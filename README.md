### Directory Structure

	bodeza/
		src/ (for all the source code)
			python/ (for python scripts)

### Yelp Data
The yelp data we're working on is too big for github. So the code for now assumes that the bodeza repo on your local machine has the same parent directory as another folder called "bodeza_data", which has a subfolder "yelp_data".

So the parent directory looks like:
	
	parent/
	  bodeza (this is the folder where your git repo is)
	  bodeza_data/
	    yelp_data/ (this is the folder with the JSON files)
