<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/3/2014,11/25/2014,20,119,4,7,6>They have the best donuts!  I have been there many times trying different kinds and they never disappoint. The staff is always very friendly. I dont usually give 5 stars but they by far have the best tasting donuts in the area...and outside the area...most times. Luckily they're not that close to where I live or else I would be much healthier looking :)  My favorite is the chocolate frosted cake donut but really I've liked all of them. Instead of making a White Castle run, make a Dimples run!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/16/2014,11/24/2014,352,448,6,10,8>Lee Donuts has a new owner and a new look. The previous owners were super friendly but the location was starting to look a little shabby. I had a chance to see the brand new owner and store when I came for the grand re-opening last month. I really like the new layout -- an old school diner theme. I especially like the later hours because know I can get donuts well into the evening hours. The only thing I didn't like was that the new owner greeted everyone who came into the store in a very friendly manner but didn't even acknowledge my boyfriend and I when we walked in. We even purchased a dozen donuts from his store and didn't hear a peep out of him or a general glance in our direction. I can't help but take it personally. Despite the fact that I didn't feel appreciated as a customer, the donuts here are still as delicious as ever. Try the blueberry or the sour cream -- two of my favorites!
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2014,11/23/2014,771,552,6,8,6>I've visited this place numerous times and you're probably asking why I haven't reviewed it  yet....well I wanted to make sure that service and sushi was consistent. Overall, it actually has been. The first time I visited was for a UYE AYCE sushi. I had no idea what to expect but between 7 of us we managed to eat A LOT of sushi. For those of you that don't know the "Yelp Lingo" yet, UYE - Unofficial Yelp Event and AYCE - All You Can Eat. Ughhh....I just became one of THOSE people, who say Lingo. lolSince the first time and to the last time I visited, it still stands, my favorite is the Lion King roll, I just can't get enough. Whatever sauce they put on top is on POINT!  My second favorite would have to be the Mango & Tuna rolls. Yummmm-O! (As Rachel Ray would say, is she still around?)I'd have to say the oddest thing I've tried at Abashiri is their shrimp boat.....sounds cool doesn't it? No, it actually doesn't. At all. lolWell, I'm not going to lie, I had to talk myself into eating this. It's a piece of open faced shrimp, topped with white rice, a quail egg and caviar. NEVER in my life would I have tried that but I've learned that in life, you should always try things at least once. So I closed my eyes, inserted the boat in my mouth and closed it. To my surprise it was SOOOOO good! I could not believe that I, Osiris V, liked that slimy quail egg caviar topped thingy. haha But the combination gave it an exquisite flavor. If you visit, you should definitely try it for your selves. Just remember, AYCE sushi is only from Monday through Thursday and it runs around $25/pp. Which is not bad at all considering if you order one plate it runs you about 12-14. So it's very worth it. Plus they have really good Japanese beers!Update: I guess they have AYCE sushi everyday except Sunday now!!! WHOA.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,11/22/2014,135,187,9,10,8>How good was it? This is the first time I've ever cleaned my plate or finished my whole meal at any restaurant. But let me start at the beginning.What brought me here was a search for shrimp and grits in the suburbs. Per James H.'s review the ones here were great. So tonight me and my husband went, snagged a seat on the patio, and dug in. The menu is small but the beer list is nice and long. I got to try the Bell's Amber Ale(reminded me of Hacker Schoer) and the Not Your Fathers Root Beer(tastes JUST like root beer but has alcohol). Both were great, but the NYFRB was more my speed and it's a new favorite.  Most of the menu is small plates. We ordered a lot of different things because everything looked so good. For appetizers we did fried pickles, grilled oysters grilled shrimp. All of these rocked the house. The grilled shrimp was huge, tender, seasoned and sauced just right.  We'd never had grilled clams, and these were fantastic. The shrimp. The grits. Wow. This was a larger plate, definitely an entree. The dish also nice sized bacon pieces and a perfect egg over easy.  My husband was was lucky to get a few bites, because I finished the whole thing. I almost ordered some to go. This dish is the perfect combo of all the delicious things I love. The pulled pork sliders were tasty. Nice pretzel buns and not over sauced. The onion rings were crispy, battered thick the way they should be.To top it off, bread pudding. Bread pudding made with...wait for it...DONUTS! And it must've had magical powers because I looked away for a second and it disappeared. Or my husband inhaled it. Each item, besides the ones we asked to be brought as entrees, was brought separately. I really feel like that gave us a chance to enjoy the flavors properly. Our server was attentive, fun, and informative. Each dish was prepared fresh and presented cleanly.  Despite their extensive beer list, don't make the mistake of dropping by Union House just for a beer.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/27/2014,11/21/2014,78,76,4,12,8>When I was younger, I used to go here all the time with my parents.  It had been YEARS since I've been there and my dad suggested it over another Italian restaurant. It was a Saturday evening at around 6pm and they were slammed! We had to wait 15 minutes.  I don't usually drive past it but when I would the parking lot would always be nearly empty, so I was shocked to see this much business.  I believe several changes had been made to the food, ambiance and restaurant and it is now back to what it used to be.  Yes, I will say, for a suburban Italian restaurant it is a little pricey! BUT, I will also say that you will not find a better vodka sauce at any suburban Italian restaurants.  Everything is made to order, so you could expect your dinner to be around 2 hours or so.  They start you off with garlic-butter rolls, delish! The baked clam appetizers were very good and our calamari was crispy and tender on the inside.  Our cocktails were strong, bonus points to the bartender.  I asked for my chicken parmagiana to come with vodka sauce and the waiter had no problem making the substitution.  The rest of our party enjoyed their meals, especially my dad and his veal dish.The service was good, but a little spotty, I couldn't tell who our server was because a couple people kept switching off.  At any rate, the service was fine and fulfilled it's purpose. It's also dinner AND entertainment: Tony Spavone sings and takes requests!My dad is a Taylor Street Italian and loves to hear his "Mob Hits" and Tony kept his favorites coming!  That's amore? Yeah.  I can't comment on much of their menu, but I do recommend the calamari appetizer and the parmigiana dishes.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,11/20/2014,452,173,11,12,11>When you need someone to have your back.. you get a brawler.It's a Sunday morning, we answer the door and a perfectly good day in May 2014 is tainted by the foul, fetid stench of the beast on my stoop... Mr. Woodbury? It asks.. "Yes",  I say."you've been served"What the...?   I had neglected to immediately inform a homeowners association of my change of address, I rectified it (acknowledged in writing in 2013 by the association) but they never made the change someplace. They raised our fees $20 a month, but because we didn't know, we happily kept autopaying monthly thinking that "all is right with the world"We were less than $300 in the hole and a phone call, letter.... email (same email since 1998) would have taken care of it.Instead, satan's spawn (just kidding, he was just a regular guy) showed up with a summons saying that they had amassed a lot of costs trying to get this money from me... just about $3,000 worth of attorney and late fees. This was the first that I'd heard about it.My regular Attorney couldn't get anywhere with them, they told him that if we go to court the costs will keep going up. Well, he's no dummy and he knows this situation makes no sense* so he tries to reason with them (he's doing this as a favor, it's not his kind of law) but they ignore him. We make an offer to settle... because I know that I owe and that there will be late fees. They tell us.. "See you in court"So I tell my friend that I think I need to get a guy that specializes in this kind of stuff.. a tough guy.. a LITIGATOR.*it actually makes perfect sense now, it appears that the association has something against landlords (I've had the same great tenant for the last 5 years) and are making things harder for us.I work with a lot of Attorneys, but most of them do family law, traffic court, real estate etc.. I saw Dave in the courtroom when I was setting up my trial date, he was representing a Plaintiff.  We talked briefly in the hallway. Dave and I scheduled an hour to go over the case in his office. We met, and he informed me that I have an excellent case and that I should consider putting a very short time limit on the settlement offer that I had made the association.. so I did, and...They ignored me.Dave became my attorney, filed our appearances for court and sent a copy to the opposing counsel.Suddenly, the other side wanted to negotiate and came back with an offer. Now I have costs, so we told them "no".We made a low ball offer back... and they said "See you in court".  We said OK.They asked what it was going to take... Dave told them...The F bombs were flying from the other side   :)They settled for far less than I had offered them the week before.I was able to pay Dave Clark and the association and still have enough money left to take the family to Gibsons for a steak dinner over what I would have paid in my previous offer (wish I had called Dave sooner)Dave thinks we would have had even more success in court, but the settlement was close enough. A trial (however short and easy) is a bunch of aggravation that I prefer to avoid.  A couple of things..When we first talked I was thinking that my case was too small for Dave, he's participated in some pretty large cases. But i never felt that way. Outside of the courtroom, Dave is a nice guy. After our meeting I was confident that I had the right Attorney. He's comfortable in his own skin, patient, competitive (The dude has run a marathon in all 50 states... seriously,  who does that?) and is able to argue facts appropriately. Hopefully, we never need him for personal injury problems, but I'm glad to have a guy that does Business and Contract Law as well as Landlord/Tenant stuff.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2014,11/19/2014,270,833,7,14,11>I was randomly in the area one evening when my Dad was in town, and we were looking for a nice place to eat. Fire + Wine had great reviews, so we decided to check it out.The atmosphere is modern, industrial, and romantic at the same time. It does get very loud (really my only complaint about the whole experience). The menu is like tapas, only more Italian based. Most of the plates are big enough to share. They also have a good drink menu. We ordered the Mussels, F + W Chop salad, The Butchers Corner Pizza, The Raisin and Sausage Pizza, and the Gelato Sampler. I could have taken a bath in the mussel broth. They bring bread so you can dip it in the broth. They even brought us more bread without us even asking! The chop salad was really fresh and light. The pizzas were great - just enough toppings, the crust was perfect, and I loved the raisins on the Raisin and Sausage pizza. I've never see anything like that anywhere else. The gelato sampler comes with 2 scoops of gelato - the vanilla bean and pistachio were great.I can't say enough good about the service! We were seated right away, our server was great, our plates were always cleared in a timely manner, everything was explained to us, the drinks were always full, and the food came out pretty quickly. He changed the silverware between each course as well. We were really, really impressed. Fire + Wine easily became one of my favorite restaurants in the burbs that night. We will definitely be back!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2014,11/18/2014,421,397,57,51,50>Dino's Cafe is the third place I've reviewed that starts with the name Dino. Like the other two places there is no Dinosaur or prehistoric theme here despite what your first thoughts might be with such a name. And fortunately this is the best of the places I've visited called Dino's as well. Since they failed to utilize the dinosaur theme with a name like Dino's, I'll make up for that by writing my review to better emphasize this.One day a friend of mine and I came in with a jurassic appetite. We couldn't quite decide where to eat and came across Dino's and figured it would be worth a try and having never previously visited it was like a lost world to us when we entered. After looking over the menu and not seeing either Fruity or Coco Pebbles, I decided to feast on something made from eggs of a descendant of the dinosaurs(a chicken). I choose a ham and mushroom skillet with pancakes. Before our main course was brought out we were offered some bread, the outside of it was as hard as the stone age and I suspect that this fossil of bread might have been sitting around for a while. Without using a thesaurus to find words to describe it, I'll say that the skillet I received was dino-mite. It had well scrambled eggs, and a good amount of ham and mushrooms. I'm glad I ordered it as I considered ordering the Denver skillet (perhaps named after Denver: the Last Dinosaur) but I don't regret my choice. The potato's were nice and crisp and it had an overall pleasing texture and taste. The pancakes were nice and fluffy and came with a maple syrup that was sweet and not dino-sour. If you're an omnivore or a om-nom-nom-nivore like I am this was an excellent choice.While a lot of places take the "It's a living" approach to service, the waitress was friendly and speedy. She refilled drinks quickly and tried very hard to pleaseosaur. My experience here was rather positive and I wasn't dino sore with my visit.  I recommend it as it's well worth giving a try(ceratops) if you're nearby and looking for breakfast.This is a five star breakfast joint that place with quality entrees like this they shouldn't be going extinct any time soon.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,11/17/2014,344,146,12,14,11>I see you checking in at all these nice restaurants to stuff your face with marvelous food.  Yeah, I'm talking to YOU!  But what about your little friend at home?!  They deserve a little surf and turf from time to time, too!Bentley's Corner Barkery, located in downtown Arlington Heights, is a locally owned and operated pet food store.  They provide natural, healthy, and organic products for your pet.  Yes, some things are probably a little more expensive than what you may be buying now, but most of it is actually not much more money and is affordable.  Plus, you can spend a couple extra bucks on your fur ball of a family member.  Lately, I've been picking up my kitty some Fromm cat food in different varieties of flavors, and let me tell you...she can't get enough!  "Meow, meow, meow", while nudging the bag, is all I hear from her.  She sure doesn't do that when I feed her Purina.  Nothing against Purina, which we still purchase, but now that she's tasted the good stuff, she has a deeper appreciation for food, like myself.  ;)  That, or she's just really hungry.At Bentley's they also have...wait for it...a bakery case filled with all kinds of treats for your pet!  If you don't have a pet, it's a good spot to snag something for a friend's feline.  They have cannoli, biscotti, sport themed cookies, cupcakes, treats with funny sayings, donuts, and more.  They even have birthday cakes!  Oh yeah, people celebrate their pet's birthdays.  Not me, but people do.The staff is always friendly and as helpful as can be.  Everyone has been informative any time I've gone in.  They have your pets information stored in their computers so it helps personalize your experience.  You can even bring your lil' guy in to shop with you if you like!Your pet wants you to shop at Bentley's Corner Barkery.  Trust me.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2014,11/16/2014,180,420,5,12,8>I give this place 5 stars cause of the location, the ambiance, the service, the atmosphere, and the food.  I have actually only been here for dinner and lunch, never to imbibe, so I can't say much for that.  But it's actually a decent place to come with kids.  They have crayons and kid cups.  How many pubs have that?  I'll tell you not a lot.They have a small kids meal menu which is good enough.The food is good.  It's not the best Irish food I've ever had, but it is pretty good.  Sometimes the food is a little salty, but that's just how it goes sometimes.  This time I had a hankering for some corned beef and cabbage.  It was pretty good.  A little different than what I usually have, but not bad.  Oh they have poutine!  It's hard to find poutine outside of Montreal/Quebec.  And usually it's not good.  But it's good here.  The gravy is tasty, the cheese is good and the fries too.  Maybe a little more gravy would be nice.It's a great place, and I'll be back.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2014,11/15/2014,131,471,5,11,11>My boy Lefai K. has a knack for knowing what I like. :)He's been wanting to take me to a particular seafood joint, but, much to our dismay, it closes at 7, so we haven't been able to work it into our schedules just yet. Thankfully he has driven by Don's Dock and suggested we try it. When we arrived we were initially overwhelmed with the choices.  Alexis was super sweet and friendly, and explained the whole menu AND specials to us. She gave us suggestions and let us know what the most popular items were. He ordered the Fish Tacos and I had the Fish and Chips. Both were reaaaally delish! I enjoyed the biscuit-type bun and the tartar sauce was a great compliment to the fish. I was really pleased with fresh fruit on the side. His salsa (both on the tacos and on the side) was a bit too sweet for my particular taste. I love that the tortillas were grilled.I also like that this is not "fast" food by any means - we waited about 10 minutes for our food, it came out piping hot, and you could tell it was made with care. Not only that, but it was both fresh AND reasonably priced.I can't wait to go back for another dinner date!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2014,11/14/2014,123,246,9,13,10>I've been craning my neck to check this place out every day as I passed by on Roselle and today is the day that they have finally opened officially. And I was the first customer!I've been faithfully praying to FSM for a Vietnamese owned Viet restaurant to come to the area and Viet House did not disappoint. There is nothing better than authenticity after patiently enduring all the Chinese diluted menus of the other pho places in the area so I'm extremely happy that Viet House has decided to join the pho competition in the Schaumburg area.Because today was their opening day, they had a limited menu (see pic) but it contained the essentials.  Spring rolls then pho is my usual menu choice whenever I go to a Viet restaurant but we were told the wings were delicious so we ordered some wings to join the party.I'd have to say that I enjoyed the spring rolls the most because they were tightly rolled with just enough noodles (I hate noodle bloated loosely rolled spring rolls) so that the delicate flavors of the shrimp and aromatic mint and herbs were not diluted by excess noodles.  I wish they offered a peanut butter based sauce instead of the typical sweet and dark clear sauce most places offer.  A small side of very freshly shredded and pickled daikon carrot helped to cleanse the palate between bites and wasn't overly sour with vinegar like most places.The wings were small but bursting with flavor all the way through.  I could tell that the wings were well marinated because I could taste the savory and slightly spicy carrot/garlic/jalepeno marinade all the way to the middle of the wings.  These wings do not have any batter, which I prefer, but they were cooked to a crisp around the edges. A great way to start the meal without worrying about filling up before the main course.The first thing I noticed about the pho is that portion sizes are relatively smaller compared to House of Pho or To Pho and is about the same size as Pho Ha.  Their broth was crystal clear indicating use of the time consuming consomme technique.  There was just enough fat floating on top to allow for the flavors of the broth to spread and linger on my tongue.  The second thing I noticed is that total meat content is relatively smaller than any of their afore mentioned competition.  I like my broth to be as aromatic as possible so that I can place my face above a steamy bowl and clearly distinguish between the nutmeg, fennel, cardamom, coriander, cinnamon, charred ginger and onion as well as all the other aromatic spices in a good broth.  Sadly, their broth lacked that complex and deep aroma that I love.Overall, I was impressed with the attentive and friendly service, the simple and clean interior, as well as the initial offerings.  It's hard to be critical on the first day of opening knowing that they are still trying to stabilize their recipes and menu.  I'll definitely be back to try it again, especially since they are within walking distance from home for me.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,11/13/2014,66,166,6,9,9>Really, this should be about a 4.75. The falafel is amazing (and gluten free...I asked, because sometimes it isn't, depending on how it's made). The large combination plate includes rice, beef and chicken shawarma, lamb kufta, a pita, a salad of your choice, tahini, and hot sauce (if you want). It's enough to feed two people, possibly even for two meals. They pack the salad separately from the hot food, so it stays cold. It's all very tasty, moist, and wonderful!The people here are super nice and friendly, too. So glad this place opened in my neighborhood (you can probably tell from my check-ins, haha)! :)
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2014,11/12/2014,149,479,8,11,11>Color me impressed.I preface this review by stating that I've pretty much written off most of the restaurants within a 10 mile radius from my house.  Why?  Well, for one, I live in Vernon Hills, which is filled with big box stores and boring chain restaurants.  Granted, there are a few local restaurants tucked into the strip malls off Route 60 and Milwaukee Avenue, but they are few and far between.Lo and behold downtown L-Ville.  This is one of the closest places you can hit up if you want to shop local.  A few independent restaurants have popped up along the downtown strip, Shakou being one of them.Now, I love, love, love sushi.  I'd eat it every.single.day if I could.  However, I prefer more of a traditional look to the place - one dominated by Japanese chefs, Japanese sushi makers and a predominantly Asian clientele (e.g. Renga-Tei in Lincolnwood).  More modern sushi joints freak me out.I've walked (and driven) past Shakou a few times and it scared me with its beautiful decor and loud, upbeat music.  I questioned whether such a hip restaurant even belonged in Libertyville where I associate relatively well-to-do families and soccer moms.  Then, I questioned whether the food would actually be good or if it was all show and no substance.And boy, oh, boy was I wrong.  Shakou - 1.  Jen - 0.I finally got over my fear and dined in at 8pm on a Tuesday evening with my parents, my bro, his girl and my fiance.  My fiance and I were the first to arrive.  The host told us he'd check on our table, and we were told a few times that it was being prepared.No worries, good sirs.  I'll just gape at your awesome decor, thank you very much.  And, gape, I did.  I mean, it just screams modern, chic and sexy.  Words can't describe how awesome it looks in there.  I saw exposed pipes, which had the speakers installed to the undersides, dark wood tables, comfy looking couches turned into booths, awesome lighting and even a fireplace along the wall by the bar area.Ok, so the decor won me over.  On to the food.My fiance and I started with the miso soup ($3) which tasted good and similar to miso we've had at other sushi joints.  No complaints there.  We sampled the spicy tuna maki ($6), spicy scallop maki ($7) and the crunch ($15), which was filled spicy crab, cucumber and avocado and topped with seared spicy tuna, eel sauce and tempura crunch.  If you're a fan of the heat, I recommend the spicy tuna and crunch.  They packed a powerful punch that had my mouth on fire (in a good way).  The spicy scallop was the least spicy of the trio and tasted great too.  The portions were a great size and perfect to share.For dessert, I sampled the pyramid (chocolate mousse  with molten caramel center; dusted with cocoa powder) and chocolate truffle (zabalone cream center surrounded by chocolate gelato and caramelized hazelnuts, topped with cocoa powder).  They were presented beautifully, tasted sweet and were a nice way to end the meal.  Seriously, don't skip out on them.  Sushi can't possibly have that many calories anyway so you can spare some on these decadent treats.Service wise, our waitress was wonderful and she was able to handle our large party well.  We also hung around to talk after my dad had settled the bill (thanks Pops!), and she checked up on us to make sure we didn't need any water.  We joked around with her telling her that she was kicking us out, which she claimed she wasn't.The only downsides were that the white chairs aren't the most comfortable for long periods of sitting. Try to claim a booth if you can!  And, the music was a tad too loud for me.  I like my eating and my dancing/clubbing separate.  But, in reality, those are very minor things compared to everything else.I enjoyed my experience at Shakou very much and definitely will be back when I'd like sushi for dine-in.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,11/11/2014,137,206,10,11,10>I love Yelp, but I REALLY love Yelp for introducing me to Hansa Coffee Roasters! Without it, I would have never known about this magical place tucked far away in Libertyville. It's right behind the tracks, next to the metra station, making it incredibly convenient for those who ride the train to and from the city. I am a big fan of coffee in general and recently started exploring random coffee shops around the city. The quality of coffee is as good if not better than any place I've tried and makes Starbucks taste like complete garbage. That says a lot because I used to drink Starbucks on a daily basis...Everything about this place is amazing - starting from the concept to the coffee itself. It's an auto shop turned coffee shop - such a brilliant idea! There's lots of space and they have open mic nights and other events during the evenings. The owner is very friendly and I love his passion and knowledge for what he does because it really shows. His focus is quality coffee, but they recently added on a couple of pastries and the cupcake was OUT OF THIS WORLD! There's no doubt in my mind that I'll be back soon... and I hear their lavender latte is incredible :)

<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2014,11/9/2014,646,300,11,15,11>When I first saw the coming soon structure of Mojo's in my hometown I was pleased to see someone finally taking over the old Kozmo's with a different theme. Then upon entering the door I read the sign "New Owners".My two cents before I talk about my meal. First and foremost this plaza is located in a dynamite location with businesses of 30 years as tenants. Take into consideration the plethora of residential condos and industrial facilities behind the plaza not to mention all the houses across the street. Plus you are located right off a major highway for easy access to visitors from other towns. Just what I mentioned in these short sentences is a strong intro formula to the best visual and word of mouth marketing.I understand Mojo's is new to the area and I do not know their background or following. I know what I ate I enjoyed in a comfortable atmosphere. Upon my inital visit I had no idea they closed early everyday roughly 2pm or 3pm. I strolled in about 2:45pm and the chairs were up so I made plans to visit again which bring me to today.I was in the mood for breakfast and the "egg on a roll" caught my eye. It is served on a baked amoroso roll which I loved! However I should have requested the bread to be toasted but now I know for next time (no harm, no foul). I also chose to have it served with sausage and the cashier informed me its a maple sausage link the size of an Italian sausage. I was like "You had me at maple brother!"....LOL!I did asked if they served any kind of potato side like a hashbrown, unfortuately they don't. The hand cut jersey shore fries were not ready at 9am so I only had the sandwich and coffee. My hopes for future visits the fries would be ready but who am I to judge they've only been open a few weeks and eventually protocol will change.From what I gather looking like a nosey rosie as I stalked their menu they are a cheesesteak and hoagie joint first. Believe me I will attack one or two of them lunch sandwiches in the near future, it ain't over yet.The restaurant's name reminds me of this scene from Austin Powers.youtube.com/watch?v=gEuw…
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2014,11/8/2014,273,603,14,16,16>Let's be honest. Katy's is the sort of place you drive up to and your husband hollers out: Heck no!  Well, maybe I toned that down a touch, but that's seriously what I heard as we pulled into the shopping center parking lot a short while ago. He asked a stranger sitting outside in front if he frequents Katy's and when he heard no, he was almost back in the car on his way home. We walked in and found a handful of tables, a lot of people slurping up noodles and some very friendly employees. I had checked out a few reviews a long time ago and added Katy's to the bookmark list.  When I knew we would be out in Westmont tonight, I knew I had to make my move. We snagged an available table and perused the menu. To my husband's delight, Katy's Dumpling House is more than just dumplings. He was immediately drawn to the noodle dishes. Side note: He thought I said we we're going to Katy's Duckling House so he was annoyed when he learned that it was actually Dumpling. Although for the life of me, I cannot figure out why he would want to eat at a Duckling House since he doesn't eat duck and if he didn't want to try dumplings, I would have been surprised that he was okay with ducklings. Do they even have duckling houses?  Quack?The pop is canned here and served at $1.50 per can. I'm still sipping on mine so it didn't go to waste. And this is a cash only joint, so come prepared. But let's talk about the food.Egg rolls. We ordered them and ate one of the two. Hubby said it was good, but not the star of the show. We've ruled that out for any future visits. Beef and scallion potstickers. Juicy!  As in right down the front of my shirt.  D'oh!  No sauce necessary. Quite tasty with a nice texture from both the meat filling and the outer dumpling. I will try this dish again and want to try some of the other fillings too!Scallion pancakes. Crispy, but a little greasy. I used to eat something similar as a kid at No. 1 Son in Elmhurst. I am still on the hunt for the replication of that dish, but they also serves their scallion pancakes with toppings which I could see trying in the future. Beef fried noodle. The rumors are true. These homemade noodles are absolutely to die for!!! That Heck No Guy I mentioned earlier was having a religious experience as he ate these noodles. The beef was cooked well, but not burnt or overly chewy. The noodles pushed the experience over the edge for us. We almost ordered more noodles to-go, but we have every intention of being back in Westmont soon. No need to over indulge on our first trip. Speaking of which, if the two of us had attempted to actually consume all of this food, we may have died. Death by bursting.  Make a note. Here's what I learned:Listen to the employee recommendations. They will not steer you wrong. Get the noodles. Just say yes to potstickers!Bring CASH!Come hungry. Don't over order. Don't judge a restaurant by its cover. And, even after all of the great things we've found due to Yelp, my husband needs to taste for himself before he's yelling: Yes, let's come back next Sunday!!!
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/28/2014,11/7/2014,1337,181,16,25,16>Le Chocolat du Bouchard is a great little cafe/chocolate shop in downtown Naperville. There are two different parts of the store. On one side, they have food cases where they sell pastries, chocolates, macarons (not macaroons, there's a difference people), tarts, cakes, whatever your little heart desires. On the other side, it's like a restaurant. A hostess will seat you and provide you with a menu where you can choose from a wide range of coffees, hot chocolates, shakes, malts, cakes, and pastries. The desserts are amazing. I wouldn't think of going anywhere else for a piece of chocolate cake, although you can expect to pay $10 at the very least for one slice. Being in the store/cafe feels like you're in Paris. They have great decor and cute little cafe-style tables. The service, however, was below average. The staff are younger. My best guess is that no one working there is over 25 years old, and they don't really understand good customer service. I've been in here multiple times where I was not acknowledged by one staff member and sometimes it has taken at least five minutes or more to be seated (given there are plenty of tables). The servers honestly think they're serving at a five start restaurant in Paris and come off pretty snooty like I'm wasting their time, or as if I don't belong there.Aside from the service, the store itself is great and you won't find desserts this good anywhere else. Just know that you gotta pay extra for 'good'. This place is not cheap.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2014,11/6/2014,2184,1339,30,45,44>Bigby's has finally come to Rolling Meadows! After months of anticipation, I'm happy to know the doors of Bigby's are open --- AND! It's the first bar in Rolling Meadows EVAAAAH! As a Rolling Meadows resident, I'm fearful I'm going to be here way more than I should but...it's just that good. I'm actually a bit hesitant writing this review because at this point I don't think many people know about this second Bigby's location and it's not too busy just yet. Stay away from my new favorite spot!!! ;) Many know the OG Bigby's in Addison as the holy grail for craft beer lovers in the 'Burbs. Not only does it have the best beer selection in all of Chicagoland but the atmosphere is so chill, they have fun board games and the people that all work there are great. Curious what the Rolling Meadows location would have in store, I stopped in last night to see how it compared to the original location. It's everything Addison is and more. At least in my mind and most of the 'and more' is probably because it's 15 minutes closer to home for me. Rolling Meadows Bigby's also seems a bit bigger to me. I don't know if it's because they are actually more tables (maybe a couple) or because 2 full walls are windows giving it a more airy & open feel. I was really happy that aside from the window walls, it still has that Bigby's decor I've come to love - wood everywhere, shelves of bottles, casual but clean beer lover's wonderland. I'm a dork because I thought one of the coolest things was the chalk in the bathroom! You best believe I made my mark.I was psyched to see Bourbon County Stout on tap! That 15% will knock you on your booty and is oh-so-delicious. I can always count on Bigby's to have new & exciting beers for me to try, as well as stocking classics some of my less adventurous friends love --- I'm looking at you Gumballhead, Dragon's Milk & Not Your Father's Root Beer. Bigby's stays on top of their updates on BeerMenus.com so if you're curious what they have on tap, take a gander. Right now, Bigby's is BYOF (Bring Your Own Food) and great news - Sushi Station is right next door! Order some carry out & bring it in to Bigby's to have with your beer. If fish blobs ain't your thang, no worries - there are TONS of food options in this area on the corner of Golf & Algonquin.In talking with the very attentive bartender last night, they have plans for food at this location eventually. That and also craft cocktails! He made sure to be clear that doesn't mean no jack n coke - no, no, the fancy shmancy concoctions though I'm sure they will still be down with the Bigby's twist. They don't have the pebble voting system yet but dude let us know that's just because they haven't gone through much liqs yet! Once they do, you will be able to place pebbles in which beers you'd like them to order. Gotta love the way they honor the wishes of their clientele.  Everything about Bigby's is friggin fantastic and I've already made plans to come back soon. When my homie CG told me about their plans to open up shop in my Rolling Meadows hood many months ago, I didn't believe it! Never could such a miraculous opening occur in my tame & tepid town. BUT ALAS! IT HAS COMETH!
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2014,11/5/2014,65,171,5,10,9>Probably the best restaurant in Wheaton. We have never had a bad meal here. Most recently we had lunch out on the beautiful patio. I had the lobster mac and cheese which was glorious. Chunks of lobster, parmesan bread crumbs, creamy joy.The decor is old school and comfortable but formal. Like an old plantation home. The view from the upper level is lovely.From the fresh bread and herb butter to the baked brie and berries appetizer everything they make is heavenly. Also recommended are the deluxe grilled cheese and blue cheese crusted pork chops. Highly recommended.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2014,11/4/2014,31,287,4,9,6>An Asian buffet with Vietnamese food? Sign me up. After my first visit to Fusion Buffet, I ended up eating seven plates of food and both my stomach and wallet approved. The place is small but the quality of food is better than most of the buffets in the Chicagoland area in this price range. For dinner, they make pho, Hong Kong style ribeye steaks, and bun thit nuong to order. I ended up making several trips because it was so good. There was also plenty spring rolls and bahn mi sandwiches. Although there are mixed reviews, I'm writing from the viewpoint of someone with a big appetite. If you're like me and love buffets but prefer value over cost, then Fusion Buffet is a definite must try.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/14/2014,11/3/2014,33,50,6,11,7>I'm teetering between a 3 or 4 star for 1913, but I decided to give them a 4 because of certain reasons.  First off, I will say this restaurant is definitely meant for couples, or very small groups of people.  There small plate are where it's at! Each one we tried was great! We got the lobster mac and cheese (phenomenal), braised pork shoulder, medallions, and meatball sliders all of which were great! But, we had 5 people with us so it was very limited with how much we could eat.  The small plates are pricy, so if you want to get your money's worth, I recommend only going with one other person.  Because there were 5 of us, we got a main dish as well which was ok, but not stellar like their small plates were.  I do not recommend the campenelle (chicken with vodka cream sauce). Plain and dry. I got the Champagne Risotto with pan seared scallops which was fairly good but not great.  Stick to the small plates.But, don't get me started with the salted caramel gelato.  A must try if you go here! It was amazing.  I was in heaven while eating it!Now, they've definitely got some service bugs to work out. This is why I would like to give them a 3 but their amazingly sweet and nice hostess makes up for that. She was awesome and made sure we were taken care of while we were waiting for our table.  Which leads me to my next complaint.  We waited for 40 min in the bar area for our table to ready.  Not a big deal with a brand new restaurant opening in pretty much a restaurant desert.  BUT, the bar area is half the size of the restaurant AND has plenty of large tables and the do not serve food at the bar.  Are you kidding me? I saw so many people walk out and go somewhere else when they were told they couldn't eat at the bar.  Figure that out and you'll get more business! And no Lynfred wine...really? I know they're sticking with the italian and french theme but you have an AMAZING winery right down the street and you're not going to utilize it. WHY?I hope they work their service out because this place has GREAT potential in this area.  The atmosphere is amazing (original hard wood floors, exposed brick)... beautiful, the food was delicious (the small plates at least)! But their service could really turn people away.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2014,11/2/2014,103,126,1,5,4>We use All for Dogs, LLC for our dog walking services while my husband and I are both at work, or while he travels! It's been about 8 months and we have had a fantastic experience with them. They are extremely accommodating, flexible, and so sweet with our dog :) Our normal dog walker, Katie, always leaves very thorough notes in our dog notebook about each visit, and it's nice that they take the time to do that, plus it's fun to read! We use "standard visits," which are 25-30 mins and cost $15, which I find very reasonable. However, you can choose to do shorter or longer appointments as well, as they do offer other services than dog-walking. The AFD website is user-friendly and you can make, adjust, and cancel appointments online. If you need a last-minute appointment within 24 hours, you can always call and leave a message, and they are prompt about getting back to you. Colleen, who I dealt with while setting up our account, was very professional and sweet. They have customer service down to a science here!As for payment, you can put a credit card on file and it deducts automatically. They may have other payment options, but this one works with us so I stick with it! Will continue to use AFD for as long as I can! Thanks!
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2014,11/1/2014,200,204,4,6,5>OMG Hamachi Kama time!!  If you've read any of my older reviews you may know that I regard hamachi kama(broiled yellowtail collar) very highly as far as sushi/izakaya restaurant apps go.  If you have not read any of my older reviews, I LOVE HAMACHI KAMA.  So...I saw it here on the menu and had to get it.  It was perfect.  It was bigger than the plate it came on.  It was bigger than any piece of hamachi kama I've ever seen personally.  And it's only $7.  The best part about it was that there were two distinct halves to the collar, the buttery softer half of the fish collar and the crispier more firm half.  This makes it the perfect collar for me and my wife since she likes the crispy half, and I prefer the butterier half.  That is so totally a word.  Having hamachi kama here makes me extremely happy.  The reason being, I am usually searching for it in the city, and Arlington Heights is mucho closer and preferable to driving to Chicago for a piece of fish.  Not that I haven't or won't do that but it's nice to know it's a short-er drive away.  I also love that Nikko closes at midnight.  A late night suburban sushi place with hamachi kama?  Man, that's like finding an intelligent woman who looks great in heels, likes fantasy football, loves watching sports most importantly hockey,football and combat sports, knows how to drive a manual car, and smells good.  Oh wait, I did that already :pThe other great thing about Nikko is that with anything you order, be it a single measly sushi roll or the giant plate of BBQ short ribs, you will receive some complimentary goodies; miso soup, a teeny taster salad, a couple pieces of a fried roll,(I just can't remember which one it is), ice cream and banchan, usually broccoli crab salad, kim chi(you might have to ask specifically for it) and some lightly pickled cukes.  If you're even more lucky, they will give you the egg bake, a deliciously light albeit very hot(temperature hot) cast iron dish full of eggy goodness along with some Korean red chili pepper and green onions.  When it comes to the table, it looks like one of those science fair volcanos made of vinegar and baking soda, sorta...But tastes much better.  Just give it a little time to cool down before you dig in.  Or at least blow on it some. We've been here more than a couple of times and so far my favorite things are the Hamachi kama., the grilled saba(mackerel), the BBQ beef plate, those cucumbers, the egg bake, the Jab Chae(noodles) and the Steve roll. The space isn't very large, but we've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes or so for seating.  The staff are very friendly, all welcoming customers as they walk in.  The service can sometimes be spotty depending on who is taking care of you, but for the most part, most of the servers are very attentive and will try to keep the waters topped and the dishes cleared as you devour you way through the menu.  So come on down to Nikko and don't burn your tongue on the egg bake!

YUM!Tiger shrimp tacos? YUM AND PREPARE TO BREATHE FIREYep...usually all in one sitting.Also be on the lookout for their Taco Time. You have to follow them in Twitter or Facebook in order to see when the next one is. Taco Time is one hour where all tacos are $1 each...trust me...that's a heavenly deal.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2014,10/30/2014,45,184,3,4,3>I ordered the special which was Chicken Parm. The bread was soft and the Chicken Parm was tasty. The sauce and cheese were on par with what I was expecting. I took advantage of the Yelp promotion which was $5 for $10 worth of grub. They also have a free cinnamon stick offer with check in. I will take advantage of that offer next time I come back. I also want to try their pizza because it looked really good when I saw it at another table that ordered it. The owner is also here 7 days a week and it's good to see young entrepreneurship at its best.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2014,10/29/2014,50,88,4,4,5>Enjoyed a mommy's night out with a girlfriend here. The food was delicious! The waitress talked up the baklava so we decided to try it out. Sadly, they ran out by the time we finished our dinner. Boo.The atmosphere is really nice and fitting with the rest of downtown Geneva. I believe there are three floors total and there was a fun crowd that night. I believe there were a couple of bacheolerettes going on. There was also a great cover band that really engaged the crowd. Will definitely go back.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/26/2014,10/28/2014,187,236,6,9,6>It was a beautiful day in Arlington Heights today and froyo was on our minds after eating dinner at a local restaurant. There were a lot of different options for froyo flavors, but I was sad to see there was no peanut butter! I instead opted for the vanilla and chocolate-flavored custard, which tasted quite good. I only wish there had been a few "normal" froyo flavors because I came for frozen yogurt, not frozen custard. There were a bunch of toppings options, but they looked a little depleted by 7 when we dropped by. I wished that there had been mochi as an option, but that's just me being picky. The blueberries I chose to add on too were fresh and not wilted at all. Delish! We chose not to dine in, but it looked like a great- cute, trendy green chairs, and plenty of seating from which to choose. I recall that the flavors change periodically, so I would most certainly return!For those interested, I saw a sign that said it was possible to host a birthday party here and it sounds like a great location! The store is close to lots of other places in downtown Arlington Heights and the space/layout of the place could house plenty of froyo-hungry kids.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,10/27/2014,180,52,6,11,12>Love love love this place! This is my go to place for breakfast and so far, has not disappointed me. Been here 3 times already, with the hubby and the rest of the family. I always make it a point to come here before 8am because it gets packed pretty quickly esp on weekends.Great food! They have ample portion sizes and unique menu items. Can't go wrong with their egg dishes and skillets-I esp love the Rutherford omelette and butcher's block skillet. They both come with hash browns and toast or pancake. I usually upgrade it to their special pancakes (only $1 more). My personal favorite is the signature berry bliss. Not a fan of tiramisu or the oreo pancakes though. Great coffee as well! If I live closer, I would definitely buy my daily coffee fix from them. Forget Starbucks.As for service, I have no complaints. Very friendly and very efficient staff. They try their best to cater to what the customer wants. Really, can't complain. Overall, definitely recommend even if you're not a breakfast person!

It was limp, it wouldn't light, it was spent, it could do no more. Curses!Now what? Lamps & Shades is what. This is a little known spot, in an unobtrusive place, where the huddled masses go after their shades are burned and dusty, their filials are bent, and their specialty light bulbs cannot be found anywhere on the planet.Yes, it will cost you but you will find what you are searching for and if they do not have it, they know how to get it. The sales staff is personable and very hands on. I found my replacement lamp for the piano; we became immediate friends.If you stop in, prepare to be amazed at the assortment of lamp shades that actually have character to them. They have lamps of all sizes; from pretty to distinguished. And because of their ultra specialization to the God of lamp fixtures, they get the ultimate rating from me, even though my checkbook would give them four. A great spot to know about!

I like the fact that even though they are extremely crowded (because their amazing) they still take their time! I hate places that short you on the massage portion and I hope they don't turn into that type if place. Never change. =))Their prices are great and are the same as any other place you would walk-in in the area. However, this place is just a better, clean, chic feeling inside. Chloe, the owner decorated the place and it is super cute inside! The manicures are perfectly polished. They pay attention to detail. I do suggest calling ahead before you come or on your way because you may have to wait. Yes...their that good!! It's worth the wait.. I promise!*Enjoy*
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/5/2014,10/24/2014,124,515,11,9,9>I can not believe good thai is hiding in a strip mall in Carol Stream. I mean seriously, when I think of good food or area restaurants, Carol Stream is really not my go-to city. Until now! This place is adorable! It's a nicely decorated, clean, cozy place nestled in a strip mall with Piggly Wiggly and Dairy Queen. I didn't even know there were PW stores in Illinois. Guess that's another Carol Stream secret. We found it by searching the app for restaurants in close proximity to Costco because it was close to 9p and we were not traveling far during severe thunderstorms for food. We pulled in the lot and walked in and it was a ghost town. A waiter appeared to be dozing off.  And here I thought I was the only person who is tranced by the sound of rain. We wondered if the food would be that bad. But we sat and ordered anyway and are glad we did! It was 8:40p so we ordered quickly. I went traditional with Chicken Pad Thai and he had a coconut dish. He asked for beef but received chicken too (chuckles). Despite the mix up, it was great. Both were flavorful, saucy and the portions were generous. Our server, Tony was personable and attentive. He checked on us often and offered information about delivery and lunch specials. We were treated like we were the only ones in the room (and we were but it still felt nice!).We will definitely circle back. Only next time, we can only hope to receive what we ordered. :-)

The Pizza del giorno was the Spinacchi (no idea if that's how it's spelled). Spinach, speck, artichoke hearts, mozzarella, Gorgonzola. Excellent! Split a Caesar salad, enjoyed the warmth of the pizza oven. Service was impeccable! I still think the pizza's too thin in the middle, but man, oh man, that crust is PERFECT when you get out to the edge.If you haven't been here in a while, it's time to check it out again.

<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2014,10/21/2014,16,94,4,6,4>Absolutely fantastic!Visited Hugo's in the casino last night with my wife and a couple of neighbors and was absolutely blown away.  Food, service, ambiance...it was all top notch!This was my first time at the casino so we actually took a leisurely tour around the place and had a drink at the center bar.  The casino is well thought out, very clean and easy to navigate.  Staff seemed relatively friendly and more than accommodating...everything just seemed a "step up" from the riverboat casinos I've been to and this was also way easier to get to.We were seated in a big comfortable booth inside Hugo's and started with a great bottle of wine that the sommelier (spelling?) suggested as well as a couple of appetizers.  The wine was velvety smooth and the appetizers (crab and calamari) were both super fresh and perfectly done.  I believe my exact response to the wine was...this wine is *!@%$#^ awesome!For dinner I had the bone-in ribeye and we split a bunch of side dishes for the table, including crawfish mac & cheese (could have been a meal in itself), hash browns, brussel sprouts (I know what you're thinking but they were phenomenal) and grilled asparagus.  Honestly, I didn't even make it to the asparagus b/c I was already loosening the belt at that point but all were excellent.  My ribeye came in a bit on the rare side for me but they took it right back and were more than accommodating in fixing the issue.   The steak was just as advertised and I gobbled up the entire thing!Almost forgot...desserts are to die for!  We had some sort of blueberry pie ice cream thing and it was divine.Hugo's is pricey but its an unbelievable place for a night out with friends that like to have a good time...this is not a quiet romantic spot to take your honey.  And if you like to hit the slots or the tables a little bit after or before dinner you couldn't ask for a better set up than the one in River's.Great job guys!
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2014,10/20/2014,29,80,5,6,5>What attracted me most about Sal's Pizza Pub, apart from my wife suggesting it, was the prevalence of four-star reviews. Does anyone give it five or three stars? Such a small variance suggests a place that hides nothing, assumes no false airs, and has so much salt-of-the-earth to it that you'd swear you were at the ocean.On a beautiful Friday, reminiscent of trips to the ocean while we lived on the east coast, my wife and infant joined me for lunch at Sal's. With our little one, late-night rollicking is a memory. Too bad; I'm a big fan of karaoke.With an option to order at the register or at our table, we went for the restaurant treatment. The number of take-out orders during our stay confirmed Sal's decision to make the offer. If a place can be trashy without being dumpy, Sal's might be it. There are many non-matching TVs around the place. The carpet looks as if many a gallon of beer has been absorbed into its fibers, yet the upholstery in the booths are not in need of duct tape. And, for some reason, the place is devoid of women during the day. For most of our meal, my wife was the only XX'er there.Oh yes, the meal. Pretty dang good, I must say. We split a buffalo chicken sandwich and a "sloppy Jose." I can't say that the chicken sandwich is that different than other sandwiches of that ilk, but the quality of the ingredients were good, as was the balance. The chicken could've been a little thicker, I suppose.The sloppy Jose was my preferred sandwich. With two types of cheese and jalapeno slices, the sandwich had a nice kick that wasn't too powerful. Even my wife, who cringes at the thought of another Manwich, liked the taco meat in its place. The bun was a bit stale, but not too much to ding the review. Ordinary fries, rings and other sides completed our meal. Nothing special, but it was nice to get two sides with each sandwich. Every town should have a place like this. Many channels on many TVs, but local station WGN got the one audio track. The server wore an untucked T-shirt and jeans, but you wouldn't expect anything else here. Sal's is exactly what you think it will be, and that's a good thing. I think I'll enjoy coming here one evening, as soon as we trust a babysitter enough.

They have better, fresher quality of food items than any other place I've ever been to.We eat out at a lot of different pub grubs so trust me when I say, they have the best tasting appetizers, sandwiches and wraps on any menu that I've tried. I'm sure their burgers and salads are amazing too; but, I don't eat those here. There are too many other items on their menu that are unique and more interesting.My favorites are the mac'n'cheese poppers and adult grilled cheese. Oh. My. Gosh. The BEST GRILLED CHEESE I've ever eaten! Maybe it's a good thing we don't come often. I'd probably develop an intolerance to cheese.If you live in the area, don't let the name fool you. They're kitchen staff is like a well oiled machine. The staff and owners will not let you down!
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,10/18/2014,68,127,1,9,6>My husband and I stopped by this past Friday night for dinner.  We were greeted by Angelo, the owner.  He was incredibly friendly and let us try a few things before we ordered.  He's the kind of guy you want opening a business in your town.  They have a "ready-to-go" bar of a good number of delicious Greek food like mousaka or pastitsio- they change daily and they're all home made (we tasted the beef - it was amazing!)  They also have a "Greek" menu and a "Chicago" menu to order from.  The Greek menu has things like souvlaki and gyros while the Chicago menu has hot dogs and italian beef.  My husband ordered a gyros sandwich and I had the char-broiled chicken on a pita - and we both had their hand-cut fries.  Both sandwiches were filled to the brim and were delicious! Something that stood out to us was that the owner checked both of our orders in front of us to make sure we got everything we ordered, the way we ordered it - nothing more annoying than getting home to find out they forgot something.We're looking forward to coming back and trying more of their delicious Greek dishes.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,10/17/2014,63,74,14,8,8>In my life there are only two things that can make me swear involuntarily while I'm doing them. You can guess the first. The second is great transcendent food.I've had the salt pork as well as the miso Ramen soup here before and both were excellent. But while eating THE spicy miso Ramen soup today, I found myself involuntarily cursing under my breath. "Fuck yeah!" and "Jesus fuck!" (apologies to tender readers, but if you don't know that I curse a lot in my reviews by now, well I guess now you know).Maybe it was because I was alone eating in a busy loud food court where no one cared or would notice my insane mumblings. Maybe it was because I'd just finished a 7 mile loop through Ned Brown Forest Preserve and was in a degree of physical pain, to which the perfect spicy umami rich broth was delivering healing endorphins.Whatever it was that soup was damn good today! The Ramen noodles were cooked perfectly tender but not too tender. The sliced pork was both meaty and ultra fatty. However, that fat had been cooked so long in that delicious broth, that it fell apart in my mouth and had essentially turned into a spicy porky gelatin.And oh, by the way, the first thing that makes me swear involuntarily while I'm doing it, is...video games like Call of Duty.Which reminds me that there are actually three things that make me swear involuntarily while I'm doing them. But that's for another review.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2014,10/16/2014,239,635,15,18,17>My first visit, of many, I hope.Yes, the beef brisket was extremely tender and juicy.  My husband had a side of beans and totally enjoyed them, I had the bacon potato salad and it was tasty.  I liked that I could try every type of sauce on my sandwich to find my favorite.  They are all on the tables.If this is your first visit, you enter kind of in the center and then proceed to the right wall and place your order.  You move down the line, kind of cafeteria style, and then check out.  Trays are very small and cannot hold food and drink orders for more than one person, but they do not give you 2 trays.Just a few things that prevent it from being a 5 star review.  I guess, depending on time of day you visit, they may be out of your meat selection.  We had a brief wait for the brisket and, as we were leaving, someone was told to return in 20 minutes for whatever they had ordered.  The warm sides need to be just that, warm.  They offer free mini ice cream cones for dessert, but beware, ALL kids, unattended, run to the machine, attempt to grab a cone, they are mostly too short to reach the top to get a cone, and then hang out at the machine eating the ice cream.  One young man nearly knocked me into next week and his father did not see the need for an "excuse me" of a "pardon me" soooooooooooooo typical.  There has to be a better system so that all customers have equal access to the machine and a clear path to get past.  Last, but not least, the ribs, which we were assured were fall off the bone, were anything but.  We bought a half slab to take home and I am several thousand years past fighting a bone for its meat.  Very tough, beware.Instead of chairs at the window counter they have saddles.  Kids love them, adults, not so much.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2014,10/15/2014,79,174,6,6,4>When I learned that my beloved Moondance Diner was closed, I was devastated. I called my favorite brunching partner (my momma) to break the news, and she took it much better than I did. "Ame... That place had gotten a little shabby.""But the food!""Food was great, but the booths had holes.""They did?""And it was dusty. And the paint was chipping. And tired."Soooo I guess I had sort of turned my head from the fact that Moondance had become kind of a dump, but alas. When I learned Citrus opened, I was pensive. What if it sucked? What if their "organic spin" on Moondance's menu was unsatisfactory? WHAT IF THEY HAD PAINTED THE TIRED PAINT AN UGLY COLOR?! Listen, I get attached.So last weekend, my mom and I ventured in to try it. The place was so fresh, clean, and inviting! Bright white walls with a predictably citrus colored theme of bright orange, yellow, etc. Much of the staff have remained the same, and thank goodness - because they're great. A quick peek at the menu revealed that nothing awesome had changed - all that delicious food was the same. They've added a few fun things - like organic coffee, that I didn't try but will next time, and a fresh-squeezing orange juice machine, which I didn't try because I'm 30 now and everything delicious and wonderful gives me heartburn. Ah, to get old.I got my old MD favorite - the calypso omelet, breakfast potatoes with cheese, and an English muffin. Food was fresh, fast, and delish. Still chock full of fresh avocado slices, covered in enticing melty cheese, and completely delicious. My mom got the calypso as well and was completely happy with her order. Husband got the bacon waffle and thought it was dry, but the man refuses to use syrup and is also extraordinarily crabby before noon, so I'm chalking that up to his preference, not their quality.The new owner (I think, she was hostessing and running around and being generally bubbly and in-charge-y) was lovely, effervescent, and polite to everyone. All in all, Citrus has stripped away the tired aura that Moondance Diner had lingering about it, without removing all the things that had made it a Hinsdale area staple for so long. Can't wait to go back and enjoy my old favorites in a new atmosphere.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,10/14/2014,17,96,3,5,7>It's right near the Illinois Prairie path! perfect location to stop by while walking your dog. Super cute store! Philosophy is so simple and it totally makes sense--no corn, wheat, soy or fillers.  We bought some yummy treats for our neighbor's dog.  Baked goods that look so pretty...a great idea for dog's birthday!  Of course it is not just for pet special occasions ...  every day dog food is priced competitively!  Refrigerated section carries a wide selection.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,10/13/2014,11,205,8,6,6>(Disclaimer: this review is by a white, middle-aged mom with little-to-no experience with Japanese food. Look elsewhere to read all the (largely 5-star) reviews about the quality of the produce, authenticity of the food court, etc. This one is strictly a dilettante's POV.)I have a catbus-sized grin thinking about my inaugural visit here. This place has been on my radar for a while, but I'd never gone. Made an afternoon of it a few weekends ago, and had the -best- time.Clearly, a very different cuisine employs very different ingredients, the discovery of which is great fun. A full-case display of octopus tentacles is not something you'll see in your local Jewel. New kinds and flavors of snacks, desserts, tea... and the cost of trying something 100% unfamiliar is just the price of a bag of (seaweed-flavored) chips: big adventure, small tab. Plus, Japanese packaging is just far superior in every way, and of this, I am a *big* fan. Favorites I came home with included itty-bitty little chocolate-filled cookies for the kids and yuzu-flavored jellies, unusually nice toothpicks (I know, I'm a dork), and Pocky (duh). Oh, and Hello Kitty "soda" (ingredients: water, high fructose corn syrup, citric acid. The end.) The green tea ice cream from Re-leaf in the food court was also fantastic, but not bring-home-able. And the apple pastry from Pastry House Hippo didn't technically make it all the way home.There's a fabulous bookstore in the building, too. I have an origami nut in my family. I know where her next birthday present is coming from.Parting advice to other foreigners like me: consider visiting on a weekday when it's not so busy, and for the sake of politeness, stay out of the way of anyone doing their "real" shopping here.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/2/2014,10/12/2014,14,102,4,4,4>I came in the other night with a buddy to grab some grub & watch some of the Blackhawks game.  The reviews of this place made me curious to stop in since I've driven by so many times but didn't really notice Danny's was there.  We sat at the bar & had great service.  After we ordered, the bartender brought out a nice warm loaf of sliced bread to munch on while we waited & it was fantastic.  We went with a 16" sausage pie & it was really good.  The sausage had a good flavor & seemed lighter than most sausage pizza's I've had.  The thin crust reminded me of Lou's, but the taste & overall execution was better.  We had the chocolate chip cookie dessert also which came in a small circular tin, I thought the cookie would take up the entire bottom of the tin but there was more ice cream & whipped cream in there than cookie which was the only minor disappointment of my visit.  This is a nice, quiet little spot with good service & tasty pizza, definitely worth stopping in!
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,10/11/2014,49,309,3,7,5>Well, that was fun.We went today to celebrate our friend's birthday as a group of 7. I called ahead when making the reservation online to get a promo code because it was our first time at the place. We saved $5 each. It's BYOB/BYOW, so we planned accordingly. Glasses are there for you and all the rest of your necessities are there. They even had plates and utensils. We brought the snacks as well and there are special tables to get up and eat/mingle during drying times, etc.The teaching artist was great, too. She was helpful and chill and we were cool with that. Definitely a fun activity for girlfriends to chitchat, especially in a small group like ours. I would do it again for sure!
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2014,10/10/2014,53,47,11,12,11>Stacie Cakes cupcakes are decorated beautifully.  The cupcakes sit pretty on silver pedestals in a glass case with chalkboard signs listing the flavor varieties available that day.  My favorite is the Salted Caramel cupcake - It is a moist chocolate cake piled high with melt-in-your mouth buttery caramel icing drizzled with caramel.  Get ready for a blissful sugar high!ENVIRONMENT:The environment is stylish with plenty of tables to sit and relax.  There is a hallway that runs along the kitchen wall with windows that let you peak in on the action. (Cool!) The day I visited they were making giant chocolate dipped marshmallows on a stick. (Drool!!!)CUPCAKE VARIETIES:I was a little disappointed to see that almost all the cupcakes had chocolate bases.  There was only one vanilla cupcake base (with plain vanilla frosting) and one carrot cake.  The rest were chocolate cupcakes with many different icings, thus equalling a new variety.   Some of the icings (i.e. peppermint patty, peanut butter) were tasty but grainy. CUSTOMER SERVICE:This was my first visit to the store with my sister, who is a regular. Our server was neutrally pleasant, so I have no complaints.  My sister mentioned we were lucky to get the lady and that was the best service she ever received there.  (Huh?!)  She says that there is usually a high school girl who acts way too sour to be selling sweets. (Ah teenage angst - maybe you should eat a cupcake!)
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2014,10/9/2014,144,165,6,8,8>As a famous writer puts it, the 'burbs are a lot cooler than they get credit for. Well, the numerous forest preserves are the coolest thing about the 'burbs, if you ask me.Mallard Lake Preserve is simply beautiful. In the summer months, we usually come here close to sunset time. Recently we spotted two deer (or the same deer twice) on two evenings less than a week apart. Keep your eyes peeled when driving (or biking) on the long driveway between the Schick Road entrance and the parking lot. One of the deer seemed to have an affinity for rock & roll music, just fyi.The gravel trail that loops around the lake is relatively short with a couple of cool bridges over the lake. The gravel path leading away from the loop will take you past a short bridge over a creek and eventually get you to a playground in Heritage Park. The gravel path along the creek will take you to a wooded trail through a less-travelled tiny peninsula. The only downside of this preserve is the noise from a seemingly constant stream of low flying jets to and from O'Hare 25 miles away.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2014,10/8/2014,34,30,9,6,7>Ok so I almost drove off the bridge in downtown Aurora as I was breaking my neck to make sure what I had just seen wasn't a mirage..... What?! Taco Grill and Salsa bar this close to my home? Is this real life??!!Anyway on to the Carne Asada burrito. Omfg. Soooo good! Al Pastor tacos? Soooo good!... Next on my list is to try the guacamole... You see this is not my first run in with the ole Taco Bar. They have a location in Westmont that I would on occasion drive 20 minutes in the wrong direction to just because I had to have this ginormous burrito filled with real steak. I'd say Los burritos gives them a run for the money but I'd still venture to say Taco Bar may not only be the best burrito in Aurora, which is a task in of itself, but maybe the best Suburban Burrito in the Chi Town Burbs. It will run you about $9 for the grande big daddy mack burrito, but it is so worth it! They aren't kidding about the word grande, I mean this thing is serious. After I was full it was still the length of my forearm from wrist to elbow, not easy to get a selfie of that, I tried. Lol.Last but not least is the Salsa bar. You'll see by my photos I'm a sissy when it comes to xxxhot salsa, but they have like 20 of them, careful. You just dish out your own. It's pretty cool.The people are awesome too! The girl at the front was so cute and fun, I think she could tell how excited I was and thought "Why is this weirdo asking me like 1000 questions?". Hahaha. The owner also came out and asked if everything was good to the couple of tables that were filled. Oh btw, pretty decent amount of seating. Which you wouldn't guess from the storefront. Just give it a shot, if you're disappointed I'll buy you a burrito from anywhere you choose, that's how much i like this place!
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,10/7/2014,31,16,2,9,6>I stopped by during Cali Girl's Grand Opening weekend and I was very impressed. This was less than a week ago and since then I've been trying daily to convince myself that bi-weekly visits to the pastry shop are not a healthy idea. The shop decor is lovely and inviting and the staff is very helpful.  They have completely nailed both atmosphere and service right out of the box.  As excellent as Cali Girl is at these two important things, the absolute most compelling reason why I'm going to be a regular patron at Cali Girl is their fantastic baked goods.  I bought a variety of treats and there was not one that wasn't excellent.The chocolate croissant was buttery, flaky and had a really nice amount of high quality chocolate.  The cookie topped with chocolate buttons and mini pretzels was my husband's favorite with crispy edges, beautifully gooey in the center, and with the perfect amount of salt to keep things interesting.  We also got two different bar cookies. One was a frosted brownie with a thick, fudgy layer of delicious frosting covering a dense, chewy brownie.  The other was a millionaire's shortbread with a pecan shortbread base, topped with a soft, handmade caramel and a layer of dark chocolate ganache.We also got four cupcakes, the names of which are escaping me, but I remember the flavors very well.  The first was a red velvet frosted with a silky cream cheese and a gold-dusted star. The second was a cream-filled dark chocolate topped with a satiny chocolate ganache.  The third was a fresh strawberry decorated with a molded white chocolate strawberry.  The fourth (my favorite) was a fresh blueberry with a lemon buttercream decorated with a handpainted chocolate surfboard.Everything they serve is so well thought out and flawlessly executed with meticulous attention to detail.  It's clear that they use only the freshest, best ingredients and their prices are quite reasonable.  They also make beautiful cakes of all sizes and shapes that I'm looking forward to ordering at some future date.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/16/2014,10/6/2014,78,342,2,7,5>I am a sucker for a good bakery, and this one came highly recommended.  I came here with a co-worker when we were in the same area and wanted to grab a quick bite.  This place doesn't look like much from the outside, and even when you initially walk in I wondered how this was going to be.  I saw a lot of older people, not really much in the way of decor - I was thinking that this was going to be a senior special kind of place.  However, our friendly waitress sat us by a window that had a great view of the river.  I was happy to see that they had both daily specials as well as a list of monthly specials to choose from.  I went with a Ruben sandwich.  The food was pretty good and I'd come here again to eat.  Being a fantastic bakery, we had to order a couple of things for dessert.  We went with a french lace cookie and a strawberry and cheese pastry.  Both were fantastic and I'd come back here for those baked goods again and again.  Waitress was very friendly, made good suggestions and service was quick.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2014,10/5/2014,61,251,1,5,7>Yummy! I just came here for a girlfriends birthday lunch. Quick service and good food!  I ordered a one egg scrambled (had to pay $1 extra for cheese..) that came with pancakes and hash browns for $4.99 (plus my $1)...not to shabby! McDonalds is probably right around that price as well!  My girlfriend ordered a made to order omelet which she enjoyed as well!Good service! Our waitress was friendly and on point.  I came in with my daughter and the manager/owner came up to me and said I could leave my stroller up front if I wanted to and they would bring it to me when I was ready to leave!  Staff members are friendly and were all coming up to my baby girl to show some love :) Definitely am putting this place on our list of breakfast food places!
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2014,10/4/2014,72,386,2,4,3>Quick, efficient, and economical. What more could you ask for at a car wash? This isn't Platinum car wash but you know what, it's darn near close and the price is more attractive if you ask me. Typically you can get a deal on the pricier washes so don't be afraid to ask what the deals of the day are here. The staff is helpful and attentive and knows their product and what will be best for your car. It's usually pretty full but they pound cars out like nobody's business so you usually can be through the wash in under 10 minutes and then shimmy over to vacuum out your interior which might I add is no charge with a car wash. Why not take advantage of that while you're there?
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,10/3/2014,129,200,8,6,8>"franks & beans, franks & beans!"-Warren (There's Something About Mary)Portillo's has plenty of franks, and even a few beans, in the form of their chili cheese dog.  It's a Chicago specialty, just as In-N-Out Burger is a California/West coast gig, and Skyline a Cincinnati-deal.  Usually partnered with a Barnelli's Pasta + Sandwiches, any Portillo's in the greater metro area will ALWAYS have a stack of cars in the drive-thru, doesn't matter what time of day.  It can be 10:30-11am, people are lining up for an Italian beef or double Chi-style red hot.  Crazy people are crazy.The crinkle-cut fries are excellent, nice and salty.  The 'dogs are priced reasonably, and like many have already commented, the chocolate cake is to-die-for.  Most locations have a beer and wine station (although I didn't notice if this one did).  I was leaning towards a solid 4-star, but as I sat and devoured my red hot with extra sport peppers, I heard something that gives Portillo's that extra boost.When your order is called, instead of simply saying "number one-twenty-five" or shouting your name, as many Mcdonalds do nowadays, the designated announcer has a catchy rhyme that goes with your order number.  Per example: "order #127, welcome to hot dog heaven", "order #129, your lunch looks devine", or my personal favorite "order #126, come gitcho' Portillo's fix!"  Every time a customer picked up their food, they were smiling, a few even laughing.  I couldn't help but smile and laugh too; something so small having an equally-pleasant impact on dozens of people during their lunch hour.  Hell, it made my day.  Now THAT'S certainly worthy of an extra star.

Not as good as naan.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/4/2013,10/1/2014,255,326,7,14,13>Watching two silent films with live organ accompaniment at the Des Plaines Theatre was the highlight of my summer. There is nothing quite like seeing and hearing a movie from that era as its filmmakers intended, in a building constructed specifically for the purpose. Visitors will discover that there's something special about standing in the glow of an art deco marquee as the sun sets on a clear night, though the theater as a whole exemplifies vintage charm, both inside and out. In addition to movies, you can catch live music here or even rent it for an event (recently it has hosted a spelling bee and a birthday party). Unlike a chain multiplex, the Des Plaines Theater is in many ways a partner in its community. This week, for example, they're showing a free Christmas movie for families following the Des Plaines tree-lighting ceremony. Check the calendar on the web site to see the latest goings-on and events.Parking is free and easy, with both a parking garage and options for street parking just steps from the door. You can also find the Metra right across the street, as well as bike racks.

The buffet was really good. Nothing grew too old up there because there was a good crowed there for brunch and all of the dishes (there was quite a good variety) kept turning over at a good pace.You don't want brunch you say? You don;t have to get it. This restaurant allows you to order off of your menu while brunch is going on I had brunch buffet while many people in our part ordered lighter off of the menu. They all seemed to enjoy what they ordered.Our server was very helpful and friendly and very patient and attentive to our lrge group.I am sold.

<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,9/25/2014,36,135,4,7,6>Baseball and summer are synonymous in my life and since I live out in The Kane, the Cougars fill that need for me.First off, there isn't a bad seat in the house.  Even if you sit in the grass you can have a good and comfortable time.  Ticket prices are still decent and if you scout out Living Social in early spring they run an offer of 10 tickets for $50..a deal you just can't beat. The schedule itself is very flexible with day, early evening and weekend games.  We like the evening games because they start a tad earlier at 6:30, getting you out a little earlier.  Some weekdays like Thirsty Thursdays offer $1 beers, others offer $1 hot dogs/sodas.  We often go as a family but I also like taking my son over who's six yrs old and just learning the game.   Every seat in the house puts you right on top of the field..it's pretty intimate.  I also like the fact that my son gets a close-up view so he can learn more about the game.This is minor league baseball so every half inning offers a different on-field gimmick.  Most are amusing and keep the crowd involved.  The Cougars are also good about scheduling various theme nights and guest appearances. Check their schedule for the various things they offer.Aside from the game there's a couple of traditions that we really enjoy: the post game fireworks and running the bases.   Their fireworks are better than some townships 4th fireworks, and running the bases is a unique way to get on the field and run one out with your son.Being that I'm a Cub fan it's additionally cool that the franchise is now part of the Cubs organization.  It will be nicer to see some players get to the show.  The only complaint I can think of is the $5 parking fee.  Parking was free here for over 20 years until some fool found another way to screw families out of money.  All in all, if you like baseball you just cannot go wrong here.  Cougars games are good for any age.Cheers!
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,9/24/2014,104,234,4,7,7>This place loves their coffee! And so do I! You can tell from how passionate the staff explains their coffee and the whole brewing process. This place has a nice small business vibe and I love it. They have these cool looking sciencey experiment lookin' beakers with long tubes that drip out the coffee veeeeery slowly. There's a brew there that literally takes 24-hours to brew! You can check out the setup here: coffeeplanetinc.com/coff... but its almost like a science experiment ending in coffee deliciousness. I ended up having the peanut butter latte and it was awesome. As of the time of this writing, Yelp check-ins give you a $1 off!BATHROOM REVIEW: Bathroom is a single stall setup and consists of a toilet and sink. Super clean and modern tiling and decor. Sit or squat? Sit!
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/19/2014,9/23/2014,64,130,2,9,8>You can't beat the Chicago area for having such diverse food. Tommy's is a semi-fast food type restaurant with quick but interesting food. The Gyros are delicious but they also have a wide variety of other food to choose from like burgers, ribs, and dogs. What is a plus is that their prices are the same if not slightly lower than chains like Burger King and McDonald but the quality is much better. The only drawback to this location is the interior does not make for the best in restaurant dining. Do not waste your money on fast food chains if you live in this area.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2014,9/22/2014,56,185,4,7,4>Let's go quick and efficient:- Gizzards with plantains: Best dish of the night. The sauce consists of red peppers and tomatoes and they shine in this dish. The slightly sweet taste goes perfectly with the not-so-chewy gizzard.- Jollof Rice: Great flavor. Not sure what the flavor is, but my taste buds loved it. The fish that came with it was slightly underseasoned but was perfect when eaten with the rice. The goat was perfect and fell off the bone.- Fried Rice: Not sure where the liver was but it wasn't a bad dish. It could have used a little bit more flavor as it paled in comparison to the Jollof Rice dish. The chicken was a little dry.But the best part of the experience was talking to the owner. He explained what went into the sauces and answered any questions we had. We ended up staying later than any other customer but he didn't hurry us at all. And when we finally did leave, he wasn't around but he made the effort to come outside to tell us good-bye.Great experience, although, their interior decor could use some work. For those that judge a book by the cover, Bisi might not interest them. But for those willing to see what's inside, you'll find a Nigerian gem in the burbs.P.S. This place is super cheap. Dinner is 10 bucks for a ton of food.
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2014,9/21/2014,65,785,2,7,7>This was indeed a nice stop for a brat lunch.  I hadn't been back here in years when it was first a neighborhood gem of a grocery, then a sausage shop, and now since Jan 2013, a sausage shop serving lunch.   Colleagues and I came in for a weekday lunch and beat the crowd by showing up at about 11:45am, and a surprisingly long line did subsequently form on this day.  I had their brat lunch deal for $6.88 - their original brat with in my case sauerkraut and mustard, and with chips and a soda can.  It's also a nice quiet place to have a good lunch conversation while enjoying a fresh tasting home made brat.  I also bought for take-home a pound ($5.99/lb) of their enticing turkey-cranberry-orange brats, amongst various brat selections in their freezer (haven't tried yet but looking forward to it).  Will be back again I think.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2014,9/20/2014,98,221,3,5,6>When I was beginning to look for a photographer for my wedding at the end of this year, one of my bridesmaids recommended I check out Kirstin/ LaRoche Photos.  My friend had been using Kirstin for her daughter's baby pictures and had nothing but awesome things to say. After browsing her website and Facebook page, I loved the style of her wedding photos and for in touch with her.Her response time is awesome - it was never more than a couple days before I would get a response. Her pricing is more than reasonable as well (Seriously, compared to the other photographers I looked into, she's a steal!) Last week we had an engagement photo session with her, and we had an absolute blast. She's so nice and fun. She had great ideas for locations. She brought a few fun props with her and had great ideas for poses that didn't feel cheesy.  We're silly people, and I felt like she got that about us. She didn't seem too take her self too seriously either. (I mean this in s good way! She was certainly professional!) She was snapping photos of us goofing around along with the posed photos. I haven't received the photos back yet, but the teasers she's posted on her Facebook page look amazing! I was hesitant to book her without researching a dozen other photogs first (after all these will be like the most important photos ever, right?!?), but now I am so glad I did! I cannot wait!!
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/6/2014,9/19/2014,113,67,3,4,5>I still have taco breath as I'm writing this review. That's just how powerful my three fish tacos were even after 3.5 hours of eating them.The restaurant is pretty spacious and has multiple dining area sections. If you sit at the bar during happy hour of 3:00 - 6:00 p.m. on the weekdays, you can order various menu items for $3.79 each with a beverage purchase. My friends and I just sat at a regular dining table that was located by a fireplace.I ordered the Grilled Fish Tacos while my friends ordered the Steak Tacos and Low-Calorie Turkey Burger. The fish tacos were tasty with the red salsa. They didn't have the green salsa unfortunately, which I normally use on tacos. My tacos came with a side of beans and rice. I hate refried beans, so I was happy to see regular black beans arrive on my plate. I sampled my friend's turkey burger, which was flavorful and juicy.REMEMBER TO SIGN UP FOR THEIR E-CLUB ON THE WEBSITE TO GET $10 ANY PURCHASE (excludes the $3.79 specials)!! It made my fish tacos ($9.99) essentially free!Food was great, but it didn't beat my steak taco love affair at Chavas Tacos in Elmwood Park, IL.Overall, I recommend going to this restaurant.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/18/2013,9/18/2014,83,164,3,5,4>Eating here was like stepping back into the 70`s...a little outdated decor, good lively people and very simple, yet good, homemade food.Our first visit here and we were treated like family.Very crowded, and being a last minute decision...didn't think to make reservations. Was a little nervous when the hostest asked us about any..thought we'd wait at least a good half hour.5 minutes later, room was made at a nice comfy table in the back for us and we were enjoying the fantastic smells of people digging in around us.The waitress had her hands full with several tables, had a short wait for wait for drinks...which although it was to be expected..gave us our first round of drinks on the house for the inconvenience. Was surprised! Didn't complain! Was a very nice gesture.Reading all the reviews here on Yelp, knew we were trying the french onion soup. Most definitely.My hubby ordered their prime rib special and I went with good old fashioned liver and onions...bacon too! Oh my! Haven't had great liver like that since my grandmother made it for me as a kid. Fantastic! Could convert even the most pickiest into a fan. Huge crispy strips of bacon, nicely grilled onions and the liver was soft and moist. No rubbery foreign substance! Perfection! Let's not forget about my husband's prime rib. Minimal, yet just enough fat to keep things tender and tasty. This was perfectly medium rare...melt in your mouth goodness!! French onion was great.Service and food served in a fast and friendly atmosphere. Our waitress was awesome! Very much loved our experience here! Prices very reasonable...very generous portions...can't go wrong!!
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2014,9/17/2014,101,611,12,12,13>If I was a single chick, I'd be here every day. This place is a sausage fest and I'd definitely have my pick of any type of man I wanted -- from the burly lumberjacks to skinny hipsters to just the average working man, I think any woman could find her potential mate here.I came to Solemn Oath a few weeks ago on a Friday afternoon with my husband and Angela P to try out their beer and also finally try some Toasty Cheese. Solemn Oath doesn't have food, so if you're the type that likes your beer with food, make sure to come on a day where a food truck will be on the premises. I tried the Oubliette and found it delicious. It's a light beer and right up my ally. The seats are very hard to come by so if you plan on coming in on a Friday night, I'd recommend leaving work early to beat the rush and snag a seat. Just tell your boss I said you had to leave and that should work as a valid excuse. (I am also willing to type this up and print it out for you because I am that selfless of an individual.) The bartenders were pretty cool too, even though they were slammed. It was a fantastic experience, just wish the place was a little bit bigger.
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,9/16/2014,191,452,2,5,4>$14 for men's haircut. $16 for women's. Classic barbershop complete with the barbershop pole & no nonsense atmosphere. My husband's been coming here since he was 12 years old. He doesn't say a word. He sits down and Joe just knows. Plenty of magazines & a small flat screen to keep you busy while you wait. Closed Sundays and Mondays.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2014,9/15/2014,168,718,5,8,8>Yup, this place is awesome.  KEEP IN MIND: I have only done take-out and delivery (YES, they do delivery now!!)I have ordered from them 4 or 5 times recently, and every time is REALLY great.  Probably better than the last.  The spider roll and the lasagna roll are great--yes I know that sounds strange but trust me, it's a must-get.OH, and their fried rice is by FAR the best I've ever had :)The only thing that I was somewhat put off by is the fact that we only sometimes get the salad that's supposed to come with the meal.  There's no rhyme or reason about why we DO and DON'T get it at certain times.  But I love me some salad, so that's not something I could overlook!
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,9/14/2014,48,231,1,6,5>I bought my first road bike here 3 years ago.  They are a great local bike shop.  I usually go to another location for service, but when I stop in here they are always quick and friendly. I recently stopped by to check out some triathlon bikes.  The employee helping me out was great.  He let me ride a few bikes and gave me some advice on buying and things to look for.  He was very knowledgeable about the bikes and answered all my questions.  He wasn't pushy at all.  He suggested I check out their other locations and ride a few bikes there so I could get a feel for the differences in the fit and feel of the bikes.  He also mentioned they were having their annual tent sale in a week and if I wanted to get a bike that would be the best time.  I did end up buying a bike at the sale and I am happy to continue to be a customer of Village CycleSport. They have a great maintenance policy and are always helpful.I see Village Cyclesport at a lot of local cycling events providing basic maintenance or volunteering and I like that they are very involved in their local cycling community.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2014,9/13/2014,63,113,3,7,5>Lots of good beer and food at Tap House. Beer menu is fairly extensive with an emphasis on craft beers. Each month features a different brewery, which opens up even more drink options. I wish the beer menu wasn't just a couple of 8.5 x 11 sheets of paper stapled together though. Does that take away from my experience? Absolutely not but but why not have an appearance similar to the food menu? Speaking of food, I have not been disappointed with anything on it yet. Try the exotic chicken wings. Really good flavor with a touch of spice. Wings overall are nice and meaty without an abundance of heavy breading. Burgers are pretty solid and they even offer a burger eating challenge! Finish ~2.5 lbs of burger and fries (combined) and you get an exclusive reward t-shirt... and bragging rights of course. Prices are reasonable for almost everything. It's a craft beer place so expect some beers to be a bit higher. Besides food, they have occasional beer events throughout the year. Some of these include tastings, educational sessions, and more.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/21/2014,9/12/2014,212,227,5,9,6>What a cute shop for the tea and/or yarn lover! I decided to check it out one day when I found that they carry a flavor of Republic of Tea that I had been looking for. The shop is tucked away and was a bit hard to find, but I'm glad I did.I'm new to tea, so it was almost overwhelming walking in. There's SO. MUCH. TEA. My friend and I spent a good 20 minutes walking around and looking at all the tea. Since I was overwhelmed, all I bought was the tin I originally came in for. We were left alone and had to call for someone to check us out. They seemed to be too busy talking in the back room. The woman who rang up my order wrapped my tea up so nicely! She didn't have to but it was a nice touch.I'm not a knitter but I would definitely come here if I ever want to learn how.EDITThey sell expired tea. Today (August 29, 3014) I just pulled out the tea I had bought four months ago and checked the "best by" date. It's May 2013. Not cool!
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2014,9/11/2014,73,152,5,8,6>I'm always on these temporary "healthy" diets but I did not want to cook anything on a Saturday night. So, my parents suggested a sushi joint owned by some Japanese folks. When was the last time you met somebody from Japan? Not some Asian fellow who probably is Chinese or Koreanese, but a real Japanesian. After experiencing their food, I'd say this is the most authentic Japanese food I have yet  to have in the Chicago burbs. Maybe I am jaded cuz I think the owners are Japanese. Nonetheless, the food tastes FAF (fresh as frick).The food here is 5-stars, but you have to pay a hefty price for it. There are a lot of pricey sushi places out there that cost a lot and have great presentation, but their sashimi tastes and feels limp and not fresh. This place has some FFrF (fricken fine raw fish). It took a long time to get our food. My party arrived fairly early in the night so we did not have to wait for seating (can't make reservations for groups under a party of SIX btw..), but there were customers arriving later who had a long wait. Watching the waitresses running frantically around stressed me out. There might have only been two people on the wait staff that night handling the entire restaurant. The longest wait was for the first dish to come out. After the first dish came out, the long wait in between dishes didn't bother me as much since I wasn't salivating every time the waitress passed me with an order fresh out of the oven.TLDR: Service can be better but their sushi is fresh and delicious
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2014,9/10/2014,9,105,4,5,7>My Dad's laptop was full of viruses and he gave me the task of finding a place to get it fixed.  I contacted Triple Check Techs after seeing all the positive reviews.   I left a voicemail and got a call back from Greg and explained the laptop issues to him.   He then offered the option of me either bringing the computer over to their shop or having Tim come over and pick it up from my location.     I decided to opt for Tim to pick up.   We set a time and Tim came by to pick up the laptop.    This happened on Thursday afternoon.He was very courteous and before leaving took the time to look at the laptop to see what was going on.   He mentioned the possibility of the CMOS battery needing to be changed due to date/time being inaccurate.So he took the laptop and I got a call later that evening to go over the programs on the laptop and whether I used them or not.    By Saturday morning I got a call from Greg stating the laptop was ready and scheduled a time for Tim to return it.   Tim came by with the laptop and mentioned the laptop had 33 viruses and over 2000 traces that were removed.    The price of $129 was reasonable I thought.   Tim had forgotten the power plug and made a separate trip later on to return that.I'm very satisfied with their level of service and would definitely use them again.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/14/2014,9/9/2014,73,90,4,12,8>As good as it gets because of all the heart that goes into the food. By heart i mean hearty food. beef stroganoff. meatloaf filled with ginger zest. shrimp bisque. cheesy pulled pork fries. this was an epic first visit!surprisingly they have one of the best beer selections around that rivals most liquor stores. You wouldn't suspect this coffee shop looking place to have excellent draft beer and a full page of hand selected craft beers. We're talking some of the best beers from across the nation including local (litterally down the street) brewed beer. its comforting its home towns. something you would find in Portland. To top it off they offer build your own 6 packs to go. i can picture this being a real life savor in the summer during festival season, picnics, or to seal the deal on date night.We also had the Bluebery bar which paired perfectly with a saison. This is a hidden gem adored by locals.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2014,9/8/2014,41,83,4,6,5>This place is so kitschy! WHICH I LOVE! I'm a fan of anything themed. This place has a medieval feel to it. They offer complimentary bowl(s) of popcorn. The first time they asked if we would like a bowl, the second time we didn't receive a bowl nor did we ask for one (no biggie). So I'm not quite sure if you need to request one...?But anyways... Try the Cajun Burger. So so good. This is probably the only time in my life that I didn't smother my burger in ketchup. The seasoning and pepper jack cheese added enough flavor that I didn't add any condiments. Major plus, it didn't taste the least bit dry.Decent steak fries. Fries are my secret obsession. Personally, I prefer thinner crispy fries, but I will eat just about any kind.The baked French onion soup is another must-try.Went there on a Saturday night and they had a guy playing guitar and singing. Wasn't half bad, either! Definitely a cool place to grab dinner.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/10/2014,9/7/2014,160,654,5,9,8>Don't mistake the Choo Choo Restaurant as a kids place only. Yes, it has kid appeal with a little train car seat and the model train track that circles the dining counter, bringing food to customers. They got serious food that appeals to both kids and adults. First off, their burgers are great. They are pressed thin, grilled crisp around the edges, and a rich meaty flavor you'd expect from Smashburger or Meatheads. Want bacon or other toppings? You can request them and customize it to your liking. Not in the mood for burgers? Try their turkey chili. I never thought turkey chili, which is usually more bland than beef chili, could taste so good.Fries are plentiful, which is a good thing with my younger son. And if that's not enough, try their apple pie. It's a huge slice with a small scoop of ice cream. Sugar sprinkled on top gives it the home-made touch and in the words of my 10 year old, it was "the best apple pie ever."And did I mention hey have ice cream sundaes and cupcakes too? Check it out. Got no kids? Come for the food. By the way, it is best to come early (11 AM) or closer to 1 PM and beat the crowds that can line up past the door. If you got kids, be sure to sign them up for their birthday meal with the Choo Choo during your visit.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2014,9/6/2014,165,146,4,5,5>I've been working out here for a few months and I've definitely seen an improvement in my performance. Now if only I can pay someone to follow me around and slap food out of my hand.....It's pretty small and classes can get packed but it's broken up to help alleviate some of the crowding. The workouts keep you moving and don't allow for boredom which I love. You can challenge yourself with each move or modify depending on fitness level.The trainers are extremely helpful and friendly as well as the staff at the desk. After a few sessions, everyone knows your name. That kind of atmosphere is what keeps me wanting to stay. But the part that wants to leave is the money. For personal training, this is probably cheap but it's group training with a personal touch. It's definitely something I can't continue to do forever but for now I've seen a big improvement in what I'm able to do now versus my first class. Also, the heart rate monitors are what makes OT different but the monitors don't always work accurately which takes away from their niche.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,9/5/2014,41,45,4,8,6>Located next to the YMCA and Little Caesars at the intersection of Book Rd and 95th Rd. This place opened up early in 2014 during that horrific winter and has since been running with a wide selection of items ranging from: Milkshakes to Ice Cream to Smoothies to Desserts.Man you name it, they have it.I personally have only tried one item: "The Cappuccino Crunch" Ice Cream flavor, which is beyond delicious.It features a, Cappuccino flavor which is pretty close to chocolate and a crunchy wafer like crunch. So when you eat, you enjoy the Cappuccino flavored Crunch.Its hard to describe because it seems to be a custom ice cream flavor, that you may normally NOT FIND at other stores.By the way, they serve Hershey Brand, Ice Cream, which I never heard of before until this store opened up.Its a family run store, in which you'll often see the Mom or the Dad working, and occasionally their children.Although no Business website was found, I did find their Twitter account in which they post daily updates and special promos from time to time. You can follow or just simply bookmark them at Twitter here: twitter.com/SweetVille1The items here are fairly priced. Of course its cheaper to buy more of, rather than a small scoop. They have other items besides Ice Cream, which I encourage you to try whenever it gets warmer outside.There is reasonable space indoors to throw a small party or just eat in. I have seen Soccer Team parties being thrown here from time to time and so I suppose you can book parties here.Also, SweetVille incorporates newer technology into your experience. They have iPad based registers, in which you may slide your card and sign on the screen, and you receive an email with your receipt. It definitely de-clutters your wallet and provides for a easier transaction. The store has 1 or 2 bluetooth speakers set up. From which, based on your appearance and your age range, the Woman owner may try to play music that is geared towards you.I remember when I walked in a month ago, all of a sudden "One Love" by Bob Marley started playing. And I remember saying, "Nice, its not often you hear this song is a food shop."Other than, its Evening Only Business Hours, this place is awesome and is geared toward the younger crowd. Their menu is so big and decked out with pleasantly-delicious-sounding-names that someday I plan to try other items on their menu. Whether you're young or old, everyone screams for Ice Cream, and so go here and give your taste buds a treat!
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2014,9/4/2014,149,67,5,8,9>I cannot say enough good things about these people. I trust them 100% with my fur children. I have taken both of my babies here numerous times. With both of them being rescues they come worth the usual issues, but my older pug took the cake. I was told by a different vet he would need all of his teeth pulled out and to have pins put in his front legs to straighten them out. Yes, he came from a puppy mill. This was also going to cost me around $2500 according to my vet. I started to research a more low cost alternative to having this surgery done. I found Spay Illinois online. When I took him over there to be examined, i was presently surprised! The facility was very clean. It didn't small like cat pee, and the staff was super helpful. When the vet came in I got a great vibe from her. Low and behold, my dog did not need all his teeth pulled. Only 4 and a dental cleaning for $167 including meds! Needless to say I haven't ever returned to my old vet. The staff all knows me and my dogs by name, and always go above and beyond in their care.Smashface, Hayden, and I have referred numerous friends and family to them and will continue to for many years to come.

I can't wait to go back for their steak sandwich and try other eats. My wife and I reported a bill of $28 (including tip).We really can't wait to go back! It's not a fancy place. It's reminiscent of your old fashioned tavern style diner. The service was great, and although we had to wait ten minutes for a table, it was a sign that this place was full because the food is good.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,9/2/2014,63,131,,6,7>Come support a small business that serves delicious coffee and gelato. I have personally tried both the standard coffee and the 'pour over'. Both were terrific. Admittedly, its hard for it not to be when its Intelligentsia, but that is the point! Right now the seasonal special is Persephone coffee from South America - a medium brew with a smidge of apricot flavor to lighten the body up a tad.Plus, the servers are friendly and in need of a little more attention from my fellow Yelpers. So skip the $tarbucks (that's right, plural) and stop on by Bloom Coffee Company because I bet you'll like it too!
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,9/1/2014,15,87,5,6,4>You cannot live in, live near, or visit Geneva without eating at Preservation. If you miss Preservation Bread & Wine, you've missed one of the Western Suburbs' great restaurants.If you are out to dinner (or lunch) with someone you don't like or that you don't like talking to, then don't come here. Go to McDonald's or something and get it over and done with quickly.If you enjoy the person you'll be eating with, then come here. The cheese and meat plates at Preservation are terrific for long, conversation-filled meals over a bottle of wine. The staff can always recommend excellent wines to go with whatever you choose from the menu, and never ever will you be rushed. All the crostini are good, all the flat bread pizza is good, and the Charcuterie and Spanish Charcuterie are terrific.If there are any of the Chocolate Espresso Tarts left when you go, have one. Or two. Or three. Along with coffee. You'll be happy.

Ever walk into a place and you just know it's going to be good right away? That's pretty much what you have here. It makes me feel a little bit like I'm on vacation somehow, just sitting inside or in the outdoor area, which they added after they bought the building when Cafe Firefly closed. I'm pretty excited to have Taste This so close to my house, for sure.I'll have to come back a few times to get the full scope (I hear good things about the ice cream, coffee, and "adults only" milkshakes), but my sandwich, the Vinny Barbarino, was excellent, and I loved the side potato salad, which is clearly made in house. I finished it off with a fresh squeezed lemonade (delicious) and brought a roasted almond tea home to my wife, which I stole more than a few sips from. I look forward to when the 31 bypass construction is done, because it will make getting to this part of town easier, but in the meantime, it's well worth fighting some traffic to stop in.

<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,8/29/2014,499,481,12,17,18>I came with high expectations after reading all of 20 reviews, each with 5-star rating.  It was getting late and their website said they close at 7pm.  Amazingly, they had a Facebook feed on their website where they recently posted that they were opening until 8p that night.  How tech savy!!  That piece of info got me into those doors that night.  After my dinner here, I am happy to add to their 5-star streak.The deli is adorable and is tucked away in one of the alleys in downtown Lombard.  Street parking is free and was easy to find.  There is both seating inside and outside.  The lady working here, I believe her name is Theresa, made us feel more than welcome.  She is enthusiastic and genuinely cares for the business and her customers.  What a delight to be at a place where the people are happy!Shrimp Po Boy w/side was on special for $7.  Since it was towards the end of the day, some of the sides were almost gone and she threw in an extra side for us.  How sweet!  The sandwich looked and tasted amazing!  Cobb Salad - $8 - Big salad, fresh and delicious!  The bacon on top was perfectly cooked.The sub and sandwiches on the menu ranges from $5 - $8.  Great atmosphere, great food, and great prices. I'd go out of my way to come eat here again!
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,8/28/2014,59,161,3,8,7>The taproom is open! We came here 5/23 for Chicago Craft Beer Week and my birthday. It was awesome. We were a little confused, since there wasn't too much signage, but everyone was nice and we found the taproom in a corner of their warehouse. It was really cool to watch the goings on of the brewery. They had great music and a cool movie playing. My friend and I each got a flight, and the nice lady working suggested we get all six of the beers on tap and then each pick our fav for the last two. 5 Lizard is still my favorite, but the mango paletas and mango chile paletas were both yummy. The Yodo con Leche was the favorite of the bf. He had two glasses then a beer float. (The beer float was amazing). The Gringolandia Super Pils was a very nice pilsner. The Naked Rabbit was a collaboration with a Norwegian brewer Nogne O. It was really good, mango and juniper. It was my friends favorite.  There were people selling ice cream and mangos, and they started grilling burgers before we left. They also have a fridge full of beer to take home and you can get growlers. I can't wait to go back and sample more beers.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2014,8/27/2014,65,197,3,7,10>I  am always on the hunt of a good diner type place for breakfast, not the "wait for 1 hour and maybe we will be seating" you next to screaming kids and warm coffee and high prices.Mauri's was GREAT.  If you drive down Hawley too fast you will miss it, but it is worth the turn around.  The place was clean, service was excellent and friendly and the coffee was hot and plentiful.I had the 2x2 special and it was more than enough with eggs cooked perfectly (over medium) crisp bacon and 2 melt in your mouth pancakes.  Next time I am getting the pumpkin pancakes (if they are half as good as the regular I will be thrilled).  We ordered a skillet, an order of corned beef hash (this was the only possible flaw as it was a tad dry) and Mauri's famous omlette with jalapeno peppers and chorizo and lots of cheese came with hash browns and a side of fruit.  Their prices are good, service super friendly (as were the happy customers sitting next to us) and my tummy was very happy when I left!
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2014,8/26/2014,38,217,2,12,7>Love the concept.  the man making the sandwiches (whom I can only assume is the owner) indicated they use mostly organic spreads, Red Hen breads (redhenbread.com), have an independent farmer out of Traverse City, MI making all his jams, etc.  I first ordered the Blackhawk, which is 2 pretzel roll slider size sandwiches (chocolate peanut butter with raspberry preserves).  When i saw them being assembled, i realized it was definitely not adequate sized for a lunch so i ordered a chaser, i think the Berry White (reg. peanut butter w/ blueberry preserves, on white).  I settled on these 2, as many on the menu looked to be overly sweetened.  added marshmallow fluff, honey, toffee peanut butter, etc.  While I'm sure these are all excellent.  I wanted to stick with a basic staple for starters.They were tasty little sandwiches.I could have used a larger quantity of spread on the sandwiches, a little thin on that end.  Even these 2 sandwiches didnt cut it for a complete lunch meal. I was still hungry.  And ending up paying $10, I was a little disappointed on that end.  I love independent businesses such as this.  I fear this one may be a little TOO specialty, focusing on pbj sandwiches.  Not a whole lot of room to diversify with the name being peanut butter planet.  Maybe adding grilled cheese sandwiches would give them room to grow?
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2014,8/25/2014,25,298,4,8,5>Bono's Beef and Bono's Pub - they are in the same building. If you are in the Pub, you walk through the breezeway to Bono's Beef to get food. If you are in Bono's Beef, you walk through the breezeway to get into the Pub with your food and tack on a beer. Either way you look at it, these two share the same address and should have the same reviews. That said, the food was really nice at Bono's Beef/Pub. We ordered a grilled chicken sandwich (nice marinade and sandwich), cheese fries (slathered in cheese), a Maxwell Street Polish (add-ons make for a nice sandwich), chicken strips (moist chicken and crunchy breading), and mozzarella sticks (nice thick sticks) ... and all the food was good. Had the BBQ (smoky) and Ranch (peppery) sauces and they were also nice - tangy and just a bit of zing so you'll remember you had a topping. Don't usually give out five stars but this place rocks the food side.When you enter the Beef side it looks just like any other kind of roast beef place - a number of booths, a counter up front where you order, a TV on the wall - you get the picture. If you go through the door on your right, you'll enter the Pub area - full service bar on the back wall, lots of tables and TVs and a couple of video games. The center room often has live music - with the bar and pub working on either side. Never been here for the live stuff, but the food and pub sides go together very nicely. I checked into the Pub but spent my time in the Beef - split personality. You can eat on either side, but I assume the pub is off limits to the little people...nice way to separate them. Nice staff...we ordered and forgot two things. They gave them to us anyway with no charge or rolling of the eyes. They have a nice laid back staff that gets the food out. The food isn't prepared a day ahead of time and waiting on the railing...they make stuff pretty fresh and that was a nice touch. Small wait and very nice food. Clean yet old place. Come here for the food and not the décor. Pottys were also nice - had wild cherry soap in the Unisex bathroom...old fixtures but everything works just how it should. This place is a winner. We'll be back.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2014,8/24/2014,42,136,6,7,5>We went there for the recent Blues on the Fox Festival. They featured artists like Jimmy Vaughan, Tab Benoit and Los Lonely Boys just to name a few. Only $20 to get in the park. Had to park in the Metra station and trek to the venue, but that's to be expected with an event this large.Venue was set up well with food and other vendors near the entrance. Walk around them to get to the seating area. We found our parcel of grass and parked our chairs. Bring lawn chairs and an umbrella, we needed both. Plenty of clean Porta-Pottys and hand wash stations which I consider a plus.For folks on the lawn there is a giant screen behind the sound and light booth. Makes it nice since your a good 50+ yards from the stage itself. You do have good sight lines from the grass. Only problem with this event was the planning. At around 8pm most of the food was gone and so was the beer. Giant mistake! How do you run out of beer? They did have bud light, which I don't consider beer at all, so for all intents and purposes they were out. I think they ran out of bottled water, too.I'd definitely go back and I hope the planning committees and vendors learn from the mistakes made during this event.Cheers!
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2014,8/23/2014,47,165,10,17,12>I bookmarked Sam's based on reviews on Yelp.  Today I finally made my way over there.First of all, Sam is very nice and entertaining to talk to.  You will walk out of there with a smile for sure.I ordered the tandoori chicken on a pita, but he talked me into another version on a crispy bread.  OMG... it was amazing.Although I didn't order fries, he threw in a few for me to sample.  Also very crispy (surprising since they're fresh-cut) and tasty.I think a Tandoori chicken salad would be great, and I'm sure Sam would make it if you wanted it.Great find, and some day I'll try the pizza.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,8/22/2014,75,135,4,5,8>The ladies in this shop are very helpful, patient (I always have tons of questions, don't judge picking nail polish colors is a hard decision to make). As well, they work quickly. I was happy to find this place on groupon and it's about 6 min from my job. I had a no chip, decided to go with a natural color to mix with different outfits for work and otherwise. Since it's my birthday, I jazzed it up with some gold glitter top coat.Each layer was done perfectly and they were nice the entire time. They also do no chip pedis so I'm definitely coming here again since it's so close to work. The no chip pedi is a must when traveling and based on the great work they've done on the mani, I trust it'll come out right. Check this place out, it's close to Jewel and Rockies Pizza.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,8/21/2014,124,106,2,10,7>Guac + watermelon = amazing ness!I came here on the raving review from Katey A. Her and a coworker have gone after school before, and warned me that you do have to get there early. The restaurant opened at 12pm, so my friends and I got there at 11:30 to wait. Luckily the line didn't start forming until about 10 minutes before 12, but I'm glad we did get there early. I think they're use to a line because the host came outside to take names and than the (assistant?) host kept locking the door behind him until they were ready.Upon entering, you pretty much understand why. If you've never been or heard of Bien Trucha, you would know this place as the grey building with no sign and a line around the corner to get in. There's a line because it's seriously the size of a New York apartment! Small cozy tables, very modern look, but it has the mexican feel to it as well. We knew all this before we came, so this was no surprise. I was, totally ready for the small space as long as the food was as good as I had heard. When you sit down, the waitstaff does do a great job of trying to clear as much space as possible by taking your coats for you. When we sat down, we immediately got a basket of chips and a bean dip that was delish! And that's saying a lot considering I HATE beans :) My friends and I (three all together) had the following:Guacamole del Dia: not only do they have a traditional guacamole which is delish, but every day, the chef makes a guacamole of the day which includes his choice of fresh fruit. Now Im the FIRST person to turn my nose to fruit in savory dishes (i.e. chicken salad with grapes or oranges?? eeww!) My food friend Katey A did however, keep my mind open to this, and I'm so glad she did! The fruit of the day was watermelon, and it was such an amazing combination. Since watermelon isn't completely in season, it wasn't candy sweet like in the middle of the summer. The sweetness, however, was a great compliment to the savory of the guac. It was delicious!Ahuacatl (margarita): When a drink menu is so unique, I just have to have one! I decide to try the ahuacatl, which was a drink (margarita I think!) made of avocado, agave nectar, lime, exotico blanco, orange liquor, and mezcal mist. It was sweet, savory, and creamy all at once! I think this will be my go-to drink next time we come!Barriga de Puerco - I had the pork belly tacos, which was marinated in adobe, and had salsa verde cruda, cucumber, and queso fresco. The pork belly was cooked to perfection, and cubed so small for this plate of 4 tacos. The cuts were perfect for the size. The taco itself was spicy, but not too spicy. With all the food we had, I was very impressed with the balance that was found within everything! Esquites - Along with the pork belly tacos, I had to try their roasted corn. It came with epazote-butter, lemon aioli, queso cotija, and chile piquin. It was a little watery than what I'm use to with mexican corn, but the flavors were there. I think the liquid came from the mixture of the butter and the chile piquin, but it was still yummy. You could tell that this corn was roasted on the cob and than made into this side. Yum!Bien Trucha - One of my girlfriends decided on the bien trucha, and I traded one of my pork bellies for her. This one had grilled skirt steak, chorizo, chihuahua cheese, and roasted tomatillo salsa. When they came out, I was a little weary because the chihuahua cheese was melted , and I've rarely seen that on a traditional mexican taco.  The flavors of this taco, however, were amazing! I really didn't taste the chorizo, but it could have been added for the heat factor, which was nicely balanced. Pollo - My other girlfriend had the pollo tacos, which were more like Southern California rolled tacos. Although I didn't try them, they looked amazing. The rolled tacos had a mixture of shredded chicken and potato hash inside, and topped with creama and queso fresco and morita-serrano salsa. If you eat with your eyes, this was a winner!The one negative with this place is that they don't split the checks, however they are more than happy to divide the check among as many credit cards as you want, and you can indicate the amount. There was so much on the menu that I wanted to try, and didn't get a chance to for the sheer fact that I had no room wahtsoever! I'll definitely be back :)
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,8/20/2014,122,135,3,6,7>I had a great haircut yesterday from Toni. Without even being asked, she took the time to explain HOW to style my hair and use my hair dryer correctly. All of the staff I encountered were friendly. The salon is very nicely decorated and comfortable! They even have a cute little bar set up for their color consultations. It is a boutique-feel, but there is nothing stuffy about this place! As a new client, I felt welcomed and enjoyed my experience here.
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2014,8/19/2014,43,86,2,7,8>The food is excellent, and the service is fast. There's not much more you can ask from a restaurant.  I recommend coming here for the lunch special from 11 AM - 2:30 PM, Monday - Friday (the restaurant is closed on Wednesdays, though). You'll get a lot for $7.25 (There's a $2 upcharge for a dish with shrimp or squid). With your choice of Pad Khee Mao, Pad See Ewe, a Thai Basil dish with your choice of meat or tofu,  a red curry dish with your choice of meat or tofu, plus four other dishes, you can't go wrong. Each lunch special comes with an egg roll, chicken satay, Pad Thai (meatless), and fried rice (meatless).  I typically get the Beef Pad See Ewe, which is always good. In particular, I like how the dish has the perfect balance of noodles, meat, and Chinese broccoli. As for the restaurant's other offerings, we enjoy the shrimp toast and the Thai calamari. The individual pieces of toast and calamari are big. Both dishes have a nice batter on them. I particularly like the Thai calamari's delicate batter, which allows the calamari to largely stand on its own. The service here is fast, and you'll get the attention you need even if there are lots of diners. You shouldn't have a problem finding seating here either. Just walk right in - no fuss. Thai Little Home comes highly recommended!
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2014,8/18/2014,152,234,3,6,6>Best Truckin' BBQ was scheduled to go to my Corporate Office building during lunch hours.  On their receipt, they are located in   This food truck offers sandwiches, sliders, homemade BBQ sauces, Southern style side dishes and dessert.  The staff was friendly and on average you would expect to pay around $6-$10 bucks for your meal.It was the beginning of Memorial day weekend so why not start off with some BBQ!  Here are some items I got:-Speeding Ticket which was snack size bbq pulled chicken bites on toasted pretzel buns that come with homemade potato chips.  They had two types of sweet BBQ sauce, one more tangy than the other topped with cole slaw.  This was really tasty chicken was perfectly cooked not at all dry, I would get these again.  However, I didn't care much for the homemade potato chips.  Mine tasted a bit stale/old or maybe it wasn't cooked in a high temperature?  Also, there was no seasoning on mine, no salt. I'd rather have a bag of chips or even a small cup of potato salad if they offered it.-Traffic Jam was a side of 7 pcs of crispy and hot hush puppies with a red pepper spicy dipping sauce on the side.  This was good but I'd prefer a BBQ type of dipping sauce as this spicy sauce was ok but a bit spicy for my taste buds.  It didn't compliment my BBQ meal.But overall, good eats heard from my other coworkers that they liked their pulled pork sandwiches and their sliders.  I will order from them again when they are around.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/29/2014,8/17/2014,47,131,5,8,4>North Aurora, Gem!!!!This place doesn't look like the culinary highlight of North Aurora from the outside, nor does the name make you think that... It's awesome.  Seriously, it's hard to even spot windows from the outside.It's like they took an upscale Naperville restaurant, allowed you to wear jeans and put it in the middle of no where North Aurora.This is one of those kinda places where the chef takes pride in his menu.  It changes a lot, but it's so good!!!!I have gone here at all different times, had a fantastic brunch with prime rib... took friends from work here and had the burger and fries that I dream of, and had a meatloaf flight once with Kobe beef and buffalo.The servers here are awesome too, always funny and never seem like they are being rushed.  They have great ideas for you to get some amazing food.Heck, even the bathrooms are awesome... individual bathrooms that all have different names and themes.Why only 4 stars then?  Two reasons, it's a bit pricey (even though you get what you pay for... I just can't always afford it.)  And, the part that disappoints me the most is the noise level.  If the great bluesy rock they play could just be turned down a notch, I'd bump it up to 5.Try to make a reservation if you want to go here in the evening cause they will pack up quickly, although they are honest about the wait times... it can be nuts.
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2014,8/16/2014,57,177,5,6,6>I was pleasantly surprised by this new restaurant.  The only thing I didn't care for was the country music, but the food and experience quickly overshadowed that.Our server was fantastic.  She was super personable, as one should be at a "southern themed" restaurant.  She was very helpful with the menu and brought us some tasty sweet teas.There are peanuts on the table that you can eat, but the best part is you just throw the shells on the floor!  I've heard of places that do this, but this was my first time at such a place.I ordered the shredded pork with fries and cornbread.  The shredded pork is dry rubbed and was amazing.  This was some of the best pulled pork I've had. The BBQ sauces they have are also very flavorful.  The fries were done well.  The cornbread was pretty dry and I would pass on it next time (unless there was a drastic revamping of it)Overall I was very impressed with Old Crow.  The service was awesome and the food was pretty stellar. Stop on by if you're looking for some good southern hospitality and cooking.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2014,8/15/2014,110,138,4,10,7>I love love LOVE this place. I would have to say it's my #1 favorite sushi spot.  It very inviting and classy.  It looks like it would be pricey by the way it looks but its really not(check out their happy hour!).  I think it's affordable and the service is outstanding.  The sushi is delivered fresh and decorated beautifuly.  I would suggest you check this place out if your ever near one.....oh and thier desserts is oh so yummy :-)P.S. they also have a Hibachi Grill if you are interested.  It's great for big groups/birthdays, they have Japanese-style seating on zabuton pillows or conventional tables. Enjoy!
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/27/2014,8/14/2014,76,143,7,8,7>Ok, let's talk delivery. Because Piggyback delivers. And how!The amount of sauce included (all kinds!) was insane. I could have opened my own Piggyback with the amount they sent when I requested "extra sauce, please."  Fantastic. Also- the food tasted just like it was fresh out the oven/smoker/BBQ/etc, and brought to my table at the restaurant, except I was at home and in pajamas. I got ribs and french fries, the latter of which was not soggy at all-they tasted like they had literally just come out of the kitchen. The ribs are always good-that's not hard to mess up for Piggyback. As an afterthought, and almost as a joke to myself, I ordered a s'more for desert. I don't know how -I suspect magical gypsy hocus pocus- but it was perfect. Seriously perfect. As in hot off the campfire, melty chocolate perfection. How does a restaurant deliver a perfectly-browned s'more in the dead of winter? Answer me that and I think you may have found the secret to world peace and cold fusion.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2014,8/13/2014,61,173,6,4,4>An authentic German experience! Big beer hall, communal tables with a band playing. A loud raucous place. Lets talk about the brew, made here on site.. is delicious! The big pretzel is a must have with a stein of beer. I personally think the Hefeweizen here was the best wheat beer I have tried in a long time. Oh.. lets not forget you can bring your buddy here on his birthday and get him paddled by a waitress! I am sure this is a true German tradition.. so come make memories with your friends!
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2014,8/12/2014,60,239,8,9,10>This was our first visit and we loved it.  Thanks to all of you Yelpers who posted thoughtful reviews that led us to Union House.We had a number of their small plates and all of them  ranged from very good to excellent.We started with their homemade BBQ chips to snack on.  The BBQ dusting is a mix of BBQ and a hint of sweetness.  Paired with a fine craft brew, they are a nice pairing.  Next out from the kitchen were the Crab Hush Puppies.  You get 4 on a plate and they are accompanied by a sweet & spicy pepper sauce - very good.We also sampled the Gulf Shrimp Brochette which are 5 medium sized shrimp on a skewer.  The shrimp are perfectly spiced and the seasoning doesn't detract from the subtle flavor of the shrimp.  The shrimp are drizzled with a citrus aiole that gives this dish a little spark.  All you need to do is scoop a bit on your shrimp.Next up was the Pulled Pork Sliders - WOW!  This was absolutely the best dish.   Their in-house "sweet heat BBQ sauce" is one of the best I've tasted.  I wish they would bottle this for take-home sales.  The pulled pork was not stringy and came topped with homemade coleslaw and served on a locally baked Gnarly Knot pretzel roll.  We don't eat much meat these days, but this was definitely worth the indulgence.  I highly recommend these sliders.Although we were quite full at this point,  the thought of Shrimp Corndogs was way to tempting so we ordered these for "dessert".    Three medium sized shrimp dipped in a fluffy corn batter along with a sweet honey pepper sauce.   I'll tell you, I don't know if I'll ever be able to eat a "regular" corndog again.  I'm spoiled forever.They have a small but interesting beer list and about 6 wines to choose from.  I started with a Solemn Oath Wreckagemaster and then switched to  Church Street Heavenly Helles.  Since my wife offered to drive home, I ended the evening with a delicious Bourbon & Ginger.    I like that most of their craft beer offerings are local breweries.In total, we had 4 small plates, one side of chips and 5 drinks.  Our bill was $88.  I would have figured it to be at least $25 higher.    The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable.  One other thing, their "small" plates are not that small- definitely larger than tapas size.   Locally sourced and produced is a big part of what Union House is all about as we learned from our friendly server, Evie.  She was terrific and told us  about all of the dishes and the history behind Union House.  I think the quote on the back of their signature drinks and dessert card sums it up pretty well:"Eat local, Eat fresh, Eat seasonalMost Importantly, Drink Local"Union House American Kitchen is an easy pick for something different in the Western suburbs.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2013,8/11/2014,45,113,1,7,5>So my husband and I decided we would go out and celebrate with a little date night a few Saturdays back. On a whim, we stopped here after some good recommendations from friends and co-workers. Let's just say this was probably the best dinner date we've had all year!We started with the bowl of guacamole and chips. I was hesitant at first because I thought the guacamole was a little expensive. Once I tasted it, I was so glad we got it! It was so creamy and one of the best guacs you can find!The waiter was so nice, attentive and definitely seemed to enjoy his job. He told us the specials, of which we each ordered a different dish. They were both heavenly!  They were savory and you can tell the sauces were made in-house and with care.Around the time we were deciding to finish our food or splurge and order a dessert and take the rest of our food home, I checked in with my Yelp app. Every check in gives you a free dessert. Easy choice, we packed up our remaining meals and ordered the Tres Leches cake (after another great suggestion from our waiter). Umm, let's just say I would have licked the plate clean if we weren't in public.Our waiter was spot on, never over bearing but we never had an empty water or pop cup. Absolutely perfect service in my book! Something else I noticed when we were leaving, EVERY employee smiled, greeted us, or wished us a good evening while we were entering or leaving the restaurant. This made us feel so comfortable and made this a very inviting space. Overall I would suggest this place to anyone who will listen! The prices seemed fair, the food was delicious, impeccable service, and great atmosphere.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,8/10/2014,78,76,7,13,9>AH-MAZ-ING!!!!!!!!! Fire + Wine is definitely the best small plate/tapas style restaurant in the Chicagoland suburbs.  Located in the upcoming part of downtown Glen Ellyn, Fire + Wine was like a breath of fresh air.  I'm just going to start out by saying that I'm always weary of these up and coming HIPSTER-esque restaurants, I always feel that they fall way short of my expectations.  Fire + Wine did not disappoint! We were they for a birthday party, group of ten, on a Sunday night.  The place was packed and we had to wait for our whole party to arrive to be seated; they have a weird rule on reservations and seating.  At any rate, our server Kate was upbeat and knowledgeable of the wines and menu, giving us great recommendations.  They have so many tables for a small restaurant and it makes you wonder how everyone gets packed in there and also feels comfortable.  Shout out to the genius who decided to put purse/coat hooks for every available seat. Who puts designer bags on the floor? NOT I. Thank G for those hooks. The food was amazing and perfect for sharing, as most dishes are simply just small plates.  They even offer gluten-free pizza and pasta.  For appetizers, we started with zucchini fries, prosciutto di parma (artichoke, mozzarella, roasted peppers, prosciutto and toast with a balsamic sauce) and the grilled romaine salad.  The zucchini fries were crispy, salty and nothing short of delicious.  The prosciutto appetizer was also great and the balsamic sauce was a perfect addition to the plate.  The grilled romaine salad, recommended by the server, was excellent. For dinner, we all split a couple pasta and pizza dishes.  The owner came around to check on our table, he was very gracious and even sent over some meatballs on the house, which were delicious and like nothing I've had before- which is saying something coming from a Greek-Italian family. The homemade pasta was excellent, perfectly cooked as well as the pizzas.  The vodka sauce was the #1 vodka sauce I've ever had, so memorable and I'm SO coming back for more of that.  The pizza was traditional, more like a flat bread and so good.  The crust was perfect because it was not overpowering or too heavy of a dish.  Perfect for sharing.  Overall, FIRE + WINE is an excellent restaurant and worthy of recognition.  Excellent food, excellent staff...excellent restaurant!
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2014,8/9/2014,270,833,10,14,10>I have been to a few Brazilian steak houses before, so this was not my first rodeo. I didn't know this place even existed until a few months ago! Basically it is just like the more expensive steak houses, except a few details.1. This place is about half the price. $27/ person for all-you-can-eat versus $50.2. This place is much smaller, both space wise and in the variety of food. The salad bar is limited compare to the other places I have been, and it seemed like they did not have as many varieties of meat.3. Instead of having individual 'yes I want more' or 'no, not now' meat coins, you have to decide as a table if you are ready for more meats or not. Not a big deal, but I prefer my own.Other than that, it was basically the same. Same side dishes, same varieties in drinks and desserts, and same concept. And they do have the grilled pineapple here (my favorite!). The service was pretty good, maybe not AS good as other places, but not bad. Our server did a good job of explaining how this works, and they were good about refilling drinks. The meat men could have been a little more friendly. If you want more of something, you can ask for it and they will make it. If you want the meat more rare or more well done, you can ask for that as well. I do recommend that you tell them, because they are supposed to ask but they usually don't. Make sure you don't fill up on the salad bar (which can be easy to do)! Get all your meats in first!I would come back if I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the normal places!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2014,8/8/2014,850,1294,8,17,17>Eating here kinda blows my mind each time and leaves me speaking in Doge. Such poutine. Amaze. Much craft. Such selection. Very delicious. Wow!We've come here about a handful of times and expect to make many future visits. This craft brew bar is practically in the same parking lot as AMC South Barrington 30, so we often grab a bite to eat before seeing a show.The downside:Long waits (typically 30-45+ min each time we've shown up), somewhat slow service (though not atrocious), sometimes a bit of a mix-up on orders (they're apologetic and correct it), and I think their fries are pretty weak.The upside:If it's just two of us then we've usually been able to grab a seat at the bar relatively quickly and you can order food there, our servers have all been very gracious, their poutine is pretty decent (even if the fries suck, IMO), the burgers are great (I highly recommend the Grilled Cheese Burger and The King), and they have a handful of their own beers, a great selection of other craft beers, and there are typically a couple hard ciders on tap. Their bottled beer choices are varied and extensive as well.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/20/2014,8/7/2014,50,141,7,13,7>I've been hearing raves about Mariano's from my bro for months, so when a location opened up in Wheaton, I was pretty pumped to check it out. Here are my findings:- It's a solid grocery store, so it's got that going for it- The food court is boss. Gelato, pizza, a bakery, bbq, sushi....and soup! I didn't try the soup, but the prices were super reasonable. I actually did get the pizza and random stuff from their hot food bar. Both were pretty good, especially for a grocery store food court....and the absolute golden amazing thing that makes Mariano's over the top incredbile is.........when I walked to the cash register, I saw the cashier CLEANING THE CONVEYOR BELT. You heard me. It was breathtaking!The nasty food conveyor belt is one of the ultimo banes of my existence. How many nasty raw chicken germs, etc live on that thing when I place upon it my delicate produce and Special K? In my 15+ years of shopping for groceries, I have never witnessed a single cleaning of these nasty apparati - until my first visit to Mariano's. So. Dreamy.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/29/2013,8/6/2014,63,167,5,8,6>Classic video games... check.Reasonable price... check.Return privileges (aka Ability to go for beers and come back) ... checkI love the variety of games available at Galloping Ghost.  As I walk up and down the aisles I constantly find a game that I didn't even know I remembered.  Due to lack of funds, I didn't spend much time in arcades when I was young back in the 80's, but a few trips gave me memories to last through the years.  I am also not particularly skilled at these old video games, which is why the unlimited play is awesome.This is not a place I would go often, but it is really nice to know it exists when I need to get my fix of Off Road.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2014,8/5/2014,69,261,1,15,7>AWESOME. Clara's used to be housed in a strip mall with block text advertising the name of the restaurant; you wouldn't know it was Italian (or a restaurant!) unless you looked it up. The new location is fantastic. While I believe it may be a bit smaller, the ambiance is much better. How they turned an old Krispy Kreme location to a beautiful Italian restaurant.If Clara's continues to thrive, they're going to need more tables in the bar. We had reservations for 7:30, and waited for nearly 40 minutes AFTER our reservation before we were seated. I can't knock a star down though for that - we were approached by both the manager and the owner and received two free appetizers for our wait. We weren't bothered, just ordered a few drinks at the bar as we waited. We were surprised when we were brought around the corner to our seats - we didn't realize the restaurant was as big as it was. It was cozy and comfortable.Our server, Melissa, was fantastic. Upbeat, and very nice. We started with the Goat Cheese Pizza as an appetizer as well as half fried, half grilled calamari. The pizza was fantastic. Huge slices and crispy crust. I could eat just this! The calamari was surprisingly good too. I've had lots of calamari, but this was a bit better than most. The grilled had a great flavor to it, and the fried was lightly breaded, so you could still taste the calamari. For dinner, I had the Shrimp Ersillia. I despise sun dried tomatoes, so I asked for regular. Melissa suggested I order either extra spinach or mushrooms instead, as fresh tomatoes may water down the sauce. The fact that she knew to recommend this and knew the dish/menu that well was super impressive. I so appreciated this! I ordered extra mushrooms and it was fantastic.Allow me to reiterate. I was with great company, but I could have literally moved to a corner and just ate in silence. This was so good, I didn't need conversation or company. It was creamy, garlic-y, salty and cheesey...so good. Very fresh. And LARGE! I had enough for a big lunch the following day...though I could have eaten this for weeks on-end. For dessert we ordered the tirimisu and the a chocolate cake that tasted like a lava cake. Both were delicious - the tirimisu was a little less chocolatey or coffee-tasting than I had expected but both were great.I can't wait to come back and support this small business. The new location is the icing on the cake!
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2014,8/4/2014,119,254,1,9,9>This place is my go-to spot in Oak Park. I live just a few blocks away, and I love being so close to it. I've been a bunch of times, and even took my parents here twice. My dad, who loves oysters but is a very tough critic, always begs to go to Poor Phil's when he drops by. He says they're the best oysters he's ever had, and like I said, he's a tough critic!I've had a multitude of the dishes, and can recommend a few. The lobster quesadilla (which is sort of a seasonal special so not always available) sounds a little weird but is so good, and it doesn't skimp on the lobster. I also love the guaca-burger -- it's the first burger I've ever had topped with guacamole, and the first time I had it, I wondered why I hadn't thought of it before it's so crazy delicious. Also, for you vegetarians out there, my boyfriend said their black bean burger (available as a substitute on any burger) is the best he's had. And their tater tots are pretty exceptional, at least in my opinion. I can't stand soggy tots, and theirs are always hot, fresh, and crispy. The Po'Boys are also super. The only thing I've ever gotten that hasn't been great is the Fish n Chips. Not that the taste was bad, but the batter just got a little bit soggy and ended up falling apart a bit.But back to the good, their salads and soups are also very good. I also can't talk about Poor Phil's without talking about their extensive beer selection. I'm a sucker for a huge beer menu, and theirs is quite nice. They also have a hand pump, and have a special beer each day on it, available until it's gone.Largely, service is decent, but to be honest, I don't come here for the service. Every time I've ever sat at the bar, I've ended up making friends with my barstool neighbors.The music played in the bar always matches my taste, and I could spend a whole day in here (in fact, I did once). They always have Chicago sports on the TV, and during the playoffs for any particular team, they turn on the TV volume so you can hear the commentating.Oh and ladies, check out the photos of naked dudes in the women's bathroom.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,8/3/2014,45,515,2,9,4>I live a few blocks from the Onion Roll, so I eat here frequently.  My favorite day to visit is Tuesday, as I love the split pea soup with croutons.  Yummmm!  I am also a fan of the egg salad sandwich, any of the deli meat sandwiches, and the matzo ball soup (it will cure even the worst cold!).  One of the best things is that the Onion Roll now has added a new machine for making lattes, so I don't have to go far for my caffeine fix.  With the new coffees, they have also added high end teas, and the selection is fabulous for those of us who need to get our zen on in the afternoon!  The staff is efficient and super, super friendly.  It makes you feel good about eating locally when you are treated in such a friendly manner.  Many of the staff members have been there for YEARS!  That is refreshing to see and a treat.  The location is convenient at North and Woodbine, with easy parking in front and around the corner.  It is a great choice if going to Wonder Works Children's Museum (down the street) or if going to any activities at nearby Mann School or Field or Lindberg Parks.  This is a great place to meet a friend, dine alone, or take the family!  Enjoy!
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2014,8/2/2014,344,146,7,11,8>I love me some Naf Naf.  Unfortunately, the closest location to my house is this one in Rosemont, which isn't conveniently close for me.  But when the Naf Naf craving calls, I must pick up.I have been to this location a few times now and my food has been delicious every time.  I usually go with a hummus spread bowl (rather than with salad or rice).  I top it with falafel, all the veggies, & tahini.  Yum!  I could seriously lick the bowl clean.  Served with the bowl is their perfectly soft pita bread, that leaves me debating whether or not to buy a bag to bring home every time.  Their pita bread is the best.The staff is usually friendly.  On our last visit, the girl that was working seemed to have an attitude about her.  I mean I guess I'd be pissed too if someone had left a huge hickey on my neck to mark their territory.  Take that tude up with him, not your customers.  I can handle the 50 cents for extra falafel, but I don't like the fact that adding a scoop of baba ganoush to my bowl is $1.89 (at least that's what the girl told me on this last visit).  Maybe 50 cents to 1 dollar would be more fair.  They could also use some better drink options.Overall, I love getting food from Naf Naf Grill and plan to return.  I just hope they open one even closer to home soon!
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/20/2014,8/1/2014,157,219,6,4,4>I really love Pete's. I do. I love their huge produce selection. I love that the produce selection offers produce that doesn't go bad in two days. I love the cheese selection. They carry Saint Angel on the regular, and THAT'S something I can get behind. I love the deli choices and the great deals. It's a huge conglomerate of awesome.My only reason for the -1 star? The cashier totally didn't want to let me have my OCD way. All I ask out of a grocery store is this: Good food. Reasonable prices. A variety of fancy cheeses. And allowing me to bag my own groceries without (visible) judgement.Unfortunately, though I repeatedly told the cashier that I was crazy (literally) and had OCD tendencies (fact) and needed to bag my own groceries, save I have a panic attack in the middle of the store (please, God, no). And she argued with me. And kept trying to bag my own groceries. Le sigh. You can't win 'em all.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,7/31/2014,58,86,3,8,6>An incredibly long list of brews, great food, and live music on weekends!  The beer menu is about 10x's the length of the food menu - prepare yourself.  They do offer pairing suggestions on their food menu and they are willing to give you tasting samples so that you are confident in what you choose to put in a pint. Each of their draft beer includes a beer classification, description, ABV, and serving glass.For food, we ordered the fried asparagus, bratwurst, and the BBQ burger.  The deep fried asparagus was difficult to eat because the stem was too fibrous for the finger food appetizer it was being presented in.  The garlic aoli was awesome!  I actually asked for an additional side of it so I could dip chips and fries in it!  YUM!  The brat is served with grilled onions and sauerkraut all on a pretzel roll.  I would highly recommend ordering this!The Beer Market is a great place for a good bite, new beer, and the live music is an added bonus.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2014,7/30/2014,56,402,4,6,4>This wasn't our original pick for brunch, but I'm glad the place next door was closed.It seems to be new, since I'm pretty sure it was something different less than a year ago. Ari was our waiter, and apparently the owner as well.The setup inside is small, and has a country type feel. However, if you can "not judge a book by it's cover" then you can genuinely appreciate this restaurant. It's not set up like a 5 star restaurant, but the low cost, customer service, and delicious food make up for it.I honestly don't know if we've had better service. Anywhere. We've had $100 meals where the service wasn't as good as the service we received here.First of all, my breakfast was $4.95. 2 eggs, delicious homemade hash browns, and raisin toast. My fiancé had 2 eggs, bacon, and french toast for $7.95. Very cheap!And, it was delicious. The eggs were buttery and fantastic. They also make their own butter and various jams.There are stencils on the wall that say things like "We don't own a microwave" or "we don't use added salt" which is a little odd. That being said, you can tell they take pride in their food. It is a great home cooked meal. Also, when we had finished our meal, he asked if we were full and had enough. He asked us if we wanted refills...on our food! It was crazy for us to be so welcomed and we felt that was a grand gesture that he really wanted to make the customers happy. I definitely recommend anyone to visit here!
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/8/2014,7/29/2014,204,102,4,5,5>I'm a fan! Came here after going to the Dupage Children's museum and we got here right before the mad rush with a wait out the door. My husband and I shared the sampler platter with spicy brussels sprouts and fresh cut fries, my daughter and son shared the kid's meal 2 sliders (brisket and pulled pork) with cornbread and we devoured our meal. The sampler platter was $21.99 and came with brisket, pulled pork, pulled chicken, 2 chicken wings, 2 ribs, spicy sausage, 2 q puppies, and 2 sides. We ate about 3/4 of it and took the rest home. Our favorite was the wing (you didn't need a sauce for it, it was delicious just the way it is) and the brisket was also good. The ribs was probably our least favorite, it was dry and tough to get down. I loved the brussels sprouts, it had a kick and was definitely not healthy (tons of oil which is probably what made it yummy but I'm a fan of regular brussels sprouts as well). The fries were good but nothing spectacular. The cornbread was also good, my children devoured it. We also had a side of mashed potatoes with gravy, that was also good and had lots of flavor. Q puppies were fried perfectly and really flavorful, probably the best hush puppies I've had here in Illinois. My friends had the burnt ends and it was delicious. Definitely something I'd recommend.We got here at 5:00 on a Saturday and it got packed by 5:15. The food came out fairly quickly and they take your plate for you at the end of your meal which is a nice touch. I'll definitely be coming here again the next time I'm in the area!
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2014,7/28/2014,92,197,3,6,5>There is something seductive about Russell's BBQ. Maybe, it is the bunker like building that produces pulled pork just like you wish your grandma used to make it. Maybe, it is the knowledge that nothing there will ever change. Maybe, it is the old school soft buns and the fact that the portions and the prices have not been supersized. I think it is the melodic mix of whatever made it so popular in the past and still keeps it going today. Oh, and the BBQ sauce.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2014,7/27/2014,180,420,3,11,4>I found Quality Window Tinting on Yelp and I thought I'd give them a shot.  The goal was to tint my wife's car because the sun really overheats my daughter's car seat and bothers her eyes.  We were using sunshades but decided to give it a shot.  I went legal 35% all around with the ceramic tint which gives even more heat protection.So far the quality on the work is excellent.  It looks like it was done at the factory.  No bubbles whatsoever.  I don't think I will have any problems.The entire process took about 2 hours.  It was Saturday morning and the place was pretty busy.  I was one of the first people there so I got a spot on the couch watching some x games.  Greg was very professional, yet laid back and friendly.  Not too salesy, and you could tell he enjoys his work.I would gladly go back and tell everyone I know to go here.  I'm not sure if it was because of the holidays or weather but I was also able to squeeze in a Saturday morning appointment even though I only called 5 days earlier.  Awesome.Oh yeah, depending on your map service, it may give you the wrong address.  It's actually about a block or so west of 59.  Right north of butterfield on a frontage industrial strip mall.  Seriously, check it out.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,7/26/2014,646,300,12,15,12>I managed to convince my mother not to cook an Easter dinner. Then I managed to convince my whole family to celebrate a day early. Since I told everyone we should Chama Gaucha it up Saturday evening, everyone was on board. Upon walking in I noticed a photo I took back in 2010 that was printed on a plaque by the Chicago Tribune. My name was on there as a photo credit. I did feel special I ain't gonna lie...LOL!We had reservations for a party of six and seated in the back area private room. At first my mother was a bit hesistant thinking the service may be slow since we were hidden. All I have to say to that was "THEY ABSOLUTELY KNEW WHERE WE WERE". There is not a bad seat in the house. The servers took care of us as if we were royalty. My pops is a talker and of course he made friends with everyone filling his plate. It actually got to a point where the green and red flip cards were irrelevant. The meats just kept on coming and my family just kept on smiling and grabbing.The cuts of meats ranging from medium, medium rare to well is worth every dollar. My mother can not stand to eat or look at any meats less than well done. She sees pink on the meat and she will freak out. Since my mother loves me I demanded she try the arracherra cooked medium. She willing agreed and admitted that Chama Gaucha is the only place she has ever enjoyed less than well done steak. I made her a believer and I didn't get punched.On side note I totally forgot that 18% gratuity is automatically included in the bill. I included by accident an additional 25% totaling a crazy 43% tip. Thank goodness the hostess returned with my change and mentioned I over paid. I am thankful for their honesty and respect. Food coma activated and it was a wonderful early Easter dinner :)

Literally everything looks phenomenal, fresh, and tasty! I had no idea where to start or what to order so I told a lady that looked as though she's a regular that this was my first tie and her eyes opened wide and I could just read her mind, "oh my god, prepare to be blown away young man." She was just rattling off all her favorite dishes and she basically named everything there. I ended up ordering a loaf of bread, pepperoni roll, two slices of the thin crust pan pizza, and 1 arancini with ricotta/spinach and 1 w/the traditional beef/peas. Honestly,  everything was off the hook! The bread had a nice crispy crust and a soft interior. I would recommend heating up the pepperoni roll for a little bit in the microwave to soften it up a little bit. The thin crust pizza had a nice and fresh sauce, slices of mozzarella, fresh basil, and crust  that was soft on inside but crisp on the outside. My favorite was the arancini. Deep fried rissotto that encases delicious fillings....my first time having arancinis and not the last. Both were bomb and I'll never forget this first encounter.... Friendly service and CHEAP! My total bill came out to $16 and some change...keep in mind ordered enough food for 2.5/3 people..... I will be back!!!!!!!!!!

It was my third time here.  I am going to be that weirdo that calls her friends to pretend to care and wants to catch up so we could go to this place. This place is THAT good. Don't let the location fool you. It's very easy to overlook it as it is in a weird plazza. It is not a big place but it's very cozy. Dark but not dark enough to make it look like a disco. Our server was very fast and very attentive. The sushi came out pretty fast as well and the restaurant was full. Went in with a friend and we had 5 rolls. Smokey bear, millennium maki, special spicy tuna, tornado sunrise and puff wrapped ahi. ALL rolls were great. It was very fresh. The presentation was pretty kick a** too. Very beautifully put together.  I absolutely love this place. By far one of the best sushi places around.

It had a nice blend of flavors, especially with the baby greens and basil sauce.  Knowing it wouldn't keep well without getting soggy the next day, I forced my +1 to finish the rest of it with me! :)  My +1 got the ROI (Chicken Teriyaki). The flavors were good, but I think the chicken was a tad on the dry side.  The ginger slaw was OK (a bit runnier than I like), but I really enjoyed the home made chips - they had a great spice!The owner gave me a stamp card for my next visits.  I'll have to come back and try the Wasabi Coleslaw and also see when they have a special on Spicy Tofu, since I'm feeling brave! :)

I wouldn't have believed it if I didn't try it myself. My boyfriend discovered this place based on the great Yelp reviews and it does not disappoint. We both ordered combo plates so we could try a little bit of everything. I had a traditional pupusa and beef pastel while he had the pork/bean pupusa and tamale. I thought a pupusa was a type of sandwich but it's actually more like a savory stuffed pancake. The pastel was similar to a empanada but with a crispier shell. Everything we ordered was very tasty and prepared fresh to order. The yucca fries, fried plantains and passion fruit juice were also a big hit with us. I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu.

<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,7/20/2014,86,198,5,14,10>"Gourmet" cupcakes historically have elicited a bit of an eye roll from me, as I've always been the kind of guy who just buys the neon frosted four pack at Wal-Mart in the rare instance that I'm craving cupcakes. I see what all the fuss is about now though, and even though they're way more expensive than the nuclear Wal-Mart variety I'm used to, the cupcakes from Smallcakes are infinitely better.I picked up a half dozen on the way to my friends' house with a variety of what was available at the time, and they liked them so much they ended up picking up cupcakes from Smallcakes instead of getting an actual birthday cake for a family function a few days later. Also relevant, they have a birthday cake cupcake flavor which was amazing.Anyway, if like me, your reaction to the notion of gourmet cupcakes is "Really?" you owe it to yourself to give these a spin.It's worth mentioning exactly WHERE this place is as my car's GPS wasn't entirely accurate. (I should probably get the maps updated finally.) Smallcakes is in the tiny strip mall immediately west of the Jewel at Washington and Ogden. My car thought it was closer to where the Dairy Queen and Ace Hardware are for some dumb reason.

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl...The girl who has everything? " - The Little Mermaid song, I am now basically a Little Mermaid... I LOVE MY NEW locks, and feel like the girl, the girl who has everythiiing thanks to amazing hair colorist Marie at the Life Spa!I LOVE the Aveda Life Spa in Life Time Fitness!I was initially nervous about switching from the colorist I have used for the last couple years at the Asha Aveda Salon in Streets of Woodfield, but she was gone on Maternity leave, and I needed a new lady, fast!  (Not dissing Asha Aveda, still a very nice salon, just wanted to try somewhere new)So I spoke to the manager Casey, a lovely sweetheart who never forgets a face, (or hair!) and showed her pictures of what I would like to have done, and asked her who she would recommend to best fit and be most comfortable to help me achieve the specific look I wanted (see my pics I posted here!) and she immediately, and without question recommended "Marie" for me!  I do believe Marie is a "Senior Stylist" or something similar to that and let me tell you, she has mad skills!  Jamie at the front desk patiently helped me search through Marie's schedule to find a time soon that matched up with my schedule, I just couldn't wait any longer, I was dying to get my hair color done...just beyond excited!  I was able to get in very soon, it was like 2 days later, for a very early morning appointment on account of my very long very thick hair.When I arrived that morning, Marie greeted me and seated me down in her station, and I pulled out my photos, and my pinterest board pictures of ohh about 100 pics of inspiration for the right shade of red, and the look I wanted to achieve.  I was so nervous because I've seen the communication go so wrong before between client and stylist, and they end up just doing what they think will be "best" without listening to what their client truly wants... I don't mean here, or even the other Aveda in Schaumburg, just... previously... and it's horrifying, especially for such a big, drastic, bright change! You want it to go smoothly...AND IT ABSOLUTELY DID! WITHOUT A HITCH!!!She showed me their hair color sample swatches and once she had a good idea of exactly the red shade I had in mind, she popped in the back to quickly mix up the custom color, while I looked in the mirror and said farewell to my faithful all blonde locks.The girl working at reception (who's name now slips my mind, I'm so sorry, I'm usually really good at making mental note of names so I can mention their amazing work in my reviews!) offered me a beverage, and she even went over to the LifeCafe to grab me a coffee (on account of it being hella-early morning... well, in my book... this girl needed some coffee stat) which was delish, I have never had coffee from the LifeCafe in LTF before, and it did not disappoint! Once the color was mixed, Marie and I got to chatting, like ladies do when at the salon, and she is a super cool chick!  We had a good time learning about each other's lives as our sure to be long-time client-stylist relationship blossomed, and she was painting what looked like blood on my head, wasn't weird at all, because I was so super excited, and felt I trusted her to help me with the super fun red-blonde ombre look I wanted! (again, check out the pix.. before & after.. omg love it!)Once all the color was applied, I only had to sit for like... 15 minutes maybe? for it to finish processing, can't remember the exact time... then it was time to head back to the bowl to wash out!Having someone else wash your hair feels simply maaagical.. like a mini-massage for your scalp...Marie custom chose from their long line of products my shampoo & conditioner, and I learned that since Red is the fastest color to fade, washing it in cool/cold water will help lock in the color longer, and fade less... AWESOME! After washing all the color out, we headed back to her station where she round-brushed-blow-dried my hair into the most beautiful, sleek style... once it was finally starting to dry I could see the finished color...andOHH MAAHH GOSH! IT WAS PERFECT!EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!!! EXACTLY!!!I was so relieved, and elated at my new look, it seriously could have turned to a scary shade, or had the risk to look something fiercely funky, but Marie's expert skills made it absolutely 100% perfect and just what I wanted!I cannot thank her enough, I LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE IT!!! I absolutely will be back to entrust the coloring of my little mermaid locks to her skillful hands!Give 'em a try, they have great prices, and the Life Spa is staffed by a wonderful group of ladies!Thank you for an absolutely amazing experience! :-D

<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2014,7/16/2014,154,291,4,9,8>At first I didn't want to try this place out because I am not into sweets for breakfast. We ordered Skillets and were very surprised with how good they were (avocado on a skillet is amazing...well avocado on anything is amazing!) Beware the skillets are smaller than most but I did not mind. Think portion control! A plus is that it had more of our toppings instead of potatoes. Oh and the potatoes...were good..just right!Service was great, coffee good, definitely family friendly because there were so many little ones.Get here early because there is quite a wait on weekends.Take note that this is not a place to have breakfast with your friends to sit around and chat. The place is loud (kid friendly) and is very busy (after 10am) on weekends. However, this is a place you come to enjoy some good breakfast. :-)
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2014,7/15/2014,771,552,6,9,6>La Hacienda de los Fernandez has been a staple in the Addison location for a while now. They have an awesome outdoor area and their margaritas are fab. So I decided to go here for lunch one day, I mean I've never lunched during their lunch hour. I was really looking forward to the soup they offer with their dinner meals. So we walked in and to our surprise there was a lunch buffet. I thought "wtf, I'm not going to get my soup". Should have looked at the buffet before speaking. They had so many of my favs: enchiiladas, rice, beans, fajitas, chicken milanesa, taco meat, tortillas for the meat and even seafood entrees! So awesome! Unfortunately I'm horrible at all you can eat. My eyes are definitely bigger than my stomach. Is that how that phrase goes?Their dinners are pretty on point too. Keep in mind, this is a Mexican American restaurant so don't go in there expecting Abuela Maria's homemade meals, but it's pretty good for what it is. And like I said.....Margaritas are FAB! So don't leave without drinking one. You're welcome. :)
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,7/14/2014,1337,181,5,17,12>I absolutely love the Riverwalk. I have been coming here since I was a kid and now I come with my husband and our dogs. There is always something to do. I love the paddle boats or coming out here for picnics with friends and family. The town always has events at the Riverwalk too, especially for kids like storybook readings or face painting.The river is beautiful and lined with stores and restaurants more towards the downtown area. When you go a little further past centennial beach, you have a few parks here and there but mainly trails. It is a great path to hit if you are a runner. Winter or summer, the Riverwalk is absolutely stunning and a must-see/do when visiting Naperville.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,7/13/2014,359,353,8,16,10>First, I need to start off by saying that I am the anti-bride. I'm just not that girl.  Although I'm super girly and love everything fashion - planning a wedding gives me hives. Just the thought of having to buy a wedding dress made me pop a Xanax and drink a dirty martini. I mean, just watching "Say Yes to the Dress" gives me a panic attack. Not to mention, this isn't my first rodeo and I know what a pain wedding planning and dress shopping can be.So, when trying to figure out where to begin when finding a wedding dress I weighed out my options. I knew there was no way in hell I would attempt a David's or House of Brides, but I wasn't quite ready to make a trip down to Ultimate Bride for a Monique Lhuillier or Vera Wang gown. Yes it's important to go all out for a wedding, but I'm also a realist. - I'm only wearing that dress for 8 hours. So, naturally I scoured Yelp which led me to Here Comes the Bride.I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience. Not only did I purchase the 4th gown I tried on, but the service was unbelievable. It was laid back and intimate. I never once felt uncomfortable or pressured to buy a dress. My consultant was happy to provide her opinion - but in the most tactful way. She pulled dresses that fit what I was looking for, and encouraged me to try on dresses that I normally wouldn't have selected for myself.I also loved that they had dresses in every size. With the way bridal gowns are cut, not everyone fits in their sample size 6. I was able to try on dresses that actually fit me so I could get a really good idea about how they would look on my wedding day.If you're looking for the champagne popping, over-the-top experience at a salon with 5,000 dresses, where your consultant is gong to woo you into a $7,000 gown, Here Comes the Bride isn't for you. What you will get is one-on-one attention with a professional, helpful consultant who will help find the right dress for you - not the one with the highest price tag.I would highly recommend Here Comes the Bride over and over again. This little mom-and-pop bridal shop knows just the right way to treat their brides. And as for this anti-bride, I may have just softened up to the whole wedding experience after purchasing my dress.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,7/12/2014,2184,1339,19,31,25>Amazingness has come to S-Town! As the reigning duchess of Schaumburg (self appointed, mind you), I'm beyond ecstatic to see such a fabulous event come to my kingdom. And it's going to be here every month this summer (sans July), you say? Well this is going to be fun!Toasty Cheese organizes this event and it's the most well thought out food truck meet up I've ever been to....And I've done my fair share. I went this past Friday right at opening time 4pm and that's the time to get there to beat the lines. All the trucks were there right on time, actually before 4pm hit. This past Friday the trucks there were:Toasty CheeseBridgeport PastyChicago CupcakeGrill ChasersGia Via CupcakesBest Truckin BBQChicago Pizza BossPizza ViaMariani's Gelato ItalianoGino's Steak TruckThe food truck lineup will be rotating which is great because it will keep me coming every month! I can bet my bottom dollar that Toasty Cheese will be there every month though.This event is seriously perfect with a plethora of food options, ample seating, a separate area to purchase swill beer (ca$h only), music plus some cooking demonstrations. 'Twas a really good cooking demonstration by Chef Paul in which my friends and I all agreed we learned some good home cook tips. Each month is going to have a theme and for May it was Hoedown! As in cowboys and cowgirls, not some chick that done fell down. I saw a few people with hats on but they played country music and had haystacks around to really drive the theme home. I left about 6pm and it was packed with long lines abound and friendly faces here & there.My only gripe - Portion sizes! They were huge. I know, I know, who complains about the portions being too big?!  It would be more awesome if more trucks had smaller sizes though for sampling. A cupcake is a cupcake I suppose, but huge sandwiches make you so full, you can't try anything else! Props to Best Truckin' BBQ for offering cheaper, smaller portions on a couple items.Now keep in mind I split these items with friends so wasn't a complete mountain beast consuming all 96352 calories associated with these nomz. But here's the damage I did:Veggie pasty from Bridgeport Pasty - a must get!Chef's choice ($9) grilled cheese from Toasty Cheese - If I just put " "  to symbolize this is also a 'must get' is that lame? Duck bacon!Pulled Pork Sandwich from Best Truckin' BBQ - Delicious and really friendly guys!Korean BBQ Chicken meatballs ($5) and Mac & Cheese ($3.50) from Grill Chasers - I didn't taste the Korean-ness in the balls but liked the various textures in the mac & cheese.I'm obsessed with Chicago Cupcake so you best believe I grabbed me a couple of those before I hit the road. Other Quick Notes -They allow dogs. My friends both brought their pups.Most places take credit cards, but a few are cash only. Check with the individual food truck.They don't announce the exact food trucks prior, so go & hope for the best! Bring your own water to save yourself some $$$.Truckin' Around is a must go to event this summer! Mark your calendar and be ready at the Schaumburg Boomers parking lot (free parking!) -June 27th - AmericanaAugust 29th - Pool PartySeptember 26th - FiestaOctober 31st - HalloweenSee y'all there!

My wife and I decided to make a donut run and grab a couple of donuts. It's been a while since I had been here when I read Kim B's review that stated that this place has recently changed ownership. It's not like I wasn't a fan but the donuts were just okay. I also read Christina S's and Meghan H's reviews and thought it was time to go back. Thank you lady's for the great reviews. You're like sirens calling people into this place, except instead of crashing in to unseen rocks underneath the treacherous waters you are calling people (and me) in to this great unassuming donut shop.I went with a Buttermilk Old Fashioned donut, a Sour Cream donut and an Apple Fritter. Buttermilk Old Fashioned Donut:The Buttermilk Old Fashioned donut was a dense cake type donut about the size of my fist with a honey glaze on top. Good to have with a tall glass of milk.Sour Cream Donut:The Sour Cream donut was very nice. It was perfectly made with a nice chewy crust and a flaky, delicious cake on the inside. It reminded me of the old days and how donuts should be made.Apple Fritter:I have to say that the Apple Fritter was fantastic. Meghan H. hits the nail on the head with her description of this Apple Fritter. I'm only a novice compared to her but believe me you wont go wrong with this one, Because it is awesome, fantastically delicious, fresh and so much more I can't describe the feeling that came over me when I started to eat my Apple Fritter. I was hoping that my wife wasn't going to ask me to taste it but if she did ask I would let her because maybe she would pick some on her way home.Jennifer L, I know it's been about a year since you've been here last but I think that it's worth a return trip if you're in the area.
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,7/10/2014,20,133,4,7,4>I've gone to Quigley's fairly regularly over the nearly 15 years it's been open and the food is good, they have a great selection of tap choices, and the atmosphere is good inside or outside (when the weather is right).The Irish dishes are good and hearty-sauces on everything are as well, which tells a lot about a restaurant.  My most recent trip included a staple-Reuben Rolls, as well as their nightly special ($5 fish and chips) and some Sam Adams Rebel IPA.  My friend enjoyed it and said it was one of the best Irish pubs he's been to and he travels often for work.Service is usually decent and there is plenty of parking nearby as it's in a good location-1/2 block east of Washington-so no neighboring establishments open in the evening.
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/12/2014,7/9/2014,85,355,1,10,6>We got to go here as part of a Living Social deal for a vodka tasting. Pulling up, the place looked a little small. I didn't know what to expect, but ended up being pleasantly surprised. Owned by a young couple and their partner, this place was a little nicer than I thought it would be. It has a bar and a few tables, and an area for a band to set up.  We took a table in their second room for our tasting, and were presented a menu with 8 options. You could do all 8 cocktails or trade in 4 of them for a full size. We decided to try them all. I'm not much on vodka, but I have to say, I enjoyed this! It was a nice variety of mixed drinks, straight vodka and martini options. It was very smooth. Service was a little slow- they were preparing for a party, but the husband and wife both came over to serve us and were super friendly. We ordered the cheese tray- an assortment of Wisconsin cheeses, which was a good compliment to the drinks. That would be the only thing I would recommend. The rest is just frozen pizzas and low quality college dorm-type food. But hey, they are focused on the vodka! Can't knock them on that, but if they could get a chef to make fresh food, I think it would take them to the next level!They have lots of vodka options, their full price drinks weren't that pricy- from $3 it looked like. You can buy vodka by the bottle as well, they were 26-28/bottle.It was a big hike for us to go there, but it was a super fun experience and I would totally go again!
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2014,7/8/2014,69,457,4,8,7>This is one of my husband's favorite places for lunch with coworkers- he's been here probably 100 times over the years. Last week was my first time- we tried it for dinner. It's a cool looking place- a little confusing walking through to find the order counter- but a neat looking place. They have a wide menu- a lot to choose from. We got the onion blossom appetizer- it was OK- easier to pull part than those at other restaurants, and it came with the biggest container of homemade ranch dressing- that was confusing- there was almost more dressing than onion and the onion was big! I wonder if anyone actually eats all of it. We also got the soup of the day- chicken with dumplings- I LOVED this soup- it was thick and so delicious- that made the visit worth it for me. I wasn't crazy about the little loaf of cornbread we tried- it was very dry and stale. The coleslaw had good flavor but was more torn than shredded and had some bad parts of lettuce/cabbage in it. My husband had the special of the day which was a pig sandwich (BBQ pork)- he loves the BBQ sauce they have on the tables and always goes for the spicy kind. Apparently the BBQ sauce is more smoky than sweet. The service was good and the music they played was really fun- a blend of oldies.Overall it was good- the soup was awesome- my husband loved his sandwich- fun atmosphere.

Unfortunately, her appointment ran late and I had to run to my next appointment. So she went to Gnarly Knot's without me! She had a cheese pretzel and french onion soup.. said it was excellent... (insert eyeroll)Lisa was asking what I wanted to do for lunch today... she threw ou a couple of ideas.. so me (feeling a bit salty) said that I might just run over to Gnarly Knots later."I want to go" was her reply... and so it was..Today (Wednesday) is BRISKET Stuffed Pretzel day. Yup, you read that right. So that's what we got, along with the Garlic Mashed Potato Soup, a Big Honking Chocolate Chip Cookie of Delightfulness, a container of their Chili (frozen, for later) and two bags of their Pretzel Chips.The pretzels were crazy good, as was the soup.They only have one special a day, but I could happily eat any and all of them, I'm knotty that way.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2013,7/6/2014,421,397,44,51,47>In driving through Carpentersville a friend of mine wanted to take me to a hot dog stand he had seen so I could give it a try, and a review. As we approved the restaurant a fairly commonly found statue of a giant hot dog applying ketchup to himself so no one would want to eat him was visible right in front. Soon after I walked in I discovered that the name "Just Hot Dogs" is a lie as they have fries, Italian beef sandwiches and tamales. I placed my order for a hot dog and fries and within a few minutes my food was ready.The hot dog here came on a regular non-poppy seeded bun. The bun was well steamed, soft and just a little bit greasy. The sausage used was a natural casing dog that was heated very well. The relish and onion applied to the dog were perfect fits though the hot dog was a little light on mustard. I did not detect any celery salt on it, but it's possibly it could have been applied sparingly. The sport peppers were evenly applied through the length of the hot dog and a long and thick pickle and two large tomato slices were right next to it. The pickle was a little bit on the thick side and the tomato slices were a little too watery, but outside of that this was an excellent hot dog. The bigger star of the show here was the french fries. Normally when I see fresh cut fries I cringe. The reason being around 90% of the time the only way to salvage them is to add chilli, cheese or some combination of the two. These were some of the best tasting fresh cut fries I've come across. Whatever they cook them in gives it more of a sweet taste than salty.Overall I'd say the hot dog is four stars here and the fries were five. Due to friendly service and a clean restaurant, I'll round up the score and give this place a five star rating and a recommendation.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2014,7/5/2014,28,222,6,6,5>I might need to find a gym somewhere between home and Sausage Guys.  This could get ugly.If not for Yelp I'm not sure we would have noticed this place even though it's just down the street from us.  Have gone here a few times for eat-in and take-out since.  The small front room is basically bordered with a standing bar with some tall chairs and they keep it plenty warm inside in the winter.  On our first visit a group of city cops where grabbing lunch which was the first indicator of a potentially solid investment in our decision to try this out.  Now I'm half expecting to see Bob Swerski or Carl Wollarski standing in line or working the grill upon each visit.So far I've had the Chipotle sausage, bratwurst, and the pork chop sandwich.  The Chipotle sausage is just the right amount of spicy and comes lathered with (almost too much) a sweet honey cream cheese which is basically liquefied by the heat of the sausage; many napkins are required.  The roasted red peppers are also excellent.  Next up the bratwurst.  Honestly, I eat brats quite rarely, I've never been a big fan and most of the ones I had in Chicago (e.g. Wrigley Field) have always been average.  Nothing like the brats I had in Germany many years ago.  But theirs is nearly as good as those memories.  And the pork chop sandwich?  It's a tender, bone-in pork chop in a sandwich.  Also messy as can be as you'll literally be picking the meat off the bone when you're finished.Now this may not be as healthy as other options but for the same price as some bland sandwiches with microwaved meat you can get a large sausage loaded with fresh tasting toppings and some of the better fries I can recall having.All of their sausages except for the Italian sausage are made from scratch in house, and you can even buy some by the pound to take home for your freezer.  Can't wait until spring to fire up the grill and cook some of these at home.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/21/2014,7/4/2014,68,207,3,6,5>Do not judge a book by its cover. Cutesy old house with teas and sandwiches? Nay. Hidden dive-gem of the western suburbs. How can a beer and bar-food enthusiast not totally dig this place?Beer menu = really good. Lots of stuff you can find in most decent beer bars, but a good selection of the finer craft brews. They had Scurry by Off Color Brewing on nitro, which tasted excellent. They also had some brews from Solemn Oath, Deschutes, Lagunitas, Left Hand, Stone, and Three Floyds on draft. There were other good selections available in bottles/cans, like Founders, Oskar Blues, Revolution, Great Lakes, Church Street, and Two Bros. Good to see they support local brews! They had a tap for Penrose hanging on the ceiling, and that place isn't even open yet (soon to be in Geneva, I believe). Anyway, beer was good, right? No Miller Lites or lawnmower beers. Lots of whiskey and bourbon to choose from, and a couple ciders available (not Woodchuck). I think that any craft beer lover would be happy. ALSO, you can get a 6oz beer, if you want to try a few beers instead of drinking one or two large pints. It's a nice option, if you aren't sure what you want a lot of, or if you just are in the variety sort of mood.Food, woah. They have a grilled cheese with CHEESE on the OUTSIDE. It's crisped on the outside of the bread, so don't expect something oozy-gooey on the outside, but don't be dismayed. It's really good and flavorful. We added grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, tomato, and bacon. This thing was overflowing but not gross or messy. Lots of flavor without an obscene amount of cheese. We split that, and then also split the Patty Melt. It was fairly standard...homemade burger patty on toasted, marbled rye, swiss, and grilled onions. The burger was a bit more than medium, but it was juicy, so no complaints. If I had to pick a winner, I'd vote for the grilled cheese, but I'm not sorry I ordered the patty melt.THOSE FRIES THOUGH. They look like boring-@ss fries, but don't be fooled. My husband ordered sweet potato tots and was a sorry sucka. He didn't finish his tots and was picking from my pile of carby, salty french fries. Not too thick, not too thin, with a crunchy outside and fluffy inside. Fried to perfection, and you get a lot. Yummmmm.Cory behind the bar was friendly and knowledgable. Everything was prompt and he checked back on us frequently. He even asked "Does everything taste great?" assuming that the found was excellent (which it was). Glad to see this place and its quality inspires confidence in its employees. I'll be back here. There are other items on the menu that I NEED to try, plus they have rotating specials, like spaghetti, ribs, tacos, etc. Their beer menu is rotating, and its nice to see that they have it posted on their website. Drop in for a plentiful basket of bar food and some local brews.

My imagination told me it would have dirty brown screens and smell like cigarettes and Chinese food. After multiple visits I am very pleased that such a place exists! Being able to see movies in the theater that you missed out on wipes away all the regrets.Service:Fast, Friendly. Can't really say much more as it is a very brief transaction. There are usually no lines. I really do wonder how this place makes profit with $1.75 showings. $1 on Tuesdays!Atmosphere:Relatively clean. It isn't spotless like most theaters that charge upwards of $10. But I don't expect it to be. The important factors are satisfied. Clean and comfortable seats! Bathrooms are a tad sloppy.Movie Experience:Reminds me of watching theaters in the early 2000's! Everything was standard with nothing cutting edge mind you. Sounds and Picture were great. You really do get the experience here. I had thought they would have a projector in the middle of the room my first time. A really cheap price for a movie experience. I was happy to be able to catch reruns of popular movies that I missed out on or just wanted to see again. Looper, Don Jon, Pacific Rim, etc. A place of great value that I hope sticks around.PRO TIP!!!This place gets REALLY BUSY on Tuesdays at certain times. It is really easy to sneak in outside food and drinks! Kekekeke...

I have been to Benny's about 10 times now and I have to say this is the perfect chill Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner place. The food comes in rather large portions and is just done right, nothing fancy or over the top, just decent quality and good tasting. Huge omelets stuffed to the gills come with hash browns or an assortment of other sides. Now, I love Belgium Waffles, but almost every place I know screws them up! Benny's are crunchy on the outside, big and fluffy in the middle, Goldilocks would be proud...just right!!!They also have this great Banana Bread French toast!!!! I feel dumb for never thinking of this before but wow!!! Make sure you get the large size or make it a side with your meal! This is what Awesome tastes like!Lastly, the owner... You guessed it! Benny! He is what makes me love this place, he is a true small business owner that cares about his baby(the restaurant) with a lot of heart. He is always there, always friendly and makes you feel at home. I feel like I'm rooting for his success just because you can see how much care and work he has put into making this place great! I hope to still be coming here 30/40 years from now! Go!!!!  :-)

Multiple "this was awesome dude, thanks!" Also, several fans of the hot & spicy XXX sauce were minted today.The wings, which I've never had before: pretty dang good. A little dry, as smoked/grilled wings often are, but not terribly so -- and DEFINITELY NOT UNDERCOOKED, which is the easier and most common way to ruin wings. They soak up sauce nicely without their texture changing. I'm definitely going to make it in for some BYOB wing night one of these Wednesdays sooner than later.We polished off all the brisket, almost all the pulled pork. There were a fair amount of wings leftover, but that was probably because we were all full of brisket and there were only six of us eating.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2014,6/30/2014,68,249,6,8,5>They got it.Skills, that is.No frills. All pie.Worth picking up to go, fo sho. I'll edit this after I finish eating.Ok and here we go...The crust (ordered well-down) is almost a pretzel. So twisted, crispy, and not over powering. It was dense and firm so it held the juicy toppings of onion, green peppers, sausage, and spinach effortlessly. The fresh tomatoes on the top were so sweet and herbed. They melted like sauce. Sweet, sweet sauce. The toasted, gooey cheeses were so delicious. Not too much but definitely enough.The veggies were fresh and tasty. I LOVE THIS PIZZA!!!Even though they don't deliver to me, 3.3 miles away, I'll definitely be ordering more frequently. I'm sorry, now, that I've waited so long to order from these masters of pizzaology. My pie was ready in 30 minutes, or so they say, for pickup. I got it fresh out of the oven and uncut so all the juices stayed in the pie and not all over the box.On the passenger seat next to me it sat all the way home, still piping hot as I rolled my cutting wheel through the caramelized cheeses and crust.Five fuhhhh king stars. Word.
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2014,6/29/2014,161,158,1,15,4>This place has officially become my favorite to go for our anniversaries and special dates with the husband. We used to go to Shaw's in the same plaza but after being at Seasons 52 just once, I can tell that the quality in food is vastly difference and it can be much friendlier on your wallet too if you follow my tips. Now, just because I said it's a great place for date night, doesn't mean you can't go here with girlfriends, or celebrate a birthday with friends or have family dinners. Please do all that as I plan to come back here for the many wonderful occasions aforementioned. Food-wise please see my photos upload for this place. There's also tons of other food pics in the gallery for this restaurant as well. However, it is hard to keep up because this place is called Season 52 for a very special reason: it is for the 52 weeks in the year and the 52 weekly menu that changes! How cool is that?! There is one constant menu that changes only seasonally (I think every 3 months) and that is going to be the big chunk in the front and center of the menu. But if you look over to the right hand side, there is a narrow column that will tell you the specials for the week, and that will change every week! For the rotating weekly menu, they will offer a few choices for soup, appetizer, salad and entrees. This is what Season 52 is all about, and it is genius marketing because if the food is good, people will come back to try out the other menu.  It's a win win because for foodies like us, you'll never feel bored going back to the same place several times!Now, here are my tips if you want to dine here but want to get the most bang for your buck or if you're tight on your budget. Instead of going straight to the entrees (which are in the mid 20's to even 30s, it gets pricey), go for the appetizers. They have a HUGE selection of appetizers, and they're all really delicious. The ingredients tastes fresh, the flavor is aromatic and not heavily reliant on salt or oil to mask its taste. Plus, every dish is under 500 calories. So for the price of one entree (portion is generally small), I actually got 2 decent sized appetizers in place. These apps are priced $9-13.  We actually ordered one entree and 4 appetizers and 2 desserts, in the end our bill came out to be under $65 for two. We were so full at the end and even had 2 doggie bags to take home. When we used to go to other restaurants of the same scale, I couldn't say we were this well fed for the amount that we spent. We have spent much more and had less food!So here's the breakdown of what we ordered:Appetizers: Grilled Garlic Pesto Chicken Flatbread- the BEST flatbread I've ever tasted. Grilled Shrimp Flatbread- I don't see this on the menu anymore but it was good!Ahi Tuna Tartare- very fresh ahi tunaThai Lemon Grass Mussels- such unique flavor, super flavorful, the best!Entree:Shrimp Cavatappi Pasta- small portion but well cooked, not salty, taste just right.DessertsMocha Macchiato- my favorite of the desserts, must try if you like coffee flavor!Mango Cheesecake- yummy and mild in flavor, for those who like their desert rich.Aside from the food, the service was really great. Our water got refilled, the apps came out quick. Our entree did take a little more time but the sous-chef came out to bring us the dish to us and comped one of our flatbread due to the wait. I ended up tipping 30% that night because I was so satisfied with the service. When customers are satisfied, that speaks volume for a business!
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/23/2013,6/28/2014,123,246,4,11,7>This ain't your standard hole-in-the-wall Polish deli.  It's a full sized supermarket WITH a liquor section.While combing the locale for a decent source of kielbasa, I came across Krystyna's and instantly fell in love.  The deli section is always crowded and if the tag system is inop, get ready for mayhem. Somehow everyone stays in order, unlike the death pit at Valli's deli.  Service is friendly and served with a smile from the ladies who aren't hard to look at.Check out the aisles for some unique Polish groceries.  I tried an Apple Mint drink that was strangely refreshing.The liquor section is small but has a decent selection, including 90%+ alcohol spyrytus. Extensive Polish beer selection is available as well.  They have prepared food and a bakery as well but I haven't had the chance to try either.  The food on display looks good though.Check it out and grab some kielbasa for the grill.
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2013,6/27/2014,269,638,3,8,5>I joined back in June, and for the first time ever, I find myself looking forward to and enjoying every visit.  That alone speaks volumes for this place.Membership comes in two simple packages: Regular and Gold.  I chose the Gold Membership.  For $25 a month, I can go to any Zip location, with a free guest each visit. (Which saved a bunch.  My husband can go with me, and we don't have to pay for two separate memberships.) Plus a free shirt and unlimited tanning- which I don't use, but could be a perk to those that partake.The gym itself is not fancy.  No classes, juice bar, or massages.  Just plenty of treadmills, elliptical machines (3 types), stationary bikes (2 types), stair climbers, and a hellacious yet wonderful climbing machine called Jacob's Ladder.  There is a small mirrored free weight area, and tons of weight machines with clear descriptions on how to properly use them, and what areas they target.  Most of the clients are people like myself, out to lose a few pounds and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I usually get here around 9am during the week, and it is sparsely populated, so there are never lines for machines.  Staff is quite friendly; always greeting and saying goodbye.  They do a great job of maintaining the facilities as well.  There are always full tubs of sanitizing wipes, and the locker and restrooms are nothing short of immaculate.  There are personal trainers available by appointment, but by no means do they use the hard-sell approach to make you sign up.I'm very happy with this gym.  Thanks to it, and a bit of will power, I've managed to so far drop 40 pounds.  Yeah, it's a shameless self plug, but I think I deserve it!
<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/5/2013,6/26/2014,273,603,4,11,7>What a great find!  While exploring our neighboring towns, we decided to check out some spots in Elgin. My sister and I were yapping on the phone trying to plan our day out when one of us (I can't remember who!) found Elgin Public House. After scrolling through the pictures and checking out some reviews, we decided to give them a try. Off to Elgin with my husband and son to meet the sis and bro-in-law and we find a free parking garage immediately across the street. This was perfect!  As we approached, we commented on how the street view really doesn't do this place any justice. Nothing would have made me stop if I didn't know this bar/restaurant was here. Once inside, we end up having the nicest server and sit in her area toward the back of the restaurant. Kinda behind the bar area. This was fine for us as there were plenty of TVs and lots of football to be watched. Our guys were happy.There's nothing fancy about this place, but the service was great and the food was fresh and tasty. I stepped outside my comfort zone with a meatloaf sandwich and chicken chili. Oh yeah!  I'd order both again. The meatloaf was a little light on the actual sandwich but it tasted really good. Around the rest of the table was more chicken chili, regular chili, a chicken sandwich with pineapple, a chicken pesto sandwich, a burger and an avocado turkey wrap. Everything was good. There were absolutely no complaints about the food. We were practically planning our next visit in between bites!  I think we better get on that soon...
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,6/25/2014,72,277,7,11,7>Love this place!  Ok, from the outside it looks like one of the bars in "Roadhouse" (minus Patrick Swayze), but it's a surprisingly cozy and cheerful place where you can have a great meal at a good price.  In fact, I would have liked it when I was single: good, strong drinks in a chill atmosphere with a separate bar area, and fun, kitschy decor....AND I like it now that I have a husband and toddler: kid-friendly with servers who make googly sounds that my son loves, and a fish pond and entertainment that will keep him enthralled.  We went there for NYE and the fire dance show was definitely worth watching.  Try the tasty and hefty portion of teriyaki beef, and if you have a sweet tooth, the mango passion moa (sweet and sour chicken).  Their hot and sour soup was huge and possibly one of the best I've ever had.  We're looking forward to trying the rest of the menu, and our next check-up with Dr. Fong.
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2014,6/24/2014,41,109,11,15,11>Holy hell in a handbasket, if I could give this location 10 stars I would.Don't let the drab outside appearance fool you. Place is tiny and easy to miss. Only a few tables inside, generally no music, just a small little storefront. Oh, and parking? Worst lot ever. I'm convinced. So, I was weary when I walked in.But then it happened. BAM! Falafel sandwhich, babaganoosh, lentil soup, random green salad (delicious nontheless), and habañero sauce. Oh my god, I dropped dead and arrived in Middle Eastern heaven. As we were ordering, the falafel was already being handmade by one of the cooks. Our babaganoosh arrived to our table first with warm pita. De-freaking-licious. I have never had anything like it before. By far my favorite. Then our falafel sandwiches came out. They weighed a freaking pound each. It was stuffed with warm falafel, veggies, and sauce. By the time the 12 oz of lentil soup came out, I was already in heaven, but when I had a taste of the lentil, it sealed the deal. Literally could have fallen out of my chair. So delicious.Overall, 10 on the food hands down. Will definitely be returning even though driving on Harlem makes me want to rip my hair out. But it's so worth me being half bald. One thing I wish I could change...add some music or something. It was eerie quite in there when my boyfriend and I weren't conversing. Otherwise, bravo!
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,6/23/2014,283,456,12,14,12>EAT PAN DULCE, LIVE HAPPY!I am always on the hunt for a good bakery. My definition of a good bakery:Items baked on site (for freshness, obviously), sweet or savory foods that are baked in an oven, reasonably priced treats that will leave you wanting more. Azteca meets my requirements and then some!! I have been to several Mexican bakeries over the years and I have only found one other place that truly deserves 5 stars from me and that place is on the West side of Chicago and too far for me to frequent so I'm especially excited to have found Azteca right in my backyard. Some of my favorite bakery items are not the prettiest things in the world and as much as I like cupcakes, donuts and cookies from other random places nearby, Azteca has just earned my business after one brief visit.I have been wanting to get to Azteca Bakery for several months and tonight, I made a quick stop in since I just happened to be passing by and wouldn't you know, they were open at 6:30 pm on a Sunday night. In fact, they are open until 9 pm every night of the week. I'm a fan of the hours!The location is perfect for them located right next to an Aldi, a taco joint and a Fiesta Market, I can get all my Mexican foodie needs met at one small strip mall in Streamwood. Who knew?The store itself is extremely CLEAN!! I mean, eat off the floor, clean! The display cases are free of fingerprints and dirt. Management/owners obviously take pride in their bakery. The staff is very friendly and not one single person is just standing around which I have seen in plenty of other places the like; Everyone is working, cleaning, putting fresh items out, you name it. These folks work hard here.I selected about 12 or 14 items and left there for just over 7 bucks...ummmm, are you sure about that? I gotta admit I was a little afraid that the stuff wasn't going to be that great because it was so cheap, but Dios Mio, you weren't kidding, this place is fantastic!! Yelptastic, to be exact. I picked up a few rolls for sandwiches (3 for $.99...can you beat that?) that I'm looking forward to eating my sandwich on for lunch tomorrow. I also selected several Polvorones and a chocolate cake slice that was calling my name. I nibbled on the Polvorones tonight after dinner and I must say Azteca, you have made this picky little lady a very happy one! Looking forward to returning for more treats soon. Maybe next time, I'll bring my hubby or sister along. Damn it, these places are the reason I'm a round little Mexican lady! ;) Adios!!!
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/8/2014,6/22/2014,68,183,3,6,5>I ended up here for a late lunch on a snowy Saturday afternoon with my dad, stepmom, and the BF. Dad and stepmom had a chance meeting with the BF during a recent hospital stay so I had suggested lunch to make it a lot more official. This combined with the LEYE gift card I had given them for Christmas gave us the perfect excuse to check it out. Every table gets bread and a sort of antipasti plate. It is an olive oil base with actual olives, parmesan, definitely anchovies and some other stuff mixed in there. I didn't have any but I think I saw my dad licking that plate clean. He couldn't get enough of that! We started with the bruschetta. It was a nice serving of four slices and made with fresh mozzarella. Stepmom was incredibly excited over the surprise arugula in it! Dad and stepmom followed this with salads. They have some very interesting salads to pick from. Dad ended up with the spinach and avocado salad! NOTE: Everything is a la carte. BF and I both ordered types of gnocchi. I ordered a special that was baked in an Alfredo sauce. He had a tomato cream sauce. We had expected his to come in a vodka style sauce. It looked almost like a typical tomato sauce. As he mixed his plate together, you could smell the cream sauce start to come together. It was definitely unique. He enjoyed it. Mine was incredible! The gnocchi were flavorful and tender. I enjoyed every bite. They bring out a tray of small tastes of desserts. You can get the whole tasting tray, choices off the tray, or a single full size dessert. Dad and stepmom picked out two tastes to share. BF and I split the full size molten lava cake with vanilla gelato. It was very rich and very delicious. We will definitely be back. The four of us got out of there for under $50 after a $100 gift card and with apps, desserts, and a few glasses of wine.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/9/2013,6/21/2014,31,112,4,8,7>I'm a big fan of Tuscan Grill. Family owned and operated in the heart of Blue Island's historic Uptown commercial district, this place delivers tasty Italian favorites, a few unique surprises, in a casual dining setting that's perfect for the neighborhood.I've had a bit of everything from the menu. My favorite are the panini sandwiches with a basket of fries. Italian classics like manicotti are done perfectly. The pizza is one of the best in town. Hand made calzones are worth the wait! This is a kitchen that knows how to cook.If you're in town for business I'd recommend this place for a working lunch. Grab a booth and get to work! Servers are attentive and keep your group happy. Carry outs are a breeze if you need to bring something home to the family.If you've been here in the past you owe yourself a revisit. Nicely remodeled dining room, opened up with a full bar to one side. Comfortable and cozy, I'm happy the family gave it another go and excited to see what's next for Tuscan Grill!
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/26/2013,6/20/2014,74,264,3,10,5>This is an adorable place!!  The ambiance is very french - right down to the waitstaff  uniforms - "little black dresses" with a beaded Eiffel Tower on the back - darling!!  I wanted to meet a friend for coffee in the area so we settled on La Crepe Bistro - instead of coffee we had Mimosas and a few items off the starter menu.  The assorted cheese plate and the Grapes Chevre Bon Bons...just enough to fill our tummies before doing more Christmas shopping. The menu looks fabulous with a large variety of inventive crepes and other french standards.  I am excited about going back to explore the lunch and dinner options.  VERY happy there is a place like this in the area.
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2014,6/19/2014,107,399,1,9,6>Very good for a diner-type restaurant. While nothing was particularly amazing, I felt the satisfaction to price ratio was very high. In fact, many of the items (most of which are under $6) were cooked at least as well or sometimes even better than pricier restaurants. Food came out quickly, piping hot, and in plentiful portions. The sides, like toast, were prepared consistently well also.The items I tried;Cream of Brocolli with Cheddar - Light and creamy soup, a bit underseasoned (this can be a good thing if you need ot watch your sodium intake) but satisfying for only $1.75Two eggs with corn beef hash - Slightly crisp hash browns matched great with the corn beef hash which was served with slightly runny eggs. Surprisingly good texture and flavor combination.Steak plate - Good size steak which I got with fries. For $6.10 I can't complain as the steak was cooked exactly to order and juicy. The fries were nothing special but did go well with the steak.Chili and cheese omelette - Nice fluffy omelette, was not runny at all despite having some chili in it. Could hae smothered it with more chili but for the price, I can't complain.Chicken sandwich - Simple and fresh with nicely grilled chicken. For $4.60, there's really no reason to have a chicken sandwich as some fast food restaurant.This restaurant does exactly what you expect, good value diner food, well. A great place to stop by if you're in the area and need a quick meal.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/21/2013,6/18/2014,826,1108,13,16,17>No grilled cheese can compare to the enormous sandwiches we ate from Toasty Cheese last night.  The Chef's Choice, $9, is piled thick with duck bacon, provolone, arugula and cherry tomatoes.  When it comes to bacon, I can take it or leave it, but the duck bacon was thick-cut, flavorful and not super greasy.  My husband had the "Chicago's Best," ($12) which is the same as the Chef's Choice - but with TWELVE slices of duck bacon.We had dinner with my parents here, and they opted for the "build your own" grilled cheese sandwich option.  The options are endless if you go this route, and both of them really liked their sandwiches.  I also tried their loaded fries.  Sweet Jesus, those fries were no doubt loaded with cheese and bacon!  The portion is huge, so you'll need someone to share with.  I wasn't as impressed with the rosemary fries.  The flavor was nice, but they were a bit too oily and there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the container.Be ready to get messy.  I can be a bit finicky when I have to eat off of my lap and stuff is glopping onto my lap or into a napkin.  We chose to eat in our car (Toasty Cheese was at Solemn Oath on Friday night, and they looked pretty packed), and even though it was chilly outside, those ooey gooey sandwiches sure kept us warm.For $29 we had two sandwiches, fries, and two drinks.  I took half of my sandwich home and ate it for lunch the next day.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2014,6/17/2014,28,75,3,8,6>We were hungry. Our Pinot's Palette event will start at 6:30. It was already 6:05. The Sushi house was in the same building as the event so we went in there. We told the waitress that we needed to be  somewhere at 6:30. She already knew where we were going and said that would be no problemYvonne ordered the Sexy Mexican and another sushi roll that was supposed to be spicy. The service was very fast. Yvonne's guest ordered soup. The food was delivered. The Sexy Mexican was fabulous. It has a delicate crunch on the outside layer that was a pleasant surprise. It was delicious. The spicy one was not spicy, but it still had good flavor.I like my wasabi to blast up to my sinuses and make my ears glow red. The wasabi that was served with the rolls was very meek and mild, a disappointment. The ginger was flavorful and refreshing.We were seated, order taken, food delivered, eaten , paid for, and we were at Pinot's Palette at 6:30!! Great service and good food.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2014,6/16/2014,907,149,4,9,7>I have such luck when I am being impatient! I had a Tuesday night "need a massage or I will die" moment and the women I use currently don't work on Tuesdays so I went to my BFF Yelp and Eureka, found heaven. Apparently this salon has only been open about 6 months- I used to live in Carpentersville and didn't recall seeing this here previously. Anyway-- I scheduled with Julie who is an angel direct from heaven. Seriously. If you have read my reviews on massages before, I am needy/picky. I need someone that does DEEP TISSUE and isn't just fluffy "let me rub your back" kind of stuff. I also want someone that doesn't chat me up the whole time. Massage and then Hot Yoga time - those are the only times I really get to NOT TALK and so I appreciate the down time. Julie used to run the massage team at Bellagio in Vegas. She knows her stuff and she is not playing around when it comes to deep tissue. I almost proposed marriage to her professionally speaking. She is fantastic. In fact, I've already booked my next appointment. Please tell her Kelly O from Yelp sent ya, she'll hook you up. ;-)
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/30/2013,6/15/2014,51,217,6,8,5>Very very very good.  A little hidden away gem that is very aptly named.  I saw the reviews and thought to myself "Self, with this many good reviews it can't be bad"  and boy was I right.  It was in fact so not bad it was great.  Just walking in gave me hunger pangs.  It smelled delicious.  I don't know what it actually smelled like but it was heavenly.  When I got my take out home I was the furthest thing from disappointed.  I was prepared to not judge at first bite because I got take out and traveling doesn't always put food in the best light.  But there was no need to reserve judgement.  The pad thai was fantastic.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and spiced so very nice.  Actually, if you ask for it to be spicy it will be spicy.  I may have to hand in my man pants, but I needed to cut my spicy version with some of my wife's non-spicy pad thai.  Do yourself a favor and get some of this food. You will be joyous that you did... HAHAHAHA see what I did there?
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2014,6/14/2014,405,605,4,12,8>By far the best on Chicago's South side. I come over and over to this location because they are amazing with their food choices. From Japanese Sushi to Chinese and Thai. I love that they do have Thai food since many of the establishments in the area are Chinese. I also adore the fact that on a rainy day, they have an umbrella stand with umbrellas for your use. They do ask that you return the umbrella on your next visit, which I've done many times. This is by far one of the kindest things any restaurant can do and that is to be on the honor system with their patrons. What a wonderful idea. I do appreciate the fact also that the food always taste fresh and made right there. At times of course you have to wait for a table (that's how good it is). But while you wait, you can have a cocktail or two at their bar while you wait for your pager (they provide) to ring and let you know that your table is ready. Definitely one of the restaurants that I adore over and over and would always be a customer. The sushi station is really nice because they will make your sushi right in front of you, and the station holds about 20 people of course. If you have a big party they will also accommodate your party, although again like I said it may be a wait, that's okay. If you are in the neighborhood, by all means stop by and see what the big hoopla is about, this is one of the South Side places you defintely do not want to miss. Instead of the usual Mexican and Chinese joints, this place is by far one (if not) the best place ever. I am happy coming here over and over because this is one of those gems that doesn't dissappoint me in the least. See you at Chi Tung, and of course they have won many awards on their fine cooking.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/10/2013,6/13/2014,280,274,6,7,5>My wife's family has been coming here for years and I feel like I have to.

<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2014,6/12/2014,200,204,4,9,7>Happened to get out of work early today and was on my way home when I decided to stop in.  Heres a quick tip:  Don't listen to Google Maps.  Google will tell you it's *here* when it's actually about a mile north of there, on the other side of the street.  Thanks to Yelp for having the location spot on, but I digress....Being that I'm new to the whole vaping thing, I don't have much of a knowledge base to draw on as far as comparing Elixrz to other similar businesses, but based on the first experience I had today, I was very happy that I walked in.  Walking in with nearly zero prior knowledge as to the components of a vape, or personal vaporizer, I had a lot of questions, and Joe and Joe(Jr. and Sr.?) had a lot of answers, and they took the time to explain what makes certain models differ from others, how variable voltage changes the vapor profile of your vape, the compatibility of certain tanks and batteries, advanced vaping techniques i.e. dripping, etc., all the things you want to know as a new customer.  When choosing a first battery I narrowed it down to three and rather than upselling me on the most expensive one, they allowed me to choose which I liked and then went down the line with the pros and cons for each model, but ultimately allowed me to make my own decision for the battery and my tank.  This alone took me about 45 minutes to come to a decision, and then came the "hard part", according to the Joes, picking a flavor.  So I straddled a stool and perused the menu on the wall, which are categorized into tobacco, fruit, and alcohol flavors, and a sample tank for each is on the countertop.  Just so you know, when they hand you the tank and vape to sample, you grab a rubber mouthpiece cover out of the glass that says "New" on the counter and put that on so you don't have to share cooties with the last person who sampled that flavor.  I tried a lot of flavors, and many were very good.  One of the more interesting ones was the Bacon e-liquid.  I love bacon but I can't get down with the feeling that I'm inhaling bacon smoke coming off of a frying pan, because that's what that tastes like.  They do a good job with Horchata, with has a creamy profile with a cinnamon aftertaste...I tried more flavors than I can remember, but the Lion's Blood had that je ne sais quoi, literally I don't know what.  I mean I really don't know what it is, but Lion's Blood reminded me of something that I just can't put my finger on.So after 20 minutes of choosing my flavor, Joe(Jr.) showed me how to take it apart to charge the battery and how to fill the tank, and how not to fill the tank.  He then filled my tank with the liquid I just purchased and I was on my happy vaping way. Since Elixrz is conveniently located halfway between home and work, I have no doubt that I'll be coming in again.And again..And again...So many flavors, so little time....
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/27/2014,6/11/2014,64,296,6,10,9>I've been to the Verdict on multiple occasions, but I feel like it's time to update my previous (2009) review.I love breakfast foods, and the Verdict does have very good breakfast, but I had eggs earlier in the day, and since it was dinner time, I decided to go with their dinner fare, specifically a Grecian dish.After debating between a few things, I decided on the Slouvaki Chicken Platter. It comes with a choice of beef or chicken, and I went double bird. There's a picture of the dish on their menu, so I was swayed by that. The meal also comes with soup or small greek salad, their house rice, potato, veggies, a mini loaf of their homemade bread, and a complimentary dessert (jello, rice/chocolate/tapioca pudding, fruit, or ice cream. Since I was a to go order, the ice cream wasn't an option. Also, I ordered double veggies instead of the potato. I'm not quite sure if I got double veggies (no pic, sorry), but I did get rice and a serviing of veggies in my tray. As for my soup, I went with the roasted red pepper, which is a common soup in their rotation (check site for daily soups). For dessert, I opted for the chocolate pudding.I really want to give the Verdict a 5 star rating... Food and the prices are right, but there's always a small issue with my experience. This time, when going through our to go orders (there were just 2; a coworker and myself), they forgot my pudding! I was really looking forward to it too. As for the rest of my meal... YUM! The chicken kebobs were actually my least favorite part of the meal. They were good, but nothing really stood out. They were skewered with red onion and peppers, but the chicken really had no outstanding flavor. Besides the chicken, everything else was excellent. The yellow rice had a slight butter flavor and pieces of carrots in it. The veggies featured green beans, broccoli, and carrots. They weren't wilted at all which was very surprising! The homemade bread was super good. About as big as an italian beef roll, the light brown roll tasted amazing by itself, with butter, and in the red pepper soup. The soup was my favorite part of the meal. Not sure what exactly is in the soup, but I will definitely be ordering again. No chunky veggies and not too heavy; not sure if it was completely cream or broth based.In the end, I actually did call back and pick up my pudding. I was also given a complimentary eclair. The custard inside the eclair was amazing! All in all, the Verdict is a great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and I'm looking forward to my next visit.
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/26/2013,6/10/2014,160,525,5,8,9>I'm in love with this place. I have had this place bookmarked for at least a year. I'm just mad at myself for not coming here sooner. I don't honestly want to admit to what I ordered. I really didn't even want to order it. I probably shouldn't of eaten it all.I decided on the Maxwell street polish sausage, buffalo fries and a blue raspberry lemonade. Yum. Everything was so delicious. The buffalo fries are my new favorite thing. I actually wanted a regular lemonade but got so distracted by all the choices I ordered blue raspberry. I'll go with traditional next time. The staff was so sweet! I couldn't believe how nice everyone was. My food was ready in no time and they packed it all up neatly to-go. It survived my 30 minute drive home and was still nice and hot.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/8/2014,6/9/2014,101,127,6,9,6>Come for the movie, stay for the legroom. If movie theaters are like airplanes, AMC is coach and iPic is first class.  Star Cinema Grill is like business class. You get plenty of legroom, which is a huge deal for me and my long legs and my creaky knees.  Theres a full menu and a bar. When I came here I had a pineapple express (a delicious pinappley rum drink) and a chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The sandwich was wrong- had cheese on it when I asked for none, and the fries were freeeezing cold. I sent it back and they kind of fixed it. The fries were fresh and lovely, and the sandwich looked new until I flipped it over and saw where the breading was missing where they scraped the cheese off. It tasted alright though. I think when I come back I'll go for more classic movie theater fare.
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/4/2014,6/8/2014,151,298,5,6,4>OUT****ING STANDING!!!After reading Taffy G's recent review of Annie's Cucina, it has been on my radar for a few weeks.  So I popped in to get  a sandwich for lunch. Annie's Cucina is tucked away on Front Street in Mokena by the Metra station.  They have a menu on wall as you walk in.  I did not see your typical sandwiches and I was in the mood for a change.  I ordered the Carleton.  It has prosciutto, salami, mortadella, capicola and provolone.  It comes with LTO (lettuce, tomato and onion) and the house made dressing.  I added hot giardiniera to as well.  I brought the sandwich out to the car and it smelled so good, I had to take a look.  I open up the box and there it was----(chorus of angels sing)!  I wanted to take a pic but I could not wait.  I powered the Carleton down right in my car.  It was very good.  This was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  I also bought some of there home made giardiniera as well.  Its a family owned business and the owners were the ones preparing the food.  I like that.  I cannot wait to go back.
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2014,6/7/2014,230,78,6,9,6>I started a new job and took to Yelp to find my first lunch break destination. Blissful Banana Cafe was within 1.5 miles and its joy-filled name caught my attention.   I browsed pictures of food via Yelp and was happy with the sandwich options pictured by other Yelpsters. When I arrived I was happy as pie. The ambience reminded me of my University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana collegiate days at my favorite coffee bar Espresso Royale.  There was happy music, fresh coffee drinks and friendly employees who greeted me.The menu is refreshing. The perfect offerings for vegans, vegetarians & meat eaters alike.  I ordered the Idalia panini with an organic side salad and a soy iced latte with caramel.  My waitress asked if it was my first time and when I said yes she told me she'd bring me a sample of the banana bliss non-dairy/all banana ice cream dessert.  Free samples rock and this one was delicious.   About the panini, it appears they no longer offer one of this sandwich's meats for the Idalia (something about their ham shop burning down last summer) but you can get it with turkey. The waitress cued me in - but my panini was still delicious.While I waited for my food, my waitress checked in on me several times and a barista came around with a second free sample of a mocha white chocolate coffee drink. Super attentive staff!My experience was all around fabulous - A+ customer service, A+ food quality and A+ food taste.  I can't wait to go back!
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/18/2013,6/6/2014,234,114,6,10,8>Broosters is one of those rare finds that would remain tucked away unless you did some wide-eyed searching. I have to admit, even if I had seen the Lombard location, I don't think I would have given it a try; its THAT inconspicuous. BUT, I'm seriously happy I did.Even if you had decided to walk into the joint, I don't think you'd feel like it was going to produce some b-o-m-b chicken. Its appearance is THAT modest. BUT, the chicken is not.I think the first thing you should do at Broosters is order the whole or half chicken...whatever you feel like you can put away. The flavor is absolutely amazing. Add that charbroiled essence to the mix to seal the deal. What we have in the end is an incredibly moist piece of chicken that hits the spot where it counts.The mashed potato and coleslaw side dishes parallel that of KFC. Texas toast is included with  everything! **They have this salsa thats hidden in a white container that you MUST use...it changes everything!!**
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/10/2014,6/5/2014,31,104,8,11,8>I am by no means a sweets or pastry guy, rarely do I enter a bakery to buy anything other than bread but when I heard this place had "cronuts" something inside me forced me to go. Probably from all the hype and attention cronuts were getting in New York, I just had to try it. Its located on the side of a busy street and its pretty easy to get to. Here are my feelings of Dossant/Cronuts overall: its good. Even for me who doesn't like sweets very much, its pretty darn good. I can't really comment on the price because they are 2.50 each which is kinda pricey but I also heard people are paying like 20 bucks a piece in NYC so maybe its a good deal. They have like 6 flavors of Dossants. The Dossant overall is like a lighter, flakier doughnut with layers in it. There is creamy filling pumped unevenly in the sides but I didn't mind. Honestly I liked them but I don't get the hype. I bought a half dozen and ate 2. My mom had 1 and freaked out about how awesome it is. 3 more disappeared the next morning haha. I guess if you're a sweets person, this is gonna blow your mind and taste buds in a very sensual and maybe inappropriate way.. (See Picture)Btw I also sampled the "pizza" there which isn't really pizza, its bread with tomato on top. I didn't see any cheese or anything else. In the end, I can't complain. You'll have to try for yourself to understand. Its definitely worth a try if you're into pastries. GET ON THE BANDWAGON!
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2014,6/4/2014,92,360,1,16,8>My wife and I have been aching to try this place since it opened. Pizzeria da Nella is going to be our go-to place to have thin, Neapolitan-style pizza from now on. The bread course was three slices of bread, served with a lively, fruity olive oil. One of the servers wasn't used to the idea of having me pour the olive oil into a plate and covering it with parmesan cheese, which I thought was sort of funny. This was quite good.We decided to take a tour of the whole menu today, just to get an idea of the place. So we started with fried calamari, of course! This came out perfectly; the calamari was tender and the outer coating crisp. It was a bit difficult to get the tomato sauce to coat the breading, since it was a bit then, but I liked the freshness of the sauce nonetheless.The server took care to bring our baby's Nemo Pizza out at the same time, so she had something to eat. It's a cheese pizza shaped like a fish. She loved it, and since I'm assuming they used the same dough for her pizza as mine, I'm sure it tasted good. Speaking of which...I had a Mare & Monti pizza, which has mini shrimp and porcini mushrooms counted amongst its toppings. WOW. This is the closest I've been to Naples in a long, long time! The bottom crust was just-so floppy, while the outer crust had just enough chew but was still tender. The first bite was briny from the shrimp, and the porcini lent just a bit of earthy flavor, but mostly texture. The crust was wonderfully yeasty.Likewise, my wife's bufalina pizza had the same texture but took full advantage of the slightly chewy bufalina mozzarella on top of it.We left room for dessert, and opted for the Bacio, which is a homemade creampuff. Topped with hazelnut cream. Filled with hazelnut cream (and maybe nutella). And I think there were toasted hazelnuts throughout. My goodness, was this good.I have no idea - none - how this restaurant ended up on the corner of North and Schmale in Carol Stream, and not in downtown Wheaton or Glen Ellyn, or Elmhurst, or any other place within walking distance of other top-quality restaurants. (Their other location is in Lincoln Park, of all places!) This place is a fantastic treat, and I can't recommend it enough.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/29/2014,6/3/2014,239,635,16,21,21>We stopped in for a quick lunch.  Let me correct a bit of the info that is posted.  It is a very small, Paris type bistro.  What does that mean?  It is NOT good for groups.  If you had a large group, larger than 4, I cannot even envision where they would put you.  It is NOT good for kids.  The exception would be if you stopped in for some gelato which is in a case near the front door.The menu is on the small side with dinner specials that change frequently, but not on a daily basis.  We selected the Pomegranate Chicken Salad and the French Dip sandwich.  The sandwich was listed as being served with homemade chips and a petit seasonal salad.  The chips never appeared, but it was quite filling as it was served.  We had to pass on dessert, which is unfortunate, because all desserts are prepared on site.  We did stop to drool over the glass case where the desserts are showcased.We will return, they only accept reservations for 4.  It gets crowded, or so we were told.Go and enjoy and pretend you are back in Paris.
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,6/2/2014,66,166,5,8,7>Most people in food service (chefs or otherwise) probably know about Chefwear, because they're a company that sends out catalogs and offers tons of options for professional clothing for my field. I ordered from them a long time ago, when they were still based in Chicago. I knew they'd moved, but I had no idea they'd moved ALMOST RIGHT UP THE STREET FROM ME. :DThey have a corporate store on site, where you can go and try on any jacket your heart fancies before you buy it. If you're local, and you buy Chefwear gear, you owe it to yourself to go check this place out. Do it when you have more than a few minutes, because whatever they don't have on the floor can be pulled from inventory in the warehouse so you can try it on. You read that correctly. You can try on anything you want from their catalog. This is great news, because every style of chef coat fits differently -- and it's especially great news if you're a female chef (and therefore, by definition, have a bit more difficulty finding satisfactory coats that look good and don't make you look like a marshmallow). While it's true that you can go get jackets and such at Schweppe, this beats that hands down -- you seriously have access to Chefwear's ENTIRE CATALOG. Well, as long as they have it in stock at the time. Any color and style you want are yours to try and buy. Also, the lady at the front desk, Cindy, was super helpful in guiding me toward styles and prices that she thought I would like. I wish there were more locations, so my fellow professionals could all have such a great experience in finding good chef gear! :)
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2014,6/1/2014,1096,1134,7,9,7>What a blast! We sat at the bar for a drink. I asked for a tall Jack sour and they must have run out of sour mix because my drink was a dark chestnut color. They have a heavy pour and the prices are incredibly reasonable. We were seated promptly at our reservation time. We were politely greeted by our server Alex. None of us had ever been here before, so she explained what was going on for those of us who were paying attention. We grabbed a plate and hit the buffet. If you are into meat, then skip this part. We ordered a bottle of wine and more martini's. Once we flipped over the cards to let the servers know we wanted meat. It was a free for all. I felt like Julie Andrews in Victor/Victoria when the waiter kept bringing her more food as she was chowing down. The rest of the table came up for air. Not me! My fork was red hot and I wasn't going to let it cool down. The offerings were 16 different cuts of meat. Once I sampled everything. I stuck with the beef and the servers knew it. They were plopping chunks of meat on my plate without even cutting them. I had a wonderful time. It was a meat amusement park and you get to eat the rides!
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2014,5/31/2014,119,299,5,8,6>This is a very cozy place. Looks more like a cafe than a Taco place. The lobby is clean with the contemporary decoration. I was on the way to see my Dr. and found this place from yelp app. This place is not easy to find in this shopping mall. In the end, I found the Payless store first then see this Taco Diner.You will need to order the food at the counter first which is in the back. I know my favorite taco is fish taco. So I quickly decided on the two fish tacos, one steak taco, and rice water (wanted Jamaica but they don't have). The complimentary chips and salsa were great. The tacos came pretty quickly. I loved the fish tacos. The fillet was grilled to a nice brown color without breading and seasoned just right. My favorite type of fish taco. The steak one was pretty good but a bit greasy for me. I actually mentioned this place to the nurse during my appointment. She actually knew this place and said the fish taco was the best. I am just glad to find another awesome place for fish tacos.
<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2013,5/30/2014,124,515,5,14,10>If you break your phone screen, wet your phone or are in need of any computer repairs or phone accessories,  you'll love Fix that for you. My iPhone 4 got wet (which is a story for another day) and I brought it in for fixin'. While my phone was not able to be repaired, I found them to offer great pricing and helpful tips should it happen again. I was quoted a price of $30 bucks if the phone could be turned on/repaired. If it cannot be fixed, there's no charge. Here's the free advice I was given, if your phone gets wet, power it off immediately and leave it off for at least 24 hours. Try soaking it in a bag of rice too and using a dryer to get the water out.  While it may not work, leaving it on will definitely short it out.
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/2/2014,5/29/2014,187,236,4,15,4>After reading an article in the local newspaper, the Landmark, about a new diner that opened up in Brookfield earlier this month, I knew I had to stop by for a visit. Even though I could not find the menu anywhere online and the only place I've been able to find the restaurant's hours was in the newspaper article, I decided to drop by for breakfast. (For the record, the hours are 6 AM-3PM 7 days a week.) We were seated right away by Mary herself and our waitress took great care of us, even if she was a bit busy. I ordered the hobo skillet, which consisted of hash browns, eggs, and cheese (cheddar or American) with a choice of either toast or pancakes (I chose pancakes). For just under $6, this was a bargain! The serving size was generous and I had more than enough to bring home as leftovers. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, as were the eggs. I was also pleased that there was the perfect amount of cheese--just enough to get that great taste and consistency, but not enough to clog your arteries.Mary's Morning Mixup is more about the food, though. The atmosphere was homey and inclusive, decked out in cute Valentine's Day decorations (included heart-shaped doilies on the tray with the syrup and powdered sugar). The energy was positive and the staff were very welcoming. Dining here almost felt like we were being welcomed into a family!My only suggestions are to accept credit cards as a form of payment and to hire more waitstaff. Our delightfully friendly waitress was spread a bit too thin among all the tables, which led to a slight lapse in service (in terms of wait time). Of course, MMM is brand spanking new and kinks such as these can be forgiven.If I ever happen to have cash on me and I'm in the mood for some filling and affordable classic diner food, I'll be happy to swing by Mary's Morning Mixup (and you should, too!).
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2013,5/28/2014,73,240,3,5,3>Girls Night Out with my cousins a few weeks ago on a quiet Wednesday night.  It'd been a while since we'd gone out and we were looking forward to catching up.Anna Shea's provided the perfect intimate setting for us to talk, while having some of the most wonderfully pretty and delicious treats.  We indulged in each other's company and in Anna Shea's dessert this night.Parking is a breeze, plenty of space in the adjoining lots.  They have a nice corner location in the Arboretum.  The front of Anna Shea's is the chocolate shop and the lounge is in the adjoining room.  I took it all in my first time here this night.  Spent extra time perusing the chocolates and confections, asking for recommendations and descriptions from the staff.  I had noticed the Princess Tea on the menu and figured it would be something I might enjoy with my daughter, and when the staff showed us the exact tea set and tiaras, I was sold on coming back w/my 6-year-old for Mommy/Daughter time.We debated on fondue or one of the plates, but I went with the English Toffee Chocolate Based Coffee...wow.  It was like drinking smooth melted (but not overly rich) chocolate.  I asked for sugar-free Toffee but it tasted just like the real thing...as if they'd melted toffee into the coffee.  I complimented my order with a salted caramel macaron, a maple bacon chocolate, and a bacon caramel chocolate.  I've been on the search for the perfect macarons in Chicago, and this one at Anna Shea's came pretty close.  The caramel was the right salty/sweet and the shell was delicate but not crumbling.  The bacon chocolates were so good (and rich w/bacon bits and flavor), that I wanted to go back for more, but I held myself back.My cousins also all had varieties of the chocolates, and cupcakes.  Everyone was pleased.The lounge was just so inviting, pretty, cozy and perfect.  The fireplace kept us warm on the cold night...we were fortunate to get the couch directly in front of the fire.  There are also tables/chairs around the sofas/couches for those who prefer traditional seating.It's expensive, but definitely worth it to treat yourself to.  So much more I'm going to have to come back for - gelato, bon bons, other chocolates, wine...We closed out the place...we actually stayed a little past closing time, but the staff were so kind in letting us know.  We felt terrible for staying over, but they were so gracious about it.  Staff was fantastic all around.We've decided to make this one of our go-to Girl's Night Out spots from now on...but I also can't wait to come back just because as well.
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/27/2013,5/27/2014,371,418,6,7,8>MY 400th Yelp Review!!!! I cant speak highly enough of this company. I used them to rent tables, chairs and linens for my Labor Day Weekend 2013 wedding reception, in Naperville, IL.  Everything was completely seamless, easy and affordable. The staff seems to be pretty low energy/chill and at first I was worried that they sounded so aloof that they might not care enough to make shit right. But even after I changed my order 3 times, they still got everything done. The pick up and delivery was on time and exactly as described - and the prices were unbeatable - and trust me, I shopped around, I'm telling you - this company is MUCH cheaper than any other suburban rental company. I will be using them again in June 2014 for another huge party I am having. ...and any subsequent parties I throw....one more thing - if you're contemplating getting linens or not - get the linens!!! The tables are BEAT UP, you need to cover them, unless you want your guests eating on scratched up nasty tables. I mean the tables are STRONG but they are not pretty.... The linens are nice and affordable and make the tables look fantastic. ...it should be mentioned that the girl on the phone fully disclosed the quality of the tables to me.
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2013,5/26/2014,56,172,4,7,5>Al & Joes is the kind of place that you're unlikely to find unless you're looking for it. That's a shame because the sandwiches here are pretty amazing. You'll find it in the shadow of the Mannheim bridge over the railroad tracks, which in turn is spanned by the Tri-State. This makes it a little confusing for the uninitiated, but the destination is definitely worth the journey.I came to Al & Joes for the subs. The Original Italian has a great reputation, but I like it a little spicier, so I opted for the Herbie, which comes with top notch capicola, pepperoni, salami and sharp provolone. One thing is certain - you will not be shortchanged on the toppings at Al & Joe's.If you're craving an amazing sandwich and are ten or fifteen minutes from Franklin Park, you should immediately plug the coordinates into your GPS, grab a trusted friend to act as a navigator, or do whatever is necessary to get to Al & Joe's for some great food.
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/18/2014,5/25/2014,52,231,2,10,5>50 yrs and counting. I've been coming here since I was a small kid. Good for young and old, not just old!The food is solid yummy and the beer selection quite nice. It's a slice of the wonderful neighborhood Cicero Berwyn once was.The chicken soup is really good with twisty noddles, chucks of carrot and chicken. Warming on a cold winter day.The Liver dumpling soup is insanely popular but honestly, who eats the poison filtering organ of the body? I guess older people who lived during the depression, I won't touch it, but everyone I know over 60 loves it here.The meatloaf is good, with a rich brown sauce and the beef with dill sauce is a touch of czechgoodness in your belly.The sourkraut is excellent- with the required caraway seeds and touch of onion. So good, I get a double helping when I come and skip the dumplings. You can get 2 kinds of dumpling though- bread or the thicker potato.Everything is so large, you can get 2-3 meals out of it and most meals come with soup and dessert- you cannot go wrong for the price.Don't park next door in the lot for the jeweler - they will tow!
<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2014,5/24/2014,107,169,3,5,4>What another great Corepower location!   Different than the one in Hinsdale, but quite charming in its own right.Located on the 2nd floor of Springbrook Prairie at 75th and Rte 59, the location is decent if you are coming from anywhere in Naperville, as well as Aurora and Plainfield.Things I like about this particular studio: high ceilings.  I'm 6'5, and when I do my mountain poses I don't want my hands going through the ceiling :) Fireplace in the big studio.  I love this ~ it's an awesome prop to focus your drishti on.  Also a nice benefit when doing hot yoga.  This studio also has a variety of props you can use to assist your practice.  Locker room (the guys one, anyway) is large and clean, lots of room to keep to yourself.  The teachers are awesome (like every other CorePower), and the students are very respectful of one another.Downsides: none that were glaring.  Some lightbulbs in the locker room were burned out.  Saving some energy is not always a bad thing....5 stars :)
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2014,5/23/2014,46,197,4,13,6>For me, the only thing that could have made our stays at Inn at Water's Edge any better was if the hotel were located in Paris or Brussels or California wine country. It's a boutique hotel stay at a budget motor lodge price. We have stayed at Inn at Water's Edge twice, both times in a queen room. Each time our room was spacious and spotless. Furniture and fixtures are of clean modern lines, natural tones, and variations in texture: espresso, sandstone, ivory, black, silver, leather, metal, tweed, travertine, glass. Our rooms included not only a desk and upholstered chair, but also a sofa and two leather ottomans/tables.  In some hotels the mere addition of the sofa/seating area would designate the room as a suite and bump up the cost significantly. WiFi and cable TV were available, of course. The large, well-appointed bathroom featured a generously-sized travertine walk-in shower and had the quietest toilet I've ever encountered. The furnishings are upscale and modern. I was smitten with the locally handcrafted organic French lavender & chamomile  bar soap. The shampoo and conditioner were an eco-friendly line from Gilchrist & Soames, a provider of toiletries to upscale and luxury hotels worldwide.All rooms are located on the upper floor of the Culinary & Hospitality Center -- accessible by key only -- and have floor to ceiling windows overlooking the lake next to The Mac. The view during our July stay was especially lovely as there were "islands" of flowers in bloom in the water. We had the surprising pleasure of watching a Great Blue Heron land and fish from one of the flower islands!Our November stay was more exciting than we bargained for. Our check out day happened to be the day of the tornado outbreak. I can assure you Inn at Water's Edge (& Waterleaf) have plans & procedures in place for your safety. Twice we were summoned by the alarm to ride out the threat on the first floor of the CHC. Glen Ellyn was, fortunately, spared that day. Many towns downstate were not so fortunate.One of my favorite parts of staying at the Inn is breakfast. There's an intimate lounge on the west end of the floor where the rooms are. You'll be treated to a continental breakfast plus. There is espresso, coffee, and a selection of teas. There is an assortment of fruit and pastries. There is housemade granola. But the most wonderful part of breakfast is the housemade yogurt. You have never had yogurt this good! In fact, I would book a room just so I can have the yogurt. With a bit of honey and some granola or fruit ... heaven!I can't praise the staff at the Inn enough. I've not encountered a more professional or friendly staff at any other hotel in any price range.They make you feel welcome. They make you feel special. They make you feel like you're getting away from it all even if, like us, you're a mere 5 miles from home.Fully and highly recommended.

That's exactly what I felt the minute I stepped into this new Cafe, located just two doors north of the old Roxy theater in the heart of the Downtown Historical District.The sandwich board out in front heralded different menu specials of the day, but my visit was for coffee, pure and simple. I was greeted with a friendly "Hello" from the young man behind the counter as I made my way to the counter, and then asked what he could get for me. I told him and much to my surprise, he brewed my cup as I waited...nothing's just "warmed up" here. It just doesn't get better than that.This shop has kind of a Soho ambiance to it that I hope will catch on throughout the businesses nearby. The Olde Town Cafe is a breath of fresh air on State St, that much is for sure.  Let's spread the love!
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2013,5/21/2014,135,187,1,11,6>I've always been a fan of the arboretum.  I first started coming here on field trips 15 years ago.  I enjoyed it then(mostly because it was a day away from classrooms) and I enjoy it now.A group of us went last night to see Illumination.  Absolutely amazing.  The weather was 25 and constant snow.  It was a winter wonderland.  Within a mile walk you will see lights(obviously) and trees(duh).   But you can interact with the trees.  You can sing to trees, hug trees, see your image on trees, all while the trees react directly with your voice, your embrace, or your image.  And much more.  The light shows are stunning.  The trail to see all of this has a few fire fixtures so you can get toasty warm in between sights.  There's also tents that serve hot beverages, sell glowing items, and for $5 they'll give you the stuff to make s'mores.  All this goes on pretty close to the visitors center and there were quite a few staff members along the way directing people, answering questions, and assisting in taking group photos.I only have a couple tips which are pretty obvious for the weather in this area.  Bundle up, layer layer layer.  We all had layers, kids in snow suits.  But after the 45minutes it took to see it all and take pictures, a couple of us grown ups were pretty stiff.  Go while it's snowing if you can, it really adds to the light shows!  If you go while it's snowing and plan on taking pictures, use a ziplock bag or a waterproof camera bag.  So that's my glowing review.  This is a must see.  It's great for the holiday season.  Everyone in our group ages 2-51 years had a fantastic time.
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/12/2014,5/20/2014,75,174,4,6,5>Not sure why I came here on one of the coldest days in history, but it was worth the trek. It was also busy on a day when the weather is so bad, so it really is a testament to their great food/service. Get the king of the hill omelette, which is pretty much breakfast's version of a supreme pizza, frittata style. The potatoes were not starchy at all and flavors integrated very well. Throw on some hot sauce and you got yourself a breakfast feast. Great service, great coffee, great food. I'm not sure if I had a really tall waitress, or the seats were really low. Either way, my neck was slightly strained from looking up to her while chatting with her.
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2014,5/19/2014,62,147,6,12,10>I accidentally came across DMK on Yelp and I couldn't be more grateful for this blessing in disguise. Yes, I think DMK is THAT good! I loved it before I even met it, when I read through every line of the menu on their website. I couldn't help but be intrigued by the concoctions that are the burgers all across their menu. With ingredients like charred balsamic red onions, bread & butter pickles, and blueberry BBQ sauce...!?!? I had to get my mouth on these.We started off with two orders of fries: the Wisconsin cheddar & scallion fries, and the sweet potato fries with lemon tobasco aioli. My favorite of the two being the Wisconsin cheddar & scallion fries, it had a nice sweet, full taste to it. The sweet potato ones were just as good in their own right, but were a little dry. Still worth the taste either way. Next time I think I'll try out the Amish blue & smoked bacon! MMMM!Now for the burgers, I went with the Bison Burger--Fresh Goat Cheese, Pickled Red Onions, Blueberry BBQ Sauce... I absolutely HAD to try the blueberry BBQ sauce. The waitress kindly explained to me that it was pretty much just BBQ sauce that they made from blueberries....!!! It had a subtle sweet, smoky flavor, nothing TOO off from regular BBQ sauce but I still loved the idea of it. It paired well with the pickled red onions and goat cheese. Loved every bite.My friend went with the Chorizo, Guacamole, Sonoma Jack, Chipotle Aioli, Cilantro, Onions burger... essentially a Mexican-style burger, which was phenomenal itself. A little spicy for those who aren't into much spice, but I love it and enjoyed the few bites my friend let me have.They have a really decent beer menu as well, full of the familiar Two Brothers' IPA's/ales, as well as many other small brewery beers... plenty to try there.The service was great as well. The waitress was very friendly, suggestive, and joked back with us when we threw out jokes to her, which was fun.There is also a relatively good-sized bar area in the front by the entrance.I 100% plan on returning to try and review more menu items. Please stop in and try this place if you're in the area!
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2013,5/18/2014,63,74,13,16,12>Yes, we're still loving Pie Boss pies. I've got 10 more frozen pies in my freezer (6 spinach and feta, 3 beef pasty, 1 sausage), waiting to be liberated from their chilly slumber, and tossed down the family gullet. (That didn't come out quite right, but whatever.)  So yeah, instead of a side of beef in my freezer, I've got South African hand pies. Because that's how we roll in Des Plaines - "City of Destiny."So go eat your's fresh out of the display case. There's not a lot of ambiance in the dining area, so your car will also do nicely. Unless you really love large maps of the world and enjoy talking to people from other countries (which I do).  My favorite way to eat the pies is tucked into a napkin by hand. They are not like those weak mostly liquidy pot pies you're used to. So don't be afraid of them pouring out all over your lap. These are hearty dense pies built by a couple brothers, and suitable for a man's appetite (after doing hearty man-work, like logging or telephone pole tossing or polishing your rims). You'll want to eat two, maybe three (if your rims were particularly dirty). Your dainty lady-friend will claim she only wants to try 1/2 of one with a house salad. Try not to smirk and roll your eyes, because everyone knows they don't sell salads! Because, what's the point of a salad, when you can bake veggies into a savory pie? Buy her 2-3 varieties, so you get the extras. That's called tactical dining.  You're welcome.If you're a lady who can relate to said tactical dining, hoorah! And please adjust above genders according to your personal predilections.If you're a man and a huge fan of crisp vegetables, not cooked into pie form...just stop OK? Cause I don't want you reading this review anymore.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2014,5/17/2014,196,166,1,10,6>Me encanta este lugar! (I love this place!)Went for dinner on a Wednesday night around 7pm and I'd say at least half the tables were occupied, so pretty good sign considering it's the middle of the week. The decor is adorable and really a sight! Huge sombrero & tequila bottle on the walls, awesome paintings/graphics, very clean space, and great food & drinks! While walking to our table, another had a cart beside it filled with ingredients: fresh table-side guacamole! We ordered it and it was really good, chunky guac. You can customize to put how ever much or little you want of each ingredient.We ordered a margarita with ginger and, I believe, peach. I could smell the ginger; very gingery & refreshing. Also got the sangria roja (red sangria), also really good. Also tried the classic margarita with salt rim; yummm. Our server brought out tortilla chips with a dark purpleish/black salsa and it was amazing! I loved it. A bit spicy, but not too much. I have no idea why it was the color it was, but so good, I meant to ask if I could buy a jar of it! We had to have seconds. I asked our server which Mole sauce she liked best or which one was most popular and she brought out four of them for us to try. OMG. I love them all. They are so interesting in flavor, especially that chocolate, nutty one, the Poblano. The story behind it is interesting, too. Legend says that a nun had to prepare a meal for an archbishop. She emptied her cupboards and mixed a bunch of ingredients to obtain unique flavors. I ended up ordering the Mole Poblano (chocolate one) with Arrachera (skirt steak.) The meat was cooked to my liking & good quality. I still had the sample Mole sauces and used them all with the steak, along with some of the guacamole. Also got to try the Arrachera Chihuahua with mushrooms, peppers & melted cheese. All so good! Black beans came in a cute edible tortilla dish. I was too stuffed for dessert, but want to go back & try the apple empanada, a special (especially since the last one I had was from Taco Bell & literally had no apples in it and was probably 95% hollow) and the Pastel de Chocolate Abuelita (flourless chocolate cake) and the Crepas con Cajeta (crepes with plantains) and the Capirotada (bread pudding,) basically everything.We definitely want to return, especially since my beau loves margaritas and drinks them weekly. Our server was great and we had a very pleasant experience. =)

Delicious noms eclipse personal development and a sense of accomplishment any day.I stumbled into this shop during a tour with Naperville Sites and Bites. While I knew this place existed, I've never stopped in, mostly because Fat Kelly is still in here somewhere waiting for an opportunity to escape.  On the tour, we tasted vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate chip cookie dough, but you have your choice of 24 ice cream flavors and eight cookie doughs. You can also get a cookie dough sandwich, which is your choice of cookie dough flavor nestled in between two house-made cookies of your choosing. Next marathon, I know what my victory treat will be.Anywho, it was love at first bite. The ice cream was practically silk in my mouth, and the cookie dough was everything I had hoped it would be. So rich, so creamy, so impossible to leave anything behind. This is a combo only Americans could dream up, and for that, I am proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free (to eat ridiculously fattening, amazing concoctions).
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2013,5/15/2014,31,287,3,7,5>Truth: over 6,000 children die everyday from hunger. In Djibouti, children are being fed mud cakes since they have no food. Within a few minutes of watching the orientation video, I was in tears at Feed My Starving Children (FMSC). Truth: you can make a difference by dedicating some free time. In two hours, our group provided food for 37 children in Djibouti, Africa that will last them a whole year. Whether your young and able or senior and retired, there is plenty of work for everyone regardless of your age or ability. Truth: a meal only costs 25 cents to make for FMSC. If you don't have time, you can make a donation. You can also sponsor a child by making monthly contributions where your money will go towards food, clothing, medicine, and education for organizations such as Compassion. May the Lord bless the children who are in need and the staff at FMSC.

<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/3/2013,5/13/2014,25,49,6,8,8>It's a great little find tucked away in the corner of a strip mall. You can see the blizzard of colors inside from the parking lot, it's like peering into a box of fruity pebbles. Inside, the only thing they don't have is a square inch not covered by something. Bins and boxes, old action figures, play sets, Star Wars figures both carded and loose . I had (still have) a pretty decent Star Wars collection. There were figures I didn't even know existed. I walked around saying " I had that! I had that!" My wife and I bought an old fisher price boat, about 10" little people" to go with it for our 5 year old, a few record albums and a comic book, spent $40, but worth it. It's very close to my work, I will have to be careful or ill go broke. One thing to keep in mind, these are used items, some in pristine shape, some beat up. It looks like it mostly comes in right from people's garages or basements and goes right on the shelf. Please don't expect clean, polished items. Those aren't fun anyway!
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2014,5/12/2014,180,52,6,7,7>Another great find from the Yelp-vine!This is by far, the best sushi restaurant in the burbs. I was surprised by the location. We always drive by this place and we didn't even know it exists! When we came in at 8p, we were seated right away. I was glad there wasn't a lot of people.Service: our servers were very attentive but not suffocating.  Our glasses were never empty and they move quick lol!Food: Everything we ordered were sooo good! I love all the free stuff we got: salad, miso, sample for that night (we got jalapeno bbq), steamed egg, and red bean ice cream. We ordered an appetizer, sushi combo, and 2 entrees. The Nikko sampler consisted of shumai, tofu steak, and gyoza. My favorite was the tofu steak - the outside was a little crunchy and the inside was soft and flavorful. The jap chae (korean noodles) was amazing as well. I've tried other korean restaurant's jap chae and Nikko's was the best for me. Lots of meat with adequate spinach and carrots. The noodles were perfect! We also had BBQ short ribs; it wasn't as sweet and tender as I would have liked but still great. My husband ordered the Nikko special combo. I forgot what it consists of. I wasn't too impressed with it though so I'm gonna have to try some other rolls. The red bean ice cream was a great sweet ending! I'm gonna have to order a big bowl next time!We'll definitely be back!!!

The Blue Goose and after I parked my car, what have they got going in front of the store but a BBQ!I like when super markets test my comfort zone, I like when I don't know what to expect in every aisle. The place is huge! And, unless my eyeballs were tired, every item in the produce section was huge!Some of their fresh made deli looked delish; and what a nice group of employees. Moderate prices for what I stocked up on; and a nice location, too! Stop in at the fresh baked items; the blueberry popovers got snapped up by me, as an aside. I have to say I'm a fan of the Blue Goose!
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2013,5/10/2014,68,127,1,6,4>What a hidden gem!  My husband and I have been lamenting over the wonderful sushi spots we used to visit when I lived in the city... until now.  This place is very unassuming - it's near a Disc Replay and Best Buy for crying out loud.  BUT it so much better than any other suburban sushi place my husband and I have tried yet.  (cough.. cough... RA..)You can tell that they really have fun with their menu and yet still certainly know how to cater to their audience.  We got the Pink Lady, which comes in a martini glass with a LED light that changes colors, the tuna and avocado roll, and the spicy crab roll.  The presentation was fun and professional.  There isn't anything too crazy on the menu - mostly shrimp, crab, lobster, and eel - but they really don't let you down with how many combinations are on the menu.I think we've officially found our new sushi place!
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/22/2013,5/9/2014,160,353,4,9,7>The last time we went to Chef Ping was a number of years ago we went there for a party. We remember the food was really good so when my son and I were thinking about where to go, Chef Ping came to mind. It's located on the edge of Rolling Meadows and Schaumburg at just east of Algonquin and Wilke. For us, it's pretty convenient and we've talked about going back there for a long time. There is a very diverse clientele there which typically means to me that it satisfies a wide variety of people. The restaurant itself if very modern looking. But, the layout still reminds me of the Baker's Square Restaurant that used to inhabit the space. They have done a really nice job of redecorating, though,  and making the feel much more exotic.Service was a little slow, but the server was quite pleasant. Since the menu is more exotic than most of the Chinese restaurants in the area, we asked lots of questions. She was very patient with us and asked as many questions about what we liked as we asked of her. We settled on an order of steamed pot stickers for an appetizer followed by "Chef Ping Noodles" and an order of twice cooked pork.The pot stickers were fresh - served in the steamer and were served with the traditional pot sticker sauce and chili sauce. The added spiciness added a lot. While I would classify the twice cooked pork as average, the noodles were outstanding. We later learned that the original chef from Yu's Mandarin in Schaumburg, the one who made them famous for their hand stretched noodles, was at Chef Pings now. There was a wide variety of vegetables, pork and a number of kinds of shellfish with the noodles. It really was garlicky and scrumptious.Our meal ended up with the traditional fortune cookie. Interestingly, my son and I both had the same fortune - it was something about not having to worry about the future. That was a nice way to end the meal.
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/7/2014,5/8/2014,79,174,9,11,10>Never knew how many donuts I could eat in one sitting prior to checking out Sweet Mornings. I'm not proud of this, but you know, as the kids say, yolo.To be fair, this is your fault, yelp. I was perusing for suburban donut meccas one boring Saturday morning and had all but given up on the idea that something in the suburbs could be zany, unusual, and trendy. Then finally, I saw glimmers of hope. Amidst the reviews of boring, traditional, ye olde dunkin shoppes, I saw words like Nutella pretzel, salted caramel, and s'mores donut. I literally got up, got dressed (just kidding, I went in pajamas. I'm already buying a dozen donuts solo, the veneer of dignity is past me) and headed for Carol Stream.Mind you, the place isn't cute. I drove past it twice on accident. It's dim and teeny tiny, and I'm shocked people dine IN the space. But I didn't mind. I was there for one thing - donuts. A charming (approximately) 15 year old gentleman helped me pick out my selections and seriously, I had to have 12 to try all the flavors I wanted. Red velvet?! Pumpkin?! Cream cheese frosting?! STOP IT. I actually don't remember how much that dozen cost, I was so freakin excited - but it couldn't have been that much, because I wasn't shocked or anything.I waited till I got home to try one, but the car smelled so amazing, it was a struggle. When I FINALLY tried one - an enormous bite of the red velvet flavor - I was in heaven. Soft, sort of chewy, sort of crisp-edged, flavorful heaven. The frosting on each one is generous and complimentary, and the flavors are ACTUALLY dead on - the hubs knew the flavor of each one he (was allowed to) try without asking. I want to go back ASAP, but have thus far resisted - only because no one needs to sit in their pajamas pawing anxiously through a box of donuts with any sort of frequency. Yolo or not.

Well, I think they might need to change that to "save money by getting takeout from Kong Ming Express instead of trying to cook for yourself." My family of four ate two full meals and two of us also had lunch from one $35 takeout order from here. Typically, I do not sing the praises of large portion sizes. In many cases, restaurants make up for lack of quality with lots of quantity, but this was both yummy and bounteous. Our favorites from our order included the Beef with String Bean and the Broccoli with Spicy Garlic Sauce (spicy!). The Singapore Noodles were also pretty good, and our youngest ate up the (free with $35 order!) Orange Chicken. We'd order any of those again. We'll skip the Vegetable Lo Mein next time just to have the opportunity to find another home run. Also - veggie egg rolls were not the best. We'll try a different side next time.Overall, good stuff!

They have a special in February 2014 for Will & Cook county residents:FEMALE CATS $20.00 MALE CATS $10.00FEMALE DOGS $50.00 MALE DOGS $50.00PITBULLS $20.00Limit 2 per household.  All surgeries includes pain medications to go home. If your pet weighs over 75 pounds additional charges may apply.The Feral/barn Cat Program is $40.00 per cat in Lisle and includes the anesthesia, spay/neuter, rabies vaccine, ear tip and pain medication.LOCATION: In a strip mall next to Groomingdales.  The sign says "Vet Clinic"

It's rough these days attempting to find a place that offers everything you want for a reasonable price!  We shopped around a LOT!  Most places that fell within the "banquet hall" category were outrageously priced for a dinner / drinks package.  Other places that were more along the lines of "thrifty hall" locations were cheap yet required a lot of work on the part of the renter.  Royalty West was more than we could ever have asked for!We had a Renaissance Faire themed wedding.  We made almost everything that was incorporated into the event as well (even our outfits and those that were worn by our party and family).  Unfortunately, due to the rains in the Chicago area we were canceled out of our outside ceremony site and left for the reception hall early.Royalty West was so accommodating it was absolutely amazing! While the finished preparing our meal we had our ceremony on the dance floor.  The ladies who assisted with setting up our event even poked their heads in to watch which was fine with us!  Dinner was to die for!  It far exceeded our tasting and our expectations!  We had the Chicken & Rice soup and Potato salad to start.  We moved on to our Family Style entrees which included Chicken Devoli, Roast Beef in Mushroom Gravy, and Veal Meatballs with Rice & Dill Sauce.  Our sides included Roasted Garlic Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Potato Dumplings.  There wasn't one complaint about the food!  People were cleaning their plates!The servers and bartenders were absolute delights!  One bartender knew that there was only one thing on the menu that I could have.  He also knew I was the bride and was prepared without me saying a word to him every time I came near the bar!  Even if I was talking to someone I would turn around to a full drink!  When I politely asked that our head table be broken down for the band to begin *pow* It was gone!People have been telling us that it's the best wedding that they have ever been to and I realize that is mostly due to our planning... Some of that goes to Royalty West though!  They were absolutely great hosts and so reasonably priced that we couldn't imagine having our wedding anywhere else!  Even the dozen or so crashers from upstairs had a better time at our wedding than the one they were at! ;D
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/18/2013,5/3/2014,118,202,5,6,5>As the French would say - I am le impressed.Franks you are awesome!  Keep doing what you do!The SO and I stopped in with a friend since I had been wanting some exotic dogs/meats.  The restaurant is a little hard to spot (keep heading south at the Binny's) but has easily accessible parking and is nice inside.  The menu is big, but not too big and well laid out.  There is tasty & free bacon popcorn (not sure if its bacon grease to replace the oil, bacon salt, or what) to enjoy while you wait.I ordered one of the day's specials - the bacon bomb burger - and an order of truffle fries.  This burger is a monster... of deliciousness.  It played out like 2 burger patties with bacon and jalapeno sandwiched in between, formed together into 1 patty, battered, and deep fried.  The fix'ins were simple (lettuce, tomato, onion, and possibly a special sauce?) but the flavor and fill was GIGANTIC.  As a big eater this thing could have filled me up and I wasn't over-it 2/3 of the way through like some foods in this category of healthiness.  I definitely wanted every last bite!  They did erase it from the menu after my order, so I'm not sure if its a pain to make or maybe there is some pre-fab that has to be done.The truffle fries on the other hand - good fries, good cheese, but compared to some other's I've had / made recently something was missing (and unfortunately I think it was most of the truffle-y-ness).  I'm not sure if they are just fried in truffle oil or how they are prepared, but the truffle flavor doesn't exactly burst through.  I didn't see any typical bits of black truffle fungus floating around, but at home we make it with truffle cheese.  Good fries for sure, but not a must-have at this time.I was also able to try the SO's dog which had mac 'n cheese and tomato.  A bit on the simpler side, but it was still tasty and well prepared.  I tried my friend's duck poutine fries and they were great.About our friend's order though - it got lost in the mix somehow.  When they realized the mistake they offered him some free fare, so knowing that he was already stuffed to the brim and we wanted to try a shake he got us a peanut butter, banana, and bacon shake.  The food and the shake were out in quick order.  The flavor in the shake was good, but the pieces of bacon were a bit too hard to "chew".  I'd soften them up a little bit - I'm not sure if this was too-cooked or too-frozen.Overall despite a couple of very small misses Frank's Night Out was both delicious and filling and satisfied my exotic dog cravings.I can't wait to come back!
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/4/2013,5/2/2014,73,90,2,6,4>$5 craft draft list is all u need to know yo!i've been coming here for years. After a few remodels, they really got it down. Their Nachos are pretty good. On Tuesdays they have free soup! the beer list changes regularly! my suggestion. go here on a weekday for some quality beers. Then go back on the weekend with friends and have a great time including a PBR tallboy and a shot of Malort for $5!. its a really social place with a lot of Brookfield young adults ;)  they got pool tables, video gambling and 2 pinball machines that usually rotate often.
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2013,5/1/2014,47,68,8,7,6>Yo, yo, yo! This was our second visit, and I felt a need to communicate on what makes this place fantastic.- First, if you come at night, GPS that ish...their lights do not illuminate the sign...(I passed it like a dummy both times that we came...even after knowing the address.) Rest assured, they ARE open!- There is a thai grocery store next door/conjoined. Cash only there, so save up your dollar bills that you'd been planning on using for polekatz and come get you some curry paste and some spices that you can't pronounce/identify. - This is a small, cozy, Mom and pop joint. I would not recommend more than a party of five, at the max. BYOB if you're an alkie, or just go without for an hour (ya damned alkie) and settle in with a thai iced coffee.- Nice homemade type of flavor here. They have a nice 'transition' type of menu for peeps that might not be familiar with Thai food. You can get regular, stir-fry food that's not doused in curry. (Why would anyone want that?!) It makes me confident that I can bring my Mother/Mother-in-law without them running for the door at the first sight of something that's not portillos or mexican food.So, in summary, if you're content with a small Mom'n'Pop type of Thai joint for great homemade flavors on the souuuuuth side, come here! And unlike their grocery neighbor, they DO accept credit!
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/16/2013,4/30/2014,78,76,5,10,9>I've driven past here 1000 times in my life and I'm regretting not stopping in sooner.  Uncle Bill's is a thing of rarity.  Now that corporate restaurants are ubiquitous, it's hard to find places like UB's.  They have a really small menu but it's good, cheap food.  They're not trying to blow you away or anything like that, but the food serves it's purpose.With that being said, my sis had the navy bean soup (Greek fasolada) and she said it was really good.  My boyfriend and I both got the corned beef has with scrambled eggs and a side of pancakes.  It was good, just like home cooking.  Apparently they have the best biscuits and gravy (homemade). The waitresses are your typical "hi, how you doin', honey?" kind of waitresses.  I believe THE Uncle Bill's wife is one of the waitresses.  The owner is very nice and stopped by to talk to us, he was so nice!  The cook cooks your food in an open area, the kitchen is surrounded by a counter seating area.  You never really come across "open kitchens" like this anymore but it shows that they have nothing to hide (in terms of quality).  Anyway, it's a good place to stop if you are in the area and are looking for a cheap, good meal or some coffee.  Is it gourmet? By no means.  Does it serve it's purpose? Heck yes!
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2014,4/29/2014,104,234,8,9,7>Been wanting to try out this place since this came up where the old Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in Arlington Heights was. Interestingly, there is a Cooper's Hawk closer to me in Wheeling.From the outside, this place looks very fancy schmancy. Inside, it lives up to the fanciness of the outside. The decor was very modern and appealing and this place isn't one where you would typically bring your kids, although they do have a kids menu. There's an entire section for wine connoisseurs (read: lots of white people) where you can sample and buy wine and enjoy the many wine books and other do-dads that wine people feel they need. Personally, I have slowly became a wine person versus beer, but not enough to appreciate all the merchandise that is associated with wine.We had reservations at 7, but was informed to wait for a bit. A bit was about 30-minutes so we ended up passing the time observing all the wine connoisseurs, especially a drunk old dude who felt like he was the king of the world. When we did sit down, the waiter was very nice. Tip: order the Asian Portbelly Tostadas -- you will not be disappointed. They were extremely tasty and packed great flavor. We also ordered the chicken al pastor stuffed mushrooms that were extremely good too.For entrees, I ordered the blackened ahi tuna, which was cooked perfectly. It was seared Rare and had with wasabi Sauce, with a side of cilantro Citrus Rice, and asian coleslaw. I never had "asian coleslaw" before, but from what I could tell, it was just a bed of cabbage.Overall, pretty delicious. Kind of pricey, but what you expect for a fancy place that has the word "winery" in the name of the restaurant? There's also a wine club, if you are into that. I know a few people who are members and they enjoy its perks.BATHROOM REVIEW: Pretty swanky as well. Everything was automated in terms of the flushing of the urinals, faucets, soap dispensers, and dryers. The mens bathroom had 2 stalls 2 urinals and the bathroom was wired to pump in super bright loud music so you can sing a tone while peeing . The stalls also had toilet seat covers which is cool. Sit or squat? Sit!!
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/12/2013,4/28/2014,83,281,4,8,6>This BBQ place grows on me each time I go here.Coincidentally, my waist size also seems to grow each time I go here.This seemingly-hidden gem is located in an odd part of town and I, sadly, forget it's there half the time. One night I had a hankering for some Q, yelped for options and JD's came up.We were apprehensive. Then we realized there was a drive-thru (for real!). Sure, the drive-thru was slow, but it's not a fast-food chain.The prices were reasonable and the BBQ was...is delicious. I want to go in to the location to try the micro beer selection and see the decor. But, for now, I'm content enjoying the delicious, local BBQ from the comfort of my own home...even if that means I have to wait a little longer in a drive-thru to make that happen.
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/23/2013,4/27/2014,93,293,1,7,5>They make fresh homemade mozzarella daily.  They feature approx 8 craft beers brewed on premises, and guest brews too (on this day they notably had Small Town Brewery's root beer (beer that tastes identical to Rootbeer soda pop) and brewed locally in Wauconda, IL.  They also make their own wine and holiday glogg.  The fish and chips were great.  Service was great.  Will definitely be back!
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/16/2013,4/26/2014,270,833,8,13,10>I love coffee. I love local businesses. This place marries the two together.I have become a...well...coffee snob. If you are in that club as well, this is the place for you! Coffee Planet is located in the old Caribou spot, and they offer a variety of really different items that other places (both chain and local) do not. For instance, their cold brew coffee, or the pour overs. They even had a maple bacon latte. What?! They brew Metropolis coffee (local from Chicago), as well as sell Rishi teas (another awesome brand). I highly recommend Metropolis coffee!If you like local art, this is also a great place to showcase your own art, or take a peek at some others' work. There is a fireplace, and plenty of places to sit and chill. The owner was very helpful and definitely has passion behind what he does!Love deals? This place has a check in offer ($1 off a coffee), a punch card, and if you come Mon-Fri before 9AM, you get a free pastry with your coffee purchase!It is a little expensive (Starbucks prices), but the quality is much better. Also be aware that if you order a pour over, they do take a little longer, but it's worth it!Do if you're looking to try something new and support a local business, this is your place!
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/27/2014,4/25/2014,57,83,7,8,6>I'm a big fan of this place, especially their lunch specials. For about $6.99 you can get a 10 inch pizza and a soft drink or bottled water or a whole host of sandwiches with fries and a drink. Where can you beat that?Aside from their thin crust pizza, which is crunchy and super thin and topped with toppings to the edge, they make a good burger. The Belly Buster is grilled over an open flame and served on garlic bread with sautéed onions and American cheese. Simple and darn tasty! Plus the fries are crunchy and delicious. I'm loving this place whenever I am feeling a righteous burger or a thin crust pizza. They are carryout only. Oh yeah. One thing I love about their pizza is they cut a round pizza into squares. Reminds me of the old days at Vito & Nick's on the South Side. Give them a shout. They deliver too but they are so close to my house that I just can't wait for the delivery guy to show up at my door. I go get it from Lucano's!

(I ended up buying a hat and scarf while trying to warm up!) The parking lot smelled delicious with people fixing food even before the game started! The Section 8 cheering was fun to watch and I'm sure even more fun to be in the middle of...I would definitely come back!!
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2013,4/23/2014,168,718,8,9,10>I am in LOVE with this place.  I have yet to try everything I wanted to, but I sure made a concerted effort my first time!!The first time we came, our waitress was Gosia, and she was amazing.  She guided us toward her favorite things on the menu and was SO attentive throughout the meal.  We liked the food and Gosia so much that we returned a week later hoping she was working--alas, she was not!  Our server was really nice and attentive, though.  I am just keeping my fingers crossed that Gosia is working next time!I am also not ashamed to admit that we were back once throughout the week, but for takeout.  Don't you judge me!!The whole place is really cozy and has a "homey" feel.  We sat downstairs the first time, and upstairs the second--by the bay window, so it was GORGEOUS.  What a view!!But anyway, my kids ordered the chicken nuggets meal--it comes with a HEARTY portion of chicken nuggets and fries.  The kids really loved them!I had the minty spiked martini--SO amazing.  It goes down so smoothly...maybe a little TOO smoothly ;)I also had the split pea soup with ham (special on Saturdays).  Let me say.  I megaloathe peas, but this was AWESOME!  It was so different and tasted amazing!My husband had the grownup grilled cheese sandwich and thought it was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches he's ever had.  This is high praise for him because he loves those little suckers!I had a bacon burger with fries and it was REALLY good.  I also ordered a side salad, and their ranch dressing is to die for!  Not from a bottle, nosiree!!When we ordered dessert (of COURSE we got dessert, duh!) it was reminiscent of my childhood!  I recreated a dish that my family used to have in Missouri when we visited my grandmother.  It's chocolate ice cream, marshmallow topping and malt on the side.  Yeah, it sounds strange but it's delicious!Now that I have been talking about this, I really want to go back!  I am already figuring out when a good time would be!!  LOL!I highly reccommend anything from here, and I can't wait to try it all!
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2014,4/22/2014,52,535,5,11,6>Hong Kong Cafe is a very unique Chinese restaurant.  It is not  a fine dining place and it is not exclusively a take out place.  Hong Kong is in between the two and a little bit of both.  Of course they do have take out as an option but during the lunch hour many people come to eat in.  The set up is simple with basic chairs and tables that seat four to six people per group.  Upon arrival you are offered green tea and hot and sour soup.  Both are excellent and slightly unexpected given the simplicity the restaurants atmosphere conveys.  Again, the interior decor and set up of this place you would expect your food to come in Chinese take out box but Hong Kong Cafe is far from that.  The menu is extensive and the dishes are exceptional.  You can gather this from the authenticity of the menu items as well from the majority Chinese patrons that frequent this location.  I had the Chinese Curry Supreme which comes with chicken, beef, and shrimp. It was excellent and filling.  Hong Kong Cafe is popular among the coworkers so I hope to come back again so I can try some other things on the menu.
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2013,4/21/2014,112,483,3,13,5>I have driven past the Tinley Park train station on Oak Park Avenue many, many times. I've even gone to the farmers market in the adjoining parking lot. And sadly, I never knew Cavallini's was even there. We were invited to a Sunday afternoon party at Cavallini's. It was absolutely delightful.What a nice place for a party. It is a very modern, but classic at the same time. The light fixtures are a stand out. The train that runs overhead was a big hit with kids - kids like to push buttons and make trains go.The staff did a great job, extremely accomodating, very friendly. Food was great. The menu was sausage and peppers, meatball, potatoes, plus brushettas, artichoke parmegan breads, caprese salad and more. Worth checking out if you need to host a shower/baptism/reception.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/1/2013,4/20/2014,38,217,4,10,6>Might be my new favorite beef. I've already been here 3 times.I love that they load on the cheese, and then melt it.  This gives the fresh bread just the nicest little crunch.  Well flavored beef.  I'm a hot peppers guy, which weren't overpowering- just enough on the samich.  I've had both the reg. cheesy beef and the garlic; I did think the garlic was a bit overpowering which took away from tasting the beef, but was still very good.The fresh cut fries even held up well to doing takeout and getting all the way back to the office for lunch. mmmm.They just need to add shakes & malts.No bendy straws here.  :P
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2013,4/19/2014,110,138,7,6,6>I love this place, never disappoints.  I only been here once, but I heard so many great recommendations about it and they sure proved them right!  The food was unbelievably amazing and the service was superb.  I didn't get to walk around the restaurants to see the atmosphere since I was stranded in a private party room.  Although, just walking into the restaurant, the way it's set up with a bakery/winery mini store...which the desserts seem to die for.There aren't many in IL, I don't even think there is one in the city, so do check it out if you are in their areas.
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2013,4/18/2014,21,25,6,10,5>I've lived about 100 feet away from this spot for the past year and a half so I figured it was high time I reviewed it! The food here is always hot and fresh (unlike yours truly) and the owners are fantastic. Seriously, my husband and I ordered from here almost every Sunday for about 5 months straight last year while having our Walking Dead viewing parties and the female owner still asks how our friends & family are doing. She remembers that I'm in healthcare and my husband works late. She'll sometimes have her young daughter there working on homework while she sorts sauce packets and wipes down tables and then there is an older gentleman as well - it's just very much a small, family business with an emphasis on great customer service. Hell, I went in there with the flu one time and she gave me won-ton soup. My favorite is the Basil Chicken - it comes with a metric ton of fresh veggies (pea pods, bell peppers, carrots, broccoli, etc..) and has just enough kick to make it interesting. The Sesame, Kung Pao, Twice Cooked and Orange Chicken are all good choices as well although I'm a dirty heathen that will always prefer the OC at Panda Express over any other. The aforementioned won-ton soup is tasty (I've had a patient request it be delivered to her while she was in labor) as are most of the appetizers I've tried - beef on a stick, steamed dumplings and crab rangoon are the first to come to mind. The only thing I don't absolutely adore from here are the egg rolls. They're not bad, don't get me wrong, but I'm a Villa Park girl at heart and Tong's Tiki Hut will always hold first place for the biggest, baddest (and greasiest -shhhhh!!) egg rolls in the Villa Park-Lombard-Elmhurst metropolitan area.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/12/2013,4/17/2014,151,128,5,6,5>Kama has been on my bucket list for WAY too long. After so much anticipation, I'm very happy to report that my first experience was outstanding!I stepped into their old space once (on Burlington) some time ago to grab a menu. It looked pretty cramped. The new space on La Grange road is awesome! The colors, decor, and lighting are beautiful, and the lovely stretch of windows up front made it feel spacious and cozy all at the same time.We sat in a booth. We had the most friendly and patient server who didn't seem to mind at all that my husband and I have zero knowledge of Indian food. She was so helpful, and made what turned out to be some fantastic suggestions. We had the bacon wrapped prawns to start. Delicious. For dinner we ordered the Tandoori Platter, Eggplant Bharta, Lamb Roganjosh, and garlic naan. Good thing we had a damn booth, as there was absolutely no free space on our table after that feast of food was delivered. My favorite things were the eggplant and the lamb. The flavors in both of these dishes made me swoon. I like lamb, but it is such a right-up-in-your-face gamy tasting meat. The sauce that the lamb was cooked and served in made it taste sublime. I'm definitely getting that next time. The naan is dangerously addictive! If I hadn't snarfed two big pieces down, I could have probably finished my dinner like a good girl, but no. I happily had leftovers and I very happily took the eggplant to work the next day for lunch. I was on top of the world! I usually eat Wheat Thins or yogurt at my desk for lunch; so my lunch was a great treat that day. My only little disappointment was that the chicken pieces in the Tandoori Platter were a tad dry. But the seafood and lamb sausage were right on the money.I'm excited to go back! There are so many more things I'd like to try. Including those lamb tacos on the appetizer menu. Word has it they're spicy. (Don't disown me Maureen M.!) Maybe. Just maybe......
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/3/2013,4/16/2014,59,151,2,7,5>We were going on a work lunch and a coworker suggested Francesca's. I do not live out by Frankfort so I had no clue of this place.Well I was happy we came here but a little mad I couldn't try out the wine menu and had to return to work. Someone recommended a pizza so I ordered one with sausage and mushroom. Before the entree's came out, we got bread and oil on the table. Most my coworkers had salads and soups. I was just waiting for my pizza. Wow, was it great! The thin cracker like crust was much like I'd expect at an authentic Italian place. My coworkers all loved their pasta. The best part about this place is that even if I recommend a dish, their menu changes often so you might not be able to order it. It's great because the restaurant can focus on a handful of good dishes at a time and rotate their meals.Since lunch was on my employer, we all ordered a delicious dessert. I really wanted the tiramasu but they have a lava cake that called my name. The service isn't super fast here, so sit back and enjoy your meal!I would definitely return here and bring some friends.
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2013,4/15/2014,124,106,2,12,6>We booked a room here for my friend's baby shower, and from the beginning booking experience to the shower today, the restaurant made the vent fabulous! If you've been to other Francesca's restaurants, the food is consistant, traditional, and oh so yummy. There were a few things, however, that really stood out to me and why I'll always consider going to a Francesca's for a small event like a baby shower:* they don't charge for the room reservation!!! Literally every other place that we looked at either had a minimum number of people (20 or more) or charged at least $150 for the 3 hour event. When Julie, the coordinator, told me that they only charged us for the food we ate (and of course tax and gratuity), I was sold!* the variety of menu options for our event was great! We could do a family style, sit down plated, or (what we chose) a buffet appetizer course. They had a variety of menu options as well as a variety of price points, based on the quantity of food and how long the service lasted. Their special events options made it so easy to find an option for us! * the appetizer buffet was perfect for our baby shower of 13 people! We started with passed appetizers of chicken skewers while we stood around and chatted. When we sat down, we had a buffet of white pizza (delicious!!), bruschetta, and a risotto. I loved that they charged us per person, but refilled the buffet as many times as we needed during the hour of food that we paid for. AND we got to take home anything that was left! When our food time was finished, they just left it out for us to nibble on while we chatted and opened presents. Not only was the food delicious, but no one left hungry.* I left Julie know that we had one of the guests who was allergic to gluten. They were AMAZING with providing us with gluten-free options for every piece of the meal! They provided gluten free bread, a small plate of gluten free bruschetta (which they kept refilling!) and one of the pizzas was made gluten free as well! All this, with no extra charge to the event!* one word...doughnuts! Francesca's is affiliated with Glazed and Infused and we were able to order a tray of 50 mini doughnuts for $35! They have a variety of doughnuts including maple bacon (yum!!!), pumpkin chocolate chip (a seasonal but very yummy), and even did a gluten free for our guest that is allergic to gluten! Although you have to ask for the option, it's a great way to get something different!I was so pleased with the service, the food, and the overall experience! This is definitely going to be one of my go-tos for events AND a nice dinner :)
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2013,4/14/2014,850,1294,7,14,12>I really love this little delikatesy, and I do mean little. It's pretty tiny but it's cram packed with Polish favorites from the motherland.Honestly, I could care less about the packaged goods (Delicje, Pierniczki Alpejskie, Kucharek). In Chicagoland they are pretty standard in traditional American supermarket under the "Ethnic" sign. It's nice that this is local, so I do buy Eastern European essentials; however, I always come here to buy meats and cheeses from the deli counter.The deli display, like the shop, isn't all that large, but they have a decent selection and there are a couple standards I always walk away with (fresh baked White Rye Bread, Morski Cheese, Krolewski Cheese and Double Canadian Meat). I find these make some of the best sandwiches I've ever had and the price is comparable to other grocers. I'm not a huge fan of pork, but the majority of the sliced meats are ham-like and I like them all.It's nice for my fiancé and me because they don't just carry Polish items, they also have some stuff from the Balkans. We've got our eyes on a large bag of Vegeta (like Kucharek) and I believe they also had Kraš chocolates and cookies. They have tons of instant soup mixes and juices, too. My favorite is višnja, sour cherry.A typical shopping basket of ours gets filled with a loaf of bread, 2/3 lb of sliced cheese, 1/2 lb of sliced meat, a jug of juice, a candy bar, and some type of jam. This last trip only cost $15.30.Come around lunchtime for their hot meal deals. It changes up a bit but usually showcases potato pancakes, pierogi and stuffed cabbage rolls.

Be prepared for a huge menu they will make any decisions incredibly hard. I had a Gyro and my wife the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger but the highlight was the enormous loaded Fries. They start with some excellent double fried fresh cut fries and load on chili, bacon cheese Amazing! The Gyro was loaded and very good and my wife really enjoyed the burger. I can wait to eat my way through the rest of the menu. This place is a real gem in the chainstore overloaded suburban landscape.
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/17/2013,4/12/2014,27,47,4,7,5>I love me some Greek/Mediterranean diner grub, so I just had to check this place out.  A lot of variety on the menu (the name of this restaurant is a big, fat liar!), but we ended up going with the Greek chicken and chicken kabob dinners.  The food-price ratio is great--you get a boatload of food for what you pay.  The food is 3-star quality to me, but I bumped my rating up a star based on the value alone.  Greek-style bone-in chicken is one of my favorite preparations of bird, but at Just Kabobs, it was Just Ehh.  They transferred the pre-cooked chicken from the line to the grill to my plate, which I know is common practice at Greek diners, but flavorwise it just wasn't all that great--it seemed to be missing that olive oily, lemony, garlic-and-herbs crispiness and juiciness Greek chicken is known for.  If you tried Jester's in Elgin, you'll see what I mean.  All in all, good, fast service and good, cheap food.  Whenever I'm in town again, I'll probably stop by.

Um, I don't know what the ONE super negative review on here is talking about, but my suggestion is if you make a comment about a restaurant being "packed" but then claim "all the people" were all complaining about the food, you are contradicting yourself my friend. Places that have awful food are not packed. And I was there that day, which makes this claim all the more redic.There is a reason why this place has mostly 5 star reviews. The food is homemade and fresh. The chips are hot and made to order. The salsas are flavorful and made fresh. You can literally watch the owners prepping the food as you wait. The steak tacos are by far my favorite. I love them, and I normally don't eat very much red meat. They are my crack. My cow crack. The rice bowls are also amazing. And, the flan. The BEST flan I've ever had anywhere. Period. It's ah-maz-innnng.And how bada** that they have Xingu beer, which is a very tasty beer that is typically hard to find. If they have a soup special, do it!!! Their soup makes me want to swim in it, it's so good. I want to bathe in the soup goodness. Prices I feel are reasonable for the quality of food. $2-$3 range for tacos is not expensive. If you think it is, you belong at Taco Bell. Basically, I am a regular here. I eat here typically 2-3x a week, and I see the same people regularly coming in and out. Check it out. And eat a steak taco, because they are the bomb diggity. And don't be crabby when you walk in there and there's a line out the door. Because I will probably be sitting there eating my steak tacos *sighing contentedly* and don't take kindly to people ruining my happy vibe.
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2013,4/10/2014,15,87,7,10,6>I went here the other night for what was officially the 10,000,000th time. Yup, got a plaque and everything.There are weeks where I am here 3x a week and many a day where I am here 2x in a day (my office is a block away). I have loved this place since it opened and continue to love it today.The menu is filled with some terrific, never changing standards like my favorite a la Diabla taco, Bien Trucha taco, Ceviche, etc. However, the other night i had the de Camarones Cazuelitas and almost died right there. It may have been the single best dish I have ever had in my life anywhere in the world.Bien Trucha provides a perfect experience. To sit outside in the courtyard, eating under the sun-protection canopies, great music (neither too loud nor too soft) playing in the background, drinking the world famous margaritas, should be something everyone on earth strives to do once in their lives.Come to Bien Trucha. Give your name to the hostess, walk down the street for a drink (or hang in the courtyard and have a drink), come to the restaurant when they call you, enjoy incredible margaritas, top notch creative food that is magnificently presented, and experience a place that Chicago area people are really lucky to be able to visit.
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/24/2013,4/9/2014,76,143,5,7,5>The fancy fries are amazing, but if you're getting a burger, ordering is a bit odd. Everything comes with chips or fries, but if you want to get fancy fries (the Mediterranean is fantastic) you have to order a separate order of fries. So, if you're dining with another person and you both get a side of fries, AND you want fancy fries, you end up with 4x the amount of fries and only 1/2 of it fancy. Should be a way to order for 2 that involves just a simple up-charge for fancy fries- otherwise you end up with the entire state of Idaho in front of you. Wasteful.I ordered the Scratch Burger. I was really good, although I don't enjoy tomatoes and they have a "no changes" policy, so that was just another bit of wasted food there. Drinks were fun since they all came in cans (I had no idea some of these beers came in cans!) and the "plastic" glasses you get are actually recyclable, so I get the whole "green" thing they are going for. Just seems odd that they would recycle glasses but not try to waste less food. Seems to me like they are still working on getting their sea legs (aka restaurant legs) in this place.  I did enjoy the food and beverages, the service was fine. Just a lot of odds and ends to fix here.I say it's worth going on a night that they wouldn't be slammed, otherwise I can see the staff stuck in the weeds all night.
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/2/2013,4/8/2014,39,72,5,8,7>Good stuff!We decided to have dinner before the Christmas parade in Crystal Lake at Georgio's... I think everyone else had the same idea!The wait was literally 1 1/2 hours and we waited every minute of that time.  We had a party of 15 and you know you've been waiting for a table for a long time when your party has taken over half the seats in the bar.Anyway the wait sucked but it wasn't the restaurants fault.  The bartenders kept the drinks flowing so the time went by pretty fast.When we got seated, our waitress was a real doll.  She really did a great job with a huge party who wanted separate checks during a totally swamped time.  We ordered appetizers right away and they were literally out in 5 minutes, which was awesome.  The pizza was also very good, we had the deep dish mama primavera with pepperoni added to it.  Very good deep dish.  They have a very distinctive sauce that is very tasty.The best part, not as part of the review, but for the adults in the party, we were sat right by the window, so when the parade finally started, the kids ran outside to see it and the adults could watch, nice and warm by the fireplace with a cold beverage in hand.  Very good night for sure.I would recommend Georgio's for good pizza and a nice atmosphere.  I don't think it's a very good place to watch sports.  Maybe they can improve on that.  But it is a great place to take the kids for dinner.  They also have some pretty good drink special.  $2 bottles on Saturday... unheard of!!
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/7/2013,4/7/2014,25,298,2,11,6>This little coffee shop is on the first floor commercial area of Orland Park's Ninety7Fifty apartments which were just constructed right next to the train station. Nice little location, but you really cannot see the coffee shop very easily. Luckily they operate the coffee shop in the train station also, so you can get a taste of their food before you jump on the train.This is a nice shop and I hope it lasts. Today everything seems bigger and busier, and this little shop is a throwback to a calmer experience. While location may be a problem for driving traffic, the trip is worth it. You can sit comfortably among a number of the antiques they display, and enjoy any number of coffee offerings. They also serve a number of pastries which were very nice. Give it a try sometime
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/27/2013,4/6/2014,63,60,8,11,9>Bigby's is a hidden gem. Like the island on the hit TV series "Lost," Bigby's is the sort of place that can only be found by those who have been there. And possibly mathematician cartographers. Unlike the Island on "Lost," it is not going anywhere and it's a super inviting place to visit. It might be a little hard to find at first, but if you like beer, wine, or just a happy place to hang out, this place is a big win.I have found that many places that serve craft beer are maybe a little like wine bars in that they can be pricey and a little pretentious, but Bigby's is wonderfully relaxing and down to earth. "Want to try a great beer? Cool. Try this." It's like someone took an awesome local bar from Orange County, and dropped it, inexplicably, behind an Italian restaurant in Addison IL. It's a nice change of pace, especially if all you're used to is loud sports bars. It's cool, low key, and a great place to hang out with friends or bring a date. Bigby's serves some interesting wines and a wide variety of craft beers (bottle or draft) that rotates all the time- and from what I have heard, patrons help select what's next in rotation. Bartenders are smart and approachable and are great at giving suggestions that really pay off. Beer is served in an appropriate glass- sometimes really crazy glassware- for the best possible drinking experience. There is also a nice but limited menu if you want to stay for a while and you get hungry. Everything is reasonably priced.If you're looking to get into craft beer, hang someplace nice before going to a movie, or want to go to a bar where you can talk, unwind, and enjoy some light food, I can't think of a better place that deserves your business more. Remember, you just have to find it first.
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/1/2014,4/5/2014,44,300,4,10,5>I've been to Niche several times since my first review - and this place is fabulous. Fresh ingredients, delicious drinks, creative menu that is frequently changing, and excellent service. I believe it is the best restaurant in the tri - city area, and the closest thing you will experience to Chicago dining in the suburbs. We recently went to Niche for their New Year's Eve dinner. It was a 5 course delight, from the lobster roll to the coffee creme brule. I enjoyed two margaritas with dinner - orange and pear flavored and they were wonderful. My husband absolutely loves their old fashioned with the special cherries, and our friends also enjoyed the Niche version of the Irish coffee. The menu was delicious, the service excellent, and the evening memorable,  as it should be. I will continue to come to Niche for special occasions in the future.
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2014,4/4/2014,30,137,2,7,8>Chicago Dough is now our favorite pizza joint in New Lenox, for both delivery and eat-in. When this place first opened, we weren't sure we liked their pizza. We decided to try them out again recently and found out they're doing something with their crust and their sauce now that we really like.They also have an excellent dine-in buffet (daily for lunch and Mondays and Wednesdays for dinner) with pizza, salad, soup, pasta, breadsticks, some of the best chicken wings I've ever tasted with an excellent breading, and dessert pizzas with fruit toppings. In fact, the lunch buffet is so affordable ($7.49 per adult, $3.99 per kid) that my sons were able to take the whole extended family here recently for a party and split the bill between them.The New Lenox location is decorated with some really unique, cycling-related artwork because the owner is apparently a cycling buff (which my husband really appreciates, since he's one too), and the service is fast and friendly (they even gave the grandkids extra pieces of pizza dough to play with, which really kept them occupied).
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2014,4/3/2014,428,1216,6,12,9>So much love for this place.  Good and simple, fairly fast, cheap.  Fricken delicious.  I swing through on a regular basis when I've got appointments in the area, or when I get coiffed at Ruelle across the street.  Parking is easy, with spots in front sometimes, and a small free lot next to it. It's tiny. Order at the counter, they bring to your table. I haven't tried the carne asada fries. I do adore their salsas and guacamole. Wonderful enchiladas and tacos with fresh toppings.The owner is a doll. So friendly.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2013,4/2/2014,16,40,8,14,8>For E+O, I'll keep it simple to avoid confusion - this place is amazing.First and foremost, however, tapas are dangerous. As the new culinary genre of choice, tapas restaurants are springing up everywhere from strip malls to train stations (seriously). As with all trends, the increasing number of knockoffs begins to sour the public perception of the product. Needless to say, I've been burned by tapas restaurants before - poor, yet expensive, food. Thankfully, E+O renewed my faith in small plates with its fresh take on this Spanish style.A last minute decision and reservation brought me here this past Saturday, and the distinct, savory smells of a Japanese kitchen that greeted me at the door let me know it was the right choice. From the moment my gf and I sat down, we were blown away by the waitstaff. Working in tandem, our two servers were incredibly attentive and helpful. Each made fantastic recommendations without seeming overbearing. This great night out was truly made perfect with their help.Moving on to the heart of the review - the food! Under our waiters' guidance, we ordered two small plates, a sushi dish, a main plate, and a desert, which turned out to be just perfect for two hungry patrons. First up to bat was the "Its Like That" maki roll (spicy tuna topped with shrimp and fried onions). Despite its unconventionality, the unique marriage of flavors worked remarkably well. Indeed, it was my girlfriend's favorite dish of the night.The steak/bone marrow tacos and the crispy brussel sprouts, batting second and third respectively, quickly made their way to our table after we finished our maki roll. Both of these crowd favorites were spectacular. Having never tried bone marrow before, the familiar taco proved to be the perfect vehicle for introducing us to the rich, savory flavors of this visually barbaric treat. My only complaints would be: (a) "I wanted more;" and (b) they were difficult to assemble. For our main plate, we again deferred to our waiter's recommendations and ordered the Argentinean Gaucho rib eye, which our waiter insisted be served with additional chimichurri on the side - he was right! The steak was massive and cooked perfectly. The fried egg was my personal cherry on top and perfectly completed the dish. The potatoes, which accompanied the steak, were equally spectacular and even caused a mini-spat when I greedily gave myself the lion's share. Sorry, Katie W!To atone for my aforementioned greed, I ordered the carrot and pineapple cake as a peace offering. This ameliorative gesture turned sour when I sunk my teeth into THE BEST DESSERT I HAVE EVER TASTED and proceeded to devour it in as few bites as possible. The cake was impossibly moist and maintained the perfect level of sweetness throughout. This is the dish that will be bringing me back for years to come; a surprising admission for a Yelper missing a sweet tooth.Overall, E+O is one of the most memorable dining experiences I have encountered this year. Everything from the food to the service was downright impressive, and I simply cannot wait to return in the near future. Please, do yourself a favor and visit this unique, suburban favorite.
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2013,4/1/2014,56,208,6,8,7>The pho restaurants that I frequented while on holiday in Ho Chi Minh City, Danang, and Hanoi have nothing on this humble little place in downtown Naperville-excepting the lack of hot Vietnamese girlfriends.  The food here is fantastic! It's obvious that Chef Nguyen takes his profession very seriously, and the freshness of the ingredients and the stellar presentation thereof are emblematic of his earnestness.The crispy eggrolls, although deep fried, are light, delicious, and ununctuous (I just made that word up-I mean they aren't greasy).My Bun Bo Hue was gorgeous and had the perfect level of piquance.  I would suggest going a bit heavier on the beef, Chef Nguyen.  Also, a word of advice to the wait people: When a formerly hip, middle aged white guy-even a well traveled one- orders the Bun Bo Hue, don't offer the "Blood Cube", because you're likely to turn his ravenous appetite into a churning, gurgling pepto-bismal craving case of pseudo traveler's stomach. I guess it's in  keeping with the Vietnamese tradition and the authenticity of the food, but the mere thought nearly gave me the dry heaves.The Green Basil Com Chien is loaded with shrimp, beef, veggies, etc and is delicious.  And the Pho Ga is delicious and perfect for kids, as it's much like a revved up, Asian style chicken noodle soup.The décor is nice, but I nearly ruptured a disc sitting on a chair that needed to be repaired, and the service is friendly, but not necessarily frequent.The prices are very reasonable.
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/6/2013,3/31/2014,65,392,4,10,5>Now that's what I'm talking about. Whoever created and manages this place needs to franchise this! Showed up at prime time Sunday morning. Got a nice thin number to hold onto. Host called out the number in about 5 minutes and we were seated at a clean table. The upside down coffee cups were NOT sitting directly on the table, but on nice little napkins. Nice touch!Coffee was good, staff was efficient. Ordered a sampler that had everything I wanted, a couple slices of French Toast, bacon, sausage, and scrambled eggs. Simple.Syrup was real maple syrup. Jelly basket had Smucker's jelly in it and lots of options, including apple cinnamon jelly... Nice big portions of everything. Food arrived quickly.All in all, everything was spot on.In fact, I forgot to bring my bill with me when I went to the register to check out and they brought it up instantly and I paid without running back to the table.They even know how to use the TECHNOLOGY! Cool!TIP: Check out the SAMPLERs for 3 quick options...
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2013,3/30/2014,771,552,7,11,8>I LOVE this place!!! $60 fed 5 adults the first time I visited. Awesome.I have to credit this awesome find to Andres D. With his bad ass pictures he lured me into checking them out. Now I find myself there on random weekends enjoying breakfast with friends. The first time I visited was mothers day. We all got skillets, I've tasted them all and not one disappoints. I mean some are not my style but nevertheless, worth ordering for some people. My favorite skillet is the Three Little Pigs - bacon, sausage, and ham with melted jack cheese, mmmmmm. I know I know, some of you are wondering why El Mariachi (Bacon, avocado, jalapeño, and melted jack cheese) isn't my favorite, being Mexican and all, but I don't like warm avocado and there isn't enough meat in there to satisfy ANY mariachi. Just sayin.Besides the skillet, the first time (and every time there after) I just HAD to share the baked apple stuffed French toast. Whoa. Bad idea because since then I've "shared" one every time. It has this delicious sweet cream filling that I can't get enough of. Add some doughy bread and baked apples, it's a done deal. Explosion. In. Your. Mouth. The good kind of explosion, the kind with a happy ending. That could be misinterpreted I guess.....umm......MOVING ON! Baked Apple Breakfast Company is where it's at. Check them out.
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2013,3/29/2014,157,219,4,10,6>So I was jonesin' for brunch when my best friend on the planet told me she was coming up to visit from Peoria. I thought about takin' her to my go-to breakfast spot...but then the thought of champagne and mimosas popped into my head and I couldn't push it out. It was definitely time for Drury Lane. I hadn't been to brunch at Drury Lane in years, but it's one of those memorable occasions that you just can't forget. For $26 plus tip, you can have all the food and mimosas that your little (of big) tummy can handle. And let me tell you...My bestie almost had to roll me out of there. Seafood bar? Check. Omelet station? Check. Crepes, pancakes and waffles? Check. A million different options? Double check.  Ah-mazing. Of course, Drury Lane isn't just for brunch. I've seen countless shows at this classic little theater. Much more reasonably priced than downtown theater, but just as wonderful, I've never had a bad seat in this house. Singin' in the Rain, Brigadoon, and many others seriously made me happy.  During intermission, head to the bar for a quick and delicious cocktail. The bartenders are friendly and accommodating.  Plus there are often snacks on the tables and bar. Who doesn't love bar snacks?!If you haven't been to Drury Lane, go check it out. I'm a total fan.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2013,3/28/2014,204,102,6,12,9>I can't believe I didn't have a review for Columbian's taste since its been here for 2 years now. My mom works right down the plaza so whenever I visit, I try and check this place out.The menu isn't extensive but I'd rather choose a dish from a category of 10 vs 100. This place is a small mom and pop shop and is doing fairly well. I got a sandwich the last time I was here with their potatoes. The sandwich was by no means small and the potatoes were like our potatoes but much starchier. They're delicious (especially when you dip it in their homemade salsa). I have also tried their mini empanadas and I can't recommend them enough! They're fully homemade and you can taste it! The outside is absolutely delicious and makes the whole dish!! I ask for an extra large salsa and go to town and these. I do have to warn, the salsa is HOT but if you like spicy, it'll definitely hit the spot!
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2013,3/27/2014,195,301,5,11,7>Five stars!  Here's the breakdown and rationale behind this stellar rating...Tribes is the only place you can go in the area to find a large selection of the highest quality of beer.  The draft beer menu is extensive and they offer special brew events even the most learned beer connoisseur can appreciate.  I love Belgian Sours and this is the one place I can find them in the Tinley area outside of Binny's.  Not only that, they have more than one on the menu!  Breweries from all over the country and world are represented and you can find a local specialty brew (Revolution) or the fine brews of the region (Brewery Vivant) or the best of the best (i.e. Belgians).  The food is bar fare amped up.  Lamb lollies, Pork belly BLT, lobster roll, bison or elk burgers...you get the idea.  They even have local bluegrass musicians get together for jam sessions every Monday.  I highly recommend listening in and enjoying a brew with some fantastic background music.  Tribes is really a gem in the area and offers a great destination for those looking for great craft beer, fine whiskey and fantastic menu options in a casual and laid back setting.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/22/2013,3/26/2014,34,80,4,8,6>Zanies has finally come to the suburbs!  This venue is similar to the city venue as well as comparable to the layout for Second City.  Of course, it is nice to not have to deal with all of the traffic of the city to get here.  The new Balmoral exit when heading north on 294 is a dream.  You can easily find your way into the stack up parking and meander over to Zanies.  Plus, if you're hungry beforehand there are great restaurants in the area.  Be prepared for a wait if you choose to have dinner after the early show.  My guest and I arrived for the Tone Bell show early and wound up with awesome front row seats!  It was quite a nice treat.  Plus, if you attend a show and get on their texting list, you can plan to receive texts for free tickets from time to time.  Our service was excellent throughout the show.  Our server repeatedly checked up on us, and she made excellent drink recommendations.This is a place not to miss!

Finally, I was in the area to get a taste for myself. As I pulled up to the dingy looking strip mall, I see carloads of asians unloading and lookin hungry and I figured they're not going into the mexican restaurant or 7-11 so I powerwalked my way ahead of everyone.I got the Beef noodle soup with all the trimmings, duh. The broth was phenomenal....perfect for a cold day. Beef ball, tripe, tendon, rare beef, etc...all was spot on! Fresh sprouts, basil, jalepenos, and the Hoisin/Sriracha just killed it....in a good way. Great service and my to-go order only took about 10 minutes. Two thumbs up!
<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2013,3/24/2014,50,171,4,9,8>I have a secret (or not so secret) obsession with Indian food, spicy Indian food to be more specific.  Clay Oven over delivers on both fronts.  My coworkers and I had a simultaneous hankering for some serious Indian eats, so I let Yelp do the talking (of course) and found that Clay Oven was pretty close to our office.Their $7.95 lunch buffet offers a nice variety of dishes that are a little more spicy than many other buffets that I've tried (and I count this as a good thing).  I didn't realize that my dining companions were spice averse, but they agreed that Clay Oven walks that fine line between spicy and "oh my gosh, the insides of my mouth are melting."  I say that there's enough spice in their dishes to warm my belly and put a smile on my face, but I'm pretty sure my stomach came with a fireproof lining (so don't take my word for it).Also worth noting, one of my coworkers is vegetarian, and she still felt like she was going to have a food baby because their offerings include quite a few veg friendly dishes.My two favorite dishes were the saag and the goat curry (with naan; I chose not to fill up my stomach with rice).  The samosas were pretty delicious too, as was their green mystery sauce (I'm not sure what it was, but it was sort of spicy & herby...and I put it on their potatoes as well as on the salad). I'd say skip on the overly cheesy gulab jamin, however.I will definitely be getting my next Indian food fix from Clay Oven!
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2013,3/23/2014,298,465,6,12,9>This is DEFINITELY one of my fave places to eat out in the suburbs!  I mean, what's not to love about an all you can eat meat buffet?!  This is a Brazilian steak house, and here in America that means all you can eat, delicious meats that are cooked over an open flame with just course salt and also a fabulous salad bar that comes with your meal.  Everything is always super fresh and beyond flavorful!The salad bar has everything from traditional lettuces with toppings, to cured meats, gourmet cheeses and delicious potato salads and chicken salad.  Yum!  They are always replenishing the bar, as well and always there to hand you a plate.  Did I mention that this place has amazing customer service?!  Your water glass will never be 1/2 empty and they are always bringing around fresh cheese breads.  Now on to the meat.  Chama has some of the best around.  Nice and charred on the outside with a delicious, salty crust and perfectly done in the middle.  I prefer med-rare and they ALWAYS have some ready to slice off for me!  I could just eat meat here until I popped, it is just that good!  You don't lose anything when it comes to the quality here, despite being an all you can eat place.  It is just that good.You just cannot go wrong here, period.  Some of the best service around, reasonable prices and delicious food all around!  Run, don't walk, to Chama and get your meat on!
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/21/2013,3/22/2014,169,686,4,7,7>A cute, cozy little caffe in the middle of an otherwise gloomy strip mall in Naperville? Count me in! I finally got my butt over here for the first time today and I was glad I did. I knew I'd like it based on the New England-y name, and I was right.The price for the coffee might seem a bit steep, except that it actually tastes good and you get all the free refills that you want. I didn't try any of the fancier beverages so I'm not sure if they can be made vegan or not. There also appears to be quite the selection of sandwiches, salads and other solid consumables.The owner was super nice and fun to talk to. You can tell he really cares, and that makes me feel especially good that I didn't go to Starbucks instead!Apparently they have live music on Friday nights, so I'll have to check that out some time.The only way this place could be better is if it were within walking distance of my apartment, but it's probably good that it's not, as I'd undoubtedly be here like every day.
<review# 250,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/8/2014,3/21/2014,49,155,4,10,7>I've seen a few shows here, and I've got to say, I kind of love it! It's a small theatre, but I really haven't found a bad seat in the house. I've sat in the front row, I've sat in the back row, and I've sat all the way on the side and each time I was able to see facial expressions and everything going on. Most recently, I was here for a Second City show and right before it started, they set up this little cabaret table with 4 chairs in front of the front row. That was obnoxious considering the people in the first row then could not see around the people sitting at that table. So, that was unnecessary and not worth any ticket up-charge IMO.Bathrooms are big (no lines!), parking isn't bad (street and garage parking), and there are plenty of restaurants around if you want to eat before/after. If you live in the NW burbs, you really can't beat the convenience. It's nice to have a place like this in my 'hood.
<review# 251,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2014,3/20/2014,69,261,9,14,9>This is the restaurant for a waistline-busting, penny-pinching homebody. Because you'll feel like you're at home, spend only a couple of bucks, and have to be rolled out.Merichka's is no fine dining and they don't claim it to be. I haven't read through the reviews, but my guess is there are some negative reviews about the greasy food. If you're coming to Merichka's - guess what?! - it's going to be greasy. So go or don't go, but know there will be grease. You've been warned.And when you go, do yourself a favor and don't go against the grain: get the steak po'boy. Extra garlic sauce on the side, with a twice baked potato. Oh - and try some of the onion rings.The garlic sauce is a greasy garlic mess of caloric deliciousness. The twice baked potato is as big as your head. And for somewhere under $10, you'll have enough onion rings to feed a small army. But the sandwich! Oh the sandwich. My mouth waters thinking about it. The cubed steak is tender like butter (or roasted garlic, in this case) and the pickles are the perfect addition to the taste. If you eat all of it, you may have a problem. So in the case that you do have leftovers, pop them in the broiler and it'll reheat just fine.And remember: this is a diner. It's a fun, low-key place with below average service - don't let it ruin the experience. Be prepared to wait on weekends!
<review# 252,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2013,3/19/2014,78,284,6,7,7>If you ask a Chicagoan where to get a good hot dog, I bet a lot of people would lead you here. As far as Chicago hot dog places go, this is definitely one to mark off your list and it's worth the visit and time.I came here for the first time this weekend. It was lunch time on a Saturday and I expected it to be pretty busy. The parking lot was full upon arrival. This is partly due to all the people waiting in line and partly because since there is no seating, a lot of people opt to tailgate in the parking lot and eat there, either on their car or by their car, sitting in the seats they've brought along. So just because someone is by their car doesn't mean they'll be leaving any time soon, so keep trying to find parking.Once you do that, you'll wait in line for a bit. I think we waited about 15 minutes, which is actually less than I was expecting. The number one rule: do NOT ask for ketchup. Luckily I knew this going in, but if you didn't know that, you know it now. They don't have it and will likely give you an evil look for asking or kick you out Soup Nazi-style (but probably not). No, you can't even for your fries. Truth be told, you don't need it. I'll get to that in a second.The toppings available for the dog are mustard, onions, peppers, and relish. Blech to all. Personally, if I'm gonna get a Chicago dog, I want tomato and a pickle spear. To each their own, I guess. I got mustard only because I can tolerate it sometimes, and this had to be one of those times unless I got it plain. The dog comes with fries. This does not mean a side of fries. This means fries right on top of your dog. Initially, I was disappointed because I thought I would want more fries than what was given, but I suppose they know what they're talking about because they were pretty filling.This costs around $2, which is pretty darn cheap! It's incredible that you can get such great food for so little. They also have a double dog which is not two separate hot dogs; it's two hot dog weinies on one bun. It's fun watching the guys put everything together. They move so quickly, like rapid fire. Then you pay (cash only) and you eat. A good place to eat is on the window ledge outside (I'm serious). So what's it like to eat a hot dog with fries simultaneously? Pretty darn good, which is saying a lot since I'm a traditionalist and like my food items separate, thank you very much. But I said, hell, this is how they do it, so this is how I'll eat it. The hot dog was good, but not the best I've ever had. The fries were to die for, though. So simple: cut potatoes, put in oil, put salt, boom. Yet somehow, they were incredibly delicious and slightly greasy. I was sad when I finished them.If you're in the area, you should definitely pay it a visit. I don't know that I'd fly my personal plane i just to get it (I'm looking at you, Travolta), but it's worth trying.
<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/14/2013,3/18/2014,180,420,7,9,6>I'm (was) the duke here and I haven't even properly reviewed it!  What the heck.The first time we came we ordered a ton of food cause we wanted to try it all.  We got the small pizza and I got a frutti del mar and wifey got the pasta arrabiatta.  Daughter got the spaghetti kids meal.  So first off, they only have fries for the kids meal.  Or bread.  I asked for veggies like brocolli or something and they gave us a salad.  With onions.  For a 20 month old.  Well she ate the tomato (the one slice of tomato) and I ate the rest.  I think if you have a kids menu you should be looking out for some healthy options.  Even McD is trying to do this now.  So hopefully Maciano's will consider something other than fries.  They give a coloring menu with some crayons so that keeps my daughter busy.The floors are a laminate and it's very slippery.  It's kinda fun sliding across on your chair, but also potentially dangerous.  We went around 5pm and got in before the rush on a weekend night.  Around 6pm there was some crazy line.  At one point they had a big group coming and set all the tables together, but then they separated them and started seating people.  It kinda made me think of that game Diner Dash.  It's a pretty intimate setting.  When I see the building from the outside it seems like the kitchen is 3x as large as the seating area, but that's just what it seems anyway.We've been here a couple more times and enjoy it.  If you sign up for their email list you get a coupon.  And they send other coupons pretty regularly.
<review# 254,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/18/2013,3/17/2014,171,116,9,10,7>Friendly and knowledgeable staff. The studios are clean, and the locker room makes me wish my bathroom looked like that.My trial week started on Monday. My goal is to go to at least one class per day. So far I've gone to Yoga Sculpt and and CorePower 1. Both are challenging classes, but not daunting. The instructors are inviting and challenge you to push harder for just a bit more. Thus far, I would describe CorePower as a combo of flow yoga and intensive cardio. Plus, each class has been in a "warm" environment. I have never sweat so much during a workout. I'm starting to regret eating all those burritos this year. My sweat often resembles salsa verde. That's healthy, right?There's plentiful parking, including an underground garage right next to the studio. No complaints at this point. Gotta run to another yoga class.Namaste!
<review# 255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2014,3/16/2014,119,128,4,13,9>Ed is awesome and he comes up with the best creations! I seriously had one of the best burgers ever when he made me the burger in my picture, it was mouth-wateringly delicious!Ed is so personable and a cool guy to just sit and talk with!  He truly cares about his customer's service!So their food is deliciously yummy, their staff is kind and happy to assist their customers, and the place is pretty sweet too!In the warmer weather, they cater to big groups on certain nights when Road & Track Riders of Chicago want to do a bike night meet up, and he let's us all park right out front so we can keep an eye on our bikes.The place inside has a decent amount of seating, some TVs if you want to watch the game or what not, and even a game console..perhaps the Wii for Wii bowling?  Is there an Xbox there too? Not sure, this is a pretty sweet place to grab some delish grub, and meet up with some friends to just chillax!   I would definitely much rather give my business to this local yummy high quality place, than just going to Domino's or Pizza Slut (where my husband has gotten violently ill from... yeeesh)So if you're craving a delish pizza pie, pop on down to Frato's, they're awesome!!!::EDIT::Update!:: I have shamelessly gone to Frato's twice in three days, and successfully eaten Frato's each of those days (yummy left-over pizzaaa!)My buddy & I ordered an 18" Vegetarian Goat Pizza with the "thick" crust, aaaaand it is now my new favorite pizza.  *I'm a sucker for goat cheeeeese!*The "thick" crust was perfect though, it wasn't crazy thick like a deep-dish or anything, it was more similar to what I would describe as hand-tossed, or "regular" at other pizza joints.  It was perfect...  Two pieces (square cut, they must do this unless you specify triangles) and I was full... so there were leftovers...for the next two days... which was fine by me, even though we split the pizza 50-50, I still had food for the next two days and I got to enjoy my new favorite pizza again & again!Then tonight, the hubbs was home, so I thought I would take him for his first time EVER!  We were both actually feeing burgers/sandwiches, and wanted to eat-in.  I think for him, I had hyped it up too much because he was let down, and it wasn't everything he was hoping for :'(.We walked in, and who I think was "Jessica" turned to look at us as I smiled, but neglected to extend a warm welcome greeting, and she just walked to the register. :(I showed hubbs that I think when eating in, we just walk to the register, stand there awkwardly & read the menu.  When we walked in though, I saw the "Specials" foldy-chalkboard with Chef Ed's latest burger creation, "The Minnesota Maple" and being a Minnesota-native, this girl just had to give it a go...and it sounded amazing  (see my pics for description and photos of it!) so we gave Jessica our order: that MN burger, his triple cheeseburger with tomato, grilled mushrooms & onions, and split an order of the "Chef's Salted Black Truffle Parmesan Fries"...we paid over $20 for our order, which the hubbs thought was a bit excessive, since what was to follow left him disappointed and tummy hurt.We sat down in one of the booths, and he popped in to use the restroom to wash up for dindins.  When he came out, his hands were dripping wet, and he was upset because there were no paper towels stocked, and the dining room was dirty.  I told him to give it a chance and be in good spirits & optimistic when we got our food. We thought when we dined-in, Jessica or someone would bring us our order, but hubbs went up to grab it & our ketchup.As we dived into our mouth-watering-looking burgers, I was happily impressed with Chef Ed's newest burger creation, while my husband's bun was folding in half, trying to break & escape his burger, and chomping on very chewy "grilled" onions, increasingly gaining sadness on his Frato's experience, whereas my tasebuds were having a happy-mouth-party...When all of a sudden another employee came over to gossip/bicker/scold/argue with Jessica while she was cleaning near the trash cans loud enough for us to hear... I don't think this was the appropriate thing to do directly in front of your customers... then it continued behind the counter near the pizza-making-station...now including more employees... We just looked at each other awkwardly feeling awkward at what was happening & again deteriorating at hubbs' first time experience...Not sure if Nina sensed it, or if she just wanted to pop by, but she came to our table to check on us, and tell me she remembered me :) & to let us know if we ever have any problems or anything to just let her know...then she offered us some ice cream samples! WHAA? Frato's has ice cream!? Who knew... Thanks to Nina, the kind and ever to sweet Nina, I think our experience was salvaged a bit, she is so genuine & awesome, absolutely great customer service... hubbs says if he ever came back, it'd be because of her.Better luck next time? :-/
<review# 256,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/28/2013,3/15/2014,63,167,3,14,7>I saw the reviews and I was interested in a trying a different kind of cuisine, so I headed out to Bisi on a Saturday night.Walking in the first thing that I noticed were the flickering compact fluorescents in many of the fixtures in the ceiling.  I don't know if my vision is off cycle or if something is wrong with the wiring, but it was a little disturbing.There is a host station at the door, but nobody was there.  No employees of any sort were even visible.  After a couple of minutes we seated ourselves.I only describe this because I found it a little odd,  but I had read the Yelp reviews indicating that this is a new restaurant and it is being run by a husband and wife team without any other employees.  I understand growing pains, but maybe a "Please seat yourself" sign would make patrons more comfortable.Another sign of the newness of Bisi is the clean, but spartan atmosphere.  I don't like a bunch of junk and neon all over a restaurant, so it was fine with me.  Some might feel like the space is not finished.  There might a little room for customizing but for now let them concentrate on the food and service since that is what really makes a great restaurant.While the walls may be bare, the tables were nice with tablecloths and cloth napkins.  The chairs were comfortable too.Eventually our server came out with food for the table next to us.  He then greeted us and thanked us for our patience.  I liked that he acknowledged the delay.  He started us off with some water since Bisi is still working on their liquor license. ( I don't drink soda or tea.)  I'm hoping for a few craft brews when they do offer beer.  It is easier to be patient with a drink in your hand.We had ample time to review the menu as it became obvious that our waiter was also the busser, host, and who knows what else.  He maintained his pleasant demeanor throughout our visit despite his many roles in running the restaurant.I was not familiar with several of the items on the menu, but the Yelp reviews had somewhat prepared me.  I didn't really know enough about the food to ask any questions, but each item was fairly well described in the small menu.  I picked three separate meals even though there were only two of us, with the expectation that we would be taking some home.  I wanted to experience some variety on my first visit.The steamed rice with a tomato based sauce and plantains on the side was good, but plain.  The sauce was served on the side in a little bowl and I felt that while tasty, the amount given was not proportional to the amount of rice, so it got a little lost.The jaffa rice and goat (and more plantains) was tasty.  The way the rice was seasoned reminded me of Spanish rice, but it was fresh and moist... better than what I get in Mexican restaurants.  The goat was served as two small/medium sized pieces with the bone in the middle.  The meat pulled easily and cleanly from the bone, but was a little tough when biting into it.  Perhaps that is the style.  The flavor was very good.The Efo Riro, fufu, and fish was my favorite.  Efo Riro is listed as "spinach soup", but it is not soup in the American sense of the word.  It is wet, but not swimming in broth in a bowl.  It is more like southern style greens with spices and smoked turkey.  I liked it a lot.  The fufu was like dense mashed potatoes and served as a nice counterpoint to the mild spices in the spinach.  I believe the fish was prepared by deep frying a whole fish minus the head after it had been covered in some kind of seasoning.  I'm no chef, but that is how it appeared to me.  I was told that it was an Alaskan whiting (also known as Alaska pollock according to Wikipedia).  I mention the preparation because it came with all the fins and bones which some people might not prefer.  My wife usually avoids things like this but she dug in and enjoyed it this time.  Working around a few bones was worth it.  The fish was moist and tender and delicious.  It is definitely not a knife and fork operation though, so don't be afraid to get your fingers in there.Each of the three dishes that I ordered were $10.  I suspect that these prices may be adjusted as Bisi matures to account for the vastly different ingredients on each plate.  For example, is a plate of rice and plantains equivalent to a Efo Riro and a whole fish?  I have no complaints, but that is just my observation.Overall, I am glad that I dined at Bisi.  There are definitely some rough edges to be smoothed out at this new establishment, but the food was unique and tasty and the service was friendly.  I hope that they can scale up appropriately as more people find this place, because even four tables seemed to be taxing the current staff a little.  I'm rating Bisi as 4 stars with optimism and a recognition of its newness.  I like independent restaurants much more than chains and I want this one to succeed.  I will be back and I hope they continue to improve.
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2013,3/14/2014,16,94,7,9,7>First time to Freddy's and I will definitely be back.  Had to try the Meatball sandwich since it was so hyped up and let me tell you it lived up to the reputation...hands down the best in town!  Grilled panini with shaved ham and italian cheeses was also phenomenal and the simple salad with olives greens and some of the smoothest Feta you will ever taste was a great way to start.  Top it all off with authentic creamy gelato and Freddy's transported me back to a small market in Naples.It's a tiny place, there is no formalmenu (its really a small italian grocery store that happens to make incredible dishes) and only takes cash so be prepared.  Everything is served on paper plates so don't go there for a fine dining experience, just unbelievable food and an authentic homemade Italian meal.  Can't wait to go back to see what's on the counter next time!
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2013,3/13/2014,131,471,8,10,9>I biked a good bit of this trail today: from Kline Creek Farm to Main Street in Lombard.  There was actually a decent amount of traffic even though it was late in the afternoon.  Most trailgoers seemed relatively friendly (smiles, "hellos"), but there definitely appeared to be some creepers..It's pretty scenic and there is good tree cover on most of the trail.  The only downside is having to cross various streets.  The visibility around some corners isn't great, so proceed with caution!  I do like that at each street intersection the trail marker notes the name of the street right at the top!  Be careful where you tread: there's some dog mess here and there.  Sadly there is also some litter, and I encountered some high school kids (ones I know, actually..) smoking pot under a viaduct in Lombard.  Kyle H. had it on the money (aside from the drugs, lol): I found, like, ONE water fountain (in Lombard). I'm definitely going to see how far I can go on this trail - it's pretty awesome despite the inconvenience of having to cross multiple roads.
<review# 259,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/13/2013,3/12/2014,154,291,8,16,9>I am in Homer Glen very often yet I never came across this farm before. What a great little treasure in the middle of no where! $ 5 dollars per adult to go to the farm and pick your own goodies. Or you can just go grocery shopping in their little shop with homemade honey and the farms produce. They had more veggies than I thought..and an abundance of peach trees. They also have bee hives (be careful!). It was a great way to spend a nice afternoon. Many people took their kids and they have wagons were you can place your fruits & veggies. There is also a hen house to look at the chickens. :-) Definately will go apple picking here this fall.
<review# 260,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2013,3/11/2014,86,198,4,12,8>If you're anything like me, your first reaction after walking up the stairs to enter The Wandering Dragon will be, "How did I not know about this place?" In fact, one could make a strong argument that it's the best kept secret for gamers of all kind in Plainfield- The only way I event found out about it was because we were looking for a place to play Magic the Gathering at on a day other than Friday, which works better for my friends' schedules... Making this the one time I'm actually thankful they work such weird hours.So, for any place that's in a downtown-y location my first worry is always parking. I used to live in downtown Naperville and I know what a nightmare it can be to need to park on the street. This isn't the case with The Wandering Dragon, as the nearby library on Illinois St. has a huge public parking lot that's within incredibly easy walking distance to the store. Oh, also, another tip- Even though The Wandering Dragon's address is technically on Lockport St, the entrance is actually on the west side of Illinois St.Anyway, I play a LOT of Magic in the Chicago area, and even the best venues typically have some sort of caveat. They might have a great play area, but the storefront for buying Magic cards and accessories is severely lacking. They might have a great storefront, but the play area is totally cramped, too hot/cold, dirty, poorly ventilated (read: smelly), or features bathrooms so filthy your hands feel less clean after washing them in the sink... I could go on. The Wandering Dragon nails it.The play area is great, featuring clean tables, comfortable clean chairs, actual framed posters and art on the wall, a vending machine that sells snacks and soda for reasonable prices, a nice size TV to watch between rounds, and more. Tournament organization is fantastic as well. We played four rounds and the whole thing went incredibly fast. I prefer numbered tables as it makes it friendlier for newbies, but it seems like the player base there knows each other well enough that such formality isn't necessary, at least at the event I attended.Overall, the vibe of The Wandering Dragon couldn't be better. It totally feels like a place that you would actually want to meet friends at to play a board game, card game, or anything else. They've flawlessly managed to bridge that weird gap between nerdy game store and actual cool place to be.It's a hell of a drive for me from Lisle, but I'll definitely be back for more Magic at The Wandering Dragon whenever my schedule allows for it.
<review# 261,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/2/2013,3/10/2014,149,479,5,13,7>I tried their pink velvet cupcake last summer, but ate it way too late and couldn't write an accurate review.  I purchased a vanilla bean cupcake off the truck one sweltering hot Tuesday afternoon and was disappointed by the dry cake and grainy frosting.  So, I decided to purchase cupcakes from the actual bakery to get a more accurate representation of their cupcakes.And boy oh boy, I was not disappointed.  These cupcakes are beyond legit.  I purchased a Yelp deal which was $5 for $10 worth of goodies.  I took a peak at the flavors on their websites and knew I wanted to try the lemon raspberry and the chocolate bacon beer.I stopped by around 3:30 on Saturday afternoon and there was still a very good selection of cupcakes including the two I wanted to try.  I also purchased an apple slice, which basically is a square piece of apple pie to make sure I hit $10.After dinner, I sampled half of each cupcake.  The lemon raspberry cupcake blew me away.  The cake was moist and I loved how it was filled with a raspberry pastry cream.  It had just the right amount of filling.  The cupcake was topped with a whipped cream cheese, which was light and paired perfectly with the lemon cake and raspberry pastry cream.  It was topped with dehydrated raspberries, which added a nice decoration and a little crunch.The chocolate bacon beer was definitely one of the most unique cupcakes that I've tried.  I was worried that it would taste too much like beer and I'm not a big stout fan.  However, it didn't taste too much like beer at all.  I did get subtle hints of it though.  The topping was a Swiss meringue and stout glazed roasted bacon.  The meringue was awesome and wasn't too sweet.  I loved the bacon and felt like it could have used a few more pieces.The packaging is great since you know the cupcake will be secure.  My packaging also served as storage for my cupcake for the following day.  Both cupcakes still tasted delicious the evening after, which was another huge plus.They also have a punch card where you get a punch for every $3 you spend.  You get $3 off your purchase once you collect all 12 punches.  The punch card is valid both for the bakery and on the truck.Overall, awesome cupcake shop and I look forward to sampling more of their flavors.
<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2013,3/9/2014,78,144,13,14,10>Well, damn.I must say, this place rocks my socks. Before leaving for work this morning, I did a search for "bubble tea" on Yelp, thinking of treating myself to one this evening. And I stumbled on the page for Coffee Haus, with many reviewers recommending the patbingsu (specifically the Haus Bing). I saw the photos and was intrigued: ice cream, fruits, red beans, Fruity Pebbles, and shaved ice?  Like, whoa. Yeah, I think I'll get one after work today. So I arrived shortly after my wage-earning duties, and ordered the Schaumburg-famous Haus Bing. The cashier was very friendly and helpful, answering any and all of my silly questions with a smile.I took at seat at one of the plush booths and took in the cozy surroundings. There is also an area with couches and a TV.  Top 40 music was playing on the PA, no country or kpop. My order was called, and it took them about 5 minutes, not a long wait. My bing was too pretty to eat, but in kimsyland, if I buy something to eat, I don't care if it has an image of Jesus riding a dinosaur on top of Jupiter. I'm eating it. And WOW. I see what I've been missing for all of these years. I loved the combination of sweet, crunchy, and chewy (from the mochi---NOM). I almost teared up when I finished the bowl; it was that damn delicious. I REALLY wanted a bubble tea, too, but the powers that be (my bank account) dictated that I shan't. So I'll save it for my Friday end-of-the-week treat. Another fab business just a jump away from my apartment. Well done, Coffee Haus. You will be seeing a lot of me. Beware.
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2013,3/8/2014,57,177,6,14,11>This place has been in my bookmarks for months and I finally was in the area to check it out.  I am a huge juice/smoothie fan and even have a juicer at home.  I like ingredients I can pronounce without the artificial stuff.  This is a small shop tucked into a strip mall which means it has parking right in front of the store.  I say this because I parked across the street because my directions were a little off.  The menu has a huge selection to choose from of juices, smoothies, and some other food items.  I came for a smoothie.  I got the Liquid Super Chocolate.  I don't remember all of the ingredients but here it goes: cacao. banana, almond butter, almond milk (I think), macha, and that is all I can remember off the top of my head.  It was delicious.  I usually use something like this post work out, but it was a treat today.  The smoothie tasted fresh, the customer service was top notch, and the inside had a cool vibe.  The employee who served me informed me about their loyalty program which is buy 9 smoothies get the 10th one free.  I was very impressed with the service, food, and food quality.  I will be back and I'm telling all of my friends to check it out!
<review# 264,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/7/2013,3/7/2014,436,333,9,14,10>Decided to check this place out for the Bear's game this past Sunday.  We arrived about 11:30 and was able to snag a table for 6.   The place was already 70% full and by noon, there wasn't an open seat.    The space isn't large, but the high ceilings make it feel bigger than it is.   The tvs are small (mabye 32") and placed high all around the room, so you are really craining your neck depending on where you sit.   There is one projection/screen tv that is bigger, but the picture is so faint, it is not worth watching.  They do need some 50" flat screens to make this a better bar to watch a game.  Service was great - very attentive and friendly.  They had $10 buckets of domestic and $3 imports.   They put out a huge spread of food at 1/2 time.   Real food - chicken, potatoes, etc - all free and a ton of food that didn't end.   Very impressive.  We didn't partake in the food, since we just came from brunch, but everyone else in the joint did and it looked delicious.The also ran some raffles during the game for jerseys - they did 2 of these at $2 per ticket.  They also had strip cards - which I won $50  - BONUS!!I am either getting very, very, very old - or the noise level was beyond what I could handle.  I could not hear or understand the person sitting next to me.   It wasn't because the sound system was so awesome or the game on - it was just noise.  The juke box was blaring, the game was blaring, and the crowd was just loud and the accoustics were bad.    Decent bar - clean and good service.  Prices were good and food looked good.  Not sure I'd come back for a game, just because the tvs were so small.

Now add in fun, funky, season flavors, happy & friendly staff, and a cute little ice cream parlor. Perfection. I've only been to Tate's a couple of times, but have managed to sample quite a few of their rich and decadent flavors. Some personal favorites: pistachio, pumpkin pie and red velvet. Mmmmm....creamy....velvety....and full of flavor. Each visit I became more and more impressed with Tate's flavors and their service. The owner is always in the shop and makes a huge effort to spend time and converse with the customers. Even though Tate's might be one of the most decadent and indulgent treats - I'm here to validate that each bite is worth every single calorie.
<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/6/2013,3/4/2014,646,300,9,20,15>My mother discovered this place in our hometown and insisted I stop in. I took mama's advice decided to give it a try. They serve homemade paletas (Mexican ice cream bars). Totally reminded me of my youth back in my Little Village days. To my surprise they actually sell Polvorones Rosas (Big Pink Cookies) too. Their is a variety of items such as hand-packed ice cream on waffle or sugar cones, elotes (mexican corn on the cob), smoothies, milkshakes, fresh fruit dishes and the list goes on.But yeah, on the real there is a so many paleta flavors. You'll just have to go in and see for yourself.
<review# 268,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/6/2014,3/3/2014,144,959,10,23,21>Visiting this restaurant was a family project. My oldest daughter found it on Yelp and my youngest went with me! We loved it!The restaurant is very chic and classy but understated. The furniture is modern but comfortable and the tables are nicely spaced, you have room and privacy.My daughter had a hearty soup and I had a delicious chicken dish with rice. I loved every single grain of food on my plate! My daughter adored her soup as well which surprised me, she tends to be very picky.This classy restaurant is behind the Starbucks in an Orland Park strip mall, not where you would expect to find exquisite Asian fusion food. I hope everyone goes there so it stays in business.Looking for an upscale Asian experience with impeccable service and gracious surroundings? Then get in your car and come here NOW!
<review# 269,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2013,3/2/2014,1546,338,39,37,36>What's one more Review?The answer is the 50th review for this place.We came here since we were in the neighborhood after we had just finished our lunch and a quick stop into Kohls.Since Country Donuts is only a mile away, why not run in for a couple donuts? Especially a place that has 49 reviews and basically 5 stars. Why drive all this way and not try them out?There is no reason to not stop in so that's what we did.As I was driving west on 14 I noticed the sign and the small shop on the left. I also noticed that it isn't easy getting in if you are coming from the east. As I made my illegal left turn into the parking lot, my eyes focused on the cop car that was just pulling out. I glanced over to him and nothing was done or said. It was almost like he was saying, "Welcome to getting your mind blown and it's ok to make an illegal turn into a donut shop". I never knew that. We went inside and there was no other customer there. It was just my wife, me and the clerk with all those donuts. I went with a double chocolate and an old fashion plain donut. Since we were still pretty full from our lunch we took them to go.Later on we tried them out. The crispiness yet airiness of the cake was terrific and the richness of the chocolate made me realize that these are truly 5 star donuts.The only thing that would have made this experience better would have been if the cop had turned his lights on to stop traffic so I could pull in. To quote Arnold, "I'll be back" and thank you donut cop.
<review# 270,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/3/2013,3/1/2014,123,246,11,16,14>That was the most expensive ramen I've ever eaten. But it was worth it.After seeing all my Yelp friends check in and write reviews, I finally made it over and waited in line in the strange but convenient sitting room to await our taste the goodness.  We were greeted immediately and given a menu, which we drooled over during our short wait.This place is tiny. The parking lot is tiny and awkward to get in and out of. I'm sure the food market next door doesn't really appreciate the traffic this little restaurant causes either. Our order was taken a few minutes before we were seated which sort of sped up our order. Smart and convenient.We ordered gyoza to start and I had the Shrio Miso Cha Shu and my wife had the Kome Miso Cha Shu. They made a mistake and our appetizer came out well after our ramen did but I actually didn't mind too much because it was a good accompaniment for the ramen.I've had Kome before so I decided to go with the Shiro style which was similar to Korean dwenjang (miso) in color and bold flavor. The noodles were slightly thicker than other fresh ramen places which was necessary for the salty broth.  About the "salty" broth complaints... uhm, it's supposed to be salty. Not Santouka salty but miso is salty so I'm not sure where any of the below complaints are coming from. Maybe they improved their recipe?The flavors were bold for mine and soothing for my wife's while the slices of pork were ridiculously thick. It was NOT pan fried because I saw them grilling the pork on that stupid smokey ass grill, the smell of which has permeated my clothes and hair. Thick, juicy slices of meat and a plenitude of other toppings ensured that there was a bite of something to accompany every bite/spoon of ramen/broth.  It was wondrous and without a doubt the best in the area; even Sankyu.The gyoza is handmade every day so the consistency is soft and pillowy. I'll admit, I didn't like the filling as much as I hoped but it tasted much better than the frozen variety that is served on the stiff side at other places.I thought the bowl looked small when it first came out but the amount of toppings more than filled me up, and I can eat a LOT. Sure, we had an appetizer as well but I knew I'd be full even if we didn't order the gyoza.Almost $40 after tip makes it hard to justify this place as a regular stop but I'll be back whenever I can afford it simply because it is the best in the area, no contest.
<review# 271,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/16/2013,2/28/2014,287,787,13,19,13>My fellow Yelpers. Now we have another reason to visit Oak Brook Mall. Old Town Pour House has beer. *Cheer!*They have at least 80 different kinds of beer. *Cheers louder*And they're all on tap, making it easy to have short pours, sample different brews and my favorite, the beer flights. *Cheers, whistles, standing ovation**has to shout over cheering* there's wine and a fully stocked liquor wall for those that don't want to drink beer. Now that I have your attention...there's more.There's an nice menu of eats too. Danielle S tried this wonderful-looking bacon and caramelized onion burger. *Intrigued*And there's other good stuff. For example, the Grilled Cheese *Cheer!*There's Pork Belly in it *Cheers louder*And a sunny side up egg *Incredulous Cheering*And it's served with a side of the creamiest/flavorful tomato bisque for dipping. It was pure heaven. *Cheers, whistles, standing ovation*Service is great. Knowledgeable about brews. Glad to see they have a short list of seasonal brews too. That's how I got to try 4 Elf by Dark Horse and the Christmas Ale by Great Lakes. If you have to catch a game, there are many Flat Screens for your viewing pleasure, but no worries non-sports people, it's not intrusive. Great space. I'll be visiting again soon.
<review# 272,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2013,2/27/2014,758,308,9,23,14>I came here solely because of the dossants. My brother had told me of the nyc cronut awhile ago, and he finally got to try it last month after waiting in line for 2 hours. It was like $5, and he said it was super buttery & rich with a flaky-crisp outside. Fun for the novelty of having tried it, but not worth the 2 hour wait. When he compared Chicago Pastry's dossants to the nyc cronut, he said that the dossants tasted more like a donut, a lot less buttery and not enough of a croissant texture.I got here around 10am on a Thursday and the cases were full, boasting of a variety of baked goods. My eyes went immediately to the dossants. They had 7 varieties, and the friendly employee offered me a sample. I ended up buying the wannabe eclair, nutella deam, and banana dossants, along with the lobster tail and chocolate-filled cornetti. The total came to $11something.lobster tail ($2.19) - 4.5 stars. The outside shell was flaky in a crispy, shellacked quality so that each bite was accompanied by crackle. Not stale crackle either, thank heavens. And the inside was filled to the seams with fresh, light cream. I shared this with 2 other people, and we all agreed that this was the clear winner of our haul.chocolate-filled cornetti ($1.89) - 3.5 stars. This had a noticeable buttery flavor, but then I expect that from a croissant. Not overly rich, just noticeable. I definitely liked the chocolate filling. It was a good amount injected in at 2 places, with the tips of the cornetti unfilled. Not the best croissant/cornetti I've had, but it was pretty good. I like my croissants rich, buttery, many layers, with a flaky crust so that when you bite in, you get a fine crackle.Now for the dossants ($2.50 each, though they were $1.99 last month when I checked Candice's photos) - 2.5 stars. Needs more of a croissant-like buttery/flaky texture & crust, prettier presentation for a more polished look. Mariano's doughsant is much better ($2).
<review# 273,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2014,2/26/2014,826,1108,10,22,13>Six plates of sushi (four rolls each, and each plate ranged $2.50-5.50)One House SaladTwo beveragesTotal Cost = $37 (before tip)That's for TWO people.The Sushi Pizza and Volcano Roll are a must!  The Sushi Pizza "crust" was crunchy, chewy, and also adorable!  It takes 15 minutes to prepare, so we ordered this as soon as we sat down and then began to watch the conveyor belt.  I almost clapped my hands like a child when I saw the Volcano Roll (topped with Hot Cheetos) coming at me.If those descriptions sound hokey and not authentic, there are also "normal" rolls like California, Spicy Tuna, Philadelphia, etc.  I really liked the Spicy Tuna and all the rolls we tried tasted fresh.  The only (minor) disappointment was the wasabi served to use in squeeze packets, like when you get ketchup in a drive-thru.Even the interior of the place was impressive.  I didn't expect much from a place tucked between a tuxedo shop and Jamba Juice.  There's a definite trendy and classy vibe going on here.  I don't think I've ever thought of a restaurant as "fun," but I adored the rotary concept and how interactive it could be.  This would be a fun date place to take someone or if you are new to sushi.All of the plates range from $1.50-$6.50, and the vast majority are actually $2.50-$5.50.  They are coded by color, so there are no hidden charges, and there were a few dessert options (green tea cheesecake, coconut pudding) that looked good as well.We arrived between 11:30-12:00, and there were a few people sitting at the counter.  You can choose a seat either at the counter or a booth.  They had just opened for the day, so I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of variety, but I was again impressed.  The only thing we ordered that wasn't on the conveyor was the Sushi Pizza.The waitress also gave us a complimentary 2014 calendar with a 10% off coupon for online orders.  The calendar is, of course, Japanese themed, so I'm looking forward to the months featuring chubby Lucky Cats.

<review# 275,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2013,2/24/2014,31,112,6,13,10>Wait, you can review Fay's Point? Where's my sixth star??Let me tell you a bit about me. I'm a proud Cal-Sag junkie. So much local history can be found in our waterways and so little of it is known. Briefly: Blue Island really was an island. Some 15,000 years ago, when glacial Lake Chicago existed, Blue Island stood proud above the lake. As it receded our rivers, creeks and wetlands were formed. Fay's Point, uniquely, sits just past where the Little Calumet River turns back on itself and empties into the Calumet River. Stony Creek meandered to the west. From the 1840s to the 1870s a feeder canal helped keep the I&M Canal filled, and in the 1910s the Cal-Sag Channel was dug, reversing the flow of the Calumet River and altering Stony Creek forever. The Cal-Sag Channel opens for business in 1921, at its widest only 60 feet across. In the 1960s it was expanded to its current width of 225 feet.Go for a walk along the north bank of Fay's Point. Across the Cal-Sag, on the north bank, you'll see some the "ruins" of the Blue Island lock. From the 1920s to 1960s this was the controlling works for the Cal-Sag, the boundary between Lake Michigan, the Illinois Waterway and ultimately the Mississippi River. You can still tour this amazing waterway. Local boaters often complete a "triangle tour" down the Cal-Sag, up the Ship and Sanitary Canal, into Lake Michigan and back to the Calumet River. The more adventurous might take the Cal-Sag into the Desplaines and Illinois rivers, into the Mississippi and all the way to the gulf. Who knew you could connect to the whole world from Blue Island?!Fay's Point features a marina with 88 boat slips. This active marina can hold boats up to 40+ feet. It offers an idyllic setting on the bank of the Little Calumet River. The north bank has been restored with native wetland plants and is a haven for birds and other critters. Across the river is the Forest Preserve District and Joe Louis golf course. It might be worth renting a slip just for a chance to hang out on the river in such a relaxing setting. This safe and modern marina is the best in the region.The Little Calumet River is also becoming popular with paddlers, and offers a great course for families and beginners looking to explore our region's waterways. Check out the Calumet Waterway Stewards website for annual paddling and clean up events.

Crazy good excellent technique resulting in beautiful and delicious cake. I am almost a regular and I have to say they have really earned my 5 stars.

<review# 277,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2013,2/22/2014,92,360,7,14,9>Ah. I think I finally found the "right" BBQ place.We went here for lunch without our nugget. After staring at all my choices I decided on the ribs and brisket combo, with pit beans and creamy slaw. My wife got the pork sandwich with seasoned garlic fries.In the past I have insisted that a BBQ place needs to have great sides and great meat, which proved to be too tall an order for an astounding number of places around here. But here I am happy to say that the pit beans had great texture and depth of bacon-y flavor, and the creamy slaw likewise didn't merely taste of mayonnaise.The meats were fantastic. The ribs clung slightly to the bone, and had a decent amount of chew. The brisket was remarkably tender, and both had the telltale pink smoke ring just beneath the surface. For what it's worth, I only had one bite of the pork but it was suitably tender.We tried all of the sauces; the vinegar one probably goes better on pork, the apple bourbon is delicious, and the Butler's BBQ Sauce is equally delicious. The hot one (XX-rated, I believe) wasn't all that hot, although if you drenched a sandwich in it I could see things going poorly.Overall, because of the high quality of the items being made here, I have my new BBQ spot.
<review# 278,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/28/2013,2/21/2014,363,708,6,17,11>It's Saturday evening, and me and 6 friends are cooing over a baby. 7 p.m. rolls around and we realize we're pretty hungry and do not expect the new parents to feed us. But they do want to come to dinner with us, and suggested Open Range as nearby and suitably tasty.This place is not super-obvious in downtown Batavia; the sign is kinda small and the street not terribly well-lit, plus there's roadwork right now. They have a small lot but there's a bigger one across the street. I didn't get a great grasp of the restaurant layout, but there were at least two rooms, one more "dining" and one with a bar. We were seated in the dining area at a longish table. The menu is slightly classed-up bar food -- burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads. They also have a pretty good craft beer list. I would say though that the layout of both is slightly confusing. The menu has one sandwich section with some burgers, and then another page with only burgers, with longer descriptions and pictures. The beer menu has one column with style/ABV/price and a second, mis-matched from the first, with the Beer Advocate rating. Weird.That said, overall, both menus looked good once you could figure out how to read them.Our orders were taken pretty promptly. I went for a Tumbleweed burger (bacon, queso, fried onion straws and a fried egg plus some kinda sauce), tempura zucchini as a side and an Ace Honey Cider to drink. I like that you have a variety of sides to choose from, and they're all the same price -- onion rings, zucchini, fries, salad, mashed potatoes and a few others. My burger was very good, and pretty messy. I ordered it medium but I think it was more like medium well. The egg yolk dripped all over as did the queso but it was a delicious mess. A few notes that keep it from being five stars for me:-- No glasses were offered for bottled beer. Every beer snob knows you need a glass to really experience the full flavor of your beverage.-- Water refills were sporadic.-- Waitress did a great job with separate checks, but then there was some sort of weird thing with mine, she claimed she had run the wrong bill on my card, but I immediately looked at my credit card app, and there was the original charge, a refund for it, and then the same exact charge (which was correct, based on my math) ... it was strange. The atmosphere was sort of odd, too, they clearly are going for a little bit nicer food menu but it reads like a bar through and through. Still, I would definitely come back for the creative food menu and good beer list.
<review# 279,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2013,2/20/2014,74,264,6,13,10>After reading a review from my Yelp friend James H. - we decided to make Barbakoa our destination for dinner with a group of friends.  I made reservations on Open Table (which already improves the experience in my book) for 6pm on Sunday. The place was quiet and we were greeted and seated promptly at a sizeable round table in the middle of the dining room (I LOVE round tables for larger groups).  Visually, there is a lot to take in at Barbakoa - eclectic furniture, interesting lighting and artwork - you can tell great care was put into remodeling the former Buona Beef location, not a shred of "fast food" ambiance exists in the new space.   The seating in the bar area consists of velvet covered sofas at high-top tables, great for talking and sharing which I believe is the foundation of the concept here.  The outdoor seating area is wonderful and we were told an all-season outdoor space along the bar would be opening in about a week.  The service was excellent from the pleasant hostess who seated us to Oscar, our attentive waiter and Ted the manager who stopped by to check on us periodically during our meal.  We had lots of questions about the menu and drink specials and they were both very patient and knowledgeable and helped guide us to our choice which was the Dos option on the Share menu.  It gave us the ability to try many of their menu items and was enough food for six hungry people.  Oscar also suggested that we order our Malbec as the $5 drink special vs. a bottle which cut our wine tab in half.  We also tried several of their specialty cocktails and enjoyed them all - I particularly enjoyed the Paloma cocktail which is a Latin favorite of mine and one I don't often see on a restaurant menu. The Dos Share menu gives you a tasting of salsas, guacamole, ceviche, tacos, side dishes and desserts - how many of each is determined by the size of the Share menu you choose (Uno all the way through Quatro at various prices per person).   EVERYTHING we ordered was fresh, flavorful and well balanced with spice and texture (with the exception of the ceviche).  Of the guacamole versions- we liked the Chicharon and both salsas were good.  Of everything we ordered, I thought the ceviche was underwhelming -we tried the Shrimp and the Mixto versions and we really couldn't tell the difference between the two as the subdued flavors and ingredients were almost identical.   Our taco choices included Baja, Pastor, Carne Asada and Camaron and we loved them all!!  I think we voted the Carne Asada and the Baja the top two.  Each taco was topped with delicious accents on soft corn tortillas.   Our side dishes included the Rancho gordo zape beans and Mexican corn which in our collective opinion was outstanding (I would probably come back to Barbakoa just for that corn!!)The meal ended on another high note - the dessert sampling which included a tray filled with four different sweet and tasty morsels as well as another plate of sugared fried dough with four sauces to fill them with.  We've been to several other well-known Latin inspired restaurants before but really don't enjoy having to drive into the city for that experience.  Barbakoa is as good - if not better than Carnivale and I'm sure once word gets out, it will be the "go-to" spot in the western suburbs.
<review# 280,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/21/2013,2/19/2014,85,50,10,13,8>I can't financially support Hokkai on my own, so I am calling on the help of the Yelp community. If this place closes down I will cry. You don't want to see me cry. If I could give Hokkai six stars, I would. I've been to at least fifty Japanese/sushi joints, and Hokkai was hands down the best sushi I've ever had. We arrived around 5:45 pm on a Wednesday evening for a casual birthday dinner. The place was empty and silent but completely stunning. The owners definitely invested in the decor and remodel. Don't let the exterior of the building fool you. Service was an A+. We were cheerfully greeted by every employee of the restaurant upon arrival. Our water glasses were always full and our server was beyond helpful.We ordered the Angel Roll, Twister, Rainbow Roll, Spicy Tuna, and Spicy Salmon. The presentation was incredible. The other reviewers are indeed correct; each and every roll was boasting an enormous amount of fresh fish and very little rice. Freshest fish I've ever tasted. It was just such an overwhelmingly enjoyable dining experience I still can't get over it, twenty-four hours later. I couldn't pick a favorite roll because they were all so amazing. Yes, even the simple $5 rolls, which I tend to shy away from. Oh, and the prices? Incredibly modest. I cannot say better things about Hokkai. I can't wait to go again!
<review# 281,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2013,2/18/2014,16,131,5,14,8>I've been going to Clara's for at least the last 25 years.  It has always been the best Italian place around, locally.  Prices have always been right, the food has always been nothing but authentic, comforting, and delicious.  Friends of ours who worked at a local restaurant when we were all kids transitioned over to becoming the backbone of the Clara's staff.  I grew up eating here, and it's always been the same.I am so happy for the Clara's family.  The new restaurant is immaculate, and it's obvious from the moment you walk in.  The bar looks brand new while looking like it's been there for years.  They have a "pizza bar", from which we were given a sampling of the pesto pizza.  It was really, really damn good.New menus, a lot more space, a clean new atmosphere.  There's some new food items as well, one of which was the focaccia bread- it was ridiculously good.My staple is always the spinach fetuccine alfredo with grilled chicken.  Since moving over, they must have changed up either the recipe or the prep for the pasta, but whatever they did actually improved the dish.  The pasta was perfectly al dente.  I can't recommend that dish enough.Go there.  It's a family-owned restaurant.  Bring your family.  Keep bringing your kids back.  Clara's is a very special place and this new move ensures that it will remain so for years to come.

How could this possibly be up to code, I wondered, because I am apparently boring and authoritarian. As we approached, no less than five of the patrons spotted us and waved us right on in. "Have a beer!" said one. Wow, okay!One of them pulled up seats for us at the bar. Two separate employees shook our hands. I had my first Mexican beer, a Modelo, with a hearty twist of lime. One guy actually showed us how to dance to some of the songs. Mostly Mexican songs, with a little Gangnam Style thrown in. We danced in our flip flops till we were good and sweaty and we didn't leave until Wolf R. almost lost a toe to a stray stiletto.

There's doors to backrooms and backrooms into backrooms, yep that's how big this place is.We came here on a Wednesday evening with a party of 30+ and they easily accommodated us. Like any other buffet you usually figure out where your table is and head on over to all the deliciousness. There was always a crab/lobster line the whole night, but it moved steadily. The seafood was fresh and juicy. Their variety of hot food is vast! So much to choose from that sometimes I find myself with 2 plates in my hands (don't judge). Most of it is seafood, but they do have some meat/beef options. Their sushi is actually pretty good for a buffet, which is saying something, since my favorite spots are usually those on the spots fresh made sushi not no container from Jewel or Dominick's, yuck.The service was eh, usually you'll have to wave someone down for more water or napkins, etc. But we really enjoyed the food and we'll be back!Lobster: yelp.com/biz_photos/roya…
<review# 284,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,2/15/2014,48,217,5,9,8>After seeing this place featured on Chicago's Best, we knew we had to come try  the Evviva pizza (chicken, bacon, artichokes,  and olives). So after a frustrating morning of shopping we stopped in.For drinks, we weren't in the mood for beer so we chose Bloody Mary's. They are 25 ounces, and are $9 with $7 refills; I can dig that. On Sundays they have a "Build your own Bloody Mary Bar" but our server never elaborated when we placed our drink order. After deciding to skip appetizers, we ordered a large Evviva pizza and waited anxiously to taste deliciousness.The inside of Evviva is your typical sports bar- multiple flat screen t.v.'s, a Touch Tunes music player,  and a combo of both low and high-top tables. It obviously is decorated for Christmas with lights strung around the ventilation system and mini Christmas trees hung upside down from the ceiling. The Bloody Mary's are very spicy, which is awesome. Between the pizza and the Bloody's (I had two) I left with a serious case of heartburn, which is was fine with me. It was well worth it.The Evviva pizza was phenomenal. Who knew artichokes would go so well on a pizza? And of course, you can't beat black olives and bacon. The chicken was exceptional; the flavor was so good. I don't know what they seasoned it with, but it was very tasty. The pizza crust itself is like nothing I've ever experienced. Crispy, but not too crispy and chewy but not too chewy.For a Sunday, it was fairly quiet (we arrived at noon when they opened) but our service was a bit spotty. It wasn't a huge issue, as we were in no hurry.  I can imagine during peak times it can be frustrating. Today was an enjoyable experience between a small crowd (less than 15 patrons), football games, and country music (my fave) playing throughout the speakers.Regardless,  we will be back. In the bf's words "any place with awesome pizza and 25 oz Bloody's is okay in my book."

We had a tasting of everything on tap, and also a not-quite-actually-beer-yet malt beerling that tasted a bit like a watery maple syrup, but will taste completely different once the fermentation process is complete. After the tasting, I grabbed a pint of El Hefe as we started the tour.The tour was incredibly informative, and the brewmaster dropped all sorts of science on us about how, exactly, they make their wonderful brews. It was fun getting my beer and science nerd on while walking around with a pint glass full of a very nice hefeweizen in hand! The party was allowed to bring in its own snacks, and everyone had a great time. Several people purchased growlers to take home. I would have, as well, but my fridge was too full. It's so close by, however, that I'll definitely go back for a growler of something in the future. The Heavenly Helles lager was good, as was El Hefe. I also liked the Crimson Clover red ale a lot. Great experience, great beer, and I'll definitely bring some friends by so they can experience it for themselves! :)

This is that one Oasis in the desert that is Elgin. Atmosphere:The furnishing is much nicer than most breakfast places I have been to. It is very relaxing with plush booths and great lighting. The glass storefront is always pleasantly decorated with specials or announcements. It is also amazing for both large groups and for couples as they have tables and booths to accommodate. Taking a significant other here would be a wonderful treat. Service:Cheerful and Excellent service. I have gone here over 5 times and have always been treated warmly. There is friendliness from the hostess to the server. You are never neglected when it comes to water or getting checked up on. They are also very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu items and are very adept when it comes to explaining ingredients or substitutes. Coffee lovers will not be left with an empty cup here.Food:This place beats Denny's and IHOP in both portions, presentation, quality, and price. They have a gluten free menu and plenty of healthy options and substitutes. Despite being a Breakfast place their lunch menu is also fantastic. My favorite menu item is the create your own omelet. I had Turkey Sausage, Mushrooms, and Avocado. The eggs are always at perfect fluffiness and the ingredients taste as if they were fresh from the garden. My Omelette came with a side of Pancakes that were prepared very well. The syrup they provide isn't the store bought as it tastes and looks homemade. The presentation is also nothing to scoff at! The food items look just as good as the breakfast food in commercials! The Sweet Berry Cakes look like an absolute work of art. I have a big appetite and was pleasantly surprised as most breakfast items don't usually fill me up. The chocolate mint they give you after your meal is the perfect finisher. I am in love with this place! It is rare for a Breakfast place to hit the high marks in all three categories for me. This breakfast place goes above and beyond other establishments. Whether it is a group of friends or a significant other, this is the spot! To many more sweet times!
<review# 287,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/18/2013,2/12/2014,252,423,11,19,16>This is still our favorite casual local place to go to.  I'm writing an update because we finally got our butts over there to try their Sunday Brunch Buffet and loved it!  We were quite surprised with how many different options they had on the Brunch Buffet, and it was just $13.95 per adult!  They had a cold/salad table, a sweets table and a VERY long row of all the hot foods (both breakfast & lunch items).  I would say there were easily 20 different hot dishes.  Our favorites were the Irish Bangers w/Onions in Guinness, the Beef Stroganoff (needed more Spaetzle though!), the Biscuits & Gravy & the Cajun Tilapia.  Oh, and the Bloody Mary's (just $4 during brunch!) are fantastic.  They even had 5 different kinds of fresh stuffed olives & a variety of other items to dress it with.  :-DFrom 4/22/13:I'm bumping EPH up a star to the coveted 5-star status!We come to EPH regularly and each time the food has been delicious.  From sandwiches and burgers (my favorite burger of all time is here) to pork chops, mac n cheese, meatloaf, etc., it's all been soooo very good.  They have your standard bar fare but plenty of other items on their extensive menu - something for everyone.I'm bumping them up a star because their service has improved.  The service has always been friendly but was previously on the slow side...like, turtle slow...but over the past few months it's definitely sped up and consistently stayed that way. Yay!Also, they have daily specials so check out their website.  Mondays are half-price burgers!  Tuesdays are Create-Your-Own-Mac-N-Cheese, etc.  Also, check out the Events Calendar on their website because they regularly have pairings (could be wine, beer, bourbon, scotch, etc.) themed prix fixe dinners which are top-notch for the foodie & booze-hound alike. ;DThey also have a big selection of tasty brews to wash down all that delicious food.
<review# 288,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/21/2013,2/11/2014,421,397,67,76,70>For some time now I've seen coming soon signs over a spot in a mini shopping center off of Roosevelt Road for a place called Shwarma Express. I made a note to visit when they eventually opened. This evening, while driving by I saw an open sign and people inside so I decided to give it a try. I got in line while someone else ordered and waited for a few minutes to place my order as well. Once I had ordered I sat down and began the process of adding the business to Yelp gathering information off of the menu and business card. My order took quite a while to be ready (a little over 20 minutes) but my food was then brought out and it was time to dine. I ordered a Beef Shwarma sandwich and a bottle of water. The sandwich came wrapped up in a roll kind of like a burrito. There were grill marks visible on the bottom and it held together quite well. I took a bite and was immediately overwhelmed by a whole lot of different than I'm accustom to flavors. The beef shwarma meat was tender and moist. There were lots of middle eastern spices which I can't identify giving it both a sweet and spicy combination that perfectly complimented one another. Tomato slices and onions were mixed in which gave it a little extra body. I'd also say the sandwich was at least double the size I expected to be. Simply put I was very impressed as the overall combination of flavors created a decadent masterpiece of a sandwich. As I was eating and leaving I overheard that there would be an hour wait on Shwarma as they had run out, growing pains with a new business I guess. Assuming that they have food ready this place is definitely worth trying. Hopefully they'll maintain the quality (and quantity) of food I experienced as time goes on. Despite the name express (you'd think it wouldn't take 20 minutes to have a sandwich ready), the Shwarma here was definitely fantastic. I'm going to give this place a whopping five stars and say that this Shwarma did me no harma. This was an absolutely fantastic sandwich and I will surely be back again.
<review# 289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2013,2/10/2014,273,603,11,14,12>Hello. My name is Jennifer and I'm a Toasty Cheese addict.So during my most recent visit, I commented about the duck bacon. This is an item that I've never tried before. Without hesitation, a TC employee fried me up some fresh duck bacon and handed it over with some forks for me and my partners in crime to try. No joke...it is a crime that I have missed out on duck bacon up until now!  It was so good!Another new-to-me item that day was the caramelized onions and jalapeños. This was not as successful according to the flames coming out of my mouth. If you like spicy, I'd try this on your sandwich. It is apparent to me that I am not as much of a spicy freak as I may have thought that I was. I love building my own sandwich here!  I'm picky and they have yet to disappoint. I always end up with exactly what I asked for and that's the way to keep me coming back for more!My husband is hooked on Toasty Cheese too. He is such a bad influence!  Sharing a sandwich once with some coworkers now has them ordering regularly for the whole crew!  It's THAT good!I've gotta ask, but I think they rotate cupcakes/bakeries. I'm curious about that as I do love my sweet treats!Service is still spot on. They do an excellent job of keeping their followers in the loop on Facebook. If you haven't checked them out yet, you really should. You won't be sorry.
<review# 290,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2013,2/9/2014,107,399,6,28,13>There is a severe lack of dim sum choices in the northwest suburbs with Jockey and Royal Buffet being the main choices available. Therefore, I was excited when I heard that a new restaurant was opening in Arlington Heights with dim sum available. I went here on a Saturday afternoon and the experience did not disappoint.The interior is simple and comfortable -- without being either too traditional or too modern. The noise level was low and service was alright. Overall all the cuisine was generally light (you do not need to be overly salty or use a lot of sauce if you trust the quality of your ingredients). The oil used was light as well which makes this a healthier choice. All the dim sum is made in house and generally of high quality. There are currently 34 dim sum choices available which are prepared upon ordering so that crispy dishes come out crispy and all items are steaming hot when they arrive at your table.My biggest complaint is really the dim lighting inside the main dining room which made it difficult to take pictures of the food without flash, but that is a Yelper problem completely unrelated to the food (which was presented very nicely). Several Yelpers have complained about the prices and portion size, but remember that this is cook-to-order and house-made dim sum in the suburbs so you won't find the bargain basement prices available in Chinatown.Jasmine tea: It's clear that they use higher quality tea here. Served nicely in little glass cups with your own teapot that is refilled frequently.Spare rib with black bean: Spare rib was nicely cooked and fell off the bone easily. The black bean wasn't overpowering.Beef crepe: Crepe was soft although not chewy with a lightly flavored beef filling.Rice chicken lotus leaf: Probably the least salty version I've ever had. The sticky rice was very soft and served hot. Minced pork congee with preserved egg: A little expensive but the creamy texture of the congee was excellent. It had a nice savory flavor to it that wasn't too salty despite using preserved egg. The creamy texture does take a long time to prepare, so few people (outside Chinese food meccas like Toronto) will take the time to prepare it this way.Steamed BBQ pork bun: Nice fluffy texture to the bun with lightly flavored BBQ pork inside.Shrimp dumpling: Slightly sweet shrimp wrapped in a translucent skin. Could've had a bouncier texture to the shrimp but overall pretty good.Beef brisket daikon: The beef brisket and daikon were served firm to the tooth and could've been a little softer. The gravy was flavorful although a little thick.Egg tart: Slightly flaky crust with semi-sweet egg custard. The custard was a little lacking in flavor and could've been silkier but this is next to impossible to find in the suburbs.Fried dumpling with pork: Excellent crispy texture on the outside with chewy glutinous rice on the inside.Crispy crab meat ball: Nice fried exterior with nice shrimp inside. Bouncy texture to the filling although the crab was a little lacking in flavor.Chicken feet with black bean sauce: Cooked nicely with a chewy firm texture to the skin. Taro coconut: Done very well. You can taste the taro and coconut clearly without being too sweet. Probably better than any version done in Chinatown.Crispy Taro with Pork: Very nice fine nest-like exterior with a light taro flavor on the inside that matched well with the pork.Pan fried turnip cake: The best part about this dish is that the rice flour doesn't overpower the other flavors. This is also less oily than most versions you'll find elsewhere.Steamed beef tripe with ginger and onion: Nice and chewy/soft-crunchy texture (it's hard to describe how both textures can exist at once - you need to try to understand). The sauce was light enough were you can clearly taste the ginger and onion.Beef sui mai: One of the interesting things about this is that the filling is much like the steamed beef balls (ngao yuk) that is another dim sum specialty except in a smaller package.Mango pudding: Perfect way to end the meal. You can clearly taste the mango whose flavor is heightened with a touch of condensed milk. The dinner menu contains a nice variety of sushi, Japanese hot items, noodles, standard Cantonese and Mandarin dishes, salads, and vegetarian options which I'm excited to try sometime. For now, I'm just happy to have saved the gas cost, hours of travel time, and the challenge of finding parking in Chinatown. I can enjoy nearby dim sum in a quiet relaxing atmosphere without a 30 minute wait.
<review# 291,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2013,2/8/2014,131,300,7,15,16>"What do you want for dinner?""I dunno. What do you want?""I don't care. What do you want?"Ever have this discussion with your significant other? I do. Weekly. Somehow mid-stream, we both decided what we wanted. Me, Mexican. Her, Middle Eastern. I didn't want Mexican bad enough to go against the flow, so Middle Eastern won, but I was kind of grumpy about it for a few minutes anyway.Then I smelled what they were cooking and I realized this place was a win no matter what. Except for the crazy wait, that is. Apparently it was 40 minutes, but through some sort of magic, my wife got us a seat on the covered patio room almost immediately. It wasn't much to look at, but I wasn't there to look, I was there to EAT!And oh, let me tell you, friends; eat we did. This is hands down the best Middle Eastern food I've ever had, and I grew up next door to some lovely Arabic folks who often invited me to dinner and weddings, and this stuff even trumps their home cooking. The Baba Ganoush was perfect. It was smokey and flavorful while retaining a bit of the eggplant. The Falafel was divine, perfectly crisp on the outside with a nice texture outside. And they're smaller than what I'm used to. I suspect this has something to do with cooking time and flavor. All the other dishes we sampled were amazing. The Labna was not too sour like it often is. The hummus had a silky texture you don't find ANYWHERE else. And a subtle flavor that was just delicious. Meanwhile, my grilled skewer entree was just absolutely perfect. My stomach is rumbling just thinking about it and I might have to go back again this weekend.Yum.
<review# 292,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2013,2/7/2014,101,611,5,19,12>I've been saving my #400th review for a few weeks waiting for a deserving business and Firewater BBQ won the coveted title.A friend asked me to head to the area with her for a few errands. I usually tag along if I'm free because it's a chance to explore some new dining establishments. I had about 7% battery life of my phone left, so it was imperative to find a cheap, close lunch spot before my phone died. I clicked "nearby" and Firewater BBQ was the first place that came up. Since my phone died within seconds, it was settled that this was the spot.My friend and I were both excited to try not only a new-to-us restaurant, but a brand new restaurant that had only opened a few days prior. Although we prepared ourselves for a few new-business kinks, there weren't any. They ran like a well oiled machine that had been doing this for decades.We were instantly greeted by one of the friendliest women you've ever met( I believe she's the manager or co-owner since she told us that this was a family run establishment.) She explained the menu and made a few recommendations. I went with the brisket on a regular bun with two sides (mac & cheese and potato salad) and a drink. I believe my total was around $9, which was completely fair for the amount of food that I got.Of the two sides, I preferred the potato salad. It had pulled pork and bacon in it, and was seasoned really well. The mac & cheese was okay, but not my favorite rendition of it. The brisket was so tender and had the perfect amount of smokey taste. I usually prefer pulled pork to brisket (so I really don't know why I ordered it) but this was perfection and made me change my opinion on brisket. The sauces are on the table so you can choose which one to slather on your food, and I went with a mixture of the Carolina mustard and their signature sauce. Both delicious. They will also be offering a brewery in the future, but right now they are only offering non-alcoholic beverages until they get everything set up. But even without the booze, don't pass up a chance to eat here. It's fantastic!
<review# 293,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2013,2/6/2014,104,448,16,17,15>We've been sad and blue around here since Yes Asia Cafe closed but our daughter found this one on Yelp.  My wife and I came here with our granddaughter. As she's only one year old she was unable to give us her written opinion but she seemed to really enjoy the fruit at the end.We had fried dumplings which were really good, dumplings have a dumpy name but a great taste. Speaking of great taste, the soup here was superb. I also devoured my noodles and can't wait to come back for more.Add to that the fruit plate which the baby enjoyed and it all adds up to a great meal.Warning: the physical plant is pretty sparse, it is a bare bones kind of dining room. No real ambiance. Just bare table, some serviceable chairs and strap on the feed bag.
<review# 294,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2013,2/5/2014,216,123,8,25,19>Labas!This delightful, family-owned restaurant has long been a staple within Southside European circles....and thanks to Yelp, an entirely new generation can be gettin' crazy for Kugelis.  When I am terribly homesick for my mother..when I'm missing my late-grandmother...when I yearn for the innocence of my Old-country-infused childhood, I turn my heavy heart toward Mabenka. I've yet to find a borscht on par with the varieties served here.  I use lamb in my Oma's killer Lithuanian recipe, but their selections seem in keeping with Polish tradition and are immensely enjoyable; no matter how you slurp it, it's a dream.  Curl up in a deep booth and enjoy an ice-cold Lithuanian Brew, hearty basket of soft,  flavorful sweet & whole-grain breads, scratch-made soups, saucy stews or juicy sausage and butter-rich potato platters that are sure to soothe the spirit...and still leave you enough coin to take in a movie.  Better yet...snag a galactic, baked-apple pancake for home and enjoy it with your feet up and your hand placed within your waistband in a manner that would do Al Bundy proud.  Oh yesss....The atmosphere is quiet, extremely casual and low-key. I stick with my favorites, which are Meat Blintzes (that I smother in unsweetened applesauce), Lithuanian Sausage, Cepelinai, Potato Pancakes and Borscht. It's worth the trip here for the Kugelis alone. Wat?! I know...I know.  I'm a Kugelis snob..and I have earned that right as I grew up making the dish from scratch with some hardcore old-country women. Trust me when I say there is no better Kugelis than my family recipe, BUT...I will concede that they do a delish dish here.  For those unfamiliar with Kugelis, it is the National Dish of Lithuania and is a thick potato pudding brimming with butter, salt and a plethora of bacon.  It is traditionally baked in a deep pan til browned..spooned and served up with crispy bacon atop and a mere dollop of sour cream. Their version is sliced and much more loaf-like than my Grandmother's recipe, but it's mouthwatering and in keeping with how many European families choose to make it. I highly recommend it for lovers of all things potato. Skip Grand Duke's and come here instead..seriously.  Over the years, they have moved away from German favorites. That's quite disappointing.  Polish purists be aware that this is more of a fusion style restaurant where Lithuanian and Czech influences are present and so things may not be exactly as you expect them, but that does not mean they are not yummy. I know peeps truly dig their pierogi, but I think they need to step those up a bit as they often seem dry to me. Note to those who write reviews griping that there's too much potato/dough, everything is fattening or that there aren't more fresh veggies: This ethnic food stems from a long, rich history of people who ate for warmth or sheer survival with what little they could get their hands on and were oftentimes impoverished  all while at the mercy of a soil and a climate that wasn't always green-veggie friendly. Tradition: How does it work?  There is nothing else like Mabenka around these parts and so a solid four stars it is. Servers are refreshingly polite, kind and eager to see that you are pleased. I always leave with a full tummy and a smile. Save a visit here for a day when you're not watching your caloric intake or cholesterol. ;)  Fresh ingredients, time-honored tradition and cooks who truly know their craft result in meals that feel as they were made by a Helga-fisted loved one.  If a comfort-cloaked carb crash is what you seek..come to The Dark Side; we have pumpernickel.
<review# 295,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/27/2013,2/4/2014,119,299,8,14,8>Excellent food with way-extended menu from Westmont location. Much bigger lobby with the basic decor. But definitely need more hands to improve the services. They provide the beauty of Northern Chinese food to the equation,in addition of most common known Cantonese and Sichuan dishes. Northern Chinese are great on cooking noodles, dumplings, pancakes or buns which are made from flour. So you could never go wrong with orders like: Scallion pancakes, Beef noodle soup, Dumplings, Dan Dan noodle, or Pan fired pork buns. Cumin lamb with bones was delicious unusual dish which on the heavy greasy side. The Northern smoked chicken was unique with nice smoking flavor. The stir-fired green beans was a nice fresh veggie for kids and parents. Every single carbs loaded dish was gone in the end. Pan fired pork buns was a new item on the menu and three kids finished 6 buns quickly. Those buns were bigger than I used to get from Shanghai. Chive dumplings were huge and juicy inside with the nice chewy dumpling wrappers. Beef noodle soup tasted as great as the westmont one. The Dan Dan noodle, however, was addictively spicy with homemade chewy noodles. It looked very innocent, white noodles with ground pork and boiled spinach on the top. Once I mixed it, it became such a spicy dish with an extremely pleasant smell from chili pepper and peppercorn. Once I started eating the noodles, I had to stop, made the ridiculous haha sound due to the burning sensation, fanned myself a bit, drank iced water to cook down, then picked up more noodle to start the cycle again. Somehow, they only had a young waiter for the Sunday dinner time. There were about 4 or 5 tables. We waited a while for ordering food till we had to flag the manager over to get the order in. Then had to wait for the individual bowls for sharing the noodle soup. Then again to ask for the to go boxes and the check. The waiter was very nice actually once he had the time to fill up our water glasses.  Oh, I didn't like whatever (Vinyl?) they put on the table instead of regular table clothe or glass. It looked cheap, felt sticky, and just no no....
<review# 296,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2013,2/3/2014,64,296,10,12,10>I'm what you like to call a Pizza snob. It's my go to food, and I know a lot about it. I can tell the difference between a solid pie and a crap za.That being said, I recently got the chance to try Anthony's Pizza. I was able to try both the stuffed and pan cheese pizzas. If you've read my previous reviews, you know that I'm a knife and fork pizza kind of guy, so these pizzas fit the bill perfectly!I will start with the Pan pizza. Pan Pizza is similar to deep dish a la Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, but Pan Pizza is covered with cheese. It is simply dough, sauce, then cheese (and toppings; mine did not have any). Note:Deep Dish Chicago, what most people think of, is Dough, Cheese, toppings, then topped with sauce.They are closely related, but not the same. I was pleasantly surprised by this pan pizza. If anyone has had Rosati's Pan, it is very similar, but the taste is much better. Anthony uses a top line cheese on his Pan Pizza, and he does not skimp on the cheese nor the sauce. I wasn't even thinking about trying the Pan, but I did, and I do not regret it! Sometimes the ratio of dough to cheese is unbalanced, but Anthony knows what he's doing. I highly recommend the Pan pizza.As good as the Pan pizza was, it cannot hold a candle to the Stuffed pizza! Full Disclaimer here: I LOVE STUFFED PIZZA. If you'd really like to grind my gears, refer to stuffed pizza as deep dish or pan. My blood pressure just went because I simply typed that. Anyways, Giordano's is the standard stuffed Chicago pizza. Some people also prefer Nancy's. Those are the 2 most famous stuffed franchises in Chicago. As far as I'm concerned, those two are the silver and bronze, respectively, to Anthony's stuffed PLATINUM pizza (Yeah, I skipped Gold because it's that much better). To have a good stuffed pie, you need the three elements to blend in a way that one is not too powerful over the other. Those three elements, in order of importance (TO ME), are sauce, cheese, and dough. I'll fully admit this: I am a sauce whore. I could drink pizza sauce for Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner. As for cheese, you can always tell a difference between the standard cheese from Sysco /GFS(used by plenty of chain pizzerias as well as some smaller stores; not a bad thing) or cheese ordered from an independent distributor (who is never revealed by a savvy business owner). As for the dough, I prefer one without cornmeal. I will explain stuffed pizza briefly now. From the bottom, it is dough, cheese/fillings, another thin layer of dough, topped with sauce. Definitely different from pan/deep dish (I understand that all 'knife and fork' pizza is cooked in a deep dish, but PLEASE stop confusing the two. Anthony's Stuffed pizza was amazing. The sauce was not too sweet or savory. It had a great amount of seasoning but nothing was overpowering. The cheese was very fresh and you could tell that it was not from a baggie. The dough was a winner as well. I prefer chewy stuffed crust pizza. If it is crunchy, I consider that a big disappointment. The crust was perfect; I prefer it a bit chewier than most, but this one fit the bill. Overall, the stuffed pizza was perfectly balanced. No one part was dominant, but they were all equally distributed and made for an excellent lunch (ask my stomach... I had 3 huge slices and was begging for more).You know Tony and family are doing something right. They've been around for 25+ years,and they know Pizza. I had a feeling the pizza would be better than Giordanos/Nancys, but now I know for sure. Berwynites, Ciceroans, and all of Chicagoland.... This is amazing Pizza. If you like those places, you will love Anthony's Pizza. Take his challenge... you will not be disappointed.THE PROOF IS IN THE PIE!
<review# 297,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2013,2/2/2014,160,525,6,12,9>I never would of heard about this place if it wasn't for yelp (Thanks, Greg D). I have been looking for a unique Mexican place anywhere near me. This is still at least a 30 minute drive but worth it. I believe they take reservations. I would say attempt that route as this place seems to get packed! We got lucky and only had to wait 10 minutes. The inside is beautiful. Even the bar is gorgeous. It wasn't cheesy at all. It honestly wasn't something I would expect to find in Orland Park. The margaritas and sangria are delicious. They also (obviously) offer a huge selection of tequila and drinks that feature tequila. They even have a Mexican Mai Tai. Prices on the drinks are pretty standard. We enjoyed one cocktail at the bar and found the bartenders to be friendly and eager to help. We sat down and the seats are close to one another. I know this bothers most people. It usually bothers me. I was able to overlook it here for some reason though. Our server seemed to be having an attitude at first. He eventually warmed up to us though. I'm not really sure what that was about. I think he was having a bad day, so I cut him some slack. He was always there when we needed something. We ordered the queso fundido with chorizo. It was alright. I hate filling up on this though. I wouldn't bother with it unless you have a party of 3 or 4. I just think it's a difficult appetizer to finish with 2. The chips and salsa are good. I would have loved to keep them on the table longer, but the tables are so small it's almost impossible to do so (eat those fast). I love the way the menu is setup. I was able to try several different tacos. My favorites were the veggie and the grilled fish. Order these! They are phenomenal! We finished our dinner splitting the churros. These were great too! I would love to see a different choice for sauces though. Maybe a raspberry? That's only because I love raspberry though. The BF hates going out for Mexican. He must be a fan because he's asked about this place at least 3 times since we have gone. I think we may have found our new favorite Mexican restaurant.
<review# 298,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2013,2/1/2014,283,456,9,12,9>If Yelp has taught me anything, it's not to judge a book by its cover. I saw several people I know write excellent reviews for this restaurant and bookmarked it a few weeks ago. It's not terribly far from home, so I knew I could make my way over one of these days. I've been home for the past 2 weeks recovering from surgery and tonight was my first adventure out of the house except for work the past two days. My sis and I had plans for dinner tonight but we didn't know where we were going so after chatting a while and not getting anywhere, I said, lets just go! We'll find something. I didn't feel like driving (which like never happens but I have been pretty tired the past few days) so my sis drove tonight. I was the navigator. She said, you tell me which way to go, and I'll follow your instructions. Yippee!! I get to pick the place! So I tell her to turn right, make a left here, make a right there and before you know it, we're headed North on Barrington Road, so I pull up some restaurants in this direction and Jaded Thai pops up! Ok, we have a destination! We pull in the parking lot on the west end and notice there are several other restaurants in this strip mall, so we drove down the full strip to see what else there might be here for future reference or if we want to change our minds (just like a couple of women might do on a whim), and we end up parking between Jaded Thai and Lily's Mexican restaurant. Now, I don't have a particular taste for anything as I haven't had much of an appetite and my sister doesn't want to be at fault if she picks either place and it sucks, so she stands by my door as I'm struggling my way out of her car, and waits there so she can follow me to whichever of these two restaurants I walk to. I laughed at her like the goof that she is and said, well, we were heading to Jaded Thai so lets just go there and we walk over. As we walk in, I noticed their restaurant is pretty busy. I was nervous for a second that we might have to wait for a table and I'm not much for standing around in my condition, but luckily they have more tables in this place than you would think looking from outside. We are seated at a 2-top table right away and I'm thinking I HATE 2-top tables. They are never big enough and were always struggling to fit our drinks, food, side plates and our phones (of course!) but I was happy to find the 2-top was plenty spacious for our dining needs. We're immediately served ice cold water and given our menus. They are not the most extensive menus but they have plenty of options. It's very simply laid out. For example, they list all your entree options like "garlic, ginger, sweet & sour" and then you can pick if you want tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp. I love this! Simple yet customizable. Right up my alley! I love ginger like I love chocolate, so I of course select the Ginger Chicken. My sis, well, I'll let her tell you herself about her meal but she loved it! We also shared their combination appetizer. PERFECT FOR SHARING UP TO 4 PEOPLE!! You receive 4 each: crab Rangoon, mini egg rolls and shrimp dumpling. It was more than enough for the 2 of us and just enough for 4 people to share. Their dipping sauce was wonderful. The egg rolls were wrapped tight and packed with flavor. The shrimp dumpling did not look like something I would normally pick up to taste but were FANTASTIC! And the crab Rangoon was pretty standard. Oh, did I mention the app was only $7?!My Ginger chicken was very, very good! I was a pain and ordered it without mushrooms, easy onions and extra bell peppers (they did charge me an extra $1 for the extra peppers). The chicken was plentiful. Beautiful white meat pieces of chicken and had plenty of sauce. It was served with some steamed rice to tie it all together. What I love about Thai food is that it's not greasy or heavy like Chinese food. I ate plenty of food for dinner tonight. I only ate about 1/3 or half of my dinner so I have some leftovers for lunch tomorrow and it cost me about $18 out the door. We both skipped the soda and stuck to good ole H2O but do keep in mind they serve soda by the can at $1.50 each: coke, diet coke and sprite only. Personally, I prefer my soda from a can anywhere I go because I know exactly what I'm getting and I'm not concerned that the lines haven't been cleaned or I'm getting some generic crap soda pop. We will definitely be back! I have a feeling now that we like Jaded Thai so much, were unlikely to try any of the other places in the strip mall but anything is possible. Ps. They're closed on Sundays!

Well, heavenly is conceivably light and this is far from light. It's really good but certainly not good for you. But if you have teeth and have to chew food, shouldn't you chew something worth chewing?! If you are toothless, this is probably not your kind of place. Why should you chew this? Here's my recap. ....After seeing other Yelpers check in and rave about this place, I decided to stretch my stomach in preparation for Thanksgiving gluttony/feasting = plan to eat way too much. I couldn't decide on whether to utilize their delivery or if to pick it up but I ultimately decided I should drive over to see the place. It probably would not have altered my decision either way but I was curious as to the layout. Lo and behold, I tried the Buffalo Chicken Sausage which was amazeballs!! It is served  on a bun with finely sliced carrots and celery. You also can choose to have bleu cheese or ranch sauce on it too. The sausage is served with regular fries but you can upgrade to butter garlic fries, cheese fries or chili fries. Given the popularity of the butter garlic, I decided against everything else. My fries were delicious too. Delicious enough to eat cold and so much so that I was upset once I realized I had no room in my stomach for what was left. I highly recommend this place and hope you can look past the building's appearance. It's worth your while.
<review# 300,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/1/2013,1/30/2014,255,326,11,14,10>This family-owned bakery can trace a solid lineage of pastry wizards and bread magicians all the way back to 19th century Germany. Don't let the tradition and heritage here fool you, though. Their products are made with a very modern sensibility.My favorite things to come here for are seasonal treats, like apple pie cupcakes in the fall (mmm, pie filling inside!) or classic heart-shaped sugar cookies for valentine's day. For Halloween this year, they had very creative if very frosting-heavy monster cupcakes, complete with sparkly, spiky "fur." There are different specials every day,  including donuts of the day. I've never tried anything from here that I didn't like, but some items that are decorated to look amazing don't taste as good as they look (see aforementioned monster cupcakes). They also run out of certain items fast. Call ahead or come prepared with a Plan B if you want something specific, although showing up at random and trying to choose from the many delicious choices is also fun. Lest you think they're all about sweets, I'll recommend the croissants and potato bread. Try it for a hearty sandwich or for dipping.
<review# 301,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/27/2013,1/29/2014,760,671,12,23,18>Here's the thing: I don't rush in the morning. I'm that rare, weird person that wakes up two hours before work to relax and prepare for my day. I light candles, make (and eat) breakfast, drink tea/coffee, prepare a lunch for later, do some reading, journal a bit, maybe write a review, and do some light morning yoga. Then I go to work. It makes my day feel so much better if it's not a routine of wake up and go to work. On nice-weather days, I'll even head over to a forest preserve for a leisurely walk.If I don't feel like making breakfast at home (or run out of food), I'll use the time to find a new place on my route to work that isn't Starbucks (although I do love my 'bucks). In fact, I really love finding new morning places -- especially cute places open at 7am. Blackberry Market appeared on my radar a couple months ago and I finally visited recently.I can't believe I didn't stop here sooner! This place is amazing.If I had a larger disposable income, I'd come here almost every morning for breakfast.Walking in, you'll see a little shop area for artisan jams, bags of Intelligentsia coffee, packaged gluten-free treats, local beer, and other little kitchen essentials. Beyond that is a long counter with scrumptious baked goodies displayed behind the glass and smiling employees creating culinary delights. The interior has gorgeous floors, brick walls, tin ceiling tiles, lime green chairs, and fun photographs. There's even a large dining area attached to the front cafe. All of this, wrapped up together, makes for a very cozy and inviting cafe.I stared at the beautiful menu (quinoa salads, lovely sandwiches, baked treats, coffees, teas, etc.) for a few minutes before deciding to order a pumpkin spice latte and a veggie breakfast sandwich. My latte was made right away. It was better than I had expected. Soooo good. A few moments later, my sandwich was ready and it was placed in a large brown paper bag (I ordered it to go). I was a bit confused why one little breakfast sandwich needed such a big bag. I looked inside the bag and saw one HUGE breakfast sandwich! With a side of potatoes! Very unexpected.The sandwich and potatoes were eaten once I got to work. They were delicious and so filling! I actually ended up eating only half of my sandwich for breakfast and finishing the other half for lunch. At this point, it was probably a good thing I didn't order a brownie or something because I wouldn't have had any room for it in my [tiny] stomach! Mmmm.Blackberry Market, you've won me over. I can't wait to eat with you again.
<review# 302,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/20/2013,1/28/2014,2184,1339,17,35,30>Lynfred Winery is still everything of my hopes and dreams, however there's a need for an update as I've now attended their Epicurean Experience.December 2013's menu was based on Holiday Traditions dishes and it pleased my mouth in every possible way.Our menu was:Pinot Grigio 2010 paired with:-Arugula salad with bacon, figs, ricotta cheese and marzipan -Caribbean Christmas crab cakeCabernet Syrah 2009 paired with:-Goose stew with pearl barley and celery root (they substituted duck for us)-Beef brisket with slow-roasted beans and olive aioliPear Wine paired with:-Gingerbread pate a choux with pear compote-Sticky toffee pudding with oranges and whipped cream fraicheI loved every single item with the standouts being the Arugula salad (surprisingly) and the beef brisket for me.Going to Lynfred for the Epicurean Experience is a perfect date activity. If you're a member of Lynfred (which you should be if you aren't already), it's just $23 pp. That is such a a steal for such highly elegant food and full glasses of each wine, plus insanely personal service. Upstairs in the special Epicurean room, it was just my date & I plus one other couple. The chef came out to explain every single dish in each course in great detail. Then we had one server checking up on us and the other couple - just very attentive service. And they won't accept tips! When you're finished with the meal (or before) you can of course indulge in their fabulous wine tasting for $7-10 for members.I'm determined to go to more of the Epicurean menus in the coming months. Lynfred remains one of my favorite places in the Chicago 'Burbs and I'm so happy to be a member of their Wine Club!
<review# 303,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2013,1/27/2014,55,86,6,9,8>I love Rainbow Cow. I have been to many frozen yogurt shops that are similar, but Rainbow Cow is the best! They always have new flavors in, and I believe they rotate flavors every week. My favorite though is the California tart. That with some Oreos and nuts.... YUM.I give Rainbow cow such a high rating because of the quality of yogurt and the variety of toppings. Also, the place is clean, and the staff is very pleasant. The prices are very fair too; for a large cup of yogurt with toppings, it costs me about $4.50. Peter, the owner, loves to educate people about yogurt! I learned about lactobulgaris, one of the bacteria used to make yogurt, and the early development of yogurt through conversations with him.I love coming here and I highly recommend it. This frozen yogurt kicks the crap out of any ice cream!
<review# 304,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2013,1/26/2014,68,129,8,11,10>There's really nothing anyone could possibly say to make a die-hard Johnnie's enthusiast stop believing in the greasy power of waiting in line for ten minutes for an Italian Beef sandwich. Every time I wait in line, there is a family or group of friends nearby in line who came straight from O'Hare airport. Inevitably the person who flew out to Chicago will mention that part of the reason they came to town was to have another meal at Johnnie's. They have Italian beef with hot peppers, Italian beef with sweet peppers, Italian sausage, and lovely Italian Ice. The bread is always chewy and flaky; the beef is piping hot with a cracked pepper-y taste; and the hot jardiniere (I've never been a fan of sweet) is crunchy and, yes, pretty darn hot. When you first go to Johnnie's (and I say "when" because you WILL go to Johnnie's. And I hope when you do you say to yourself or out loud, "Margaux was right.") you will be intimidated. All of these people surrounding you in line seem to know exactly what to say. There's a cash only policy, and everyone has exact change. Don't worry, young neophyte, you will soon be among the experts who frequent this delicious hole in the wall. You don't want Italian beef with hot peppers. You want a beef hot. Everyone will be talking fast and saying things like "Beef hot" and "Beef sweet" and that's what they mean. If you want extra au jous, know that they won't give it to you so you can dip it into the tiny plastic cup with your pinkie in the air because that's extra superduper fancy. NO. You'll get it dipped. Your order will be "one beef dip, hot." And how will you maneuver around the hotness, you ask? (Inevitably you'll underestimate just how hot their jardiniere is...) You'll order an Italian Ice.Now I'm not one to sing the praises of a dessert as simple as an Italian Ice. That was before. Before I realized the healing power that is Johnnie's Italian Ice. Havin' a bad day, bud? I know just what you need. You need Italian Ice. Nothing turns that frown upside down better than shaved ice with the sweet, tangy, light taste of lemon. Don't be scared--that's just a real lemon rind in your Italian Ice. That's just quality slapping you in your grin the size of Chicago. Feelin a little sick? Have a headache or stomach ache? Let's face facts, honey, are you hungover? Johnnie's Italian Ice is LITERALLY WHAT YOU NEED. I don't want to sound insane, but when I'm feeling sick and get Italian Ice instead of seven-up or something, I feel better the next day. No lingering sickness. I might live in Oak Park forever just so I can have Italian Ice whenever I'm sick. Don't walk, people, run.

<review# 306,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2013,1/24/2014,61,251,6,9,7>Overall the place was AWESOME, but what made me really like this place was our waiter Mike...a young male asking if we needed warm water to warm up our baby's bottle that we had on the table! I was so caught off guard by his awesome question I looked at my hubby like, omg! What do we say??!??! lol.  Im sorry but to me I just think that is just so cool to ask...maybe its a standard thing in restaurants, but as much as we have gone out to eat with our baby, no one has ever asked that.Anywho, this place has a nice set up with plenty of seating!  Their staff is amazing and extremely attentive and courteous!  They have a great and extensive (but not overwhelming) drink menu with good pricing (beer ranging $4-7 and mixed/martinis in the $8 range). ..not to shabby eh!?!Their pizza is delicious!  The hubby and I ordered a thin crust 14inch pizza half cheese half pepperoni and it was so good!  We had about 5 squares each to take home.  We have also been obsessed with that cookie and ice cream dessert at restaurants so we ordered that too...yum...enough said.Our bill was $47 for 3 beers, 14 inch pizza and dessert.  They have a rewards club that is free to join.  Once you get 300 points you get $20 added to your card! Its free...so why not join!?!?Its in the South Barrington Arboretum, so it can get busy over there, but otherwise there is plenty of parking.  Its near the movie theater FYI. :)
<review# 307,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2013,1/23/2014,69,457,4,10,7>It is definitely time for an update. I appreciate the many and convenient hours they have and that I can call and ask for an appointment and get one the same day a lot of the time. It helps so much that they have weekend hours too. I like the techs here too, especially Marissa!My sweetest cat in the world who was 15 was starting to act differently and even though she was so traumatized by going to the vet we of course needed to take her in. We had many visits over a period of several months and saw several different doctors. It always made me happy when the staff would comment about her- how cute or sweet or talkative she was. They were helpful and compassionate in figuring out what was wrong. She ended up having a couple of kinds of cancer which was devastating to us, but Dr. Pecoraro walked us through it. She recommended steroids which helped our sweet cat tremendously and helped us have more time to grieve the impending loss- it was so appreciated. When it came time to say goodbye we had a male doctor (sorry I don't remember his name) who helped us. We hadn't met him before but he explained everything to us and was very compassionate and kind. He let us say what we wanted to say to our sweet girl. The other staff were kind too. It was a little hard sitting in the waiting room with everyone else, knowing why we were there. I was crying. I was a little frustrated that it took so long for them to take us to a room- I don't know if they realized for a while why we were there or that I was crying. But eventually they realized and we were taken to a room and everything was explained and several staff told us how sorry they were.We were so touched to receive a hand written card from Dr. Pecoraro in the mail with her condolences. We also appreciated that they gave us paw prints and shared the Rainbow Bridge with us. Losing my sweet angel was one of the hardest things I've gone through but Lombard Veterinary Hospital made it better by educating and caring for her and us well.I brought our other cat in recently and cried pretty much the whole time remembering being there the last time to say goodbye. They seemed to understand and I appreciated that. Dr. Pecoraro also was sweet when she said she couldn't wait to meet our new kittens when we're ready to adopt more. :)The only thing that sometimes it stressful for me here is decisions about what to do or not do- I can tend to feel guilty or like I'm a bad cat mom if I say no to things. Money does matter and I have a hard time deciding what is necessary and what isn't- I want to care well for my cats but with indoor cats it's hard to know what is really needed. It seems like some vets here are more cautious in recommendations and understand the finances and others seem a little more assertive. We did just adopt some new kittens (hooray!) and though we got a free initial visit at another vet we are going to transfer their followup care to Lombard Vet Hospital because we are comfortable there.
<review# 308,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/22/2013,1/22/2014,24,142,19,10,7>Dear Yelp, please hide this review from my wife. :-)I am on a diet and have diligently ignored Spunky Dunkers every time I've driven past.However, I must confess, last week I didn't drive past, I pulled in.  I was telling myself the whole time that I was *ONLY* going to get a cup of coffee.  That is, until I saw the apple fritters.  Oh my -- goodbye self-controlThat was the BEST apple fritter I have ever had in my life.  Now, I need to find another route to drive to my office because I can't overcome the voices in my head when I drive past Spunky Dunkers now.  :-)
<review# 309,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/26/2013,1/21/2014,38,102,4,8,6>Since this bakery is just down the street from my job, I have to restrain myself every day from indulging.  I don't have any nut allergies, so the first time I went in I was a little confused because I was under the impression that most cupcake recipes don't use nuts.  But I was blown away by how delicious they were!  I especially recommend the banana with cream cheese frosting, which makes me want to live in a small tent outside the store just to make sure I can eat every single one every day.There are about 10 flavors to choose from, and like other reviewers have stated there are a few other snacks to choose from too, but the general outlay of the store is pretty simple and frill-less (it's eerily quiet, I wish they would play a little music).  But for a grab-and-go cupcake place, it does the trick for me!

The smackdown:Yous get a whole (or a half if you want) grilled chicken (seasoned out of this world) + a stack of soft warm corn tortillas + a bundle of grilled pearl onions and whole jalapenos + hot and mild salsas + rice and beans (if you want).OhMyGoodnessI only used that delicious bird to make ONE taco, let me tell you, because the rest of the time I simply ate the bird as it was with my hands...I plucked that bird good (see what I did there?). The tortillas just got in the way if you ask me and ain't NOBODY got time for that.I've lived around this grocery store/taco heaven haven for years and always drive past it on Irving Park Road. Why didn't someone tell me about this joint sooner?! Yeah, it's Y'ALLS fault, not mine.Anyway, do your body good and stop on in this place. They're quick, delicious, and don't forget to grab a few Jarritos to quinch that chicken thirst you're sure to have.
<review# 311,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/29/2013,1/19/2014,47,142,4,10,6>Ditka's is now tied with Gibson's as being my favorite steak house out there! They are better than Capital Grill, Chicago Cut, and Chicago Chop House (although these are also excellent choices). Everything we were served had delicious and full flavor!!I had a Matilda, and my husband had the Ditka's special craft brew. The Ditka brew was very good! I highly recommend. I had the greek salad as a starter. This is no ordinary greek salad. It also has hearts of palm in it and a tangy creamy dressing. For dinner I had the Halfback sized filet. It was 8 oz and cooked medium to perfection. I also got it with the mushrooms. I can't even describe the taste, it was fabulous. I do wish they could offer a 5 oz steak. I am a BIG eater, but 8 oz or more is just always too much for me. That's okay, I took the leftovers home and make a steak salad the next day. For sides we got the Flight of 3 sides, which is more than enough for two people, and would be enough for three as well. We had the creamed corn, corn tamale cake, and smashed red skin potatoes. The corn tamale cake was sweet with a spicy salsa - yum!They brought us a flour-less chocolate cake dessert since we were there for our 3 year anniversary. So delish. Our service was superb, the ambiance in this place was awesome. It was fancy but loved the TV's - a must for Ditka's. The ONLYYYYYY thing that would have made this better is if we saw DA COACH! That's okay, we'll be back. A+++++ for Ditka's!!

The restaurant wasn't busy at this time which was nice. We could sit and have a nice quiet lunch. The service here was friendly and quite good. We were seated at a nice large booth with a tv. You can change the channel on the tv but all it had was all stations football yuck :) So we just turned the volume all the way down.  The menu has a bunch of sections. Everything from a basic burger to one with a lobster on it.  For lunch I ordered the Juicy Louise and paid the extra dollar to upgrade to steak fries. My burger was cooked to perfection. It came with onion rings on it which I took off because they just made the burger too big for my mouth. It was like having two different sides :) The Juicy Louise here is the closest I have had to Matt's bar in Minneapolis (still the best in my opinion). My burger was served with a generous portion of fresh steak fries also. One of the best burger spots in the Chicago Area. Would defiantly go back!!!
<review# 313,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2013,1/17/2014,51,217,4,8,6>WOW! It's like I've died and gone to heaven.  Amazing.  Hands down the largest beer selection I've seen in a restaurant.   So many beers I can't even begin to describe how glorious it was.  It took me an honest 10 min to figure out what I wanted.  There were so many beers to choose from that our table was ready before our beers were even poured.  It was a crowded Friday evening too.   I could go on for hours about how great the beer selection was, draft and bottle alike.  The only downside was that there was three or four different beer menus.  You had to hope you grabbed the most current one and that they had the beer you wanted.  I was told "sorry, we're out of that" 7 different times.  That was the biggest bummer, because some of them were awesome beers that I was excited to drink.  They do have flights of beer which is great for sampling, not so great for staying sober. They also serve food, which amusingly was on a menu the size of most other restaurants beer list.  The burger was alright, I'm not going to tell people to try it but I won't shy people away from it.  The pizza on the other hand was mostly garbage.  The wife thought it was ok, but it wasn't very flavorful and just generally meh.  I don't really fault them for their food being average since this is clearly a beer place, but I would have hoped for a little more in the kitchen.  Regardless, I'll just have to eat before I come here for every sports thing ever.  Because that's how often you will see me here, after all I have to try all the beers.

I've never stuck to one place for 10 years before!I've never had any other services done at Cutting Edge, but I can certainly give them 5 stars for eyebrows. It's quick, (relatively) painless, and way cheaper than going somewhere else to get them waxed. I went somewhere else once on a day Cutting Edge was closed and decided to have my brows waxed. It took FOREVER and my skin was red for the next 3 hours. Not to mention it cost $25 as opposed to Cutting Edge's $6. Ain't nobody got time for that!! Just walk in, write your name on the list, wait 30 seconds-5 minutes (depending on how busy it is), sit back, and let the professionals do the work! It's actually very relaxing if you ask me. Like acupuncture, only instead of sticking needles in your skin, they're ripping hair out.See you soon ladies, my brows are getting a little Andy Rooney-ish!

Be prepared to be pampered! The staff is absolutely lovely, and so are the facilities where the services are provided. I happened to walk by a massage room and it looked heavenly comfortable and cozy.As soon as I arrived I filled out a three page survey of my personal health and skincare preferences/favorite products so they would get a good baseline to work from. Today, my first appointment was for a manicure and pedicure in the lovely nail spa area with Amanda. The space is so inviting! Amanda is such a pro! She made me feel completely at ease and made this one of the very best mani/pedi I've had in years!They offer you their mock-tini, a selection of natural and sparkling juices to enjoy during your service. Mine had pineapple and it was delicious and refreshing.The space where the nail services take place features a flat screen TV and relaxing music as well. It also features an extensive collection of retail goodies, ranging from an exercise ball and a new mother self care kit, to an amazing array of Eminence Hungarian organic skincare products and cosmetics. Don't miss some of the lovely items on display at the main entrance, as well. Great prices and services selection.I can't wait for my next appointment, and to try out some of their other services, such as lymphatic massage.Thank you for accepting credit cards and allowing me to add gratuity on the bill. This is a rarity and it makes the difference in customer service.The private lot was rather busy with parked cars and idling cars with parents picking up kids coming out of a suite in this same building.

I came here for lunch with friends and it was extremely packed and the service was a little slow then what I am used to at lunch time at other restaurants. Not sure if the service is normally like this or if it was because it was packed. The food is reasonable priced and the best part about this place is that it's BYOB! Yay! I had their butternut squash ravioli which was yum!Via Roma is one of those places you probably would not find unless you knew about it or lived in the area. It's honestly a "gem" It is a really small restaurant and the sitting is a little congested but overall great!

<review# 319,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2013,1/11/2014,98,221,6,9,6>I was first introducted to Chef Shangr-la during my very first Yelp Elite event.  I've got to say, it was love at first bite.  (Pun totally intended.)  Sadly I don't live especially close, but I think that just adds to the excitement.There are two reasons to come to Chef Shangri-La's: the food and the drinks.First up the food, because without you may not survive the drinks.  Between my two visits I've had the Crab Rangoon, Pan-Fried Potsticks, Veggie Egg-rolls, General Chu's Tofu, the Tahatian Mango Chicken, the Mongolian Beef, and fried rice.  Crab rangoon is something I like, but it's never my first choice.  That logic does not apply to the crab rangoon here.  This is the best crab rangoon I've ever had in my life.  The pot stickers (which I believe are pork though the menu doesn't say) are absolutely huge!  They're probably twice the size of your average pot-sticker.  I loved the mango chicken when I had it at the Elite event, and very seriously considered just ordering it again on our recent return visit.  But I also knew I needed to give something else on the menu a try so I ordered the General Chu's Tofu.  (Plus, I was really in the mood for tofu, and they hae a pretty extensive list of tofu dishes.)  The tofu was firm and crisp on the outside and a little mushy on the inside just like it should be.  The flavor was awesome though if you like really spicy food, you might be disappointed by the spice level.  My pansy-ass self thought it was perfect though.Now the drinks.  They offer 28 varieties of tropical deliciousness.  (And 6 without cocounut or rum if, like my boyfriend, you're made of coconut hating evil.)  Candice G's description of these drinks are pretty spot-on.  These drinks will knock you on yours ass.  Everyone seems to love the Dr. Fong which is tasty, but to be honest, I prefer the Zombie or the Kom-mon-i-wana-lei-a.Otehr items of note: Using my Groupon was easy peasy.  No hassles or arguments.  In fact they just discounted the check $20 even though the Groupon wasn't supposed to apply to drinks.  The decor probably hasn't been updated since they opened in the 70's or whatever, but it's awesomely kitchsy and who doesn't love a good tiki-theme especially when Chicago winter stretches into May...Check it out.  You won't regret it.
<review# 320,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/5/2013,1/10/2014,65,785,5,7,6>We had a dinner outing here, and I really liked this place, and will go with about 4.5 stars for I had.  I had the sushi/sashimi combo for $23.95 and it might have been the best value I've seen anywhere for quantity.  Wife had Bento Box A for $17.95, and again the mostest we've ever seen we think per dollar.  Others in the party had various rolls (quite large again), and chicken teriyaki. The rolls tried included rainbow dragon, sunset , and I Love Chicago.  I heard the chicken teriyaki was a bit dried out, so reviews will vary with the individual meal.  The sushi was not the best quality ever, but it was still very good I would say.  A few of the rolls were really packed with wasabi for example.  The dining space is small, so reservations recommended.  At one point, the entire place was filled.   The service was quick and friendly, and green tea and water replenished quite regularly.  We will be back for sure.
<review# 321,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/11/2013,1/9/2014,78,586,6,10,7>The food was good - traditional Czech / Eastern European faire. I had the breaded pork with bread dumplings and sweet and sour cabbage. Could have been just a touch hotter, fortunately the gravy helped bring the temp up a little. Potato and mushroom soup was good - lots of flavor. I also ordered a potato pancake appetizer which was pretty good, though they were just making the batter when I ordered it, so the waitress asked if she could bring the entree our first. They both ended coming out at the same time - I wasn't picky about that though.I noticed that the waitress was also performing "hostess" duties with respect to answering the phone. She received a few calls on her cellphone while I was there - most seemed to be for Mother's Day reservations. Once it even rang as she was finishing up taking my order. Service was slightly slow at times - but I wasn't in a rush either, so no big deal. Other than 3 people who walked in midway through my lunch, I was the only person in the restaurant.I do wish they could rehab the place a little to bring it back to its former glory. Ceiling tiles were starting to come apart in a couple of places and the restaurant as a whole could use some refurbishing. Not a remodel - just fixing up some of the things in the existing spot. Hours are down to Fri - Sun only - I hope this place hangs on - it's a classic.
<review# 322,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2013,1/8/2014,82,199,10,10,10>My very first casino experience! I made it (almost) 3 years in to being 21 without visiting a casino. I had a pretty good time- this place was some QUALITY people watchin'. Started off playing some of the machines and really, I had no freaking clue what I was doing the entire time. I just wandered around, put some money in, and hit buttons. Felt pretty damn awesome when I won $40, though. That was my huge payout for the night and I felt like a baller. Hey, it kept me in drinks and games for most of the night!We also went in to the club they have on site, Cube or something? That was like seriously the craziest place I've ever been to. It was like old men dancing with middle aged women, old women dancing with young guys. It was a very interesting mix of people. Fun in a weird way and probably the best people watching all night.We stopped at Flipt before we left but the food was waaay too greasy for me after drinking. Plus I paid more for a meatless grilled cheese and fries than my friend did for her burger and fries. Overall, I had a very fun first trip to the casino!
<review# 323,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2013,1/6/2014,42,56,4,8,5>We had our son's 4th birthday party here, so I will review 1) the play area in general and 2) : the party THE PLAY AREAFor a somewhat small space, there are lots of great separate "play stations" for kids to engage and have fun. From a climbing/jungle area to a book/reading area to a instruments/stage area to an arts and crafts room and all kinds of stuff in between. A child will not get bored here for hours and hours. And everything is open to everyone! Just jump in and start playing. Perfect for a rainy or cold Chicago day!Also, everything is clean, and the staff is around and attentive. THE PARTYThere are several party packages to choose from, and the one we got allowed us access to the party room for two hours, a staff person, tablecloths, plates, cups, napkins and utensils (pick your color) and a clean-up crew. We provided our own food (pizza and cake--you can bring in what you want) and drinks. Although you only get the party room for 2 hours, guests have access to the whole facility for the entire day. There are no structured activities for the kids--just free play--but everyone was quite happy with that. It was a great time for minimal work and very affordable.
<review# 324,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2013,1/5/2014,45,228,4,4,3>OH HEY UNLIMITED SUSHI FOR $20, YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A FAN!And to my surprise, this amazing deal doesn't just apply to sushi but with appetizers and such.  But for real, why go with filler when you can get all killer, right?!?! haha. That being said, the Torched Dragon and Blue Sky signature rolls are what you need.  These sealed the deal for me. The only complaint I have about Sushi City is that the service is sooooo sloooow.... Don't come here if you're in a rush or get impatient easily.  I typically would write off a place that had "eh" service, such as this, but seriously, I cannot find a better deal with some fairly creative and delicious sushi!  :D
<review# 325,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2013,1/4/2014,68,207,4,8,4>I did a yelp search for "sub sandwich" and Kreger's came up about 5 pages in. It definitely stood out from the standard Subway, Jason's Deli, Jimmy John's, and other sub places of the world, so I obviously had to take a gander. After looking through the pictures, I was sold. I stopped by the next day for lunch and ended up leaving with more than I anticipated. They have a fridge and freezer full of goodies...sausages, chops, and various sides are ready to go in the freezer, while the fridge has cucumber salad, sauerkraut, kraut slaw (yum), german potato salad, macaroni salad, and more. The thing that really gives this place a hometown feel is that they have a small shelf with chips and candy. They also have 3 little tables with the red-checkered table cover, the place is AC-free (just like the old days of summer)...its feels like a smalltown general mart :) The deli counter offers an array of sausages plus different sandwich salads (ham and chicken) to go. But you can walk right up and order lunch! The choices were polish sausage, brat, or pulled pork. For $7 you get the sando plus a bag of chips and can of pop. Not bad for a homemade chunk of meat! I got a small tub of german potato salad, small tub of kraut slaw, a pulled pork sandwich, and a polish sausage on a bun with kraut and tomatoes (all to share with my hubby, of course). The german potato salad had a creamy-saucy type of texture to it that German potato salad should have. It was really good...if I could change anything, I'd maybe make it less sweet and add a bit more vinegar. But I still really enjoyed it and am glad that I got a small tub of it to munch on all weekend. Speaking of vinegar, the kraut slaw was off the beaten path. I was really wondering how it was going to be different than regular ol' sauerkraut...well, the name "kraut slaw" says it all. It's very much like a vinegar-and-oil cole slaw, but with kraut. It has bits of peppers and onions in there, with some spices that help to give it a tangy flavor. Again, glad I got a bunch of this to eat all weekend. The sandwiches REALLY hit the spot. The french roll in which the pulled pork was stuffed into offered the perfect texture against the tender shredded pork. You got more than your fair share of pork too, definitely worth your dollar. It had a definite smokey flavor to it that blended well with the sweet BBQ sauce that was slathered on top of the sandwich. I really glad that the sauce was put on the sandwich afterwards and not mixed in with the beef, because you could really pinpoint all the flavors out of the meat, bread, and sauce. The polish sausage was great on its own...again, the bun went really well with the link. When you ask for tomatoes, you better expect tomatoes...I think an entire tomato was quartered onto this! The sausage was cooked to a good consistency...a slight firmness on the outside, but once you bite into it the inside is juicy and flavorful. I'm in heaven just thinking about it. I'll admit, it didn't taste like any polish sausage I had eaten before...much like the pulled pork, it had a smokey flavor to it (possibly due to how it was prepared). But I loved that it didn't taste fatty or salty, like many store-bought sausages do. It tasted like I was eating real hearty meat. If you are running errands on a Saturday morning or afternoon around Naperville, do yourself a favor and stop in to this neighborhood meat market. It is literally in a neighborhood, so you might think you are going the wrong way, but then there it is, small and family owned like it stepped out of the 1960's. The place is small, but the sandwiches and meat pack a punch that will leave you dreaming of sausage (does that sound bad? Maybe?). I'm not sure I'll ever return to store-bought polish sausage again!
<review# 326,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2013,1/3/2014,209,310,5,6,5>Yippeeee!  A new bakery in town!  A new bakery in town.  Ok, so it's been here awhile.  Look, I was out of the country for the summer and needless to say I have been YELPLESS.  Anywho, this place is super cute.  I am trying to stay away from wheat and all that cray-cray GMO grains that we have going on here in the US.  SO I was pleased as punch that they offered, ON A REGULAR basis, delicious gluten free goodies.  Yeah, so it's got a load of sugar, but whatevs.  Their macaron selection is wonderful.  Now, for those of you that get easily confused by your cookies options, macarons, with one "O" are without the coconut.  They are typically made with almond flour and egg whites.  Yep, and so semi paleo????  So some of the flavors I have tried are chocolate, vanilla, salted caramel, raspberry and green tea.  All of which were really good.  I have also tried a chocolate gluten free dessert and can not remember the name, only that it was rich and chocolately.  The staff that work there are all super friendly and helpful.  Please shop here for all your dessert needs.  I really want this to stay in business!!!
<review# 327,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2013,1/2/2014,17,96,6,9,7>I'll admit...I was skeptical at first.  Does Glen Ellyn really need another Italian restaurant? Especially one that took over the beloved Vietnamese Mykha's restaurant?  Well, the answer is I am glad it is in town!  Pastas were fantastic.  We had a star shaped ravioli filled with Osso buco!  Loved it!!!  Tons of flavor, incredibly moist and tender.  We also had a fusilli pasta with broccoli and shrimp!  Both shrimp and pasta were cooked perfectly.Specials were hand-written!  I love menus that are ever changing!The place is small but diners filled it until closing.  Jimmy, the owner is charming and loud in that wonderful authentic Italian way!  He couldn't be any nicer!Lovely wine selection too!  And The waitstaff mature & professional!
<review# 328,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2013,1/1/2014,234,114,5,9,6>This is by far the best uber casual restaurant within a marketplace that I've ever been to. Yes yes, I completely sound like I'm exaggerating. But really, all you need to do is go and you will understand what I am talking about.Portions are fair and filling. If I could say something else about this place is that its quite clean feeling. This also includes the food that is served to you. Easy in terms of taste (not too salty). The presentation itself is clean and caught me off guard.The Cali burger is just so awesome; if I didn't restrain myself, I think I'd order this every time. There is something about this burger, with its honey mustard, gouda, tomato, and onion under a whole grain bun that screams 'not too heavy.' Surely, it doesn't feel that way either and the burger itself lends a lot of sweet and savory flavor.#1 tuna made me hold onto my seat because those seared pieces of tuna were HUGE. I had to snap back to reality and tell myself I was at the Standard market, not a fishing boat. They coleslaw as a component of this creation. I gotta tell you, the coleslaw here is FABULOUS. They have it nailed. I even order coleslaw as a side, in place of fries. Once I'm done, I even walk to the deli in the market...after leaving the grill...and buy some coleslaw home. TRY THE COLESLAW.24-hour steak sandwich was generous and delivered a punch. It is one of the heavier items on the menu but gets the job done if you're feeling it that day. Generous strips of steak, some blue cheese (not too strong), caramelized onions, and argula...all on a baguette. Beautiful.As a side, you can get regular fries, sweet potato fries (awesome - they got this one down also - its actually crispy crunchy on the outsides and velvety soft on the inside - served with some honey mustard), or COLESLAW (goodness gracious).Staff is attentive and will sometimes come and give you free pastries.
<review# 329,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2013,12/31/2013,51,151,5,10,8>4.5 Stars!Capri is definitely in my top running for great Italian food, and really considering putting it in a top 5 over-all.  First an explanation on the .5 star that I took off...  They were extremely busy on a Saturday night, which isn't really to blame for a popular place.  We were told the wait would be 45 minutes, and it was closer to the long side of an hour.  They do have a bar area, but it was jam packed so we waited outside.  It was a little chilly out, but they have an outdoor patio area where you can sit around these cool little fire tables to stay warm.  The other reasoning behind the .5 star off was the noise level.  It's super loud in there, almost to the point where its kind of hard to hear each other talk.  The food was phenomenal though!  We started out with a calamari appetizer and asked for Vodka sauce instead of the typical marinara (highly recommend you try this) and it was great.  The Vodka sauce was some of the best I've had.  For my meal I decided to go with 8 finger "Gavadell" (Cavatelli to the non Italian) and asked for Arabiatta sauce with it.  Just the right amount of spice, and the portion size was great, I couldn't come close to finishing it all.  I also got a side of Escarole because I haven't seen that option in too many places.  It was awesome, they saute it with garlic and prosciutto!  I will say it was an extra $5 for the side, and it was kind of a small portion on that.  The service was pretty good, and the pricing was a little on the high side, but pretty much what you expect when going somewhere like Capri.  The ambiance of the restaurant is awesome and would be a really great date place if it wasn't quite so loud in there.  The parking situation is decent, and they do have a valet if your a baller like that.
<review# 330,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/5/2013,12/30/2013,68,183,5,7,7>I have been here twice in the last couple of months for mommy daughter breakfasts. Both times, we didn't wait on a Saturday morning. WooHoo!The French toast kabobs are amazing. It is two skewers. Each have two half slices of French toast with strawberries and pineapple. Oh and a chocolate dipping sauce! I just dip the fruit but I imagine it would all taste amazing dipped in chocolate. The double chocolate waffle is kinda cakey and tastes like a brownie. Only eat if you are in the mood for a brownie breakfast. Pro-Tip: Try the passion fruit juice. You will thank me later.
<review# 331,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/25/2013,12/29/2013,65,419,11,11,8>Don't go here!  Seriously - just stay home.  More room for me that way!  This is a small place that is a hidden gem, as others have also stated.  Very bare bones, and a little hard to find, just a bar and some stools that are bolted to the ground and some room to stand.  No food, no silliness, no cash or tips allowed (though you can "buy the servers a beer", which basically tips them the price of a glass) - just some really excellent beer in a place you'd least expect.   They seem to rotate the taps out - while we were there, they ran out of one item (of course the one I liked the most) and replaced it with something new so we got to try 10 different excellent beers.  The samplers are a good deal - for maybe $9, you get 4 wine glasses of whatever beers you select.  There's a fair amount variety and something for everything, in my opinion.  Each sampler counts as one serving, btw, as does a full glass - you're only allowed three servings total per person.  They may also have a random food truck show up - check their website to see for sure, but there is no brewpub attached to this place.  So yeah.  Don't go here.  Stay home and drink bad beer.  It's hard to find and you're not going to like it.  I swear!
<review# 332,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/1/2013,12/28/2013,20,133,4,9,5>I never would have found this place without Yelp.  The Mrs. mentioned we hadn't been to a Brazilian steakhouse in a long time, and she was right.So I started looking and really wasn't excited at the idea of another $44.99 not including drinks, desserts, everything else for the family to go to a place thinking they were fine dining.  Brazil Express lived up to the hype-just a clean, nice looking restaurant with very good service.  The gauchos were not one right after the other-you actually were able to take one bite off of what was just placed on your plate before the next meat came.    The garlic steak was really good-everything was, but the meats wrapped in bacon could have used another couple of minutes to cook the bacon itself.Good salad bar-not too many items that you end up full before the meal-and it included hot items-good broccoli soup, rice and black beans.  The cold items were even better-fresh and a decent variety.  The boys (8 and 11) enjoyed not only the novelty of the grab your tongs while they slice meat onto your plate experience, but the food itself, which always makes for a good time.  Not the type of restaurant/cuisine you go to all that often, but we'll go back for sure and it's a more affordable, less pretentious, and enjoyable option than the aforementioned chain/chain like places.
<review# 333,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/13/2013,12/27/2013,32,291,7,7,4>Tensuke is similar to Mitsuwa Corp.  We only tried a few dishes, so I need to go back before I can write anything definitive.  What's worth noting is the comparison between the two.  For the record, I like them both!- Tensuke seems to have better sushi- Tensuke takes credit cards.- Mitsuwa has more variety (Korean food, yay).- Mitsuwa has better Ramen- Mitsuwa has a more comfortable food court.  Yes, I said food court, so you might as well lower your expectations right now.- Mitsuwa is the much better grocery store (especially the tea section). - Tensuke is closer to my house ;)- Tie - Everyone is super nice.  I have to try their sushi catering platters.  I'm sick of Italian beef and pizza.  Fish is yummy.These places are good lunch spots.  The romance scale for dinner is on par with a bowling alley.

<review# 335,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2013,12/25/2013,73,240,4,8,6>This candy shop is so delightful, we were quite literally like kids in a candy store.  After wading through the massive crowds on opening weekend in the new Fashion Outlets of Chicago mall, Lolli & Pops was like an oasis beckoning us in.  My kids seemed to zero in on it on our way to the Nike store, and of course, we had to go in and explore.On entering, you can see it's not your run of the mill candy shop.  Lolli & Pops has a room designated to specific categories of sweets including Gummies, Chocolates, Jelly Beans (Jelly Belly brand).  You can find all kinds of candies and chocolates here, from your grocery store Nestle/Hershey brands to gourmet like Godiva.  Most of the sweets here are self-serve bulk, weighed by pound, but they also carry many individually packaged treats and goodies, including nostalgic and novelty candies like buttons, lemonheads, mallow bars, etc.  They even have a Pez/Pez Dispenser wall.  They have a glass-display counter with various specialty truffles and chocolates near the register (where they will package for you).  In addition to the sweets and treats, they have trinkets and toys, and a variety of beverages, including nostalgic and specialty (i.e., Green River) sodas.My kids went crazy in the Gummies room, filling a bag with different variety flavored gummy bears (she preferred the sweet cherry over the dark cherry, and exclaimed over the watermelon gummies - first time we'd seen those anywhere).  My son picked out a couple of lollipops.  I'm a chocolate-addict myself, so I loaded up a bag of bulk chocolates (6.99/lb, any variety) of milk, white and dark chocolates.  They had a delicious milk chocolate amaretto confection that was divine...I picked out one of those but should have taken home more.  I also put a few of clodhoppers in my bag and malt ball chocolates (white & milk).  My husband got the ginormous turtle, some chocolate covered pretzels, and peanut butter cups and also picked out a few packaged specialty chocolates (can't remember the brand, but one was a chili-pepper chocolate, another was blood orange). One thing to note, and I assume this is because of opening weekend and still laying things out/organizing, but many of the bulk chocolate containers did not have identifying labels on them...there were some interesting looking chocolates I would have liked to try (like one i could have sworn was a rum ball), but I had no idea what they were, so I passed them up.Gummies were weighed by pound as well, ($3.99, I think?) and we ended up paying around $17 for the 3 bags that we semi-filled, the specialty packaged chocolate, and the lollipops.  I haven't been to a candy store in a while, so I don't have anything to compare to for pricing, but I guess, it was comparable to going to a Fanny May or Godiva (with more variety).   In any event, it was a nice splurge in a cute, fun, fancy-ish Candy Shop, the décor definitely fit, dark wood paneled entrance, well organized shelves and displays, motifs for each wall.  It was a nice splurge (and worth the calories!).
<review# 336,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2013,12/24/2013,38,164,4,9,9>I've always enjoyed Mickey's. They offer comfort food!It was hubby's first day with students - ah the joys of returning to school. I send him off to meet his new adventures with a snickers bar and a promise of something special for supper. Enter stage right "MICKEY'S"!Their counter people are the best and funny! They always smile and chat if they're not too busy, which they usually are, but if they know your face they chat anyway. Once I told one of the cashiers, I think the "boss", that I was a "good wife", told me, "Be a better wife...so kiss your husband more". See they do counseling too, at no extra price. They all seem like characters out of a book - a really good book. :-)The food is always delicious and bountiful...okay and greasy, but it's too be expected, if you want salads and soy and overpriced there's Whole Foods down the street. Mickey's is real food for real people at a great price. There's something iconic about Mickey's - they've stayed the course and haven't submitted to the times - nostalgic.
<review# 337,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2013,12/23/2013,60,449,5,6,5>High quality dog food. That's what you go here for. Make no mistakes about it, you're going to pay for good stuff. This is not Petco. Now that we've got that cleared up - I am SUPER-Dee-Duper STOKED that this location has finally opened! I've been driving to Arlington Heights for a looong time now, and am thankful that is over. This place is like 3 blocks away! This is a totally do-able lunch errand. I am over the moon happy they picked this spot for their new location!For those of you who aren't familiar, they've got a location in Arlington Heights that was the original, and then they opened a location in Schaumburg, and this is their 3rd location. It's in the little shopping area by Sunset Foods. They've got a nice amount of space to work with. It's organized neatly. The store is bright and fresh and new. And the help was friendly! In additon to the food, they've got some cute little stuff to shop for: leashes, clothes, booties, beds etc - but please note they do not focus on the boutique-shopping, their focus is on food. The've got a very nice selection of healthy dog food - minus all the *crap* and additivies that are hurting our pets. I go here specifically mostly for Stella & Chewies frozen raw food. I also buy kibble. They carry great treats, and also supplements. LOVE the coconut oil i get here.Overall - a GREAT place to shop. Do your doggie a favor and start buying good food. The folks here are usually pretty knowledgeable both on the types of food as well as different brands. 5-stars.
<review# 338,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2013,12/22/2013,56,172,7,8,8>I've heard good things about Q BBQ in La Grange, but I've resisted going there. Being from Kansas City originally, I sort of naturally assumed that seeking quality BBQ in the Chicago area is not worth the trouble. I found Uncle Bub's in Westmont to be uninspiring, and The Patio in Darien did nothing to change my overall opinion.I'm pleased to report that Q BBQ has changed my mind. I ordered the burnt ends plate to go, and when I tried the meat with the hot Texas sauce, I was impressed. Burnt ends are one of the most iconic Kansas City BBQ items, and Q does them quite well. The meat was smoky and moist, and the sauce complemented the taste very well.I was surprised and happy to see that the to-go sauce cups were not pathetically small as you often see in these scenarios. They are a full 4 oz., sufficient to immerse your dish if you choose (I didn't).The fresh cut fries didn't travel well at all, but that's pretty typical. They lacked all crispness by the time I got home. The meat filled me up so much that I didn't feel cheated at all. Besides, my dog is less of a stickler for textural problems than I am. Overall, I was really pleased with Q. I would have no reservations in taking my BBQ-loving friends from Kansas City here to dine. While it may not reach the heights of Oklahoma Joe's, Gates or Jack Stack, it thoroughly trounces places like KC Masterpiece.
<review# 339,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2013,12/21/2013,105,162,8,13,8>I literally can't stop eating here... I go home and dream about it at night and have to go get my fix ASAP. I've tasted pretty much everything on the menu, stealing nibbles of my friend's meals. The Parmesan herb chips are loco.... I love that I can get them as a side with my meal or in an app with guac. The shrimp wontons are definitely my most favorite item, I could die happy with one of these in my hand. The shrimp is so juicy and meaty. The wonton is crisped to perfection and I love the lemon aioli. I mean love, love like I want to take a bath in it.  I always throw the cabbage bed on top of my shrimp wonton and then am whisked away to heaven while I slowly devour it. I hate sharing this app with friends... But that's ok because I can order the shrimp taco which is basically the same thing with a soft floury envelope instead.My next favorite is the gringo taco. Who even thought of this? A genius. It's a deep fried flour tortilla filled with ground beef, beans, and cheesy goodness. Then it's topped off with crisp cold lettuce and sour cream. It might have tomatoes.. I forgot... It's gone so fast I can't even remember! The fried flour tortilla is a treat, it's still soft but crunchy and it gets this butterygoodness to it. Mmm.The shrimp taco is also a win as I said earlier. I dig the steak and BBQ pork too!  Last time I went I ordered the shrimp quinoa salad. Omg. It was heaven. Warm meaty shrimp in a cool bed of quinoa with tomatoes and cucumbers... The kicker is the sweet barbecue sauce AND the zingy-delicious-heavenly lemon aioli. Omg this is a win for sure!!! I also recommend adding fire it up sauce to anything if you dig that spicy heat!! There is also a noteable craft beer, wine, and soda list! I think that really adds to the charm of this place. Local drinks and grass fed or wild caught meats. Even organic quinoa and rice. What's not to love? Delicious flavor profiles mixed with high quality ingredients finished off with a local beverage. I'm in lovelovelove!!

I usually wind up eating at Georges before or during  (or sometimes after - eek!) my league. the food is all good. The gyro and the skillets in particular are fantastic. The staff is fast and kind and keeps the coffees full. it's nice and quiet in there (which can be a nice break from the loud bowling alley) the prices are reasonable.they have a PA system attached to the bowling alley which is super helpful when ordering while bowling (they yell your lane # over the PA system when your order is ready - easy peasy)
<review# 341,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/14/2013,12/19/2013,742,743,3,6,6>Perfect place to get my 600th review on. Rode our bikes to this fun little shop in Berwyn. Its a beautiful taste of a by-gone era. Its neatly tucked away amongst the caballero boot shops and laundromats of the Berwyn of today but it elicits a nostalgia for "main street USA". Hand made candies, deliciously packaged chocolates, and a staff that genuinely loves the stuff. Very helpful behind the counter and cheerful.Highlights certainly include their dipped pretzels. It would get 5 stars but its a bit pricey, but worth it. It just makes it a more "special occasion" candy store than an everyday stop.
<review# 342,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/28/2013,12/18/2013,87,104,3,8,7>I hate Bloomingdale. Every time I venture out of the food desert in which I reside (waiting anxiously for when my lease is up in May!!), I'm happily surprised at what I discover. Neat is the perfect kind of neighborhood spot that offers great food and a nice selection of wine and craft beer in a setting that somehow manages to meld urban chic with suburban charm.To start, alongside a chalice of Victory Golden Monkey, which, frankly, was just decent and did not at all resemble a true Belgian tripel (not Neat's fault), I enjoyed a French onion soup with hearty nuggets of braised prime rib and a gooey floating raft of Swiss and Muenster. I wanted more green apple in my grilled chicken sandwich with chipotle mayo, but it was still delicious. Next time, I'll ask. I hope there's a next time. The BF loved his Neat Burger with a fried duck egg, and we both devoured our crispy, golden shoestring fries ... we normally can't stand shoestring fries.For some reason, previous reviewers expressed qualms about dressing casually here, but don't worry. All the staff wear shorts or jeans and Neat logo T-shirts, so come as you are. It's more fun when you do, anyway.
<review# 343,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2013,12/17/2013,58,179,9,12,11>I love this store!  We don't cloth diaper because it just doesn't work for us, but I do try to be as eco-friendly / crunchy as possible and Cutie Poops caters to that.  Every time I come in there is something new I have to get.  We have gotten Z a beautiful amber necklace, adorable crocheted flip flops, EWG approved sunscreen, and cloth swim diapers.  They also have a ton of wraps and carriers and will help you try them on.  In addition to all of the natural, baby friendly products, Cutie Poops also has a bunch of great classes. We have attended free Gymboree sample classes and mommy and me yoga.  Both were fabulous.  I look forward to trying the baby signing classes and even the first aid class in the future.   The store really supports parents and even has a nursing / changing room.  I am so happy that they are close by.  The customer service is also fabulous.  When Z's amber necklace broke unexpectedly, they helped me get it replaced right away.  I have been pleased every time I come in and look forward to all of the new products and classes they have coming.
<review# 344,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2013,12/16/2013,36,142,4,15,9>There is finally an option for real BBQ in the area!That's right, Hog Wild may have great "grilled" options, but their BBQ sucks!  I came here based on the numerous 5-star reviews by people that actually have more than one review.  I didn't want to get a brisket sandwich in case their brisket was the pre-packaged garbage variety Hog Wild reheats, so I went with a cheeseburger topped with brisket.  I am pleased to report that the employee verified that they smoke everything on their menu in house!  The sauce is good, probably homemade, but would be better if it had some heat.  The brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender, juicy, and had a deep smoke ring.  The burger had deep black grill marks and tasted like it was made from fresh beef.  The toppings were fresh and the sides were above average, but nothing special.  As much as I liked the burger, next time I will be getting the brisket sandwich.  The only better brisket is the one that comes off of my smoker, and since I don't do that too often, I'll be back.
<review# 345,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2013,12/15/2013,70,137,6,6,6>OH. MY. GOD! Although it was one of the most expensive meals I've been a part of, it was so entirely worth it. We got seated super fast on a Friday night. Bonus points. I've eaten a lot of chips and salsa in my life and theirs was wonderful! The only place that beats them on that is Maya Del Sol. But their cocktails? Fricking genius. I got pretty toasty off ONE frozen margarita. Also sipped some of the other drinks at our table - pomegranate margarita and a mojito - amazing. Chef Paco came right out to our table and explained the specials to us in fantastic dramatic detail. In fact, his performance convinced us to get the special guacamole (with fruit!), the grilled tilapia special and the steamed shredded flank steak special. Both dishes were fantastic. Such a bold combination of flavors! The steak was paired with mashed sweet potatoes, a combination that just sang in my mouth. The other two dishes ordered were the chicken tacos and pumpkin seed mole with chicken. WOW. That mole was so good. I will definitely be going back to try more mole. I didn't try the tacos, but they looked beautiful and went fast. A couple of complementary things were brought to our table as well. One was a little dish with four bites of fried dough with some mole, queso fresco and sour cream on top, and the other was a generous scoop of homemade chocolate jalapeño ice cream. HOLY MOTHER. That ice cream was the most wonderful flavor! Smooth, creamy and spicy enough to feel a slight burn on your tongue. I had a bit even though I'm allergic to dairy. I wish I could have eaten a gallon of that stuff. Great food, personal attention from the chef for every table and an experience worth every penny. Hands down, this is the best Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. You want to go to there.
<review# 346,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2013,12/14/2013,104,319,4,8,4>My PIC and I came here last night for a relatively early dinner.  We arrived at approximately 6:30 and although the restaurant was bustling, we were seated promptly.  The place was pretty filled up, with the exception of two or three other small tables.  I do not see this as being a comfortable place for someone that is tall or large in stature in anyway.  I'm only 5'4 and felt like a giant hovering over the small table.  I also don't think it's really a great option for children either, given their need to roam and the cramped quarters.  However, I am young, spry and childless so none of these things bothered me.  The service was great-- as I mentioned previously, we were seated promptly and treated kindly from that point on.  Our waiter did a good job of explaining the dishes and making suggestions and was very attentive.  The busser was quick to refill water and take plates away.  One slightly strange thing that happened during our visit was that two glasses were dropped and broken.  It didn't appear that the staff was inexperienced, but perhaps some of the small tables lend to these types of accidents happening.  Everything is served tapas style, but my friend and I ordered two of the el elotito because after all, we are friends and we don't want to fight over corn.  The el elotito was quite good, the flavors were sharp and ratios were perfect with not too much chile or cheese.  I did think the corn was a tad on the dry side but overall I'd say it's a solid choice and would order again.  I hate to make the obvious comparison to Bien Trucha, but the dish is quite similar, being that it is a traditional dish and in my opinion, Bien's is slightly better.  We also split the a la espinaca, which was a delicious spinach salad with grilled pears and caramelized almonds.  The star of the salad would have to be the altiro vinaigrette, it was light, refreshing and delicious.  The balance of dressing was perfect, it was evenly coated without being saturated and provided a slightly sour kick.  We also ordered the el atun which was fantastic.  The pieces of tuna were plump and cooked to perfection.  A small spread of avocado cream cheese complimented the fish well, and both were atop small and crispy tortillas.  Lastly, we ordered the guacamole which was very good-- we had the mango.  It could have been slightly spicier or complex in some manner but I love guacamole and can appreciate the infusion of fruit to add a twist to a Mexican classic.  Of course I rarely go to a restaurant and don't have a cocktail, especially when it's a place I've never been that boasts fresh ingredients.  It really makes such a huge difference.  I started out with the ala sangrona (strawberry margarita), which was good, not terribly strong and had a generous amount of muddled strawberries in it.  The drink was good, but I was slightly underwhelmed, as fresh margaritas are offered at several local establishments.  This one was good, and a solid option, but I wasn't blown away.  I then tried the al melon, a watermelon martini with jalapeno infused vodka, and let me tell you, I will be having dreams about this cocktail.  Amazing.  The rim was generously dusted with a sour and sweet mixture of sugar and spices, the drink was light but packed tremendous flavor.  It really is the perfect blend of sweet and spicy and I will return for the al melon alone.  My friend and I briefly spoke with the owner, who mentioned they will expand the drink menu, so I am excited to see what they come up with next.  A version of the al melon with pineapple would also be an incredible choice, given that they continue to use fresh, quality ingredients.  My experience at Altiro was wonderful, and I did not feel rushed or cramped as I often have at other comparable Mexican restaurants in the area.  The service was spot on, and the food was excellent.
<review# 347,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2013,12/13/2013,66,120,4,7,5>Wildberry is packed anytime you go on a weekend (and often during the week as well), for good reason. With a huge selection of fresh and refreshing breakfast and lunch options, plus a spacious, warmly modern interior, and a coffee and smoothie bar, this is the place to be.Definitely a fan, anytime a friend suggests meeting for breakfast, this is where I suggest!This last go, I tried the Espanola omelette. Huge omelette filled with chorizo, jalapeños, chihuahua cheese, mushrooms, onions, and cilantro, with salsa on the side, this was definitely an amazing choice. I just wish I had more room to finish it ;) The hash browns are better than any I've had - seems likely they are actually made in house. Add two big fluffy pancakes to that, and I could've rolled out of the place! The fresh squeezed OJ was amazing as well. In the past, I've had oatmeal with berries and nuts (the specific menu item was seasonal, but they have tons of oatmeals all the time), it was great, hot with lots of toppings. Totally filling and delicious.My dining companions today had the Fresco omelette, biscuits and gravy, and a 2-eggs meal, and all said they enjoyed their meals as well.

<review# 350,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2013,12/10/2013,63,74,9,8,8>So glad ma Yelper homies turned me on this this place! (What's with my reviews today and my slangish impulses?) I as I write this, there are 5 delicious Pie Boss pies cooling in my kitchen (3 spinach and feta and 2 spicy lamb, baked from frozen in 1 quick hour). You can cook them up in less time, but I like my Pie Boss like I like ma ladies..."brown, hot, savory and flaky. OK, bad metaphor. Especially since my wife is white as the driven snow and burns thinking about the sun.But now I'm eating a spicy lamp pie, and the degree of umami-ness, lean lamb and savory spicy gravy is tear-inducing. And there are only three things that can make me weep like this...schmaltzy TV, great food or great lovin (note that lack of "g" makes all the difference). Too much? Oversharing? Dang, but you know I'm feeling this, homeslice!  But I digress.Since we live no where near Pie Boss or Aurora, when I'm in the Route 59 Naper-Aura (or AuroraVille?) area visiting my in-laws, we drive over to stock up on frozen pies and beef pasties. And let me tell you, they bake up really really well. Rising high and fluffy in ma oven. Like pies should. I daresay, they even appear to rise higher at home than I see in the display case at PB! Could be an optical illusion through. I'll take a picture so you can compare.Earlier this week I baked up a couple spinach and fetas (which us cool folks in the know refer to as "SF" (after the handy dough initials they place on top of each pie), as well as a couple beef pasties. And we loved them all. Note: There's nothing like a savory beef pasty at midnight, after watching "The Bridge" "Ray Donovan" and "Hell on Wheels" back to back Try it. You'll never go back to normal TV watching / Pie eating again!Anyway, engineering a way to bring a fresh pie to work  for lunch was a bit of, well, engineering...but well worth it.1. 7:00 am, wake, grumble, stagger, pull frozen pie from freezer, and bake at 350 while getting ready for work. No, I don't bother with pre-heating (that's for nerds and people who have patience or an attention span).2. In 1 hour, remove from oven with kitchen towel, cradling the bottom.3. Refrain from eating spicy lamp immediately. This is the hardest part.4. Place in lunch bag, still in kitchen towel, with the top uncovered to avoid soggification (that's a thing).5. 10:30 am. Make cubicle mates jealous as the scent wafts across your pens, and you dig in while at your desk, because you can't wait for lunch.6. Repeat for the next 4 days, with spinach and feta and beef pasties, feeling special and rewarded by the universe. Because you better take advantage of your first world privileges buddy! You're living at the height of debaucherous New Rome before the fall! It's your duty to live it up, while the rest of humanity suffers! You are of this time and this moment! Live! Now! But I digress...Go. Eat Pie Boss pies any way you can get them.Enrich your existence. Note: The beef pasty is shaped like a football, unlike the rest of them, which are shaped like pies. So the beef pasty doesn't need letters. So quit harassing me!
<review# 351,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2013,12/9/2013,160,353,4,5,5>We went on a Wednesday night at around 7pm.  Didn't realize the Cubs and the White Sox were both playing, and the Village Tavern had a "All you can eat fried fish" special.  It was packed.  We were told it would be at least a 40 minute wait.  We were not in a hurry, it was nice outside, so we sat on a bench outside of their entrance and waited.My son arrived first and put our name in. I was very impressed - they don't use beepers, they text you every 10 minutes or so with an update and when your table is ready.  Wow. Technology is great.  And, they called us after only about 10 minutes rather than the 40 they originally said.The server was pleasant, but clearly had too much on her plate. (No pun intended.)  I think she simply had too many  table to give everyone the attention they needed. I don't fault her - she was very attentive when she was at the table. In addition, she was training someone which I'm sure took some of her time.They have an extensive menu - lots of options.  I chose to have their Cuban sandwich and fries.  No alcohol that night even though we were at a bar - Coke for me.  There are TV sets everywhere. Most of them had one of the baseball games on, but I know I saw at least one with golf, hockey and a few other sports.  So, if you want to go to a hometown, local place where you can watch a game and have some home cooked food, this is the place.The Cuban sandwich was good. I would say that it was outstanding but the bread was lacking - it was simply not as good as true a Cuban sandwich. The innards of the sandwich were another story.  They were fantastic.  Probably among the best I've ever had.  So, the bread hurt the overall score.But, a wise person (not me) wrote in a recent review for another restaurant something like  "if you want Indian food, don't go to an Italian restaurant".  Makes sense to me.  I went to a greek diner and order Cuban food.  In retrospect, it was probably better than I might have expected.Village Tavern and Grill is a great local place.  Stay away from busy hours - all you can eat nights, and it can be a wonderful experience.
<review# 352,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2013,12/8/2013,31,287,2,7,4>Wow, this is a first. A posh interior and piano music playing from the speakers for a sushi restaurant. Sake Sushi and Grill is probably one of the most fashionable additions to Schaumburg. I felt like I was underdressed and should have worn a sport coat. Rather than asking me to leave since I was in shorts, I was given a warm welcome from the manager. Expecting the menu to be overly expensive, I was shocked to see the lunch special that includes 3 maki rolls, soup, and salad for only $11.95. We ordered the sweet potato roll, spider roll, spicy tuna, fire dragon, and tempura udon. The maki rolls were prepared well from the temperature of the fish to the texture of the rice - bonus points for the right ratio of rice, creativity, and presentation. Service was great too and the manager even came by for follow up. If you are used to eating sushi in the city, then you'll be used to seeing $5-7 for basic rolls and $12-17 for larger fancier rolls. Even if you are not a fan of sushi, there are plenty of other items to choose from like pad thai, Mongolian beef, and fried rice. Sake Sushi, upscale sushi without the heavy cost. Stay classy, Schaumburg.
<review# 353,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/1/2013,12/7/2013,158,280,5,10,6>How can I give this place anything less than a perfect score? The workouts have transformed my body and the community has boosted my confidence.I've worked out here for 10 months. When I started, I had just finished my first marathon and thought I was in pretty good shape. But, all that running really battered my body over time.  I could run, sure, but I couldn't do a proper push up, my squats sucked and my core strength was nonexistant. I was struggling with lingering injuries and had a generally soft physique.Now, my body is completely different.  I'm stronger, I'm leaner and I'm faster. Despite running less, I'm running faster.  I started with the foundations program to get down all the lingo and form, then moved into the twice weekly endurance workouts. These are designed to enhance your athletic performance elsewhere, which is exactly what I wanted. All summer, I faithfully got up at 5:15 a.m. to take the 6 a.m. class.And faithfully, my body has responded in kind.  I recently completed my first half Ironman triathlon (1.2-mile swim, 56-mile bike and 13.1-mile run) and felt fantastic. I was ready to work out again the next day and am regularly more sore after a CrossFit workout than I was after traveling 70.3 miles under my own power in one day.If you're thinking about trying it, just do it. Everyone can do CrossFit - everything can be scaled. The 11 a.m. Saturday workout is free, so check it out.
<review# 354,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2013,12/6/2013,239,635,10,15,12>YUM, won my heart and palate.We stopped in on a very busy Sunday afternoon and the heavenly BBQ scent wafting all the way to the parking lot had my mouth watering before reaching the door.I had the beef brisket plate.  The meat was soooooooooooooooooooooo tender I did not require a knife.  It comes with the North Carolina Vinegar Sauce and I added some Memphis Sweet sauce ~ mouth-watering.  There are also 2 other choices of BBQ sauces available on the table for your dining pleasure.  All the sides we had were, also, very tasty.  They included salad, baked beans, Q-slaw, and the Q-pups.  Needless to say, we cleaned our plates and were totally full.  We even purchased 2 of the sauces to bring home.It is a small place and I can imagine it gets very crowed at peak times.  You order at the register, are given a number, you find a table, and they bring the food to you.If only the windows opened, that would make this absolutely perfect, since there is no outdoor seating.I will return and try some other offering.
<review# 355,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/26/2013,12/5/2013,79,174,19,9,8>Reaaaaaaally wish I hadn't discovered this place like, 7 weeks before our wedding. Ugh. It's TOO good.So the fiancé and I were in downtown Naperville at Two Bostons, buying delightful overpriced treats for the pooches, when he decided he wanted 5 Guys for dinner. Eh. I don't love 5 Guys. So I walked the other way down Chicago, thinking I'd find something edible. I stopped in front of Cookie Dough Creations and thought to myself "hey, that sounds amazing. Who CARES if you're not supposed to eat raw cookie dough?! And who cares if you're definitely not supposed to eat it for dinner?! I'm 29 years old dammit and I'll have cookie dough for dinner if I damn well please!" I marched in, resolute in my decision to slip into a diabetic coma.This place smells exactly like every single ice cream shop you ever went into as a kid. And it looks like it, too. There was a line when I came in, so it was difficult to view all of the options they have. Luckily, I saw two little words that made it unnecessary to see all of my options: FAT ELVIS.Ahhhh yes, rich banana ice cream swirled with enormous gobs of peanut butter and a crisp chocolate ribbon of goodness. I don't care if the next tub over was full of twenty dollar bills, I chose the right flavor. I thought the fiancé would wind up splitting this with me, and we both have a mega sweet tooth, so I ordered a large. WHOA ARE THE PORTIONS GINORMOUS. The poor girl must have put four giant scoops into the cauldron-sized cup I ordered. I felt a little silly. And then came those magical words: "and what type of cookie dough?"YES FRIENDS, THERE IS RAW COOKIE DOUGH. But hey, take those leather chaps off - it's not THAT rebellious. It's safe to eat because they don't use raw egg. Wait, wait. Put those chaps back on. This is a g-rated review.  They have about 10 types of raw cookie dough, each one sounding more delicious than the last. I decided because I'd gone so zany with the ice cream flavor, I'd keep it classic and went with chocolate chip cookie dough. She scoops two GINORMOUS balls of raw cookie dough onto the top of my mountain of ice cream, and hands me the whole concoction. It weighed about three tons and cost me SEVEN bucks, which is admittedly insane, but how many places in Naperville offer me raw cookie dough?! Exactly. If they'd knock a dollar or so off the price, this place would be 5-star, but that's okay - maybe the expense will keep me safely out of gorging range.It took us two spoons and SERIOUSLY at least a half an hour to tackle that mountain o' goodness, but oh man was it worth it. SO worth it. I'd go back tomorrow. I'd go back every day.i mean for as long as my body would fit through their front door.

They never were and I should have called ahead. Fast forward a few years and I am working in La Grange. I finally called ahead, and they were open. The planets were aligned.  The burger pro on the phone wanted to take my order and after going over the menu for 30 mins prior to my phone call I decided on the Smokey Gucamole burger.This place just oozes blue collar pulling up to it. I beat the lunch rush and I am able to grab a seat inside.The burger pro puts this mound of beef, guaca goodness, and bacon on a paper plate, and with a half order of golden brown fries. Don't forget that a RC Cola goes well with this.I put some nice green habanero hot sauce on this puppy, and I was sold. Burger just has the right amount of spices and seared well. I wanted to hug the man who made this.You won't find a burger place like this that will give you a meal for around $10. The other burger places will charge $10 just for the burger. I feel just the right amount of fullness. My wallet is happy and my mouth. I can finish the rest of my work day satisfied.I am coming for you next GRAVY FRIES BROTHAAA!!!!!

Well, hot damn, this place had it all!The food was clever and different. The beers were generally delicious. Sure, we were tucked in the back with the other families but I didn't mind. We had plenty of room and a fairly attentive waitress. Everything tasted fresh and the growler of Hop Slayer I took home made the weekend that much tastier. I'd gladly go back. There are plenty of other beers and menu items I'd love to try.
<review# 358,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2013,12/2/2013,168,718,4,7,6>I love this bakery.  I have loved this bakery since I was 12, and we first moved into the area.  I have loved these foods since my sister worked here 14 years ago, and would bring us home delicious goodies from the shelves.The inside isn't big--but then again, it doesn't need to be.  It's a carry-out only establishment, and there's no room to sit down inside anywhere and eat your delicious goodies.  I have been in the bakery about 100 times.  This morning, there were a bunch of teenage girls running the front counter.  They were fast, efficient, and tired, it seemed like.  None of them smiled, but it's cool.  I got my delicious goodies!Their donuts are soooooooooooooo good!  We got a few different kinds (chocolate cake, raised, braided, and powdered) and every single one of them is melt-in-your-mouth fantastic.  The blueberry muffin was really fresh and had a plethora of blueberries.  It wasn't dried out or anything like some muffins can get.The cookies the kids got were really good too.  Well, I assume they were since they devoured them in record time!My total for two huge cookies, 1/2 dozen donuts and a blueberry muffin was around $15.  So not the cheapest around, but it definitely worth the "dough" (see what I did there?!)I can't wait to revisit again so I can relive my childhood over and over!
<review# 359,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/15/2013,12/1/2013,10,43,5,9,3>I'll be honest, we were avoiding this place out of sheer principal (we thought nothing with Yummy in the name can be such), but after hearing a ringing endorsement from our local hairdresser (who better to trust with food than your hairdresser?) we figured we'd stop in for appetizers to see how it was. HOLY COW it was amazing and beautiful and friendly and fast and everything I could ever want! First, they completely remodeled, making the interior chic-er than anything I've ever seen in the 60021. Second, the sushi was some of the freshest I've ever had in land-locked IL. I didn't see a heli-pad on the roof, but I can't figure out how else they're getting such awesomely fresh tuna and salmon. No fishy aftertaste whatsoever. Third, they were SUPER accommodating and friendly when it came to my gluten-free requests. It's already embarrassing and difficult enough to deal with a food allergy, so when a place makes you feel like you're imposing by making special requests, it can really ruin a night out. Yummy jumped on my first question about a particular sauce, and immediately suggested several gluten-free options, and ultimately customized a dish for me. I ended up with the veggie, GF, pineapple fried rice, and it was delicious (never would have imagined fried rice with raisins, but now I doubt I'll happily eat it any other way). I simply can't wait for my husband to work late one night soon so I can get a whole carton of take-out for myself. I think it will pair divinely with bad Netflix B movies. BUT, that's not to say I didn't enjoy eating it in the comfortable, beautifully remodeled restaurant. My husband got General Tao's chicken and he inhaled it. It smelled fantastic and I know he's also looking forward to a repeat performance soon. My only complaint is with this place now being open, and so close to Dominick's, I may never go grocery shopping or cook anything ever again... it's so much easier, and tastier, to just pick up, or stop in, at Yummy!
<review# 360,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/26/2013,11/30/2013,118,202,6,8,5>Oh man!  The scallops in garlic sauce themselves would be enough to keep me coming back for more.  I was expecting garlic butter covering some scallops with a heaping off veggies, but what I got was a heaping of scallops and tasty mushrooms in a unfamiliar but very tasty sauce that carried a garlic flavor!The SO and I also tried the beef and beans (I can't remember the exact dish name) that almost tasted a little like dan-dan, but were simple and very tasty.The meal came with a nice helping of well-cooked white rice and plenty of food, hot tea, and water.  The food was prepared very quickly and pretty close together - though in 2 separate trips.The bill and prices are all reasonable and the restaurant was clean (despite a few non-obtrusive but un-bussed tables - see the next comment).  Definitely a place I have no problem dropping in to.I can't complain per-say, but I did feel a bit bad for the one waitress (/owner I'd guess).  She was working super hard to take care of the register, phone orders, 2 large family tables, 2 smaller tables, and our pair.  Basic things took a little longer because of that, but she was very helpful, and we never had to ask twice for anything.  This could be because it was late on a Sunday night, but I might think about calling your order in if you are in a rush.No matter what though... GREAT food and I will be back!
<review# 361,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2013,11/29/2013,261,335,5,7,12>Well, I will just step right up on the band wagon with the rest of my Yelp friends (and I am in good company) because this little throw back movie house is a true gem.From the marquee outside, to the girl selling tickets in an actual ticket booth, to the old fashioned containers for popcorn, to the velvet seats housed in a jumbo movie theater this blast from the past is clean, fun, and utterly charming.Glance at the filigree walls, the framed stage, and you will expect to see the Phantom of the Opera. The chandeliers from the entry way on in are quite lovely and the guys selling popcorn are all dolls. These are just some of the very special nuances that have all but been forgotten these days. But what will totally steal your heart is the unbelievably gifted guy knocking himself out on this huge organ prior to the start of the show. And there is no lacking in applause for him either. What is his super sweet finish, you might ask? A rousing rendition of Hooray for Hollywood, and with that the organ lowers and he vanishes from sight!Not only will you enjoy the film, you will get what you paid for, and be thoroughly entertained in the process. As you leave the theatre, you are offered complimentary mints and are thanked for your patronage.After it's all over you may find yourself blinking as to what just happened here, but I guarantee you will be back.
<review# 362,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2013,11/28/2013,270,833,5,12,4>When you first walk in, you will realize this is not your typical sushi bar. It's more modern, looks more like a bar than a sushi place. Besides their...weird music selection, I was impressed! I'm not sure what the bar scene is like here later on, but the restaurant was nice.Our waitress was very friendly and accommodating. On weeknights, they have an amazing $12.99 deal where you get soup and a half salad, 2 sushi rolls, and 3 nigiri. You don't leave hungry!! So much food for so little money! We each got a drink as well that was very tasty, and Yelp had a check-in deal for a free appetizer (chef's choice) that we used as well. Everything tasted great, was fresh, and was served quickly. I was impressed! They have a fruit roll as well (I don't think I've seen that anywhere else), and that was good! Definitely worth trying.
<review# 363,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2013,11/27/2013,304,479,5,4,5>I will admit: I went into TopGolf with mixed emotions.  Firstly, I hadn't eaten yet, and was a little crabby/hangry, which I'm sure my counterpart did not appreciate.  Second, I hadn't swung a golf club in *at least* 13 years, and never really thought I was that good back when I played on a regular basis (on the golf team, in high school.)  The BF assured me that we would have fun, so, I put on a smile, and super dusty golf clubs in hand, figured it was worth a shot.When we arrived (just before noon on a Sunday) we were told it was about a 45 minute wait, so we put our name in and went to the bar to get something to eat/drink.  I was probably way too happy to see the build your own bloody mary bar as we approached.  We were greeted/served promptly, including said build your own bloody bar, which had everything you could ever want (carrots, celery, horseradish, bacon, cheese, olives, pepperoncini, and about 20 different hot sauces.)  I ordered the eggs benedict off of the brunch menu, with sweet potato fries instead of the breakfast potatoes (I couldn't decide what I wanted, mmkay?)The benedict was really good.  I mean, REALLY REALLY good.  No skimping on hollendaise here, and the eggs were perfectly poached.  I was in eggy fat-kid heaven.  There was also no skimping on the bloody - with your choice of three vodkas, I'm fairly certain this might have been a free-pour, with a souvenir mason jar glass to take home!On to the golfing.  Free club rentals, which I will keep in mind for next time, instead of hauling mine around.  Fun games to play rather than just using the driving range (I beat the BF in points on every game... maybe I'm better than I thought?!)  Bar service on the "range," 2 thumbs up.  Giant industrial  heaters, even better!We "golfed" for a solid few hours, with no pressure to give up our "stall" for other patrons.  We also left with extra dollars toward more golf in the future!I definitely see a return trip to TopGolf happening soon!
<review# 364,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/12/2013,11/26/2013,72,114,7,7,7>Pregnancy is a screwy thing. I've been craving Sauerkraut like mad, even though I rarely eat it, and I had never even bought it before, just gotten it at restaurants. But suddenly I was on a mission to make some Kielbasa and Sauerkraut.Except i didn't know where the hell to buy any, or what the hell to do with it. Yelp luckily led me to Village Market Place, and a polish friend of mine gave me some tips of how to cook it, even though he's generally distrustful of short irish people. I don't know if it's a height thing, or he just assumes we're all leprechauns, but I felt fully prepared on my excursion to Village Market.Produce selection is awesome, and prices are great. We also picked up some killer guacamole and salsa from the deli counter, that lasted a whole 30 seconds in our house, as the little monster loved them too. Blue cheese olives from the deli were also really good, but i didn't share those, because i'm a jerk. The place is clean, which is definitely a plus, but what was really cool is that the people that work there are really, really nice. Which was confusing and surprising. How did they find that many nice and helpful people? It was also way less packed than Caputo's, which always turns shopping trips into shopping cart jousting matches.
<review# 365,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/29/2013,11/24/2013,14,102,5,10,6>I finally visited Brandt's after they reopened with a slightly different name (Brandt's of Palatine instead of Brandt's Little Cafe).  Upon entering, I noticed that there was very little change from the last time I was here, which is good because I loved the character of the little cafe.  The downstairs area looks like it was the most renovated, now there's a TV & a few high top tables with stools compared to what appeared to be maybe a total of 2 tables before.  They used to have a small illuminated board with a few menu items, now they have a regular menu which has a lot more choices than before which was a much needed change.  Their burgers haven't changed which is phenomenal, but now they give you some choices to go along with your burger.  Each one comes with 2 sides, you can choose from fries, chips, sweet potato fries, cole slaw. mac & cheese, veggies & maybe 1 or 2 other things.  You can also pick which kind of bun you want, I opted for the pretzel but found that it was tougher to bite through than your typical buttered bun.  The fact that they added a whole appetizer section to their menu makes me want to stop in, have a few drinks at the bar/downstairs & order some appetizers instead of a full blown meal like I've been accustomed to.  Make sure to check out the historical significance of the building when you're reading the menu, it's a trip to picture this place back in the prohibition days!
<review# 366,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2013,11/23/2013,25,58,7,10,4>As a regular at Standard Market Cafe across the street (also owned by the same people), we finally decided to try the restaurant.  It started out rocky but things got better towards the end.Wednesday night is date night for me and the hubs.  Not because it's "hump day" you pervs, but because the rugrat is over at School of Rock in Hinsdale rocking his little butt off for 2.5 hours so what else are we going to do?  Knowing this, I made a reservation that morning for 6:45 at Bakersfield.When we arrived, on time, the hostess promptly told us it would be 5-10 minutes while they waited for a table to open.  Maybe I'm old school on this issue, but if I make a reservation for 6:45, that means you know my ass is coming and you plan appropriately so that I don't have to wait for a table when I arrive.  I wasn't early.  I wasn't late.  Kinda the point of a reservation, no?So, right off, I'm not all that thrilled.  Looking around, the place is impeccably designed and certainly a higher-end experience than across the street.  I was wearing jeans and a sweater and felt a bit under dressed but nobody seemed to care.  After a little over 5 minutes and watching others being seated, we were taken to our table where we got to listen to a pompous wine snob chatting up some big shot at the restaurant.  Maybe one of the owners?  Why was I eavesdropping, you may ask?  Because it took over 10 minutes for a server, or for anyone to even recognize that we existed.  Eventually a waitress came over and asked if we had been helped.  Clearly it wasn't meant to be her table, but she took us anyway.  At this point, things improved dramatically, if not excessively.The waitress apologized a couple of times, then a manager came over and apologized profusely and said they would "take care of us".  I wasn't sure what that meant.  I ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio, hubby stuck with his ever exciting water.  No apps for us as we were planning on having dessert.  I ordered the Four Farmers Salad with grilled chicken, goat cheese, avocado, candied hazelnuts, champagne vinaigrette and dates.  Hubby had the Five-Spice-Rubbed Rotisserie Chicken with demi-glace, wild rice salad.My salad was fan-freaking-tastic.  Honestly, the best salad I've ever had.  And it's a damn salad!  It's boring by definition.  Not this one.  It was simply amazing.  The dressing was perfect and not overly done.  Hubs seemed to enjoy his meal but I didn't try it.  The wild rice salad was a cold salad and did not look at all appetizing but he loved it.At one point, the waitress let us know that because of the initial waitstaff debacle, that they would be covering my wine and our dessert.  Woot!  Yep, that pretty much made it all better.  We decided to order the vanilla-soaked brioche with caramelized apple special.  Unfortunately, they brought us the fried Oreos.  To the waitress' credit, we had been discussing the Oreo dessert with her, so I think she just heard that, but still.  Pay attention.  I didn't want to make a stink and have to deal with them apologizing over and over so we just ate it.  Yes, we suffered through the most deliciously decadent dessert ever made.  And FYI, this thing is HUGE.  Don't even think about ordering one without sharing.All in all it was a good place.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of food you are getting and the restaurant itself is beautiful. And try to sit in the rear of the place.  It's much quieter and you get to see their gorgeous little wine room.I will gladly accept my reward for longest review ever...(edited to fix some typos and grammatical errors)

<review# 368,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2013,11/21/2013,359,353,6,8,8>I've had a couple crappy German restaurant experiences lately so the bf decided it was time to put an end to this downward trend and take me to a place that had awesome German food. ((Actually, I think he really wanted to attend a special night where Solemn Oath was going to be on tap - but hey, I don't complain when he wants to take me out))My first observation is that parking is an absolute disaster. The lot is super tiny which forces people to park on the streets. We parked nearly 2-3 blocks away (which is a lot for the 'burbs), but I had no complaints. I needed more than that in exercise after the fat kid dinner I consumed...On to the grub. I'm starting to learn that I just don't love German food like I use to. It tends to be super heavy on meat, carbs, and fats - which is everything my body hates. With that being said, Bavarian Lodge is definitely one of the best German restaurants in the Chicagoland area. We started with an order of Bavarian pretzels. They put every other Bavarian pretzel I've had to shame. Get them. Devour them. Love them. We also got a cup of the vegetarian spaetzle and cheddar ale soups. Both delish. For dinner we decided to split a 3 item combination platter. ((Major points for offering combo plates!!)) We went with the housemade veggie schnitzel, a knackwurst,  and a wiener schnitzel. My favorite was the veggie schnitzel. I've had many types of veggie patties and this one was by far the best I've ever had. It reminded me somewhat of an egg roll ((I'm assuming due to the cabbage in it)). Ridiculously good. For our sides we had a bowl of spaetzle (which were perfect), some forgettable creamed spinach, and a bowl of kraut which the bf loves and I don't even want on my side of the table. We wrapped up dinner with a order of kolachky which were hands down the best I've had.Service was okay. Nothing spectacular. Prompt, and courteous - which is more than I can say for many places. The atmosphere and decor is straight out of a German lodge. (obvi). Beer steins, clocks, and German trinkets line the wood-paneled walls. There's 1.5 million (at least) beers on tap, and the sound and aroma of Germany fill the air. Overall - Solid 4 stars. For good German food, Bavarian Lodge is the only place for me.
<review# 369,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,11/20/2013,344,146,12,11,7>"I think I'll go for a walk outside nowThe summer sun's callin' my name.I just can't stay inside all dayI gotta get out, get me some of those rays...Everybody's smilin'Sunshine day!Everybody seems so happy todayIt's a sunshine day!"youtube.com/watch?v=s5GZ…La la la, la de da...  Walking into Pastry Hippo (located inside of Mitsuwa) makes me wanna sing a corny Brady Bunch jingle out loud, walking with a pep in my step so that my hair will sway back and forth like Jan Brady, and everyone joins along in unison.  What?  You've never experienced that?  Well then, you need to get your booty over to Pastry House Hippo ASAP!When I was a little one (which unfortunately is no longer the case), my mom use to bring me home smiley face pastries, named Anpanman, filled with a sweet red bean paste.  I was hooked.  What kid wouldn't like to eat a pastry face filled with nearly anything?  If your child wouldn't...maybe something is wrong, or you haven't treated them to Pastry House Hippo yet.  Aside for Anpanman, they also have Kame (turtle), Kani (crab), and cute panda faces all filled with a coco cream.  Yes, it is way more fun to eat pastries shaped as characters.  There are over 50 different types of pastries at this little bakery and as I've grown older (and larger) I've grown to love many others such as the pear pasty and the coffee & cream pastry.  The potato donut has a creamy potato center with a crispy crust that goes perfectly together.  Don't get me wrong, those turtles and faces are still going home with me, too!  I must give in to my inner child.In addition to pastries, they also have sandwiches ready made to grab in their refrigerated section.  They have hot dog buns filled with yakisoba noodles or potato croquettes.  If you're not feeling like living on the Asian side, they do have a regular hot dog nestled with fresh baked bread and lightly drizzled with a ketchup type sauce.  When I make it over there early enough to grab a few pastries for a weekend breakfast, I also grab some of the ham and cheese rolls to reheat once home with some eggs.Speaking of breakfast, Pastry House Hippo is baking up delicious bread all day long.  If you're not buying your bread here, then you are clearly missing out.  They offer many types, but one worth making a trip for is the extra thick slice.  The extra thick slice is the perfect bread for French Toast!  I love me some steamed buns, as well, and Pastry House Hippo has them!  The only negative is that they only serve them during the winter season (which luckily for my steamed bun cravings alone does last a long time), but a girl wants some buns in the summertime, too!!  Sad coco cream panda face.Pastry House Hippo is also the perfect spot to pick up a dessert for someone's birthday.  Cupcakes, donuts, and cookies can get old.  You can grab any of the pastries, but they also have desserts like green tea cake, mousse, and banana omelets.  You can't help but be in a good mood when eating any of Pastry House Hippo's tasty creations.  I'd like to see you try.  Go on, I dare ya!  In fact, I double yakisoba hot dog dare ya!hippobakery.com

Since Cupcake places seem to be popping everywhere, I was especially glad that we had one in our back yard (ie. Wauconda).   From the minute you walk into Stacie Cakes, you see a well designed, bright, cute decor.   The counter displays the daily cupcakes and the glass case displays more desserts.    It was hard for me to decide which cupcake to choose, then I picked the Red Velvet cupcake.   The velvet cup cake was really good & their cream cheese was really creamy.  They also have a Vanilla Butter Cream cupcake which is amazing!!  The cupcake part is so moist and the frosting is to die for.    Of course I like having a cup of hot tea with my desserts so I ordered Earl Grey.    But the tea wasn't my favorite.  The Earl grey at Sugar Buzz was better. I did like sitting in Stacie's dining area & just looking around & seeing families enjoy desserts together.   How cute.   You can even look through a glass window at the staff baking in the kitchen.  Stacie Cakes is proud to say that they make everything from scratch & are not hiding anything.  I will definitely come back to try another cupcake or two or three.

Sometimes it is hard to explain the difference between a perfect donut and just a donut but it is super easy to taste.  When your mouth yells YAY and your teeth starting singing, you know you've hit the jackpot.I had a honey dipped which was just the right amount of sweet on top of just the right amount of chewy, kind of a squishy chewy.  Yummmmmmmy.  I also had a devils food donut.  (Do not judge me, it was a 12 hour day!)  It was dense which sometimes I do not like but this was dense with flavor and chew and chocolate.  I loved it and my husband adored his French crullers. Will we return?  Is the mayor of Chicago a democrat?Of course we'll be back. I will make sure of it.
<review# 373,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2013,11/16/2013,70,159,5,3,3>Right across the way from Toby Keith's (another frequent stop for my crew), the Hofbrauhaus looms large and welcoming. The first step into the main hall draws you in to the live performers onstage, singing one easy listening cover after another, always looking for a way to work in a tasty beverage tie-in. Yes, I'm okay listening to Margaritaville from dudes in lederhosen. I'm sure they'll be singing an outfit-appropriate "Ein prosit" soon enough. Half-restaurant, half-beer garden and about 100% biergarten theme park. Prepare to be a tourist in your own backyard. The crowd looks very suburban. I see a lot of families here, bigger parties. The surrounding establishments tend to cater to more nightlife-y, over 21 customers. Here, there are eight year old kids having dinner while grandpa and dad raise their steins. The pretzels are delicious, though ultimately unspectacular. I've been favoring the sausage plate, it's just the right serving size, enough to get me fueled for a late night without weighing me down. I've tried their brews and they're very drinkable. The Dunkel is my favorite so far.I've been here a couple of times and the experience has been consistent both times, once during a slower weeknight and on a very busy Saturday. Both times, I was there for birthday dinners. It seems that a lot of folks come by and bring the family for a birthday dinner because the live band gets plenty of opportunities to sing the birthday song through the evening.Overall, the Hofbrauhaus, is lively, loud and merry, Oktoberfest year-round. A bit pricey for what it is but when we're all having fun, it's a relative bargain for good times.

<review# 375,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2013,11/14/2013,187,236,6,7,6>Someone pinch me. Can all of these delicious baked goods from Flur actually be gluten free? Before tasting the goods available at Flur, my impression of gluten free foods were tasteless imitations of the decadent "real thing." Flur completely overturned that impression and left me saying, "Wow. This is amazing!" After trying a brownie and orange cranberry muffin, I was in awe. I actually had to look online to check that this bakery was actually gluten-free because these baked goods weren't just good for gluten free. They were fantastic on their own! The brownie, my absolute favorite of what I have tried there, was perhaps one of the best brownies I have ever had. It was rich, thick, sweet, light, and fluffy all at the same time. Who knew that was possible in a brownie? Yum.Since the macarons were not available on the opening day, I returned the following week to sample a few. I bought the chocolate and pistachio macarons. The flavors in both of the macarons' exterior cookies and fillings complemented each other perfectly. My only complaint was that there were some pretty sizable air bubbles, which created a partly hollowed out interior. I'm optimistic that this was just a bad batch, so I'll be back to sample more flavors. Additionally, I prefer macarons with more filling (which is completely my personal preference, not an objective assessment). Overall, I am a fan of the macarons, even if I found them to be out of my regular purchase price range. Since the business is just starting out, I have just a few suggestions, too:-Expand the hours. It's great that you cover the morning commute to work crowd, but what about 9-5ers who can't make it over in the morning? What about students after school? -Advertise that you're gluten-free more. When I visited during the first week, I did not see that information posted anywhere. In conclusion, I am absolutely ecstatic about this wonderful addition to Riverside businesses. A delicious bakery is exactly what this town needs! The prime location and ample parking space really gives you no excuse to try this wonderful bakery for yourself. I promise you will not be disappointed, especially by those mouth-wateringly perfect brownies. I look forward to seeing the business Flur-ish!Quick facts:-Flur also bakes and decorates absolutely stunning cakes!-There's an online store, where you can order biscotti, macarons, cookies, or brownies.

And that's exactly the level of service I've come to know and Love from this little indie coffee shop. First off, I know the reviews are all across the board -- and I will admit that I have visited on the occasional off day -- but I've spent more than enough time here (from open to close, on a few occasions!) to feel confident in giving them the five stars.Calibre tickles my fancy for more than a few reasons -- the first being that I have a soft spot for non-chain establishments, and this one fits the bill beautifully. Don't get me wrong -- I'm also a Starby's regular, but that's more or less just because it's a surefire way to get my chai fix on the regular. If given the choice -- I much prefer the feel of a smaller, less cookie-cutter establishment. I adore their decor. Dark wood furniture, modern/minimalist dishes, even the calm blue of their logo and uniforms. Bonus points for having a prime spot in the Arboretum -- in which the window seats get bathed in natural light (but vampires fear not, you can close the shutters if you like).Free wi-fi and a loyalty program ($5 for every $50 spent) make up for their *slightly* higher-than-your-average-coffee-shop prices. And if you're still irked by the prices -- they currently have a $1 off Yelp offer and a $10 for $30 Groupon (that I purchased, natch!) of which you can take advantage.But what keeps me coming back is their service. Okay, I'm not gonna lie, I do Love their French macarons, like, a whole lot, but more on that later. If you're grab-and-going, you may not get a feel for their super-friendly service. But if you're lounging around all day, you'll notice that: (1) They will get to know you and your little quirks. Like how I like my chai burns-your-tongue hot. (2) They will deliver your coffee and pastries to your table -- and will come and check on you from time to time, without reaching bugaboo status. (3) They'll notice when you appreciate things like extra cinnamon -- and will keep 'em coming. (4) They don't mind if you get cozy and live there for the day -- and even have an extra-large table in the back perfect for a big study group (or a small study group with a lot of baggage). (5) They strike up genuinely friendly conversation with you, and seem to genuinely want to get to know their customers. Okay, but the macarons. They have French macarons! [Insert happy dance here]. They may not be the biggest or the best -- but they do have a variety of flavors. And, it sure beats making the trek to the city (and paying for parking) to satisfy your tiny treat craving. If macarons don't float your boat, they've got a case-full of other pastries -- though I'm partial to the little Frenchies, and haven't gotten around to trying much of anything else tehe.Stop by and show Calibre some Love! They'll take care of you -- or at the very least, your coffee craving. You may even find me there on one of my all day Sunday seshes ;)
<review# 377,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2013,11/12/2013,127,193,5,10,8>Herradura means Horseshoe in Spanish.  I'm not sure of the significance of the name, but you'll want to make a U-turn and head straight to this taqueria.Horchata is a staple measuring stick I use to rate any taqueria's performance.  Herradura receives full marks for this sweet, milky, watery, cinnamon-y treat.  It cools your tongue well after a few bites of delicious dishes like pastor dinners/tacos and chilaquiles made with chile de arbol (one of the hottest common peppers served).  There is no shortage of condiments on the table- maybe almost too many- but they include a few different salsas with the requisite complimentary chips, and what  I call "Mexican gardiniera": a spicy blend of sliced carrots, jalapeños, onions, celery, cauliflower, and a little olive oil.This place sits in a former drive-in hotdog stand.  Times change and so do tastes.  But I have a feeling I'm going to crave some chilaquiles on a weekly basis for many many months to come.
<review# 378,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2013,11/11/2013,112,483,2,9,10>Finally, a City quality restaurant in Orland. Seriously, walking in the door, it is obvious that this is not typical suburban sprawl. Great art, nice brick wall, long bar, TVs.Went on a Friday night, no problem parking. Was told that it would be a long wait, but there were two seats together at the end of the bar. We took those.The bartender was great - on her game, knew the menu. Friendly and professional.We shared empanadas which were fantastic. The skinny mamarita was very good. I had the taco specials, both were so good. I can't wait to go back.

<review# 380,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2013,11/9/2013,124,515,5,8,6>This is pastry paradise. But I am happy that I have passed this place for two and half years without stopping in until now. I would be the size of the Pilsbury doughboy from all the carbs. I love the set up. You walk in and the doughnuts, muffins, bagels, cookies, pastries and other sweet treats are placed all around the bakery (largely against the wall). It's self serve for 90% f the items in the store. Their are labels listing the item, ingredients and pricing. The trays and boxes are beneath the pastries. Once you have selected your items, you then bring your items to the cashier, pay and leave. As a first timer, I spent way too much time deciding what to get. This place has everything and everything looked so good. I really wanted one of each but went with my better judgment. I bought a cinnamon roll, glaze doughnut and an almond pastry. My plan was to get one thing, but I could not decide. As I write this, I am happy to report I have only consumed two of three. After all, I did not want to go into a diabetic coma on the weekend.... I have stuff to do. But seriously, I love their glaze doughnut. (6 stars) The almond pastry was good (3.5 stars) but I probably would waste my calories on something else next trip. .....Yes, there will be a next trip. And I can't wait!
<review# 381,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2013,11/8/2013,151,298,12,12,14>Words cannot describe how awesome this place was.  My wife and I along with 2 other couples ate here on a Saturday night.  I ate more oysters than I did all last year.  2x2x2 oysters were very good.  Oyster shooter with infused jalapeno vodka was awesome.  We also had the grilled oysters which were ok.  I had the bouillabaisse for my entree.  Wonderful spicy broth with tons of seafood.  My wife had the bbq shrimp with grits.  I really liked it.  Lets get to the drinks.  Dark and Stormy was a ginger delight.  So I had 2 of them.  They have zombie dust on tap.  Its hard to even find that beer in a bottle let alone on tap.  So I swilled down one of those as well.  No desert for me.  Not enough room.  Our server was a red headed ginger like myself named Jacob with a c.  He did a great job and kept our drinks coming.  There was something I though was super cool.  The entire bar when you walk in is from the 1893 Worlds Fair.  To sit at a bar thats over 115 years old has a lot of history to it.    I cant wait to go back.
<review# 382,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2013,11/7/2013,255,326,10,14,14>How have I not already reviewed this place? I come here so often, the chickens save a spot for me at the picnic tables.Ok, about those chickens. They're so awesome. These are the most brazen, full of attitude birds I have ever met (and I have met a lot of birds). On a recent visit, one hen sat beside me, watching me eat with a look of disapproval. I kid you not, she was judging my lunch hard. "Really? A sandwich from Starbucks?" Then when my daughter dropped a piece of HER lunch (organic whole wheat crackers, organic full fat mozzarella, and mango applesauce), the chicken reached over and grabbed it right off her lap. Yes, if you eat lunch at the picnic tables here, the chickens will poach your food (but only if it meets their high standards).  Of course, with the help of staff you can go into the barnyard and feed the chickens cracked corn right from your hand, and some will even let you pet them, but then you miss your chance to be silently judged by a hen. By this point in the review, you might be wondering why I am talking about a barnyard at a nature sanctuary. It's because this place is a twofer! Well...a threefer? There's a nature sanctuary with trails cutitng through the various habitats on 135 acres, the Merkle Log Cabin (which you can rent and which has a fire pit), and an 1880's living history farm. I originally started coming here for the excellent birdwatching, but now most of my visits are dedicated to showing my daughter the farm animals and the frogs, toads, and turtles along the banks of the streams and ponds here.Everyone who works here is knowledgeable and friendly. There is a gift shop with little trinkets and some fun handmade items, like mock-antique bonnets. Sometimes, there are baby animals. BABY ANIMALS! Here are some things you will not find at Spring Valley/Volkening Farm:--boating--hunting--fishing--dog walking--sheep (they used to have them but discovered the sheep in 1880's Schaumburg all belonged to one British immigrant)This is a great place to spend an afternoon, or an evening if they are having an event (these include a meteor shower party, ice cream making, and wedding re-enactments, among other things). Daytime events can include learning about 19th-century games or demonstrations about leavening bread and pastries.
<review# 383,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2013,11/6/2013,283,456,4,10,9>Time for an update! La Hacienda has been a landmark at Irving Park Road and Roselle Rd. as long as I can remember. They are busy regularly but rarely is there a wait. This probably has something to do with the overall size of the establishment which is surprising given their location tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. I don't know about you, but I have pretty much concluded that any decent Mexican place I'm willing to eat at is pretty much always located tucked away in a strip mall somewhere. It's these places that have the charm provided by the mom & pop running the place. They also have the old family recipes with secrets no one else has. My sister and I dined here late on a Monday evening a while back and whilst it wasn't the healthiest option, it was on our way home and neither of us had been in quite a while, so we gave it a shot. My experience here was much better than any prior to this night. The service was attentive without being intrusive  the food was excellent. The ingredients were fresh.My only complaint is that there was an abundance of onion in the somewhat over priced guacamole app which we should have skipped. Other than that, my taco dinner was delicious. I got two tacso al pastor and one barbacoa taco. I have to say, the meat in each taco was abundant and I really could have made 6 tacos out of the portions of meat in this meal. The rice was well flavored and the tortillas were fresh. While they are not homemade tortillas, they were very fresh and I was a fan of that. The pricing is TOTALLY reasonable. The location is convenient. The staff is helpful. I intend to work this place into our regular circulation of Village Tavern and chipotle. Why not some REAL Mexican food!?
<review# 384,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2013,11/5/2013,38,217,5,13,10>We've been to Bisi twice now, and hope to get back again soon.First time, we took the kids, and had 4 different dishes.  This time just the wife and I went for lunch , and had 2 other dishes.  So overall, we've probably tried just about everything on the menu.The owner remembered us, remembered we'd brought our kids before, and thanked me for the pix I'd posted on yelp.  Very friendly.  Great for customer service.My favorite was the Aya Mase, the one dish that was somewhat spicy.  Had the most flavor layers, IMO.  Everything we've tried has been delicious, though.They do cook things traditionally, meaning bones and all. (which we most certainly appreciate).I hope to see this unique cuisine thrive in the burbs.  The burbs certainly need it.My fear is that the location has been a black hole for restaurants.  Haven't seen something last for more than a couple years in this location.  And I fear that people will find this place a novelty- maybe try it once.  I hope not.  Places like this should be encouraged.  The food is excellent. Be open minded to try something new, more than once.  Give them your business.  I know I'll be back.
<review# 385,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2013,11/4/2013,2184,1339,17,18,20>I have a huge bump on my head. This ain't your normal bug bite. It's some kind of monstrous beast of a bite that takes up half my forehead. Thankfully I have bangs that I can strategically place to cover up said bug bite. But I never learn - I always forget to douse myself in bug spray before going to these nature places. My first word of advice for you all is : Put on bug spray! Bam.Willowbrook opens at 9 each day and is open every day. There is no admission cost but there is a donation box near the entrance - DONATE! Read a bit about the center before you go so you can fully appreciate all they are doing for the animals and where your money is going. Willowbrook has a nature center full of animals plus some nature trails with animals and others without the furry & feathered friends.I've had Willowbrook on my must do list for months and am glad I finally got the chance to go yesterday morning. I spent just about an hour there and I think that was sufficient time to explore the area. I even met a nice lady who was also there solo and for her first time...she agreed it was great.I swear I could stand there watching the animals forever. Like a lunatic I start laughing at the silly little groundhog as he gnawed on the wood in his cage. A woodchuck eating wood - ha! Up in Wisconsin last week I saved a groundhog's life as I slammed my breaks on, while he slowly sauntered across the road. Plus I had one in my tree at my last apartment and he just chilled up there for a couple hours! I had never seen anything like that before. So groundhogs & me, we're tight. I also loved the bobcat. Just a big ol' kitty cat. I wanted to climb in his cage and pet him and love him forever, such a cutie. Adorable fox siblings were there, tons of different varieties of birds including turkey vultures, hawks, cute owls and a badass bald eagle. An opossum, too! They were all super cute, most were up and atom not just laying & sleeping. Pro-tip with any animal viewing: Dawn and dusk are always their most active times.Inside were a bunch of birds, frogs, snakes, turtles and more. I liked the gray Eastern Screech Owl inside the best. He kept blinking at me and one time even winked! Aw! They had a chipmunk and some other animals in their care area behind the glass including a gaggle of baby opossums all snuggling together. The cool thing is you can follow their Facebook that they update regularly to see what animals are in & the stories behind them.I loved being able to read the animals' stories and learn information about them as I went along. Yep, I learned stuff while here. Got my edumacation on. I love learning (I'm a nerd), love animals and love getting out on nature trails and Willowbrook ties it all together for me. As Nicole L. mentions, it's rough getting good pictures here because of the wiring on their cages but it must be necessary for the little guys so I won't hold it against them.I loved Willowbrook and it's not too bad of a drive from Schaumburg so I'll be back often.
<review# 386,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2013,11/3/2013,78,284,6,12,6>I don't know if there are many places in the Chicagoland area to get your shoot on. I've been to Article II in Lombard but never used the range. According to my fiance and his friend, it was good, but not the best. Since trying out guns is his latest hobby, he suggested that we go to GAT Guns and give it a shot (see what I did there?).We made the drive up to East Dundee. The building looks huge from the outside. We went inside and there were a bunch of guns on display along with other gun needs. We went up to the range area and waited in line behind some people that were being helped. The wait kinda sucks, as there are only two people behind the counter and they both are on hand to help the customer at the counter. I think we waited about 10 to 15 minutes. Finally, we were taken care of. The guys behind the counter seem really young, but they know their stuff and were incredibly efficient. You may want to check out the website ahead of time to see what guns they have so you have a good idea of what you want when you get there.If you rent a gun, you have to purchase their ammunition. You are charged per person and you can share a range with the person you are with (though there might be a limit as to how many people can share a range. With 4 or 5 guns, ammunition, and range fees, and a few targets, our total was around $90. We filled out some paperwork, flashed our FOID cards, and were on our way. You're only allowed one gun per person at a time, so when you want to try out your other gun, you can come back and trade. You go through a door that goes into an empty room. There is a viewing window for those that aren't shooting. This is also a good place to put in your earbuds and put on your goggles. Tip: wear long sleeves so the hot shells flying out of the guns don't burn you.There are several stations available with a top to put your guns and ammo. There is also a shelf below for your bags and other things. There is a PVC pipe with a clip to hang your target. We had some trouble with ours sometimes, particularly with the bigger targets; it would fold inward when you flip the switch to send it down the range, and then we couldn't see the target. It probably didn't help that I shot the pipe earlier.We had a lot of fun getting to try our different guns and it's a great way to get some practice. The ranges are nothing special, but they are in the process of remodeling them, so I'm interested to see what they will look like. Even though it is a bit more expensive than Article II, the guns are better and not over-worn, and I think you get more bang for your buck (I'm on fire with these gun puns). Definitely worth the drive if you like to go to the range.
<review# 387,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2013,11/2/2013,760,671,8,13,11>Growing up, I LOVED hot dogs. All I wanted to eat were hot dogs. A few years ago, I became a vegetarian, found out what was in hot dogs, and stopped eating them. The desire to eat hot dogs comes and goes. I usually don't give in to the craving.I had the sudden urge to eat a hot dog tonight. Out of curiosity, I looked up hot dog places and this was the first one that popped up -- very close to us. And the first review on this page at the time? Victoria W's review in which she starts talking about their veggie dogs!!! WIN! I was so excited about finding hot dogs that I could actually EAT; my husband and I jumped in the car and drove over to pick up some yummy dogs.Doctor Dog's is easy to overlook; it's a tiny place in a tiny strip mall between Dunkin' Donuts and something else. It's a typical hot dog place with bright colors, several tables, and a wall filled with colored-in coloring pages from children customers. What sets this place apart from other hot dog joints is the incredibly friendly atmosphere. We were greeted with smiles and conversation throughout our entire time there.Veggie hot dogs are actually not on the menu. The owner's (I think) daughter is a vegetarian (oh, the irony) and he keeps veggie hot dogs for her and one other customer (is that you, Victoria?). He went in the back to check if they had them and they did -- WHEW! So, for $4, I ordered a veggie hot dog with fries and a drink. My husband got a chili cheese dog meal for $5. The veggie hot dog was AMAZING. Best hot dog I've ever had. The fries were pretty good too, although a bit too thin and soggy. After we finished, we sat around for a bit to watch the Blackhawks game on the television and one of the workers offered us more french fries on the house. Our full stomachs politely declined, but it was very nice of him to offer!We're definitely come back a few more times this summer. Cute place, very friendly people, good prices, and delicious veggie dogs!! Woo-hoo!!
<review# 388,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2013,11/1/2013,82,235,9,12,12>Woah! Love the new management! Everybody who wrote off Coffee Haus due to the service needs to try it again. Now, instead of one rather humorless person (who totally grows on you but I can see why he was a deterrent) ringing you up *and* making everybody's order, they've got *four* separate chipper peeps all busting their butts to get you your drink. We noted a few hilarious changes -- they replaced the severe old sign about time limits on the computers with a wall quote about life and happiness or somesuch. And I love the new frequent customer cards!Now, all of this would not be worth it if the best ever smoothie formula had changed. I'm happy to report that the mango smoothie tastes almost exactly the same as the one made by the previous owner -- that "biting into a fresh mango" flavor achieved by no one else in the Chi burbs. Actually, I think they use a little less sugar, so it's even more like a real mango.We will miss the owner of before and hope he and his wife are doing okay. We had a fun glimpse of his personality a while back when we were buying a cupcake and he blurted out, "They're so beautiful."Protip: bring your mango smoothie home and add a shot of tequila
<review# 389,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2013,10/31/2013,421,397,43,44,45>If you happen to be in the city of Oak Lawn and are driving down Cicero Avenue, you might come across a 50s style fast food joint called Rosie's Drive-In. While it may have been a "Drive-In" with carhop service at some point in the past, those days appear to be long gone.  Clearly a survivor from days gone by Rosie's is a tiny little eatery with a handful of seats and tables on the inside, a public bathroom (not always a sure thing in a place this small), a small ordering counter and a drive-thru window. In stopping by Rosie's Drive-In I decided to try out the hot dog here. A few minutes after I placed my order the food was ready. The hot dog I received was a classic Chicago style hot dog. It came on a poppy seed bun that was soft and clearly steamed. The sausage itself was a skinless dog, well heated and flavorful. There were two nice sized sport peppers that one laid from end to end covered the entire length of the hot dog so that sport pepper flavor could be had in every bite. The pickle slice used here was a thin sliced pickle, that was a nice compliment without being too sour. The mustard, relish and onion were well applied. The only thing unusual about this hot dog was that there was no noticeable celery salt. The overall combination of ingredients combined with the proper application of them is key to making a great hot dog. And the hot dog here at Rosie's did this on all counts. While not the best hot dog I've ever had, it's certainly in the upper echelon. I am going to give Rosie's Drive-In a full five stars. An excellent hot dog at a fair price.
<review# 390,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/2/2013,10/30/2013,1546,338,19,22,20>A REAL DOG WHISPERER?We had been taking our dogs Rocco and Vinnie to another vet ever since they had come to our home. We were happy with the staff and doctors of the other vet but their cost and charges for typical services like shots were always more expensive than the others in the area. The thing is that they refused to bring their prices down when we even pointed this out to them. They basically forced us to shop around which we did. We looked on yelp and since most of our neighbors have dogs and other pets we checked with them as well. It turns out that Wauconda Animal Hospital is a very highly respected place with the yelp review and the neighbors.We made an appointment to take the guys here for their annual shots. It was an early Saturday morning appointment when we brought them. The staff took care of us right away with helping us by filling out paper work. Vinnie decided to leave a sample on the floor for them. He does this when he gets nervous. After filling out the paper work they brought us to the exam room. We waited a little until the doctor arrived and I have to say that she was very nice and gentle with Rocco and Vinnie. When the tech placed the dogs, one at a time on the exam table to examine them and give them their shots, I have to say that I had NEVER seen them so relaxed and calm when being examined and given shots. It was as if the tech was a dog whisperer (watch out Cesar). While the doctor was thoroughly examining each of the guys she checked their teeth and told us how to brush them properly. She told us that we only need to brush the outside and concentrate on the canines as these are the ones that get the most plaque on them.This is our first time here so I am giving them 4.5 stars for now but I am sure and confident that they will move to 5 stars.
<review# 391,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2013,10/29/2013,116,295,6,7,6>The boy and I are on a quest for the best pizza in Chicagoland. But I really wanted to try a New York style pizza based on listening to my friends talk about it! The yelp app landed us at Brooklyn Halaal!!    The inside doesn't look like much, just a few tables, and a soda cooler that you can pick out drink of your choice. Walking up to the counter I saw the pizza and I felt a tinge of sadness because I thought "Ain't no way this S*** is gonna be any good!" I totally judged the book by its cover! I ordered a slice of the vegetarian, and a slice of pepperoni. I ordered the veggie because there was only one slice of sausage left, and my boyfriend loves sausage more than I do so I let him have it. Gotta take one for the team. And who am I kidding I eat everything! :-)     Boy was I pleasantly surprised. I think my mouth had sex! #Gurl!!! The veggie pizza was nice! I would've loved it even more with sausage on it! The pepperoni was where it was at! #Okay! The pepperoni slice had just the right amount of zing, and a nice crispness to it. I wanted to slap my mom, dad, and great granny!       While eating the cook made more sausage pizza, and of course we tried a slice of it. It was good as well, but my heart was with the pepperoni! Brooklyn Halaal also has other items on the menu- Mediterranean type food! The owners are middle eastern, but they smashed that pizza!! The boy and I ordered a whole chicken to go with sides of rice, and fried okra. That was for dinner later, but of course my fat a** ate the okra right then. I kept telling myself its okay the quality will be severely affected if I don't eat it now! The Okra was bland as all get out. I probably wouldn't order it again in this life (or next life for that matter!!)      The rice was awesome!!! It had a nice flavor to it! Other side options were baba ghanoush, potatoes, fries, and a couple of other options. The boy and I chose the garlic chicken to which I asked was there any buttery sauces added to the chicken. The cook said no, but when we got home there was a creamy white garlic sauce added. I was hella pissed because my boyfriend won't eat any butter or cream based sauces, so he couldn't eat it. That S*** didn't stop me though lol! It was very good.      I will definitely be back to Brooklyn Halaal! I would like to try a couple of other sides, and of course the pizza! They offer a two slice, and can of soda deal for $5. That's such a good deal because the slices are as big as the plate! There is also a cool middle eastern grocery store next door! As well as  other middle eastern restaurants near that I will make the trip back to the area to check out! Until next time!!!
<review# 392,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2013,10/28/2013,17,90,2,7,6>This place is it!!! Going into this place we thought it served both Indian and Chinese food the best of both worlds "How could you go wrong". Turned out it is a Chinese Place that uses Indian Spices. Which, as it turns out, is the flavor profile that my mouth was missing. Because from the first bite of Chili Potatoes and the last bite of my Burnt Garlic fried rice was amazing. I washed this down with a large "Hayward 5000" which is an Indian beer. This was the first time I tried Hayward and that was extremely good as well. The level was spice was great, I was with my wife and we shared. She can't handle as much spice as I can. If it was up to me I would say "heat it up. Extra Spicy please" but instead we got it about medium and it still had a bite. I would love to go back and test them to see how hot they can make it. The only problem for me is that I live about 20 miles away. mmmmmmmmmmm...If I ever thought about moving to get closer to a restaurant, this would be the place. Thank you Taste
<review# 393,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/2/2013,10/27/2013,176,176,2,10,7>Mallard Lake Forest Preserve has become one of my escape spots when I need a peaceful outdoor place to clear the mind. Sometimes I will grab a lunch, drive out to Mallard Lake, park and eat. Most often I walk the 1.3 mile trail around the lake with my camera stopping to take pictures whenever something catches my eye. The trail is mostly a fine, light gray, limestone pathway with two bridges over parts of the lake. Pedestrians, joggers, and bicycles all share the path. Dogs are allowed as long as they are on a leash less than 10 feet in length.You'll see a few piers at the south and west ends of the lake which attract those who like to fish. I've also seen an occasional boat or canoe in the lake. And there's a few picnic tables by the trail near the parking area.Like most preserves, Mallard Lake opens daily one hour after sunrise and closes one hour after sunset. Pretty nice in the summer since sunset usually isn't until after 8:30 PM.Vehicles can enter the preserve from Schick Road about a block west of Gary Avenue. The main drive into the preserve has bicycle lanes in both directions. You can also enter the preserve from the north on foot or bike from a trail through Heritage Park on Arlington Drive (by Spring Wood Middle School and Greenbrook Elementary School).In 2009-2010, the preserve went through development improvements which included the new entrance on Schick Road, additional parking, shoreline improvements, native plant restoration, boardwalk and trail.Spring, summer, fall, and winter... I have been to Mallard Lake during all the seasons and have some great photos as a result. Not a lot to see, but if you're looking intently, you definitely see something of interest.
<review# 394,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2013,10/26/2013,216,369,10,7,5>What better way to kick off July than a barbecue review? 'Cause 'Merica, mayne. Never furgayut. This hussy and me are gonna get some Smokin M's, Budweisers, and kick major ayuss. Yew gotta problem wif dayut? I'll kick yer commie ayuss too, sumbitch. Yew ain't entirely sure who yewr messin wif. I'm one mean top gun, and I'll unload on yer ayuss. Never furgayut.I recommend going with a combo meal so you can try more than one meat. My favorite is the rib tips and hot links combo, because I like sausage (no homo). Their chicken is decent, but the white meat is a bit too dry. You can't go wrong with the ribs though. The meat is tender, fall-off-the-bone goodness. In all likelihood, you will have leftovers. They give you a lot of food for not a lot of money, as fries, bread and cole slaw come with every meal.You can dine in, but it's small and can get smokier than Snoop Dogg's rec room, so I prefer take-out. Smokin' M's in the back of the Benzy.
<review# 395,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/22/2013,10/25/2013,58,259,5,5,5>I never thought these words would utter from my mouth... but I am in love with a grocery store.I am literally finding reasons to visit this place, all I want to do is make a gourmet dinner from Tony's every day of the week.The biggest produce section I have ever seen in my life and the prices are oh so cheap.  The bakery is not expensive, always samples around, and they have some of the best cannolis!  They have regular, chocolate dipped, and white chocolate dipped.  I could also eat their Onion Buns every day of my life (though I'm sure my stomach wouldn't like that)... packed with flavor, chewy, perfect with a burger.. and cheap to boot as well, I think they are 3 for $1.The deli is insanely cheap AND courteous.  We originally opted for an oven-roasted turkey breast from some higher up brand and the employee offered us their turkey since it was $1.00 cheaper per pound.  We said yes, of course, and then he goes "oh try some too, just to make sure its to your liking."  I have never been around that great of customer service at a deli before.The Tilapia we have gotten there is HUGE and incredibly meaty, decently priced too.I could go on and on and on ... just go here, get some great food, and save yourself some money!!
<review# 396,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2013,10/24/2013,63,60,12,17,14>I am still reasonably unclear on the name of this restaurant, even with Yelp telling me, but this place is friendly, fantastic, and the fastest falafel place I have ever seen. You should definitely give these guys a try because they deserve your business.First, I have to say some things about their design choices. If you are not interested, skip ahead to the next paragraph. The sign outside reads "Egyptian Fast Food WOW House of Egypt," which is maybe a little bit much, but on the other hand, I didn't forget it. The sign is also... singular... which is a nice way of saying "a design nightmare." But, again, I didn't forget where I saw that sign. Inside, the restaurant is clean and modern but strangely mixed with lots of fake-o Egyptian stuff (including a full-on throne room) that even have placards nearby that are reminiscent to what you would see at a museum. All of the design choices that this restaurant made are potentially disasterous... except... it's a great restaurant! Weirdly, that makes every bad design choice charming (see also: La Hacienda de Roselle) and makes them more noticeable and unique in a good way. While I would not recommend that WOW Egyptian Fast Food keep their aesthetic for the duration of their business, I'm amazed and kind of delighted with how it works for them right now.Design aside, this place gets everything right. When my wife went, we both got chicken schwarma sandwiches and falafel. Standard pita fare- except we got our food in only a few minutes. How is that possible? Every pita place I have ever been takes, like, 20 minutes to cook your food. Also, the food was really delicious. I love Naf Naf, but this schwarma sandwich was better. Also we had the option to make our sandwiches spicy, which we did, and they were absolutely spicy. It was great. I had a mango juice to drink, and it was marvellous. I recommend all of the above. So does my wife.The food would have been fine on its own- I'd come back for just that- but what really impressed us was the service. I've eaten out a lot of places, and I can't remember the last time I felt this personally welcomed into a restaurant. The lady who took our order was warm and friendly, and even took the time to tell us what sauces we had, and her favorite ways to try them during the meal. I love when people do that. People that go above and beyond to make your meal better by showing you new ways to experience the food get an A+ in my book. And upon trying the suggestions she made, I have to say she was right.When you go to a steakhouse, you expect that the food and service will be excellent. When you go to a fast food pita place, that expectation isn't there- for me anyway. I walked away talking about WOW Egyptian Fast Food for a solid 10 minutes while we drove to Lunar in Villa Park. My wife, who is in restaurant management, was blown away. In her words "I think that was the best service I've ever gotten.... anywhere."Reader, I'm not sure your experience will be as good, but I hope it will be. Even after reading all the great reviews, this place totally took us by surprise. Give them a shot.Oh, and make sure you take a pictures in the Egyptian Throne.
<review# 397,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2013,10/23/2013,363,708,4,20,7>I've always been a fan of broasted chicken -- there's something about that pressure-fried process that yields delicious, crispy, juicy chicken that's hard to resist. I'd passed Mr Halal many times driving down Roosevelt, but it wasn't until we visited the Dairy Queen two doors down that it caught our eye and we thought, hey, let's give it a try.I came in around 6:45 on a Tuesday and the place was empty, although it doesn't seem like an eat-in kinda place -- maybe for a quick lunch. There are two longish tables that seat maybe 20 people total.Don't be thrown off by the Halal part -- Lombard and Villa Park have a lot of Muslim families but this is more or less American food, simply prepared to Halal standards, which is essentially the same as kosher -- just blessed by a different religious authority. The chickens are humanely raised, fed a vegetarian diet and humanely killed. Everything is fresh. I ordered the 8-piece family meal which comes with a whole chicken (2 breasts, 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks), 4 biscuits and a large side (I went with fries). I was told it would be 15 minutes and sat and chilled out. I heard the guy prepping food in the back and then he came out with a tray of freshly-floured chicken and placed it in the broaster, which is basically this giant pressure cooker. It smelled delicious, immediately.Sure enough, 15 minutes later I had a box of piping hot chicken, a large takeout container of fries, and a container of biscuits, which was neatly bagged up for me.All of this is to say it was DELICIOUS. Crispy, great seasoning (a little kick of spice), extremely juicy and tender meat. I devoured mine in no time. The fries had a slightly spicy kick to them as well which I added to by dunking them in hot sauce (which tasted basically like Frank's). The biscuits were buttery and flaky too.In short: forget that fast-food place across the street. Please support Mr Halal. I want it to stick around so I can come back for much more juicy crispy fried deliciousness.
<review# 398,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2013,10/22/2013,161,158,4,10,5>This place have had a few ownership changes in the past 3-4 months so it was confusing at first to arrive at a Noodles Pho U address, to see a giant Bok Choy sign at the restaurant. While it did took them a while to finish the name transition, eventually, they did put up an updated sign and this Chinese/Sushi restaurant is now a Vietnamese/Chinese/Thai/Korean pan asian place of cuisine. I've been here twice up to date and originally, my first thought of it was a "meh". Their Pho was A-OK but it just took a really long time for the order to come out.. like 20-30 min wait long. I'm Vietnamese and I'm my bar for Vietnamese food is a bit higher since I know what tastes good to me and what doesn't, and I also have a certain wait time expectation since most Pho and noodle dishes should have their broth prepared ahead of time, so I'm not sure what could cause them to take that long. I went home that day thinking this place is 3 stars at best. Nevertheless, my family gave it another try today and my taste buds told me differently, 4 stars. The wait time for 4 people (3 dishes, 1 appetizer, 2 smoothies) were still the same however. I clocked them at about 30-35 min wait. However, everything came out tasting really good, savory, flavored just right (not too salty or bland) and that really made up for the wait time. The server, Truc, was very nice and polite and were friendly toward us and kept us updated with the wait (a small gesture that was appreciated when most restaurants lacked). Here's my report card of this place: #50 Banh Xeo- B+ (8 pieces in small ceramic plates, authentic to taste, flavorful, good, and should be eaten right away when hot for optimal taste, once it's cold, you wont get the full flavor) $8.95 is a little pricey but since this isn't a common dish at most restaurants, it's worth a try. Would be nice if they lowered the price on this a bit. It's costing as much as an entree for app.#200 Bun Thit Nuong- A+. At first I thought this portion was small, but I ended up not finishing it (could be due to my smoothie drink I had been sipping). The pork was VERY flavorful and true to Vietnamese cuisine, the noodles were soft and not dry, pickled radishes and lettuce was fresh and compliments the dish. I would get this again! $8.95 is about right for this. Other dishes that I didn't ordered but my family did was #122 Pho Special and #300 Pork Chop Rice. You can request to have a sunny side egg with the latter dish (true to how Vietnamese people eat it). My family said both dish were decent and they finished it all. Rice is sometimes a miss or hit dish, since some restaurant can cook it well or undercook it or have it to dry, and that can really break or make a dish. If the rice is too dry, then you don't have that to compliment the flavor of the dish. In addition, nuoc mam, or fish sauce is also another break or make it ingredient. It is the final flavor of everything Vietnamese. This restaurant make the fish sauce well, and I heard the rice was okay, sounds good. Smoothies I recommend and have tried: Avocado and Papaya. My favorite being avocado. They used fresh fruits here and may put a bit more ice and sugar into it, so it can taste sweet but over all, their smoothies are decent at $3.50-$4.75/drink. There is Lunch/Dinner special here but nothing on that menu is Vietnamese, only basic Chinese dishes so I would personally take a pass. There is delivery here with a $10 purchase minimum. Ambience is very casual and in need of some redecoration, a about 8 tables of 4 can fit here, so it's not really a large place. My final verdict for this place, if you're nearby, give it a try. I certainly will come back. However, it's NOT a place to go when you're in a hurry. Give yourself at least 30 minutes for the food to come out. I think they are low in staff so service and food is a bit slow. Other than that, I'm coming back here for my Vietnamese cravings. Check it out! :)
<review# 399,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2013,10/21/2013,16,94,2,8,5>I was meeting a friend for a business lunch and have been wanting to try DMK for some time but wasn't sure what to expect.  I must say, it really impressed me.  We were seated quickly and I highly recommend getting there a little before noon to make sure there is no wait.  It looks like you can sit at the bar but if you want a table make sure you are there early.  Its a hip yet casual environment that is pretty loud when the dining room is full so be prepared for that.  Our server was great and explained the menu as neither of us had been there before.  While we didn't dig into the beer list for a Tuesday lunch meeting it looked extensive and definitely something I would explore on a weekend night or late afternoon.Both of us had the #2, which is a grass fed burger with lightly fried onions and Amish blue cheese.  We also ordered standard fries with the spicy ketchup.  When the burger came out I was a little concerned because the bun seemed a bit thin and I thought it might get soggy and fall apart...fear not though as this bun was sturdy to the last bite.  The burger was cooked perfectly and packed with flavor.  They had just the right amount of onions and blue cheese, which also seemed to stand up to the burger as opposed to melting into nothing at some burger places.Fries were fresh cut and cooked to perfection, not too soft and not too crunchy.  The spicy ketchup was the perfect compliment.  I recently concocted a homemade spicy barbeque sauce and this ketchup had a similar smokey, spicy flavor...I wanted to take it home with me!All in all, a great experience and I will definitely be back.  This place is right up there on my list of best burgers in the Chicago area.  Great job!
<review# 400,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2013,10/20/2013,58,146,3,6,4>Hands down five stars for Niki Moon Salon. What a pleasant visit. After moving from Chicago to the Naperville area, finding a hair salon that did exceptional work was top priority. After a fail from another salon, I called Niki Moon to "fix" my color and came away a happy gal.Had an appointment with Brynn and explained what I wanted. She recommended doing a color fill and all over color, rather than what I initially thought I needed (full color and full highlights) to fix my color. I appreciated her honestly and giving a detailed consultation and consequently providing a less expensive service than I had originally scheduled. To me, this really shows they are less in it for the money, but more to please the customers and provide the proper service.Once Brynn began to wash out the dye and began to dry my hair; ! WOW !, she really did a fantastic job of mixing different colors to provide a beautiful color that gives me hair visual interest and color depth.  It was like she took what I pictured and explained and executed it to a T. It was better than I'd hoped.I didn't want to write a review, because I wanted to keep Niki Moon my little secret, but as Yelpers know the cat is out of the bag with all the positive reviews. Niki Moon is my go-to salon now. Thank you!
<review# 401,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2013,10/19/2013,28,89,5,5,4>I love this place.  I love the resilience of being flooded time and time again and not consider moving locations.  That alone should make this place a must visit.  It's clean, it's busy, the servers are there to make your order - not hold your hand.  If you must have ketchup - this is not your place... don't write nasty reviews about ketchup at a place you know doesn't service it... period.  Fries on the dog - they come that way.  You do have the option to say no fries and then order a side of fries... but what's the point.  These two details have helped build an empire for Gene and Jude's, embrace it or go elsewhere.In the years I've been coming here, they got my order wrong once.  I don't think I can say that for any other fast food place.  Bring a sack of G&J's to the office or to a party and watch folks fight over hotdogs... amazing!
<review# 402,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2013,10/18/2013,212,227,6,12,7>I'm a big fan. I wish there was one like, in my apartment building. Butttt then I would have no monies. I've recently gotten into raw foods and am always looking for new restaurants or recipes. I've even completed a raw challenge posed by Brad's Raw Foods.I found this place on Yelp (Obv) and have been twice so far. First, their mission is pretty admirable. All volunteer-run and a non-for-profit. Proceeds benefit the Thanks Jordan Foundation; check their website for more info. Moving onto the actual café: it's a small-ish size, filled with oddly-shaped tables - they're shaped like leaves! There is a lot of art around; the front window states that not only is it a cafe, but it is an art gallery as well. Next door you will find the Naked Sprouts Organics store. I was told that everything sold there is organic. There is a also a juice bar in said store, so, if you order a juice (Or bottled drink) at the café, they run next door to the store to fetch it for you. Yes, I'm trying to make "fetch" happen.So, the food. I just love raw food so I bet it would be hard to disappoint me with it. I've only ordered the leaf wraps - AMAZE. You choose either a pumpkin seed or cashew "cheeze" and can pick four items to put in the wrap. It (And all entrees) is also served with two side salads, one is usually a greens salad and the other is a fruit salad. The first time I went, my friend got cucumber rounds (Which aren't on the menu on the website) and the second time, Al B. got the "El Burrito Loco" (Also not on the menu on the website). Both friends gave their meals two thumbs up. I have also heard good things about the juice bar, but I've only gotten bottled green kombucha whilst dining there. I've also tried their vanilla macaroons for desert. While VERY delicious, I often make the same thing at home, so I'd personally skip it in the future.The only downside is the price. For me, it's worth it. The food is fresh, healthy, raw, vegan, and organic, which is inherently expensive.BUT!Keep an eye out for their Groupons. My server mentioned it the first time I went and I went and bought one. When searching for it, search for "vegan", not "raw." They also offer classes, which I found when searching for "raw" on Groupon.
<review# 403,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2013,10/17/2013,56,208,6,8,6>I would venture to say that this is the most authentic Chinese restaurant in the tri- county area.  I don't have perfect knowledge, so this is obviously an absurd statement.  However, Katy's is extremely authentic based on several items:1) The clientele-99% Han Chinese, 1% white American folk.2) The Lavatories-Straight out of Beijing baby-In serious need of a remodel, and in dire need of a serious cleaning.  Exactly like you'll find in China's capital city.3) The Food-Magnificent and plentiful, if a double digit percentage more expensive than you'll find in The North Capital. I would recommend the Dan Dan Noodle to any fan of noodles.  You'll find them nicely spicy, fairly hearty, and particularly delicious.The Moo Shu chicken was, according to my wife, the best she's ever had, and she's a big fan.  The salt and pepper shrimp was really delicious, but we aren't used to eating the shell of the shrimp (which isn't removed prior to battering and deep frying) so it's a bit odd for us ma guo ren. The xiaolongbao (steamed bun) is a really nice touch, as you don't see it much around here, and it is very good. Finally, the orange Chicken (my daughter's favorite) was quite nice.The service isn't great and the décor needs some work, but if you crave delicious and authentic, check Katy's out.
<review# 404,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/21/2013,10/16/2013,171,116,9,7,6>I have a confession. I hope this is a safe space. I LOVE the smell of bakeries. I also love baked goods.I'm often faced with a debilitating issue: I crave baked goods on Sundays. Most bakeries seem to be closed on the Lord's day. What is a guy to do?Venture to Arlington Cake Box, that's what. I scrolled through the "Open Now" options a few Sundays ago and discovered this highly rated establishment. I managed to make it in before they closed at noon. A good bear claw tends to make me go into, well, bear mode. I opted for the almond coffee cake, which was nearly a foot long, and a boston cream donut. The total was a bit hefty for two items--nearly $10.Yes, I did eat all of the coffee cake and it was delicious. And yes, I did inhale the donut.  Delicious treats, but a bit expensive.
<review# 405,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2013,10/15/2013,89,117,7,4,3>If you find yourself flipping through a dictionary of common phrases and come across the entry for 'Diamond in the Rough (n.)' you'll likely see a picture of the Two Brothers Tap House used as a context for the definition. Especially with the road construction a while back, TBTH was a challenge to find; however once we arrived, we didn't care. Two Brothers was an overall incredible experience and now a favorite destination when the timing is right and we can spend a Saturday out and about. I have been to a large handful (or two) of breweries and this one stuck out. And not just because I became huge fan of their beer in college but during my most recent visit (a few months ago) I had the chance to finally eat in their dining room. It completely surpassed the hype and then some.Hands down best fish tacos. See my tip...I'm a believer. I was also at the Food & Wine festival and met the head chef, and although the food samples were equally as delicious there, I had to shake his hand and compliment the tacos.I honestly couldn't think of a better way spend an afternoon: Getting a table and placing an order for hot pretzels and beer, bringing the cold beer on the brewery tour, returning to said table where the pretzels are waiting,ordering a flight and another beer,ordering lunch,drinking the flight,drinking the other beer,eating the most delicious fish tacos you can put in your face,drinking more beer,and then visit the gift shop (for a growler of beer).Holy cow.Obviously be responsible, then be responsible and drink a lot of tasty brews. I plan to make a weekend out of it one day (think bachelor party minus the commitment......) and get a hotel room and group and taxi and just have at it. I can't wait.I would really not be surprised if Two Brothers Tap House will quickly become one of your favorites too, just don't go during North Wind season.....more for me!Enjoy.

Well played kitchen staff, well played.I happily play into stereotypes for a good laugh.Cheers Emilio. See you Saturday.
<review# 407,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2013,10/13/2013,68,249,4,6,5>The place is a pub. Nice amount of seats both inside and outdoors. Two tv's at the bar.The hash brown casserole is worth a trip from anywhere...The plum sauce on the thick-ass pork chop was killer. Real plums. Really sweet. Decadant to say the least.Even the dinner roll was delicious with it's egg-washed top and garlicy essence. Freshly herbed butter killed the roll. They heated it up rightly so when it was served it was steaming fijcking hot!The broc and cheddar soup was especially yummy in my tummy. Yuh ME!If I am EVER in Oak Park again I will DEFINITELY revisit this joint.It's Irish from head to toe and even South Side Irish to boot.So get your Slainte on and bottoms up... theys even has da 60-minute IPA from DOGFISHHEAD... bottled... but still... as in... my butt was still in the seat 90 minutes later.They were setting up for a baby Christening so it's good for parties, yo.
<review# 408,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2013,10/12/2013,92,360,3,7,4>I came here based on a suggestion from Yelp. Good thing, too; I would never have found them otherwise.This cafe is located near downtown, but off the beaten path a bit. The dining area is surprisingly large and open, though, and being able to browse books afterwards is nice. What I loved, though, was the food.I got a spinach turkey sandwich with fruits on the side. As it turns out they just serve Terra Chips if you want the chips, so I'll get those next time. And I don't think I've ever gotten a sandwich that was as well put together as this one. The dill cheese was my favorite part of the sandwich, and all of the flavors just went well together. I was eating in a bookstore but could easily have been eating on a farm.We also got the last piece of apple crumble pie, which was more or less half apples and half crumble, and 100% goodness. With crumbles that big, you know you're getting your daily serving of butter. But the apples weren't neglected either, with some soft bites and some crunchy apple bites -- definitely leave room for dessert.We will visit this place again.
<review# 409,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2013,10/11/2013,38,95,3,10,4>Well, I figured it was about time that I wrote a review on this place since I have been going there for years and years.This place is located in a small strip mall on Lake and Rohlwing. I have to say that each and every time here, I have never had a meal that was below excellent. The food here is just delicious. I most always get pasta but I have had their specials too. Every time delicious. The bread with their house garlic butter would alone satisfy me but I know that there are lots and lots of good things to eat. The Linguine Del Gulfo (I think I spelled it right) is pretty incredible. All sorts of seafood on a perfect pasta and sauce. White clam linguine is some of the best you will have.This last visit, my wife had the spinach ravioli special which was just something else. The spinach was the pasta with a fluffy cheese stuffing in a delicious sauce that had some sage in it .I like going with her because she always lets me  try her food. ;)I also like that they provide some complimentary fruit at the end of dinner.So maybe you ask why am I only giving four stars instead of five? The prices. They are up there. They are dollars more than I believe they should be but I still go there anyway because it is so good. Their pour on the wine could be larger too, but so what? I get two glasses.I am glad I live fairly close by.Hands down, this is the best place for Italian food in the western suburbs. Really.Cheers to All
<review# 410,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2013,10/10/2013,8,48,3,8,2>We had a wonderful night.  The room was clean and the pool suite was amazing.  I would expect nothing less for the $460 we spent to be there on a Saturday night.  The pool was heated, the shower/steam room was luxurious and I would absolutely stay there again.  That being said....there were things that needed to be addressed.First, $460 to stay in Woodridge IL is pretty darn pricey.  I would never spend an extra $100 just to be there on a Saturday again.  There were no plates or silverware in the room.  For that price, it should be stocked with more than a few Styrofoam and plastic cups.  Included in that price was the $30 extra we spent to add their "Birthday Package".  This included a bottle of champagne (pretty good), 2 Champagne Lodge glasses, a small birthday cake (more than enough for two) and rose petals on the bed.  With this came two small Styrofoam plates and plastic forks and knives.  There was not a tool even big enough to cut the cake.  We managed...but again...for the price we paid it just seemed cheap.The rose petals were fake.  All I could think about was how many beds these petals had been spread on before ours and how many couples probably hadn't moved them off of the bed before....well....you know.  Gross.  This should have been mentioned on the website.  They should have said "faux rose petals" or something more honest.  All in all, we still had an amazing time.  There was mood lighting, Sirius radio throughout the whole suite, a huge TV in the room and another in the pool room.  We spent more time in the pool than we did in the room.  I give it four stars because the Champagne Lodge deserves it but they should address these issues.  PS:  The ladies behind the desk were super nice and courteous.
<review# 411,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2013,10/9/2013,101,611,7,9,10>Blissful Banana is one of those businesses that has been on my 'bookmark' list for ages, but I've never actually been in the area at the right time to make it happen. I'm happy to report that I'm able to check it off my list and boy, did it live up to my expectations!I started with a Gorilla Coffee, which is an iced coffee w/ smashed banana and mocha. So. Freaking. Good. I can't believe I never thought of smashing bananas and putting them in my coffee before, but you can bet that I'm going to make that creation every day now. There's a small part of me that wishes I would have foregone the coffee, so I could have ordered the frozen banana dessert, but it's a perfect excuse to come back soon to try it.First off, I didn't really know that this was a sit-down type of place (I thought it was more of a grab and go), so I felt somewhat awkward in the fact that I was sans dining companion and was alone, but the waitress made me feel really at home and 100% less awkward. Although the menu had 3-4 items that I was equally intrigued by, I went with the Idalia panini because I have a major love affair with pork. It was pork, ham, cheese, pickles, mustard and mayo. I don't really know how to descriptively explain this because I lost all brain power as soon as it hit my tongue. It was that wonderful. What brought me here in the first place was the fact that they offer a lot of gluten-free options, but I didn't even end up ordering GF. Oh well.My waitress was so great and kept checking back on me. It took me an obscenely long time to finish the panini because I just got my braces adjusted and this wasn't exactly an easy item to devour with sore teeth. She didn't rush me at all and just wanted to make sure that I didn't need anything. Fabulous!I've already told at least 3-4 of my friends about this place and I was trying to see if I had an excuse to be in Orland Park again tomorrow to come back. Sadly, I can't think of any good reason to justify the drive -- unless you count that blissful dessert. THAT alone justifies any commute.
<review# 412,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2013,10/8/2013,826,1108,12,12,8>Frank's has major potential and I'm proud to have such a cool business in my town. Let's be real:  Plainfield doesn't have much even downtown and outside of downtown is a lot of chain eateries. I had the cheddarhead hot dog and the cajun fries.  The hot dog came covered in cheese sauce and cheese curds. The hot dog was good but not what I expected.  The cheese sauce was good, but I expected typical fried cheese curds.  These curds were hunks of warm cheese pre-fry.  Next time I would probably just get the cheese covered dog.The cajun fries were very good.  I liked the spicy aioli, and the fries were well seasoned.  The portion (just over $2) was big enough to share.I really wanted to try the salted caramel shake mentioned in a previous review.  I thought they did seasonal shakes, but it appears they do a "shake of the day." That day's shake was Oreo, so I just got a lemonade instead.My husband had the "Notorious PIG" and the chili dog.  Both looked good (the PIG is covered in bacon, jalapenos, pork and cheese).  He said both were good although he didn't seem impressed.  On his last visit, he had the "Deep South," his favorite so far.Service is...awkward.  The cashier did not say a word to us and we never heard her say hello to any customers.  She literally just stood there and stared at us.  When she dropped off our food, she just showed us the tray and asked, "is this yours?"  How should I know?  I've never eaten here and they're all covered in cheese.I don't think it was intentional; something tells me she is family or it's her first job - or both.  I don't need you to kiss my feet, but some kind of signal (lights? smoke signals? any language, really) that you are ready for me to order or you can SEE me standing there would help.
<review# 413,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2013,10/7/2013,58,209,2,4,3>I am a fairly active person and I workout 4-5 days a week at Lifetime.  I was never sure what kind of workout/training shoes were right for my feet, so I spent a lot of money and made many shoe mistakes at places like Sports Authority and Dick's.  My left foot is always stiff in the mornings and after fighting through the pain for about 7-8 years, I finally gave in a visited a podiatrist who worked with me and sent me to Naperville Running Store.  When a doctor sends you to a shoe place, you assume it's pretty good so my sister and I set-off to find out what this place was all about.My sis and I were both in the need of new shoes so the poor girl who worked with us, had not just one customer but two of us to please at the same time.  My sister doesn't have any foot issues and found a pair of Brooks shoes that she loved very quickly.  $110 for the pair and she was in love.  I on the other hand tried on roughly every neutral pair of shoes they had in my size, plus a few stabilizing shoes.   I probably tried on 15 pairs in all, sounds ridiculous, but for me, this is less than average.  I usually wander around a larger sports stores for an hour plus trying to find a shoe that doesn't feel terrible... sad I know.  I finally chose a pair of Nike shoes for $130, they were the most comfortable pair I tried out of all the options presented and passed the treadmill test as well.  Yes, they have a treadmill available so that they can tape your foot and so you can see if the shoes you have are comfortable... awesome.Not only was the girl helping us very knowledgeable about feet and foot strides but she was patient with me as well.  I was getting frustrated that my darn feet are messed up, and she was persistent in trying to help me find the right pair.  I really appreciated that she was so friendly and helpful.   I would recommend this store to anyone with special shoes needs, this place is great!
<review# 414,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2013,10/6/2013,180,420,4,7,5>When my wife saw this place on the yelp app she thought it was an Italian place.  "Let's check out Vinotie," she said.  After enjoying a good laugh, we decided to check it out.  Wow.  We really liked the place.It has nice decor with a balance of a homey feel.  At first we were a bit worried bringing our 15 month old, cause some times if she's feeling rowdy, we don't want to create a ruckus in the smaller restaurants.  It turns out there was nothing to fear. The staff was very friendly and enjoyed playing peekaboo with our daughter.  They took turns to make sure we were taken care of which is kind of nice.  It wasn't super busy but it wasn't quiet either.  It's nice when there is a team mentality so you don't have to look for your specific waiter/waitress.  Quite a lot of pickup orders came through while we were eating.  So that must be a good sign.We both got bubble smoothies (green tea and honey dew).  They were a little sweet, but the tapioca balls were very yummy.  Not like undercooked or anything like some places.  We also got the sampler of apps to try out some of their different apps.  They were pretty good overall.I got the kao soy and my wife got the Pad Thai.  They were both pretty good.  The Kee Mao was a little different than the one I usually get but it was still delicious and I was happy to have the option.  It isn't always available at many other Thai restaurants.  The Pad Thai was also pretty good in my opinion.  Believe it or not you can get bad Pad Thai.  The fresh sprigs of cilantro were delicious.Will definitely be back.
<review# 415,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2013,10/5/2013,76,143,4,6,3>This store... THIS STORE!!!!!I spent at least an hour in here looking at EVERYTHING. Its vintage-preppy-masculine-clean makes me want to move in and never leave. The glassware is phenomenal, the candles are so wonderful and decidedly neutral (no frou frou here), and I almost bought a canoe. If you need a gift for a man, or a woman, or a boss, or anyone!!! The VOLUSPA CANDLES are fantastic. Chestnut & Vetiver is the best scent to ever enter my nasal canal. Second best is the "Library" scent from Y.B. Supply Co.I don't understand how this place can be compared to a certain other semi-local store. Yearbook's owners are friendly, funny, and have a fantastic and beautiful store. The other store can't even compare, especially after you take into account their rude and extremely inhospitable owner.Bottom line: Got a man in your life, or just prefer neutral or masculine items? Go here. You are welcome.
<review# 416,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2013,10/4/2013,123,246,6,11,7>After my dismal experience with the last local Chinese place that I tried out, I decided to take Ali R.'s advice and order only from her suggested items. Apparently that was is they key to really enjoying the great food that a place has to offer and why we should all trust the suggestions of our fellow Yelpers even more.Located in a small, nondescript strip mall on the corner of Nerge and Plum Grove is this tiny restaurant that is family owned and very obviously family run.  The interior was notably clean and void of distracting or garish "traditional" decor that can sometimes scream lack of taste at some Chinese restaurants.  We were seated promptly and given time, without pressure, to get a good look at the menu. This is appreciated because too many restaurants theses days seem to pressure their patrons to quickly decide in order to turn the table over, especially during peak hours.From Ali R.'s suggestions, we chose the minced shrimp stuffed tofu and the house special pan fried noodles.  From the Americanized side of the menu we chose the ginger chicken just to get a feel for their version of that sub-genre of Chinese food.  Everything came out pretty much as we expected except for the shrimp stuffed tofu. Wow. I never knew such tasty hot triangular stuffed tofu pockets of shrimpy heaven even existed! This was our favorite by far and became an instant household favorite for us on future visits.  The pan fried noodles seemed fairly standard with three different meats cooked to perfection mingled with fresh veggies in a clear and savory sauce poured over partially crispy fried noodles. I guess the distinct lack of excess grease would be the main difference I noticed.The ginger chicken was what you would expect. Battered and deep fried pieces of chicken then tossed with the sauce of your choosing. There was no doubt that there was ginger in the sauce as the flavor was distinct but pleasant. The breading was notably less than your standard Americanized style which IMO tastes so much better. I was able to actually taste the chicken and realize that it was not overcooked--something I find happens much too often. I could also actually see the shape of the chicken pieces instead of guessing it was chicken that I was eating completely obscured by a blob of thick batter. Bravo. I bet their other Americanized dishes that use this style of chicken or other meat are just excellent because of this minimal breading method.We noticed a distinct difference between the Americanized dish and the traditional dishes we ordered: traditional dishes were not salty while the ginger chicken hung on the salty side.  The traditional dishes did not require rice as a neutral accompaniment but the ginger chicken begged for rice. As a person who absolutely abhors excess use of salt in cooking, I really appreciated that the cook allowed me to actually taste the delicate flavors of the dish without using salt as a crutch to deliver perceived flavor. For this reason alone I'd return to ND.So the lesson I learned is listen to a fellow Yelper who seems to be an expert diner at a particular restaurant. It's like having a friend along with you that knows what and how to order at a new restaurant.  Never judge a restaurant based on what YOU would order at every OTHER restaurant because those restaurants are NOT the same. I think I'm going to have to re-try other locations that I've written off after this valuable lesson.BTW, the service here is excellent. While we did not have special requests, other tables had plenty and the owners themselves were more than happy to accommodate in any way possible. Even going so far as to actually make a beginner set of chopsticks with the paper wrapper and a rubber band for someone who was not yet able to use chopsticks to eat. Customers were even calling the owners by their first names. I can see why so many have made this place their special go-to spot.
<review# 417,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2013,10/3/2013,31,104,12,16,11>I've long dreaded reviewing this place. I've been coming here since it opened like twice a month but a part of me just doesn't want to review it. I don't want to, I don't want others to know but that's apparently already too late given the 45 minute waits for dinner on a Wednesday night. God this is painful to say but....this is my favorite restaurant. In my travels eating all over the place this restaurant in my opinion has reached the perfect balance of quality, taste, price, portion, service, and ambiance. God it love it so. Let me explain:I've had a history with Yu's Mandarin which used to be my favorite but as the rumors go, their head chef sold the place and quit. He waited a while and then opened up this place down the street with basically the same recipe's as Yu's but with slight improvements. Quality at Yu's declined over the years as it changed hands and now a lot of their formers followers moved to Chef Ping, I being one of them. I've eaten most of their menu but these are my favorites:Hot and Sour Soup: Unique to only YU's and Chef Ping, it tastes amazing and has that slow warming spiciness you get int he back of the throat with Szechuan flour peppers and white pepper. Not your average takeout hot and sour here. Mandarin Duck: Pretty much the only place to get it done right. These take like 3 days to make and the taste is impeccable. You probably won't find a better version of this anywhere else here or IN CHINA!Pork with Chinese Yellow Chives: Also hard to find in the burbs, Yellow chives are like regular chinese chives except not allowed to see sunlight so they turn yellow and has a very subtle taste to them similar to how they grow white asparagus. 8 Treasures: The ultimate smorgasbord of tastiness, they are fishball, sea cucumber, ham, chicken, tofu, squid, shrimp, and mushrooms. You can't go wrong with this dish. Steamed Flounder: Don't let the name fool you, theres more to this than a steamed fish, It comes on a giant platter with scallions and peppers and a wonderful sweetened soy sauce (See picture). Egg Yolk Crab: Pretty decadent, its a giant  dungeonous  crab cooked with the flavor of chinese salted duck yolks. Tastes like heaven, probably hell on your arteries. I could go on for another 2 pages but I'll spare you and let you explore for yourself. Being a new building, the place looks very nice with great lighting. Service is never slow and the kitchen cooks lightning fast. All the turnover ensures a fantastic fresh quality meal. In my opinion, this place is near perfect if not perfect. Definitely DO NOT take my word for it. Go and taste for yourself. I'll probably be the pissed off guy in the waiting area wishing no one else knew about this gem of a place so I can have it all to myself.
<review# 418,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2013,10/2/2013,298,465,11,14,12>HAD to come back after the fabulous event last week!  Just couldn't stay away. =]Stopped in today right when they were opening (11AM.) to pick up some items for dinner tonight and get the kids a little ice cream treat.  This place looks like a diner, has the feel of a typical pizza place but the menu of a straight up FOODIE!  So many great options, it's hard to decide.  But while you do, you can play a little game of bowling on the Kinect. =]I was greeted by the chef and he is actually the one who took my order today!  Holla!  And PS...Chef...LOVEEEE the overalls look!  You don't need to cover up in a chef's jacket...this was much more you!  Loved it!I ordered the burger of the week, which is a beef braised burger, the adult mac & cheese with the buffalo Alfredo and the vegetarian goat thick crust pizza.  Of course, I got sides of the ghost pepper bbq sauce and the inferno mustard sauce for dipping.  What what!!  I definitely could not wait for dinner to try everything, so I took a few bites as soon as I got home.  The mac and cheese was amazing, the pizza (and CRUST) was to die and that burger (fratospizza.com/menu/bur…)...OMG...that burger...it was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had.  Honestly.  It ranks up there with the big boys...like Kuma's.  Seriously.  The perfectly toasted pretzel roll, arugula, havarti, mayo, tomato, juicy meat and some of the best mushrooms...ever!  So rich and flavorful...I can't wait to have Fred try some when he gets home later!  The customer service was on point and the food was even better!!  Cannot wait to come back again and again and again...love you Frato's and shout out to Chef!  Holla!
<review# 419,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2013,10/1/2013,59,151,2,7,3>I ate at Harvest Room last night on the recommendation of a friend and fellow yelper. Since eating here, I have already raved about this place to coworkers and it's not even noon the next day.Since becoming vegetarians, Dan and I have struggled to find places that offer us more options than pasta or pizza. So after looking at the menu for this place, it was immediately decided that we'd try this place and it was awesome. The best thing about this place is that their food is all from local sources. They have a map on the wall and actually can name their farms where they meat and veggies come from. That equals quality!!!Although I went there for the variety of vegetarian and vegan options (which beats out any local place), I commend them for their choices in meat. Their meat is grass fed and not from a factory farm. Don't know what a factory farm is? Google it and then you'll see why the food Harvest Room serves has a better quality.Another note, don't walk in wearing your pajamas! Dan and I felt a little under dressed in hoodies and yoga pants. They didn't turn us away but I'd dress a little nicer next time.So good that I'm actually going to review each dish that we ordered in details.Appetizer: Mediterranean DipThis is actually three different dips: Hummas, Feta, and whipped Goat Cheese, all served with warm pita bread. First of all, we ate this like it was going out of style. What was left of the dip, we took home with us... not because there was a lot left, but because we refused to waste any bit of it.Salad with our EntreeI love salads when they use leafy greens and not the white, watery stuff. This salad was good and the dressing was okay. It came with a warmed pretzel roll and really delicious butter. EntreeWe split the Seared Tofu Steak over the Quinoa with greens and pomegrante syrup. This was great. We only recently discovered that we loved quinos and I want to know the recipe of how The Harvest Room makes it!Also, I never tried Tofu from a restaurant, only make it at home. I did like the tofu but still prefer it cut up into small pieces. This dish had two big blocks of tofu but it tasted good.Because we split the Entree, we also added some sides. Let's just say we were able to take home a portion of everything. We got the skillet mac-n-cheese and the whipped potatoes. The whipped potatoes were delicious and I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch.The mac-n-cheese? let's just say I wouldn't have broken up with Dan if he had eaten them all and I couldn't order more for myself. I was prepared with fork fight him off for them! They had such great flavor and a big side for $5.And fellow yelpers, they have breakfast too. I plan to return and have breakfast and I swear I'll update my review then.
<review# 420,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2013,9/30/2013,771,552,6,12,12>I love Fridays. Mainly because I get to go to lunch and enjoy up and coming local places. This one in particular is definitely up and coming. My brother suggested I go and check out their wings, so of course I did. We walked in and for some reason expected a hostess but nobody said anything, so I asked if they were open. One of the owners/managers apologized and told us to sit wherever and immediately we had a waitress at our table. The menu is decent, as is their beer selection. Lots of craft beer, good prices too. The first time I visited we had the following: 12 Wing Appetizer - Whoa, these things were HUGE! Ginormous wings, not your typical Buffalo Wild Wings wings. Make sense? We got three flavors: Hot, Sweet & Hot and Parmesan garlic. My favorite was the Sweet & Hot. The Lombardian - Thick fried Wisconsin cheddar on top of 1/3 pound patty. Need I say more. Mmmm hmm."Bear Down" Burger - Bacon, Fried Onions, Cheese and whiskey BBQ sauce. All of the items hit the spot. For dessert, like we needed it right, the owner told us they were trying out a new dessert (creme brûlée) and gave it to us on the house. It was FANTASTIC!!! Who would have known that a dessert would be that good at a sports bar?Then, the awesome Chef - Rene - came out and asked about the food. You could tell she loves doing what she does and wanted to make sure we enjoyed every last bite.  Since my first visit I have gone back several times, tried more items on the menu and haven't been disappointed once. Lets not forget about Bacon Thursday, yup, exactly what it sounds like. All the menu items are made with......wait for it........wait.......BACON! youtube.com/watch?v=-Uqs… Hey we're only human right. Lol here's their Thursday bacon menu: otlombard.com/Thursday_B…I don't understand why some of the reviews are on here. Blasting businesses is not nice. Overtime has decent prices and would be the perfect place to catch a game. Plus they offer free taxi's on Friday and Saturday if you live in the area. Um....HELLOOOO how could you go wrong with that. They really care for their patrons. They always have awesome deals going during the week and weekends. Check out their Facebook page (facebook.com/otlombard?r…) for them. Karaoke, trivia, good food, good drinks, yea, can't go wrong.
<review# 421,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2013,9/29/2013,414,227,5,11,7>Really? I can only give five stars to this amazing hospital? Well, okay...but please know they're worthy of at least ten. Or maybe more, even.Let me start by saying that I am entirely hospital-phobic in a big way. Even for the happiest of occasions, I'm still...eh at best. My son was born at Palos seven years ago and the experience was, well, passable. Having an OB with privilege at both Palos & Christ, my husband and I decided to go to Christ for our daughter's birth this past February. Y'know, try something new & all that. In short? Best.decision.ever.Since my son was born via "C", we decided to take the same path with our little girl. Start to finish, my time at Christ was awesome. Forgetting for a moment that the experience brought one of the most amazing little girls I've ever known into my life, the staff was top notch from start to finish. What I remember most about my prior birth experience at Palos was that I felt like an inconvenience if I asked for anything (& believe me, I'm not the type to call the nurses' station unless I *really* need something). At Christ, all of my nurses were so on the ball that I barely needed to ask for anything--they were always one step ahead of me. They treated me with respect and didn't push their own--or anyone else's--agenda on me. We kept our daughter in room with us for our entire two day stay, and the feature of an extra bed in our private room awarded my husband a reasonably comfortable place to rest. They made sure my dietary preferences were respected when I was finally able to eat again, and one of my nurses even moved heaven & earth to find me a portable fan when the heater went seemingly awry & threatened to sweat me out of the room. Check out was as painless as check in, and I was almost sad to be leaving so many rock awesome people. Almost, but not quite. (Like I said, I really do hate hospitals.)Lastly, I need to give a shout out to the amazing anesthesiologist who took such good care of me during my c-section. I believe her name was Dr. Major. She was incredible. I was a mix of anxiety and SO much elated excitement and she helped make my actual section surgical experience so great. Actually, the whole OR team was fantastic. Seriously, I can't say enough about the amazing staff in L&D at Christ. Best of the best, guaranteed.
<review# 422,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2013,9/28/2013,66,166,6,8,6>Man, Elena's is so awesome at what they do, it makes me want to go back and revise a few things down a star in comparison. I'd been here once a long time ago, but for some reason kept forgetting about it, even though it's super nearby. That's mostly because its hours just don't jibe with when I'm usually thinking about needing some delicious Italian deli sandwiches, salads, and home cooking. Luckily, I stopped by for a sandwich and a salad the other day, since my SO had a day off and it seemed like a nice thing to share. When you go into Elena's, there's a nice little display case with some Italian cookies and freshly made food sitting in it. There are also a couple of little tables, and some cute homey decorations that make you instantly feel like this is a place that cares about what they do. Elena's does a lot of catering business, but they also have a little menu on a chalkboard behind the display cases. If you have trouble reading it, they also have paper menus available over by the register. They offer several sub, panini, and salad options -- and if you want to change what's on the menu? They're happy to accommodate you. At first, this might be a little intimidating. If you know what you want, however, you'll be fine.For example, my SO really wanted a roast beef sandwich. He also loves grilled and roasted veggies (minus onion) and pesto. I saw the cold grilled veggie sandwich with pesto on the menu, and asked if they could add roast beef. The woman (Elena? Not sure. I should have asked -- she was so sweet!) smiled and said, "Of course!" Not only did she add roast beef -- she sliced it fresh right then and there. RIGHT THEN AND THERE, PEOPLE. She also let me add grilled eggplant to the sandwich. I ordered a large sub (subs come in 6" or 10" sizes) , which automatically comes with a bag of chips. My SO was so happy with his sandwich, he ate it very slowly -- something he never does. He also asked why we'd never had Elena's food before. Another first: he couldn't finish the sandwich in one sitting. He ate it for lunch AND dinner. As for me, I ordered an antipasto salad for myself. I, too, didn't have room for dinner. That was a DELIGHTFUL salad. Homemade balsamic vinaigrette was perfect. Quality of the cured Italian meats in the sandwich couldn't be nicer -- and mmm, beautiful kalamata olives with perfect brininess! Of special note: in both the salad and the sandwich, the tomatoes were bursting with ripeness -- something which alone can win my heart over. I even said to the woman preparing my food, "Thank you for using ripe tomatoes!" She responded, "I only like them when they're ripe, too." That? That's someone who cares. That's who you want preparing your food. The bottom line? Even something as seemingly simple as salads and sandwiches is greatly affected by the quality of the ingredients used. Elena's takes such pride in what they're doing that you can't ask for better. This will become a go-to place for us, I'm sure. So they're not open for dinner? We'll just have to plan better so we can enjoy their deliciousness more often. :9
<review# 423,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2013,9/27/2013,758,308,7,10,7>I've tried several items from here, all via their drive-thru, and I haven't had a bad experience. Always fast service. Good prices.Items that I've tried:chicken kabob value meal ($3.49) - chicken was seasoned and not dry. I opted for rice pilaf and potatoes rather than a salad or fries. The rice pilaf and potatoes were simply good, nothing complicated flavorwise.shrimp kabob value meal (4.59) - good, but the chicken is better. The salad was satisfying with cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers. It comes with an Italian dressing if you don't mention a preference.chicken tender value meal ($4.29 with 20 oz drink) - great value. It might be a small meal though for my brother, but the portions work for me.I've also tried their pork and beef kabobs. The pork was good, but the beef wasn't tender.This place is a solid, straightforward lunch option if you're in the area. Also, the menu isn't complicated for newcomers, which is a bonus ;)
<review# 424,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2013,9/26/2013,288,400,3,3,2>Our regular go to breakfast joint was closed (it was 3pm) and we found Christy's by a recommendation of a family member and my need for steak and eggs, yes it was not a want, but a need. My craving steak and eggs were undeniable.Christy's is a spacious, clean, well lit diner with a retro early 50s counter that almost had me thinking twice before sitting at the booth. We were greeted and seated immediately. The menu is vast with many options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Our server was what we believe a newbie. He didn't know if the steak and eggs came with potatoes (had to go ask), brought out butter to our table before we even ordered (in the end we didn't need the butter, our toast came buttered), and awkwardly checks up on us, which is not big deal, I've worked in restaurants before it's hard being the new person/training.Scott opted for the chorizo omelette while I went with the skirt steak (medium rare, always!) and double yolk eggs and hasbrowns (yelp.com/biz_photos/chri…). The chorizo omelette was overwhelmed chorizo that didn't allow us to taste anything else, not even the eggs, most likely won't be ordering that again, but the steak and eggs? Egg-tastic! Steak-rific! The steak was cooked to perfection and tender. First time having double yolk eggs and I enjoyed them, how can I not? I love yolk. I even shared some of my steak with Scott and he enjoyed it too, actually I'm sure he was a bit jealous because his chorizo omelette wasn't satisfying.  We were asked by other servers, possibly the owner/host how everything was and our server did his best. Because of those awesome steak and eggs I'll definitely be back to try the rest of their menu.
<review# 425,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2013,9/25/2013,436,333,8,13,7>This review is for their Sunday Champagne Brunch....Party of 10 today with an 11:00am reservation.   I had never been here before, but it was recommended by a friend.   The brunch doesn't start until 11:00, cost is $15.95 and includes a mimosa or champagne or soft-drink of choice.    I think this place has been around forever, just like the clientele that visits.  Don't let the 70+ crowd deter you from coming here.   The food was fabulous.I'm not a big breakfast person, and I'm guessing because the brunch starts so late, they don't offer a ton of breakfast items on the buffet.   The buffet was pretty big.   There were eggs, bacon, sausage, fruit and a make-your-own-something bar (maybe omelets or pancakes, didn't check it out).   There was a sirloin, ham, and turkey carving station.   I will say the chicken picatta was amazingly good. The chicken was not dry and the rice & sauce was perfect.   The mac & cheese was awesome.  Meatballs, sausage & peppers, a few types of fish, shrimp, a few other pasta dishes, oh - so much food!   The salad selection was poor, I think there was one lone green salad, tucked away in the corner.   Giant platter of fresh cut up fruit - all in season.   The dessert table had several pies, lemon squares, chocolate square things, cookies, and several other calorie laden items. The food was all fresh, great quality, and cooked perfectly.  We were there from 11:00 - 12:30 and it was not crowded - not sure when/if it ever fills up.   Service was great.   You can maneuver you way around the walkers, canes, and hover-rounds - and hit this place up on a Sunday - great quality for a great price.
<review# 426,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2013,9/24/2013,160,525,4,9,11>I've never reviewed this place!? Crazy. This is absolutely one of my favorite bars! I should really start drinking daily so I can hang out here more. The service is always friendly! When I first started going in I was a little nervous. Some of the bars around here can be crappy to outsiders. I haven't had that problem at all here. The bartenders know craft beer and they are happy to chat about what they have that's new. The beer selection is pretty awesome. I'm not saying they have 40 taps, but the selection here gets the job done. They are always adding something new and are happy to make a suggestion. The food is awesome! Don't bother trying to watch calories here. It's almost impossible. They have some of the best burgers around. For a small fee you can add an appetizer on the side of your burger (onion rings, fried zucchini, etc). It's a decent size space but does fill up during games. They have a nice outdoor patio and a separate party room. I'm thinking my Summer may be spent on the patio here.
<review# 427,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2013,9/23/2013,151,128,6,10,9>I'm not particularly spiritual, but I believe my home has a soul. It's a free standing structure that shelters me from wind, rain, snow, and sleet. The blistering summer sun, hailstones, and 50 MPH winds. It's been providing these services for us since we took ownership in 2005. And for the families before us, going back to 1922.I heard a thoughtful sentiment on the morning of January 5th, 2012. "The furnace is the heart of your home." I heard this from a sales rep from Perfect Home Services by the name of Jake. He was telling me this because, you see, my home suffered a massive and fatal heart attack the very night before.We arrived home around 1 AM from a small get together. The temperature in the house read 48 degrees. What could we do? Go to bed with a space heater and wake up 47 times during the night because I was so paranoid about the thing catching fire. Woke up Saturday morning freezing cold and wondering who to call. As luck would have it, my Angie's List deal of the day waiting in my inbox was from Perfect Home Services. How ironic. I called them up and long story short (but it will be long anyway), we received utterly fantastic service from them from start to finish. Jason, the repair tech, was out to our house within the hour. He took our ancient furnace apart and reported that it was indeed dead. The cost to repair? $2000. I stopped him and asked how much a new one would be, and he looked truly relieved because he said, and I quote, "I would feel so completely awful taking your money for something that will be 100% broken in a matter of months anyway." Jason is the goods. Honest, friendly, and respectful.Jason leaves, and Jake P. arrives about an hour later to help us choose our new furnace. Jake was also very honest, friendly, and patient with us while my husband and I ducked into the kitchen many times to have private whispered meetings about how much we could afford, etc. We finalize things, Jake leaves, and within two hours Ben and Woody show up to remove our old furnace and install the new one. At the risk of sounding like a broken record, these two gentlemen were also wonderfully polite, friendly, and respectful of our home. The job was gruesome, being an older home, and they completed it in as long as it took to complete it, if that makes sense. They didn't rush through it just to get it done. They were thorough, neat, clean, and astoundingly proficient. All of the people I've written about worked as an impressively cohesive team that made our experience with Perfect Home Services the most enjoyable we've had than with any other home project we've had to face since moving into our home. I would recommend them to ANYONE. I thank them a million times. And we are warm again. Being snug and warm in the winter is, well, perfect......
