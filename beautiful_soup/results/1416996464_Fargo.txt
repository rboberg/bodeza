<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/29/2014,11/26/2014,2,15,,1,1>Peppers has very good food, not real expensive,  excellent appetizers and a good atmosphere for conversation. It's not too loud or too crowded.  They have 3 excellent appetizers the breaded mushrooms, fried pickles and the con queso.  They have good free Wi-Fi and lots of TV's.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/18/2014,11/25/2014,2,4,1,2,2>Great food and great price. The drunken Noddles was super.  The gyoza appetizer was very flavorful. Recommend this restaurant when in Fargo.  I'll be back again
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2014,11/24/2014,13,3,1,5,2>There's a place that just opened last week in Fargo (next to Panda Express, on 45th St. S) called Uncle Maddio's Pizza Joint.  They started in Atlanta, GA, and they're a create your own pizza joint!Went there for lunch today, and it was REALLY good!  Everything was fresh, tasted amazing, and they've got a gazillion different toppings.  They have really nice vegan and gluten-free options (vegan cheese, grilled tofu, and gluten free crust), as well as all the other meat-lovers toppings, so you can take ALL your friends there for a pizza party!Very reasonably priced, and great atmosphere!  I will definitely be going there again!  The kids loved it, too!Oh and I almost forgot to mention how fast they were!  We got our food within 10 minutes!Just thought I'd let you guys in on something so awesome!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/11/2014,11/23/2014,1,9,1,2,2>This is my regular place for my nails and the ladies are great! They are super quick and friendly, and the particular gel polish they use is supposed to last longer. Mine usually lasts 2.5 weeks. A regular gel mani is $30- I'd say that's worth it. There are rewards cards, but you have to see the same technician every time, so be careful when you're scheduling to request the tech you want.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/15/2014,11/22/2014,6,72,1,2,2>Fast food often suffers from criticisms of low quality (especially with McDonald's and Burger King).  That is NOT the case with Panda Express!  I first tried the chain when I ate at one at a rest stop on the Chicago Skyway.  I heard one opened up in Fargo and I had a gift card for the joint so I decided to try it out.It impressed me.  The beef with broccoli is just right.  It is not at all greasy or starchy.  A recent addition to the menu, orange chicken with bacon, really wowed me too.  The egg rolls are moist and crispy; the fried rice met my expectations.  The selection of beverages are good too - try the Sobe Lean Cranberry Grapefruit for a tasty yet no-calorie beverage.If you need something that's good but cheap and want to stay away from your typical chain burger place, go to Panda Express.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/16/2014,11/21/2014,0,38,1,1,1>Starting with the craft cocktails, French HoDo for me, 1st and Broadway for my companion, through a beet salad, to an incredible bone in pork chop with pork belly (seems like an odd combo, but not when you taste it) and sweet potato gnocchi and my companion's bison flat iron steak everything was on a par with meals I've had in NYC, Chicago, and my hometown foodie neighborhood of Lowertown, St. Paul.  Dessert also to die for.  I get to Fargo 2-3 times a year and now I'll need to budget for a meal at HoDo every time.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2014,11/20/2014,1,4,1,4,2>Emily was our waitress and her recommendations were spot on.  The monk fish which is a very rare special was exceptional and it was very refreshing to have a waitress that really knew the entire wine list just as well as she knew the menu. If your travels take you to Fargo this is a "must go "place.
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/13/2014,11/19/2014,80,136,1,3,3>OK, 5 stars is for the staff, but after staying here for a week while working on a state senate campaign, I got to loving my sweet suite too.Heather, Mary, Marie, Katie, Nathan, Cole  - the list goes on of really nice people working here.  Tho I travelled alone, I was never without a friendly face to give me directions, heads up, etc.  Nice touch too, Wednesdays is a VSN - very special night.  I'm not going to give it away, just make sure your stay includes a Wednesday.Great exercise room, free washer/dryer (bring your own suds), right across from the airport and the Fargo Air Museum.  Did I mention North Dakota has 2.2% unemployment rate?  Met a person from Rhode Island coming to work in the state.Also right next to the North Dakota State University campus. I was there on a game day and the enthusiasm of the NDSU folks rivals Broncos!  Course, college versus pro is a factor.Healthy breakfasts (free) but check the hours - different during the week from the weekend, refrigerator, stove and microwave in the room with all the kitchen gadgets you'd need to cook a meal, really comfy bed (hate to say it's better than mine at home) and CLEAN!  J.M. nailed it with the "small side" but as a smallish person, felt just right for me.Mark L really gave a thorough review and I'm not going to repeat all he said, suffice it to say we agree on all the amenities.  Since I lost my cell phone after the 3rd day,the free computer in the business center was a real plus!
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/15/2014,11/18/2014,0,4,2,2,1>Good pub, lots of TVs with sports on. The french fries are some of my favorites and the soft pretzel with beer cheese soup is a good appetizer. Decent beer selection.  One of my go to places.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,11/17/2014,8,2,1,1,2>Awesome. Cannot recommend enough. They did an awesome job on my 1 year old's hair despite constant sudden head movements. Staff is really friendly and super pro. Price quite reasonable.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/17/2014,11/16/2014,2,16,2,3,2>Writing about donuts only, never tried food and/or coffee.I stopped in ther this morning on my way to work, to see what the had. I am guessing that they had about 20 different kinds of donuts out.  Most are kinds you would never see anywhere else.  Examples, a donut with chocolate frosting and reese's pieces on top, a maple long john with bacon on it, and a donut with white frosting and fruity pebbles.  I liked the variety that they had.  I ordered the bacon maple long john, the reeses peices, and a bavarian cream long john.  My bill for all three was $4.76, so they are a little higher priced than Hornbachers and etc.  The reeses peices donut was my favorite, it really brought out the kid in me.  The maple bacon was was good, kind of like eating a normal breakfest.  The bavarian cream was just alright.. mainly because my donut was only a quarter filled, and I know it happens where donuts dont get filled all the way.  I did like what little filling I got to taste.  Overall, I would stop in again on my way to work like I did this morning.  I only did a grab and go, so I did not pay much attention to the inside.  The gentleman at the counter was very polite and happy.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2014,11/15/2014,1,12,2,1,1>I am Italian by marriage, and I know good Italian food when I have it. Carino's has Really good food!  The small order of Mozzarella Marinara was big enough for two. The lasagna was delicious, the bread with olive oil and garlic to die for.  Excellent environment.  Server gets an A+
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2014,11/14/2014,56,6,1,3,3>One of the best places to get pizza in Fargo!I love every pizza I've tried so far at this place - and the rooftop patio rocks my world!  I love coming here on a nice balmy summer night in Fargo to share a few drinks with friends.  The cheesy bread appetizer is a must, and Louisiana Saturday night is my favorite pizza!If you're looking for dessert, try their s'mores pizza.  We ate here and tried it with the cho-latte martinis. LOL.  It was delicious!
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2014,11/13/2014,25,54,1,2,4>Wonderful art studio in the heart of Fargo. Excellent location and beautiful art. Very contemporary and stand-out art that I didn't except. Love the photographs they have available for purchase too, especially the horse ones. The staff is extremely friendly and willing to talk to you all day about the local artist. Never had the chance to do a yoga class, but I have heard wonderful things.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/24/2013,11/11/2014,0,5,2,2,1>This place is fantastic!  Great selection, great service... large selection.  Prices can be very reasonable too.  They have such a wide selection from super expensive and rare to extremely cheap.   And the penny sale can't be beat when it is going on, although prepare for the "hardcore" shoppers...
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2014,11/10/2014,13,4,2,2,2>I've eaten a lot of Chinese food in my time all over the country.  This is by far hands down my Favorite.  They just opened a new location in the Osgood Shopping center in South Fargo.  Broccoli Beef, Generals Tao's, Orange Chicken, and their special Grandma's Noodles are all my favorites!
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,11/9/2014,4,5,2,3,3>Our absolute favorite pizza in Fargo-Moorhead. Consistently delicious! We moved away for a few years and were happy to return and find our favorite pizza place still doing well.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,11/8/2014,0,9,2,2,2>This is my wife's favorite place in Fargo. I really enjoy it as well. We've been here a handful of times now and I've never been disappointed. The service is always great and the servers are very friendly and will recommend dishes. The dishes I've had that I can remember are Rogan Josh, Tikka Misala, Karara. The Karara and Tikka Misala are my favorite. The Karara has a coconut taste to it which is amazing. Chicken is good, but I've been getting all my dishes with lamb recently. The Rogan Josh was good, but it was definitely a very different taste. The garlic Naan is absolutely delicious. Their mango drink is really good and so is the rice pudding desert, I can't remember the name of those two. The price for this place is decent too. $13 for a dish with lamb is very reasonable, and you get as much rice as you want.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2014,11/7/2014,2,32,2,3,1>Such a cute little cupcake shop. Great location. Went there for the 1st time with my 21 yr old daughter and we love it. First thing you notice is the decor,cute and simple, second is the welcoming customer service. They were so friendly and inviting and took the time to talk about the different kind of cupcakes they offer and third were the cupcakes themselves. They weren't too sweet so there was no fighting between the cake and the frosting. A very nice balance. We recommend it.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2014,11/6/2014,2,9,2,2,2>Really enjoy the Boiler Room for business lunches.  I have brought a few clients over and have always had a great experience.  Great atmosphere and unique food choices make for a fantastic overall presentation.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2014,11/5/2014,35,3,1,2,1>To start off this review I am a business owner in the service industry and I hold my business to a VERY high standard... however, this is not about me.The reason I prefaced my review with this is because too often service repair companies will take advantage of a situation and due to this reality I am VERY leary of other service companies particularly in the automotive repair industry.My vehicle had been acting wonky and I hesitated to bring it in.  After some recommendations to Matt's Automotive Service Center I decided to give it a try.I brought my vehicle in and they got me in right away.  As they went deeper into the repair they found that one of the computers needed to be replaced.  They told me it would take a week to get the part in.  This was a problem for me because I run a business and the care that was in for repair was my business vehicle.  So what to do?  Matt arranged for transportation for me and made sure I could continue to operate without interruption.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2014,11/4/2014,8,28,1,6,3>The Shack is a family-friendly, diner-style restaurant in north Fargo.  It serves a mishmash of classic American breakfasts, featuring eggs, potatoes, and your choice of common morning carbohydrates (toast, waffles, pancakes).  The lunch and dinner meals focus more on sandwiches or quick, filling meals and the expected sides.  You can order and enjoy your meal at the diner bar where you can watch the cooks and waitresses assemble the meals for patrons, or there are small tables, geared for single family dining experiences (or fewer).  This style of restaurant is probably one of the most common, and there is nothing unexpected here.  So why does the Shack stand out?  Based on my experiences, they do everything the way that its SUPPOSED to be done, and they don't just do it better than everyone else, they do it right.  They don't hide behind gimmicks, and were clearly letting their classic takes on breakfast foods represent themselves.  The eggs were made-to-order and were cooked excellently--not overdone, not underdone.  The meats were nothing special, but they were made the way that they should have been made, and consistently.  The pancakes were amazing, and from now on will be either my go-to breakfast when I'm visiting or a staple side order.  Across the table, the potatoes were cooked exactly like you would expect before diners were commonly commercialized.  Across the table of friends that I hosted, there were full and contented bellies.  Honestly, the Shack is a throwback to an era of family dining when you knew what you expected, but it was the job of the restaurant to do even better.  In this regard, the Shack delivers amply.I went on a Sunday, and you can expect a wait as the churchgoers are certainly frequent customers.  Being a family restaurant, the age distribution of guests ranged from just born to the elderly with every single age group represented between so it might not be the best place to show up really hungover.  Seating was limited, but my friends and I waited no longer than 20 minutes before we were seated.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2014,11/3/2014,1,10,1,3,3>What a find! Saw a short blurb in a travel magazine and tucked it away in the off chance we'd be wandering thru Fargo hungry. Well today's that day and were we pleasantly surprised at the selections and the friendly prices. Do stop by when you can and be prepared for a bakery that will blow you away and sandwiches & soups to fill you up and make you smile just like we did.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2014,11/2/2014,0,1,1,4,4>That was fantastic! Service was soooo quick an hour for a screen replacement is fantastic! And they were so friendly!
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2014,11/1/2014,58,23,1,3,2>Sweeto burrito does burritos different than other places. If you want your traditional Mexican fare there are places for that. However this place is for the unconventional burrito lover. Most of their burritos have a sauce which you wouldn't find in other burritos. There go-to is their sweeto sauce. Not sure what's in it, and I don't care. I will eat it till the day I die.The chicken burritos very tasty, the Carne Asada is very good, but if you're looking for something different try the cheeseburger burrito. If has french fries and is similar to a California burrito only this one has some pickles beef cheese and other things you find in a burger. It may not be for everyone, but you have to hand it to them for trying something new. Recently I went here with a family member and she got the Thai burrito as a bowl. It was very spicy and seemed to have a lot of flavor. Definitely had some kick to it.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2014,10/31/2014,14,30,1,3,2>Nothing beats the dream loungers! Putting your feet up and watching a movie is fantastic. Really it's the best of two worlds, the comfort of home and the picture and audio quality of a theater. All of the theaters have dream loungers, which is awesome! And just as an FYI the chairs are paired. Meaning that the arm rest  that is within the pair goes up, but the one on the side does not. Something to keep in mind when having date night ;) Also when getting refreshments I recommend checking out the combo deals as they are slightly discounted and keep in mind that if you have a Marcus Magic Reward card you get a free refill with the purchase of a large popcorn and drink. Also the Marcus theater app is pretty useful and convenient given that they can scan your phone for the magic rewards.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/28/2014,10/30/2014,11,10,1,4,2>I usually go to Grazies several times a year. The food is always good and consistent. You usually don't have to wait to long to get a table which is a positive for me as I am not big on hanging out in a lobby for an hour. I'd recommend pasta or pizza. They have private rooms available for larger groups and don't charge any extra to use these rooms. I'd recommend you give them a try if you want to try a local restaurant instead of another franchise establishment.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/4/2014,10/29/2014,2,4,1,2,1>Very attentive and friendly wait staff.   We tried the fish, flat bread pizza and chicken pot pie ~ all were tasty and served quickly.  My daughter has never met a vegetable that she liked but she was actually stealing peas off my plate as they were so good.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/1/2014,10/28/2014,1,3,1,3,2>I have made taking care of myself a priority with the superb support that I have received from the staff and fellow clients at Elements.  I'm truly spoiled with the CLEAN, spa-like atmosphere. Elements offers a nice variety of classes and special opportunities that challenge me to step out of my comfort zone, such as  personal training, boot camp sessions, yoga, and running club.  I have nothing but good things to say about my experiences at Elements.

They have a rewards program as well, buy 9 get 1.  They have 5 high top tables and plenty of parking. So excited to have a juice bar in Fargo!
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/20/2014,10/25/2014,3,44,1,3,2>As good as it gets! I saw Grayce and she is truly amazing! I had an awful waxing experience at another waxing spot in Fargo and this place put all worries at ease and did a wonderful job. No more trying to fit a wax in when in Minneapolis, Grayce at waxing the city is my new go to.

<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/10/2014,10/23/2014,33,9,1,3,3>Fun environment! Great and unique option to check out in the downtown area. Don't have food yet but plan on adding that. Good beer... reasonable pricing. Fun to be here on opening night ( the drekker mom team is adorable!!) Hope to see this thrive and grow! Flights are a great deal & liberal pouring (equals 2 pints).
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2014,10/22/2014,12,2,,1,1>Was at D'Vine and asked for a cab to my hotel.  The cab showed up about 10 minutes later and a lady drove us to our hotel a much more direct route than when we went downtown.  Awesome service!
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2014,10/21/2014,2,15,,,>My favorite sub shop of all time.  They offer different combos than the typical boring sub shops and their ingredients are top notch.  They also deliver!  I've never had a meal from them that hasn't been great.
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/1/2014,10/20/2014,55,39,1,6,1>D'Vine is beautifully decorated with a lot of nice woodwork, reasonably priced, and provides an intimate atmosphere that would be perfect for a classy date, anniversary dinner, or a fancier night with a small group of friends. I came on a Monday evening in a group of 5, and the place was surprisingly busy (but not crowded) for a weekday night. Our server was very friendly and patient when we took a while to order, and she provided some great recommendations when we asked for a red wine that wasn't too dry. In addition to the menu of wines and champagnes that ranged in price from around $30 to $199 per bottle (you could also order by the glass and there's some options for beer, sake cocktails, ports, and sodas) there was a unique and nice assortment of cheeses and meats to select from (in addition to a few other small plate options, such as salads, hummus, and panzanella). I'm hoping that in the future, their small plate menu will expand more to include other items as well, but since D'Vine is fairly new, it's understandable why this menu was a bit smaller. Our group tried the Mobay, which I would highly recommend, and the Humboldt Fog, which we weren't really a fan of due to the exterior of the cheese that tasted somewhat like a crayon (weird, but true). We had also wanted to order the Delice De Bourgogne Triple Cream Brie, but unfortunately they were out of this one. Overall, I'd highly recommend checking this place out! It reminded me of some of my favorite wine bars in Chicago, and it's a very welcome and classy addition to downtown Fargo.
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/15/2014,10/19/2014,9,17,3,2,1>In Fargo for business, I came to Scratch on the recommendation of a vendor.The interior is cafe trendy and the large print words wallpaper is a little much for me, thank god there wasn't portraits of veggies or meat.  However when you walk in, the aroma from the food totally diverts you to the counter to check out the goods.  Down to business.I had the Italian stallion on a Black Forest rye, delicious.  Bread was pillow soft, meat tastes fresh, and a very hardy portion.  The Vegetable beef soup broth was perfectly savory.  Only trouble are the larger than bite size chunks of potato and only two wee pieces of beef.  That said, I wasn't disappointed.  It definitely had a hand crafted flavor and was welcome on a windy cool day.Now the rhubarb pie.  Don't mess around.  Get it.  I ended up eating it before my lunch, when I intended to only taste it.  I was actually a little miffed I shared it with my peer.  Overall, a clean shop, with friendly service, great aromas and unpretentious, honest food.  Perfect lunch spot.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2014,10/18/2014,1,6,,1,2>This place is wonderful for a casual lunch or a romantic night out. The staff is very friendly. It does take a bit to get your food but it is so well worth the wait! The Greek salad is delectable, the lasagna is flavorful and the chicken parmesean is dare I say life-changing.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/28/2012,10/17/2014,0,25,,1,2>Great place for kids and large groups with potentially picky people. They have a lot of variety to offer which is excellent because while the pizza is good it isn't the best. The soft-serve and dessert pizza make all the kids super happy. The salad bar, chicken and other variety of foods are really good too.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2014,10/16/2014,34,46,1,2,2>Like the other locations, the service, burgers and of course beer are on point. This location seems to be the largest.. Burger patty perfect size with a nice fluffy bun. Had the Fox Barrel pear cider which tastes like a sweet wine. I kept drinking that rather than my coca cola:) will be back !
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2014,10/15/2014,11,10,1,1,1>Great food, good atmosphere AND they carry Fargo Brewing Company's StonesThrow.

<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2014,10/13/2014,0,3,1,2,1>Stopped by for lunch today at the Blarney Stone Pub. Opted to sit outback. Great ambience with the open garage doors plus I love their ceiling fans setup where there is just one motor that spins 3 fans via some type of thin rope. Great idea!. I had the Smoked Sicilian and my wife had the crab cake appetizer, both where delicious!!. Would definitely go back and recommend others to stop by as well.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2014,10/12/2014,23,2,1,1,1>Great coffee, superb toast (yes, they serve toast!) and very friendly service.

<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/29/2012,10/10/2014,3,19,1,2,1>I stopped at Unglued twice while I was in Fargo, and I loved it. Loads of unique items made by local and regional artists. They have everything: clothes, prints, jewelry, books, cards, and so much more. Like the previous reviewer mentioned, they also do workshops, which is pretty awesome. The owners are super friendly and helpful, and they are truly passionate about local indie art. Downtown Fargo is pretty cool, and this place is absolutely worth a stop.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2014,10/9/2014,3,35,2,1,1>This is my favorite restaurant for a great steak in Fargo. The steaks are great and the fresh bread is a bonus. I would recommend call ahead seating. It is busy but there is a reason. If you feel like dancing, get up and line dance with the gals. If it is someone's birthday everyone in the restaurant will know about it.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2014,10/8/2014,5,34,1,1,1>Had a great experience here. We found some carpet on sale that was a great brand and the customer service was very nice.We'd just moved into our new home and was hoping to get the carpet installed the same week, but knew it'd be a stretch.  Luckily it only took a couple weeks to get it in and the install went great.  They had two people come out over a period of two days (first day to tear up the carpet/padding lay tack strip, second day to install).  The job they did was fantastic and we absolutely love our new carpet.I'm writing this review two months after the install and it still looks like new.  Great job, reputable company.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2014,10/7/2014,2,2,1,2,1>My very first time at Sammy's.  Friendliest crew of any restaurant I've experienced in a very long time.  I had a 12" Canadian Bacon and Mushroom pie, yes I'm not very  imaginative, but I do have a lot of experience with that flavor.  The thin, hand-tossed crust was even, crunchy and baked to perfection--not a single burn spot or bubble anywhere.  The toppings were sweet and plentiful with a thin coating of mozzarella holding the sauce to the crust without any dried out patches.  The pie was scorching hot when it came out of the oven so I did have a little problem with mouth burn but that was a small price to pay for near-pizza nirvana.  The reason for a less than perfect score is the untintended floor show with a couple of intoxicated customers (not Sammy's fault) who distracted from the attraction.
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/29/2014,10/6/2014,0,4,1,1,1>Great place to eat!  Good atmosphere and the place to be as it is packed!  I had a cheese curd burger and it was one of the best burgers ive ever had!  Our bartender rhino was great as well. I highly recommend Lucky's to anyone that is in Fargo!
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2014,10/5/2014,0,19,3,1,1>This place is excellent. Hands down the best burrito in town. I always order the large burrito and get it smothered (queso sauce and green chile sauce with sour cream on top). The burrito is larger than my head and the combo comes with a fountain drink and unlimited chips and salsa for $11. You had better be hungry and/or don't plan on eating again for 12 to 18 hours.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/26/2014,10/4/2014,0,2,1,2,1>Great beer, great people, great place. Definitely the best place to be in Moorhead. When I said I liked IPAs and APAs they gave my wife and I 4 different samples; all great. Mostly mild to hoppy beers but they have an Imperial Stout as well.
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/28/2014,10/3/2014,5,15,1,3,1>First visit and the coffee was great.  Nice to get a specialty coffee in a real cup.  Also nice to get a cup to pick a regular coffee flavor.  Had a berry smoothie which was great and flavorful.  Our group shared lunch sandwiches and shared a protein oatmeal snack.  Great food and service.  Will be back.  Talked about the décor and was an interesting place to meet.  Nice booths have power strips for laptops but there are only a couple booths.
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2014,10/2/2014,0,4,1,1,1>As everyone else says, you can't go wrong with the pizza here. We split a pie with bacon, jalapeño, and Parmesan - delicious.For an appetizer, we split the bison meatballs, definitely something you can only get done this well out here on the plains, and wonderfully executed!
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2014,10/1/2014,1,5,1,1,1>I just moved here from Montana, I am super impressed with the service, the friendliness of the staff. I will keep using them.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2014,9/30/2014,25,14,6,4,4>Some friends and I had dinner here recently and were very satisfied. We were seated very promptly by an older gentleman who was very welcoming. For drinks I ordered a thai iced tea which was very tasty; perhaps it was because it had sugar and half and half in it but sometimes you need to indulge. As for dinner, I ordered the chicken kee mao which was noted as "very spicy" - I really enjoy spice. When the dish arrived it was seasoned very well but I was underwhelmed by the level of heat, next time I'll ask them to amp it up. The one strange thing worth noting was the incredibly confusing dinner playlist that was accompanied by an oscillating disco ball. Some of my favorites included: "YMCA," "The Hokey-Pokey," and a live version of "New York, New York."
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2014,9/29/2014,0,3,2,1,1>Best burgers in Dilworth.I love this place, from the way they serve the burgers in waxed paper to the plastic trays filled with hot fresh fries or onion rings.The locals come I. as they are and its fun to see families having a sitdown meal.  Usually have the burger basket/fries or rings.Limited beer selection but its cold and fresh.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/20/2014,9/28/2014,3,27,1,1,1>Had a big group of people and they had no problem accommodating us.  We had 8 different dishes and all were excellent.  Great presentation, quick service, and will go back for sure.

<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/20/2014,9/26/2014,66,428,1,2,2>The consensus is that we would eat here again. I like all of the little details. The rose on the straw wrapper, the fancy edging on the vegetables, etc. We had Pad Cashew with TofuBBQ pork fried riceSatay ChickenCashew had lots of fresh veggies and good flavor. I asked for it to be extra spicey and I would describe it as mediumBBQ pork fried rice had a good pan fried flavor. The kid said the Satay chicken was perfectly spiced and the peanut sauce- which was too sweet for my taste- was good but not the best.
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2014,9/25/2014,8,10,,2,2>I had bought my first car from Corwin Toyota this Janurary and I have to say the service was exceptional. I have never in my life thought I would be treated with such respect, honesty and like I was part of the family. Joseph B. did a wonderful job explaining the features of the car, and made me feel confident this purchase was appropriate for my situation. I will be purchasing all future cars from Corwin!
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,9/24/2014,46,30,1,3,1>This place is pretty sweet.  I know it's a beer hall, but you can honestly come for the food and stay for the beer.  The menu is filled with  various types of sausages, both traditional and a little exotic.  I've had the steak and cheese sausage and the jalapeño cheddar and both were really good.  A German coworker of mine always orders the curry wurst and says it's pretty spot on.  Also, much like the other reviewers, I have to say that the pretzels blew away my expectations, warm and soft, not too salty and the dipping sauces or simply the assorted mustards already at your table make great compliments.  I could go into the beer selection, but it honestly has never let me down.  There is always something new and the staff is very knowledgeable and willing to talk you through your decision process.  Overall, this place is exactly as advertised, a German Beer Hall, but with outstanding food.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2014,9/23/2014,5,14,2,5,3>I downloaded the Z!ng app today and made our first order of their family style take and bake style fare. We are a time starved family working full time and running a business, and we are sick of eating out and we miss home cooking. We ordered the wild rice casserole for 4 people and it was more than enough for our family of 5 (3 small children). It was beyond wonderful to have a healthy not greasy, salty or processed food that my husband thought that I 'made'... I might of not created the delicious meal but I can say that I cooked it and that only took about 15 min, which is less than a take and bake pizza and healthier.  I did confess that I bought the casserole at z!ng. My tips to the owner would be to post the phone # online and app and make a notes section in the app so you can specify pick up time. Grocery stores should supply these meals as their is a great need for food like this for busy families or for day off from cooking! Can't wait to try it again! Cost was only $ 26, which is less than we've spent on take n bake pizza and much healthier.
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/19/2014,9/22/2014,0,3,1,1,>Very good food and service.  We had the biscuits & gravy (large potion!) and dinner special (Hawaiian chicken).  Both meals reasonably priced.  For dessert I had the bread pudding.  This a must have!  Will be back!

<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/10/2014,9/18/2014,2,4,,1,2>Our favorite place to go! This restaurant has awesome drink specials every night and the food is delicious, far better than Mexican village or any other chain Mexican food joint in the area. A+!
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2014,9/17/2014,0,14,,1,2>Modest building and decor, excellent offerings! Our party had the Knoepfla, the ham, pear, and brie sandwich, and the Cuban, and also shared a caramel roll.The Knoepfla was a hearty, flavorful version of this traditional German stew.the Cuban was presented perfectly- hot inside with bread that was toasted crisp and buttery on the outside. The ham/pear/brie sandwich featured freshly sliced, perfectly ripe pear and a brie with authentic flavor. The caramel roll was declared delicious by all who tried it. Fresh, warm, soft, and sticky but not gummy, these are a must to try! Unfussy setting, unfussy service, unfussy pricing, with some surprising menu offerings and some really good food.

I scarfed my burger down and the fries I had with with cheese and bacon on top was excellent, as well!! It was busy and my food took awhile, but worth the wait!!
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,9/12/2014,24,7,,1,2>Doolittles has some tasty chicken! I really like the juicy flavor in the rotisserie chicken and also their other meats. They serve good portions of vegetables as well. I think the decor and lighting bring a subtle and casual experience. Servers are most always prompt. Price is medium range of about $12 - $30 per person. Try it if you have not been yet. You should not be disappointed.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2014,9/11/2014,3,16,,,1>Kobe's is great choice for fun and great tasting Japanese cuisine. The Teppanyaki experience is very entertaining and I always leave completely stuffed full.  It is not just a great meal, but you are entertained while your meal is made.  It is like Chucky Cheeses for adults, but you won't end up with influenza after the visit!  To my amazement, there are always family's with young children there loving the food (my nieces and nephews can't and won't do anything but pizza and chicken nuggets). I enjoy the sushi at Kobe's as well.  I am not a big fish fan, but the spicy tuna roll is one of my favorites!  I really want to try some of their signature rolls because they look awesome!

<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,9/9/2014,0,5,,1,2>I heard a lot about Rhombus Guys from friends in Grand Forks and I had been looking forward to trying it on a trip to Fargo. I immediately liked the relaxed, friendly atmosphere. The staff was incredibly hospitable and knowledgable. We stopped in during the dinner rush, and to be expected, there were some hiccups but the staff handled them well. I overheard the server tell the table next to us their pizza was dropped in the kitchen and needed to be remade. A manager quickly came over and told them their pizza was on him and apologized. The same manager came by our table to check on us. After noticing my pizza wasn't cut complete through, he brought a knife to me and said he'd make sure the kitchen staff got a little heavy-handed with the pizza cutter. I didn't even need to say anything about it.They have a wide variety of tap beers all listed in a binder for easy selection. I ordered the "Louisiana Saturday Night" pizza and the toppings were outstanding. However, I went with thin crust and based off the other pizzas coming out of the kitchen, I should have ordered hand-tossed. The thin crust was very crispy and didn't add anything to an otherwise solid pizza. The pizza is a little spendy, $17-19 for a small, but that's to be expected with specialty pizzas. I would like I go back and try one of the many other pizzas that caught my eye, but I will definitely order hand-tossed.
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2014,9/8/2014,15,23,,2,2>This is pretty much my one-stop-shop for all things meaty.While they don't have some of the more colorful things that I was used to getting in California at carniceria's, the selection that they have is outstanding.  All the meats are fresh, well-chilled, and they also offer a variety of different marinaded meats to pick up.In addition to all this, they've got a great selection of fish, brats, sausages, chips, and cheeses.I usually come in here before a game night on Saturday and will pick up 10-15lbs of skirt steak, which they always trim down for me, to make carne asada.The staff is friendly and the prices are very reasonable!
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/29/2014,9/7/2014,0,21,,1,2>Best breakfast in Town. I really enjoy this place when I visit Fargo 2 to 3 times a week I eat breakfast here. I just can't find a better place for breakfast.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2014,9/6/2014,0,45,1,4,>Never knew this place existed, although we've been shopping at the Asian market right next door to the Jade Dragon for almost 5 years. The owners were really friendly and nice and since it was our first time here, we received a complimentary plate of Vietnamese spring rolls - which was excellent! We had the Chow Mein and the Jade Dragon special. Food was tasty, flavorful, and had generous portions. If we happen to be in Fargo we will certainly stop in again.

<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2014,9/4/2014,20,29,,2,2>This is a great place to go and just hang out with friends in a casual environment. The beer is great, I especially love the Sodbuster their porter, even on a hot sunny day its what I crave. If you like something lighter their Stone's Throw and Iron Horse are always a great bet.Another great note, you can order food and have it delivered there or bring in your own food. Jimmy johns is close and quick!Only complaint is the lack of AC, it gets really warm in the summer and they supply industrial size fans to help cool the place off but with this comes a lot of noise making it hard to talk over.

I ordered the Chicken Ranch Junction, and it was as good as it looked. The sandwich came out oozing with a piping hot melted miracle of cheese and ranch. Really delicious stuff. I enjoyed my sandwich more than the others in my party, so chicken ranch might be the way to go here. This was a fabulous, heavy sandwich. I ordered the large and it really was huge.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,8/30/2014,21,3,,1,2>The best books music and home goods. Everything about the store is incredible. The unique decor items and book selection is really awe inspiring. If they don't have something in stock they will order it for you. My niece loves the toy section, just like everything else about Zandbroz it is like nothing else in Fargo
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2014,8/29/2014,118,199,1,,>Incredibly cool local hangout spot with cheap cheap drinks and incredible bartenders.  The crowd was mixed and the environment felt welcoming for an out-of-towner. The bar was nice and long;  Free peanuts and popcorn were offered while music bingo was being played .  This place is a winner all-around.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/3/2013,8/28/2014,56,128,,5,4>It's a barn full of booze, what's not to love!?When I'm in Fargo, this is where I go to pick up liquor. Happy Harry's has a great liquor selection overall, including beer, wine and the hard stuff - I often find newer releases here before most anywhere else. Keep an eye on the sales for some killer deals on higher end boozes like Patron and the Penny Wine sale is not to be missed if you're a wino or know someone who is.Plus you get a free bag of ice with purchase, rock.

You will not be disappointed with this menu, their smoothies are boosted with energy, nutrients, and flavor! I would recommend asking for your smoothie without the sweetener, this will cut about 130 calories off of your smoothie!

<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2014,8/24/2014,14,30,2,4,2>Stayed here for a week and it was a great experience! The hotel was clean, the room was spotless, and the kitchen (in the room) was just right. The weekday dinner socials ( I believe Tuesday-Thursday) are extremely helpful and easy as we did not have to worry about making dinner or going to a restaurant those nights. Also there is a nice variety of breakfast options, which made our stay even easier since we never had to worry about cooking or buying breakfast. Overall it was great and would return or recommend to anyone staying in Fargo.

Between the large size and the great taste it is well worth $3 dollars. It is often located on Broadway outside of Atomic Coffee, it is a very nice Summer treat.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,8/22/2014,3,17,1,1,>Hjemkomst (Home-Coming) Center is a must visit Place. The Scandinavian Heritage is very important to people who live in Minnesota.  The Hjemkomst Center preserves this heritage through Robert Asp's dream and entertaining story.  The video presentation in the Museum's Theater presentation is a must see that captures the drama of the construction and sailing adventure from Duluth, MN to Norway.  I remember following the Hjemkomst Journey when I was in High School and had visited the ship several times before it had set sail in the 1980's.

<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,8/20/2014,11,11,1,2,2>What an incredible meal! Our team of three (software consultants who travel the US during projects) ate here based on reviews in the Fargo magazine and reviews on Yelp. I started with the trio of soups. Every restaurant in the world should do this! Moderate small bowls with an ample taste of the lobster bisque, mushroom, and butternut squash soup.  I loved them all but the butternut squash was THE best. My other two colleagues had the bisque and they were both pleased.We then got a nice sorbet to cleanse the pallet (which was both wonderful and very unexpected.Our meals were all extraordinary! I had the swordfish on a nice orzo base with great green beans and the sauces added a very nice flavor.Another colleague had the scallops and she said they were some of the best EVER.  Our other colleague had the walleye with the sauce to the side for nice dipping. He was also very pleased.We did not regret not having dessert, but the three of us talked about how tempting it was. Good news is we will be back. Our waiter was very attentive, and exceptionally helpful with explaining some questions as we ordered. The restaurant is small and quaint and really capped off a great week for our team.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2014,8/19/2014,0,23,1,,>Great beer selections. Burgers are good. Hot dish burger so far is the best but the eggstrordinary is a close second. Chips and onion rings are good. We will be back.  Get the tune up punch card-buy nine sandwiches or burgers and get the tenth free.  Kids loved the homemade chicken strips.

<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/12/2014,8/17/2014,33,9,1,3,3>The staff is really friendly and very helpful if you have never been! You can try the flavors if you want do you don't have to worry about getting something you don't like. A little spendy for an every day thing but a fun and refreshing treat for something a little different. They have a nice sized space so it could be a nice quiet place to meet up for a afternoon meeting. The wraps ate decent.. nothing too exciting. Really do love the juice though!

Even if you're not looking for a luxury Swiss watch, this is still the only place you're going to find any mechanical watches in this town. Every other store that carries watches here is strictly limited to quartz "fashion" pieces. If you're a watch guy, this is the only local place to get the real deal.

<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2014,8/13/2014,4,5,2,1,3>Took my three little kids here for my daughter's birthday. Because it was a Tuesday, each kid got a pizza for less than two bucks (try the mac and cheese pizza - big hit with our family). Dad and I ordered beers which came totally flat. I took them back to the bar and the bartender was super friendly, said he would fix it and bring new ones out to us. He did and they were great. Food was good and not unreasonable. But what really caught me off guard was the amazing attitude of the servers. They were all completely calm amidst the chaos, really engaging with my kids, treating dad and I like guests, always with smiles and helpful suggestions. At one point we had seven forks on the floor and the server came with a new one without us even asking again - smiling! This is now our go-to birthday spot.

The atmosphere was what you would expect in store front restruant in ND. The food was the star! Great food, even better prices and friendly people that make it worth the drive from Bismarck.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2014,8/9/2014,55,39,,4,1>I'm a big fan of this place. You can get individual slices of pizza at $2-3 each and it always tastes great (both sober and drunk versions of me can attest to this), the staff is very friendly, and it's an easy and convenient way to get a quick bite to eat when you're hanging out downtown during the daytime or going out to the bars with your friends. I highly recommend getting cream cheese as an extra topping if you're looking to add some delicious creamy fattiness to your meal. Only thing that has bummed me out in the past is that it closes at 1:30 am, and so if you're in the mood for some late night munchies after a night of drinking, you'll need to leave the bars early. However, make the right decision folks...happily chomping down on some Spicy Pie easily trumps dancing at the OB.

<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2013,8/6/2014,112,215,3,2,2>I really like this coffee shop.  It's a nice break from the norm and it has a real small town feel and very friendly people working and hanging out.  There's a nice little seating arrangement outside on 4th and the inside has a nice area that feels like a living room with a fireplace.  Always great sandwiches at lunch and plenty of pastries for breakfast.  Parking can be a little tricky if you can't land a spot on 4th but usually never a problem.  Great coffee shop in Moorhead.

The owner was the most friendliest person I've ever met. If you're looking for great Thai, this is the place. I wish they delivered to Chicago. Enjoy!!
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/29/2014,8/3/2014,135,386,1,1,1>I needed a quick lunch so I drove through the drive-thru and ordered a bacon cheeseburger combo with fries and a Mountain Dew for my pop. It won't be the best burger you've ever had, but it beats eating at a chain like McDonald's or Burger King. The price is also very affordable. They're pretty quick here at this location in getting your order out.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/16/2013,8/2/2014,17,179,1,2,1>Went for dinner and it was delicious! And the service was excellent! The Cesar salad dressing was yummy! There was too much on the salad for my liking but I should have asked for less dressing. The oil that comes with the bread is AMAZING! I had a special with asparagus, mushrooms, tomatoes and seafood. The dish came in a puff pastry. It was outstanding! I probably should have gotten rice to soak up the amazing sauce. Next time I will!

What I really appreciate is the fact that their employees are very knowledgeable when it comes to the different varieties of beans and roasts. Thanks Dunn

My "first time" I consumed so happily the Humpty Dumpty! So delicious it can't explained.. by me! I've also enjoyed the Rajun Cajun- tender, spicy without being overbearing! The chips were fresh, hot, crispy and tasty too!  I simply wish there was a franchise in Upstate NY! Yummy!

The food was great,we started off with a round of some chips and walleye fingers then all 5 of us ordered. Mine was the lobster ravioli with shrimp, will I have this again ...... Yes! Everyone's plate was was spot clean at the end of dinner, I had to soak up the sauce from my meal with a piece of bread. Good food great atmosphere. Don't eat at chains!

You'll never leave hungry! Always generous amounts of meat and cheese. Deluxe nachos are awesome. Make sure to get the jalapenos.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2014,7/26/2014,2,15,1,1,1>Comic Junction is one if my favorite book stores.  They have a huge section of used sci-fi books for dirt cheap.  They also have books and magazines and collectibles for little kids as well as a kabillion comic books and magazines.  They've been at South Plaza since 1994 and before that they were in another place forever.  They also have old school D&D stuff.
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/28/2014,7/24/2014,7,175,1,2,>For a non-Fargoan it was a bit tricky to find...we were walking down Broadway looking for the address and ended up having to ask another person if they'd heard of the place. The entrance is "around the back" via the alley. There's a sign with an arrow but you would walk right past it if you didn't know where you were going. The entrance itself is nondescript (see pic). Hopefully a more permanent sign is coming.We were greeted by the guy behind the bar immediately upon entering. Very friendly and good, attentive service was the rule throughout. Mike (who I took to be the owner or manager) stopped by a couple times and was gracious and attentive. Very intimate ambiance to enjoy good wine and good company. The wine selection is very ample for Fargo. It leans California-heavy and prices are very reasonable. Wondering how it will evolve or if they will eventually offer a reserve list. Very good selection of cheeses and also offers other small plates (olives, charcuterie, etc.) A very nice concept that is very well executed...we'll be back!
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,7/23/2014,4,8,,2,1>Very deliscious! We had the Heart attack appetizer and the Broken Heart roll. Service and food were both great. Will definately go back.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,7/22/2014,34,46,1,1,1>Our waitress and the other staff were all very nice and attentive. She brought us samples of beer to try (upon request). Everyone in my group of 5 was happy with their meal and probably over ate due to very nicely sized portions. I enjoyed the cajun pasta which was just a bit spicy but had a great balance between the creamy sauce and fresh veggies. My favorite beer i tried was the belgium but i also enjoyed The Duke. My group noticed they had bags/cornhole so we took advantage of the nice weather by playing a few games and drinking our beer outside. It is conveniently close to the movie theatre so we simply walked over after our movie was over. They also offer a mug club rewards card that is basically $5 and good for a lifetime of discounts!
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2013,7/21/2014,0,3,4,,>We love Eddie and Barkus. We take our spoiled dog there for grooming. By far the best in th F-M area. Little spendy but worth it.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/15/2012,7/20/2014,3,3,,4,1>About as good as it gets for fine dining in the Fargo Morehead area. Great wine selection, very unique menu and incredible service. Not the cheapest place in town, but the experience is worth it. My family has been going here for years, and we will certainly continue.

<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2014,7/17/2014,46,30,,3,1>I frequent this place for Lunch downtown.   Always packed, which is a good sign.  I have tried the Southwest Mo, which is fantastic.  My current go-to is the David The Greek Salad... Great portion and doesn't need much dressing as they vegetables are very fresh and the variety is good enough to give it good flavor.  It's a little spendy, but considering it is in a pretty high rent location, I'm willing to pay a little more for convenience.  Great spot!
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2014,7/16/2014,0,9,,1,>Love this restaurant and classic Irish pub!  The food is just delicious.  I have had about 4 different items off the menu and each was served to piping hot perfection.  The wait staff is personable and attentive.  The wooden walls and tables are gorgeous and it is very spacious with a patio and upstairs.
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,7/15/2014,0,1,2,2,1>Speedy service, great drink selections and food options (grass shirt, ceasar, steak bites are what I enjoyed). The pleasant atmosphere has multiple televisions for viewing and an outdoor patio area for sunny days.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/9/2014,7/14/2014,5,14,,4,3>My husband, myself and our two small kids dined here on the 4th of July for dinner. The atmosphere is amazing! Super cool! I ordered a cup of Beer cheese soup and it was amazing and the Parmesan walleye which was hands down the best walleye I have had in many years. My kids shared the Mac and cheese and it was so so good and more geared towards adults so in the future i would ask them to make without peppers and meat for the kids. Bring a sippy cup if you have small kids as they didn't have glasses with lids. The service was very good. Love all the parking off the alley! What a great addition to downtown Fargo!
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/6/2014,7/13/2014,0,2,,2,1>Not your traditional burrito's.  These were a welcomed change for me in comparison to Qdoba or that type if place.  First off the flavor combinations range from American to Tex- Mex to Thai  If you're in the mood for breakfast, they have that too.  Next, you get to choose "Light weight" or "Heavy weight".  Light weight is a slightly smaller version of the burrito compared to the larger Heavy weight burrito, which is more comparable to the Qdoba standard burrito. I appreciated this choice, as a Heavy Weight for lunch is entirely too much food for me.Finally, you choose to have a combo or just the burrito.  The Combo consists of fries, onion rings or chips & salsa (maybe tots, too?) & a drink.The also have Tacos & Bowlers.  The Tacos are huge! You definitely get your money's worth with this taco!I chose to try the Thai Fighter & Onion Rings.  The Thai Peanut sauce had a great flavor, the chicken was tender.  It was really good. The onion rings blew me away.  They were crispy and cooked to perfection! I will most certainly make these a staple as I continue to explore the menu!My husband got the Smokehouse & Chips and Salsa. He really liked it, however, he commented that it was more along the lines of a wrap and not much like a burrito.  He got the heavyweight and stated it was almost too much food for lunch.  The Salsa was good, just the right amount of spicy without being too hot.  The chips were good, but could almost use something to make them more unique, like a lime salt or something.All in all, we will definitely be revisiting to explore this menu more.  Maybe for breakfast?  I keep seeing something about a burrito with Country Gravy?? :) YUM!If you're looking for traditional taco's and burrito's you'll fund them here, but you'll probably end up ordering something completely different then what you walked in the door craving.  Great food, great atmosphere!
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,7/12/2014,0,7,1,5,2>Amazing place! TNT has a great hometown diner atmosphere, amazing breakfast food, great daily specials, and some of the best pie in town.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2014,7/11/2014,0,2,,5,1>The beers, the atmosphere, and one can not forget about the amazing food. You need to get the Bavarian pretzel with beer cheese as a start ps try with marshmallow dip for a sweet treat. You have not lived until then.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,7/10/2014,0,10,,4,>Red Raven perfectly captures the essence of an unassuming and comfortable coffee house with the bonus of excellent coffee and stellar service. The space is relaxed and practically invites you to settle in and stay for a while. With what I consider to be the best coffee in town, it's tempting to sit and happily sip for hours on end.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2014,7/9/2014,1,52,,2,>I avoided this place for awhile because, really? How good can pasta be that is served out of an old Taco Bell? There are a lot of Italian restaurants in the FM area, and most are mediocre at best. I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I went there on a Sunday evening with a few girlfriends and there were just a few other groups there. The décor was much better than I expected- nice & cozy, if not a teensy bit cheesy. We each had a different wine flight before choosing a glass...or 2. The waitress had little knowledge of the wines, but no biggie, we are pretty familiar with what wines we each like. The wine selection is small, but decent enough and reasonably priced. $7 for a flight of 3 and I believe $6-7 per glass. The food was what really impressed me with this place. The garden salad was fresh and tasty, but pretty standard. I ordered the mushroom ravioli in gorgonzola cream sauce with chicken. I don't know if they make their own ravioli or not, but it tasted like it. The mushrooms tasted fresh, not mushy or over-processed. The cream sauce was exceptionally decadent, and the chicken was perfectly cooked. It was a little odd being offered a choice between vanilla, chocolate, or twist soft serve ice cream at the end of the meal, but it was a nice treat. I will definitely come back. the mushroom ravioli was so delicious, though, that I might have a hard time trying something else off the menu.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2014,7/8/2014,5,15,,2,1>Enjoyed dinner with friends.  Busy place so had to wait for seating which required standing for 40 minutes.  Good pizzas and salads.  Good variety of beers and wines.  Everyone had a different pizza which made for an interesting sampling.  BLT pizza was spicier than expected but it was great.  Great variety of pizza that others don't have.  Will be back.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/22/2014,7/7/2014,6,72,,2,1>The June 2014 issue of Fargo Monthly listed JL Beers as having the best burger in all of Fargo - called the "Humpty Dumpty" so I wanted to put that to the test.  Indeed, the Humpty Dumpty lives up to the reputation listed in that magazine.  The burger has a topping of cheese and a fried egg which gives it a great kick and comes with either french fries or potato chips.  There's a good selection of beer which I want to try next time.  JL does have a non-alcoholic root beer which will do in a pinch if you're not in the mood for alcohol.
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2014,7/6/2014,0,8,,3,1>Needed to run to the library over lunch hour and for the sheer convenience of it, grabbed a chicken salad wrap, a cup of Wisconsin cheese soup and an iced vanilla latte. The latte compared to others I've had, but the chicken salad was amazing! Hands down best chicken salad I've had in the area...shredded chicken, cashews and cranberries..perfect mixture without the hard lumps you get with chunked chicken salad.  The soup was also good..tasted more homemade and less food service.  All in all I might make that a destination for lunch!
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2014,7/5/2014,0,17,,4,1>Love the caramel rolls here for breakfast. You've got to get here early to get one, but it is well worth the effort. I take out of town friends here for breakfast and they adore it. Blueberry pancakes with your omelette? Of course! Caramel roll the size of my head? Count me in. The manager here is also super friendly and the atmosphere is very relaxed. I do wish their corned beef hash and OJ were made fresh, but the other food is so great I can't knock this place for it.
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2014,7/4/2014,0,11,1,1,>Grab a bowl, fill it up with noodles, toppings, and sauce, then have the guys at the grill cook it for you! Yum. For just making grilled stuff, this place has pretty good variety. Multiple noodle, meat, veggie, and sauce choices. The only thing that would make it better is to add some non grill choices too. You have to order anything non grilled (egg rolls, wontons, ect.) separately, and in my opinion the add ons are all pretty overpriced. Otherwise, great place!
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2014,7/3/2014,12,28,,7,6>I've been wanting to try Mezzuluna ever since it opened back in 2012; well, my wife and I finally got our opportunity to the other night, and what an experience it was!  Mezzaluna is located in a 100-year old building, right off of Broadway, in downtown Fargo.  I was anticipating some issues getting inside (my wife is in a wheelchair), but I was relieved to find out that a back entrance to the building is sloped.  We made a reservation for 9:00 PM on a Wednesday, thinking that the place wouldn't be as busy.  Well, it didn't exactly work out that way; thank goodness I had the sense enough to call ahead with a reservation!  They had a table reserved for us with a chair already removed (for my wife), and I thought that was pretty cool.  I could tell this place prided itself on its wait staff, as well as their food and drink.I had heard rumors that their bar staff was legendary, and they certainly didn't disappoint!  I had a Summit on tap with dinner, and a JoDo Sour (their version of a Whiskey Sour) after dinner.  My wife wanted a martini, but none of the ones on their drink menu interested her.  Our waitress suggested that we let the head bartender "make her something that wasn't on the menu".  "Sure; why not" was my wife's reply.  That guy is an alcohol wizard!  He made her a Strawberry Basil (whatever the heck that is), and she insisted I try it; I have to admit, it was pretty tasty!  It kind of reminded me of a mojito, but it had strawberries and basil in there, so it was different enough to not be confused.Our appetizer was their Sweet Potato-Pork Belly Hash.  You know how everyone says, "Bacon makes everything better"?  Bacon is the stuff you scrape off the bottom of your trash cans compared to pork belly!  The hash also has a fried egg and maple-balsamic syrup on top of it; it was, in a word, Nirvana.  For our main entrees, my wife had the Pistachio Encrusted Rack of Lamb w/ Orange and Mint Gremolata, and I had the Grilled Duck Breast & Leg Confit with Lingonberry-Pecan Preserves.  Everything was amazing, and I can't truly put into words just how good it was!For dessert, we tried a couple of their dessert bites (Crème Brulee and Espresso Chocolate Cake).  What is a dessert bite you ask?  It's exactly what it sounds like; two or three bites of said dessert, served out of a shot glass.  I guess I'm just used to the six-dollar, "Death by Chocolates" of the world, but you pay for quality here, not quantity.  Speaking of which, be ready to plop down some serious coin for the stuff here.  It's totally worth it, but I would only suggest this place for a special event (anniversary, birthday, etc.).  I've heard their Happy Hour is one of the best in town, so we'll probably go there for that the next time we decide to go here.  Either way, Mezzaluna is one of Fargo's best, if not THE best, fine dining restaurants!
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,7/2/2014,26,8,,2,1>This is hands down the go-to breakfast restaurant for my husband and I. We usually get the breakfast burrito and biscuits and gravy and split the two, because they are our favorites! The burrito is so full of flavor and the salsa that goes with it is excellent. I have never had a bad thing on the menu. For lunch, try the Italian chili, knoeffla, and you must try the homemade German kuchen for dessert. I love this place because it's always full of local characters and the staff works so hard to make sure you enjoy your meal. I also love the local art on the walls, and the bible verse on the white board every day. The food is always excellent, but it's the character of the establishment that we love most.

<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,2.0,4/9/2011,6/30/2014,29,16,6,2,2>Bar represents the mid-stage of social evolution among the Bababooey or upwardly mobile guido set that dominates the New Haven social scene. Between the college years spent in Alchemy and Toads and the coke-addled 30s Buttafucco stage at Geronimos, there's Bar. The bar scene is populated by this group - sun-damaged women and bros icing bros. This has the unavoidable effect of decreasing the quality of service (how many times can you really put protein powder in a Long Island Iced Tea?). The bartenders are pretty horrible as well. I ordered a mojito the last time I was there (for a friend's birthday party - not of my own choice) and the bartenders decided to use salt instead of sugar. I returned my drink. Most decent bars or somewhat slightly service oriented bar tenders would say "sorry mate, here's a refund and a pint on the house". Not this place. Just a vacant stare from the fembot behind the bar. The food is the only saving grace, but the menu is pretty much apizza, apizza, and apizza. And while the apizza is good, there are better places in the 'have (Modern), and better types of pizza generally (Chicago, NY, etc).

The service is cheerful, the seats are comfortable, and the food is reasonably priced. They have plenty of healthy options, so your meal can be as greasy or fresh as you like it.
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2009,6/27/2014,11,41,2,6,3>I don't really know what "real" Mexican food should taste like.  I grew up around here, and we like our Mexican food smothered in cheese and not too spicy.  Paradiso delivers, in my opinion.  My usual fare is a chicken chimichanga, wherever I go.  The chicken in this one was tasty, and cooked well.  The rice and beans were tasty and much more worthwhile than the ones I had recently at Acapulco.  Also, free dinner on your birthday? Score!  Add the fact that you can make it back to work within an hour lunch, and they have my vote.
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2007,6/26/2014,59,115,,5,1>MMM, i sure do love a Schlotzky's Sammich. I always get the ham and cheese original. I love the bread and the sammich just goes together really well. I often order a cup of soup with it too. They usually have California Blend (Medley), its a creamy soup with vegetables, and a hint of cheese. Tasty. Great place to eat for lunch.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2014,6/25/2014,25,29,,3,1>Love this store! This location is especially good because most people that shop here overlook the good finds. I am from San Francisco and when I found out that Home Goods was coming to the Farg, I got really excited!Today, I was on the hunt for a cookie jar for my puppy. We went to Petsmart first and they had a crapy plastic mason jar. Our luck turned when we walked into the Home Goods to discover their new pet section and bought a very cute and stylish jar for $5.99. They also have loads of other things like toys, bowls, beds, etc. for your pooch!

Even if your order water, have her put whip cream on it!  JKI wish she'd offer a few gluten free items in that tantalizing case of goodies that causes a person to drool by coming in 5 feet of it.  If you love scones, muffins, cheesecakes, or anything along that line - then you'll like Babb's.  They are all made in house and exude 'home made" in appearance, I can't imagine what they taste like.

The food came so fast we hardly had time to eat our bread basket. It was wonderful.We ate there again on a Sunday for brunch. There was so much food. I loved their fruit lay-out.

<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/30/2012,6/21/2014,5,22,,4,>I had never heard of this place until I got a mailer. They offer 15 percent off your order if you order online. The pizza topping choices are off the chart if you like variety. The products seem fresh and the gourmet/specialty pizzas are unique and tasty. I actually moved away from Moorhead and was sad to leave because of this place but to my surprise there is one right where I moved to! Hand down the best pizza "chain".

<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/27/2013,6/19/2014,46,52,,4,2>First time at an "Extreme Pita." It's like a Chipotle meets Subway--pita style. A choice of "design your own" or choose a pita sandwich recommendation from the menu. Meats are grilled in front of you, then add in your own choices of fresh vegetables, cheese, and sauces. Everything gets mixed together and stuffed in a delicious, whole grain pita. Wide selection of healthy, low cal options. Menu states which items are gluten-free, and vegetarian as well as the calorie total. Friendly staff. Clean tables. Definitely going back again.

We did goto Home Furniture 1st to just shop but we were told what we wanted wasn't available in any furniture store.  Way to lose a sale when you had 4 of what we wanted in a different part of the store. Maybe they should have listened as well as Josh did at Conlins.
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2012,6/17/2014,30,24,,4,1>If you love Scandanavian design, this place is for you. The furniture has clean lines, classic design shapes (aka the Swan chair) and a variety of home, office, bedroom and other decor. Their prices are quite reasonable and they have bargains in the basement, too. I loved the people working there; they were very gracious about letting us wander about the place and not once made me feel like I couldn't afford to be there...Lars Ulrich, drummer for Metallica, even dropped in there when he was recently visiting Fargo. I've already picked out a shelving set for my kitchen and a lamp for the living room. Love it!
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/24/2008,6/16/2014,8,25,,2,1>You will find some of the most unique dishes here, both cold and hot.  There is always a lot to choose from including quiche, vegetable and fruit salads, soups, sandwiches, burgers, egg bake, and plenty more.  Most of the prepared food is gathered locally which makes it even better.  Plenty of great options for vegetarians.  The ambiance of the Plains Art Museum is a definite plus and makes this a truly unique place for lunch.
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2013,6/15/2014,2,16,,2,1>Best place to get meat in the Fargo Area.  I have never had a bad steak from there.   The people that work there are always nice.  Great place to get your meat!   Once I orderd a 3 inch cut new york strip and they did that for me.  Will cut to your preference.
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2014,6/14/2014,8,28,,5,3>Tochi's is a fantastic, unique mom-and-pop style health/bulk/international store in downtown Fargo.  It isn't a "grocery" store, and you could probably never do all of your necessary shopping here, but I don't think that Tochi's is trying to convince you of this either.  As best I can tell, Tochi offers solid health-conscious alternative food items, a limited selection of bulk foods, and organic food options that you simply can't find anywhere else in Fargo.  The prices are a little higher, as would be expected for organic, specialized food options, but I have managed to find some items that are the best deals in town (e.g. $6.99 for a lb of quality pistachos is a steal in FM).  Don't be fooled by its smaller size, after perusing through the store a few times now, I've discovered that they have at least a few items of nearly every odd-and-end that I could think of, including items that aren't even stocked at the international stores.  They have the most diverse collection of spices in a single place in FM. You just have to ask.  It may be a small store, but you should definitely shop a little more deliberately when you peruse Tochi because it would be very easy to miss excellent deals on special items or even miss the items outright.  Enjoy the woodburning stove on all of those cold days. When you're feeling stumped, ask for help outright because it's not one of those places where the customer knows best.   In contrast to other health-centric stores in FM, Tochi's offers more raw goods and that can be little intimidating for those who think healthier living/eating is shoving pills down your throat or buying expensive processed packaging with an organic label on it.Homebrewers: Tochi also sells wine and beer brewing equipment.  As with groceries, I wouldn't purchase all of my brewing supplies there, but I definitely have picked up brew items when I was missing something important (thermometer, bottle caps).  Honestly, the prices were very affordable considering that the brew equipment could easily be more expensive.If you live in FM and don't occasionally pick up some treats at Tochi, then I have the sincerest disappointment for you.  You are really missing out.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2014,6/13/2014,2,1,,3,1>I had an issue with my laptop and I took it in to the guys at Blueprint...  They were able to diagnose the problem in a timely fasion and get me back to productivity!  I appreciated the service and the repore with the guys who worked on my laptop.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/13/2012,6/12/2014,16,34,,4,1>Simply one of the most effective and supportive medical practices - of all kinds - that I've ever experienced.  In town on business, an acute neck and upper shoulder injury, flared up suddenly, essentially disabling me with pain and highly restricted range of motion.  Thanks to a friend's referral, Dr. Paape eliminated the pain and restored my range to pre-injury conditions in just a few visits.  The entire staff is great, and the integrated regimen of chiropractic adjustment, physical therapy and acupuncture, directed by a well-trained team of professionals provides virtual 'one stop shopping'.  Gotta admit, a long-standing prejudice against alternative therapies made me a skeptic, but this 'pain in the neck' experience (literally and figuratively) has turned me around 180 degrees.  Different strokes for different folks, indeed, but for otherwise intractable problems (and probably for problems with a clear musculoskeletal basis in general), chiro is where I'll be heading.  And when in Fargo, Healing Arts Chiropractic is where I'll be.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2014,6/11/2014,10,149,,5,1>Amazingly fast and friendly service. I bring my personal vehicle here along with both work vehicles. Nice clean waiting area and restroom as well.
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/10/2012,6/10/2014,3,10,,3,1>One of the best places downtown for lunch. The Featured Sandwich of the Day is always great, so are the pasta salads and quinoa. Besides the lunch on the one side is the pastry side which I always stop by after eating. Love this place and the coffee.
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,6/9/2014,8,7,,5,2>This place started off with many, many bumps, but is starting to hit its stride. I've now been there five times (three times for breakfast, and twice for dinner), and they are FINALLY getting their servers to people quickly. Their breakfast pastries are fantastic, and their portions are huge. If you are vegetarian, I would recommend the tofu scramble (even though I'm typically looking for these dishes, the lack of experience that restaurants have in making vegetarian food taste good makes me nervous). Their veggie burgers are uniformly good, and their fries are, well, very much like fries--which is to say salty and tasty. I love their coffee, and their free bubbly water. They still need to learn how to do a consistent alcohol pour (or to err on the side of generosity each time). Fargo will not forgive a place that skimps on booze. I haven't had anything but luck in this department, but friends of mine have gotten some terrible pours in the past. Keep upping the speed, People's, and keep working on the details, and you'll be just fine.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/25/2014,6/8/2014,2,4,,5,1>Being a wood fired grill I had to try the rotisserie chicken that caught my attention as soon as I walked through the doors. The aroma was amazing!After enjoying one of their many choices of brews on tap I decided on the ribs and chicken. I was pleasantly surprised, nice sized portions! And I thought the ribs were especially good. I like spice so opted for the mango habanero bbq sauce, it had some kick! If you are sensitive to spicy foods I would go with a straight bbq. But I would definitely get these again, lotsa meat on these ribs. Delicious. Chicken was equally as good, nice smokey flavor, could have been a little more juicy if had to be picky but I was very happy, so much so I had to take some home!Overall I give Grizzly's a thumbs up! Will be back soon.
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/2/2014,6/7/2014,0,1,,3,1>Some of the best Pho that I have had anywhere in the country. I do not live in Fargo, but, have eaten here 4 times in the last 2 months. This is good stuff!
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,6/6/2014,2,1,,4,1>Truly a great establishment.  Staff was very service focused and passionate about their kraft. Very generous portions and the perfect balance of heat and zest.  The salsa was very fresh and delicious...highly recommend purchasing some to take home.  Overall, one of the best burritos I've eaten.  Don't miss an opportunity to check this place out early...I'd venture this place is going to do very well when more people learn of its charms!
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2014,6/5/2014,15,23,,6,1>I agree with the other posters who've raved that this is the best Indian food in Fargo.I discovered the place by happenstance when I had to drive to West Fargo for something.I've been there a dozen times and expect to go there a dozen more.  It's excellent for groups or just to have a nice quiet dinner with a friend or significant other.  The place is quiet, well-decorated, and clean.  The tables, which there are plenty of, are always clean and well-presented.The food is fresh and is made to order - I recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala, but everything there is great.  The naan bread is fresh and warm and I can't recommend the Tandori chicken enough.  I feel compelled to mention that the portion sizes are just perfect; they're not too small where you feel like you're not getting your moneys worth and not too big where you're taking half of it home.With that said, I'm usually pretty stuffed when I leave there and even have *just* enough to take with me for a late-night snack if I so chose.  The wait staff and host/ess are awesome - very friendly and remember your name and what you usually order.  For me, this is something that is usually missed in the fast-paced world today and a very very welcome and refreshing thing.Take out and delivery is super fast, too - all without sacrificing quality.  If you're in Fargo, I really encourage you to stop by this place and get some delicious food.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,6/3/2014,8,3,,2,1>As the mother of of four, my body's not what it used to be, my husband and I have a vast height difference which make family photos hard, and we have a child with autism that has a hard time sitting still and smiling nicely for the camera, and one that is similar to a Tasmanian devil.  None of these issues phased Yvonne.  She is creative, professional, energetic, and captivated the kids' attention while putting us all at ease.  Through the years we've had multiple photo sessions and received fantastic portraits each and every time!  I HIGHLY recommend Yvonne!
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2009,6/2/2014,81,223,2,8,2>Took my bf here when he came to visit over the summer, wasn't expecting much...it is very very small but the price is right and if you have a AAA card you get an additional discount. The grounds are well kept and maintained, we strolled and lingered and it took us under 2 hours to see everything.The red panda was hiding up in a tree so I only got a good look at its behind. The meerkats were cute, they have a little bug and amphibian exhibit. There is also an open air bird exhibit, they also had a bald eagle and another type of eagle or falcon in a separate display. There was a small petting zoo and a few camels. All in all it wasn't a bad little zoo and more than I expected.

<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2011,5/31/2014,3,42,,1,>Fun & delicoius. Fresh ingriedients, unique menu, cold bottles of beer, and veggie options too! Fun atmosphere. I saw kids, families, couples, and after work folks. Moe's got a fun motif and a bright, sunny atmosphere. Service is super friendly. Food was really delicious. Beer was good & cold.
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2014,5/30/2014,21,90,,2,1>They carry Benjamin Moore paint, have a good selection of samples and finishes, and the staff is moderately helpful. Not quite helpful enough to walk a complete noob through the process step-by-step, but enough to get somebody on the right path. My favorite part is they don't try to needlessly up-sell the customer. Our experience was very fair and professional, but it was only paint related. I can't speak to their glass.
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/30/2013,5/29/2014,1,7,,2,>Yes, very likely the best donuts in North Dakota. Staff is friendly and on point. The selection does thin out by late morning, so if you have a certain something in mind come early. My personal fave Apple Fritter. Be sure to ask them about the Tom Hanks story.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2012,5/28/2014,0,25,,2,1>Love me some G-Junks. The junction delight with peppers is super yummy, I also like the Chicken junction...ok I like just about everything they offer. I can say that because I have eaten almost everything on their menu. The bread is crusty on outside and soft on the inside. the hot grill and sauces on the sandwich fillings are excellent. Such a nice change from the bland ordinary sub shops!! The fries are usually seasoned well and pretty good too but for me it is all about the sandwiches. Service is good, I can't think of a time when I have had awful service or bad food, so they earn a 5 star from me :)
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2013,5/27/2014,58,23,,3,1>BBQ is the way to go here. Ribs are good, pulled pork, but my favorite is the Martian Munchies (pork pieces) smothered in the BBQ sauce. If you get the choice of sides here the beans are really good and the baked potato is always done right. Matter of fact if you like the potato the loaded potato is a great choice as they smother it with cheese chicken and other good stuff.
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2014,5/26/2014,0,22,,2,1>I have eaten here a few times and they PACK those tacos full!  Yee haw!  Great for what it is - would eat here over TB anyday and I don't feel like imgunnadie after I am done.I will say that their sauces are pretty good but I have had better.  If they had that typical mom and pop flavored homemade sauce that seems to be chili powder and water but when I mix those together I get something much much different, I'd give them a five star.
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2014,5/25/2014,1,6,,1,>My check engine light was on and I really didn't want to have to take my car in, but I didn't have time to fix it myself so I looked online for a shop.  This was really the only place I could find reviews on, but I was nervous because they were all five star.  Now I know why!  My appointment was for 3:30 but I dropped my car off over lunch.  By 2:30 Jason called me and said it was a sensor and they could have the part there and installed in a little over an hour. Shortly after  4:00 Jason called me and I went and picked it up.  When I got the final bill I was shocked that the part actually cost more than the labor!  I've never seen that before! But I still thought it was an amazing deal. I will definitely recommend this place if anyone I know needs a mechanic.
<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2011,5/24/2014,14,110,2,8,3>Lucy's serves the best Chinese/Korean food within a 200 mile radius of Fargo (at least).Here's some advice to maximize your Lucy's experience:---  Order to go.  It's a no-frills restaurant without much ambiance (or a liquor license for that matter.)  Food this good should be consumed along with your favorite adult beverage.---  When ordering, select mostly menu items you haven't seen at local Chinese restaurants.  Take a chance, almost everything is delicious.---  One exception to item 2:  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS order the Grandma's noodles.  After you've tried Grandma's noodles, you'll never eat noodles anywhere else.  Ever.  The half moon flatbread is also fabulous.This is authentic fare served with a lot of care.  Try it!
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2013,5/23/2014,5,3,,4,3>Been to Bar 9 a few times now with friends from work! Great place for a happy hour, catch a sports event, or just hang out. Staff is friendly and efficient! They recently added more space which includes another bar which is great! Bar 9 also offers "bar food" that always seems to be a step above the rest in terms of taste and quality!! Will be going there again some time soon for sure!

I frequent this shop to get on wifi and get some work done and every time I've been there the staff is quick and very friendly and the drinks are always awesome!If you need a place to set up your laptop or relax with a good book for a few hours this is your place! The atmosphere is a little loud but I always put on headphones and read anyways. They have plenty of seating too with outlets on the side wall.

They answered all my questions, gave me good advice, and above all did great work. The service was some of the best service I have experienced at an auto body shop. The staff was so friendly and willing to help me and went above and beyond what I expected. They got me in right away and had me going again in no time. I would highly recommend Advanced Auto Body and Glass to anyone who is looking to get some repair work done.
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2013,5/19/2014,14,10,,4,3>I love frozen yogurt and when this new place opened in town I had to try it out. They offer 18 different flavors of frozen yogurt and over 50 toppings. But what sets them apart from the other frozen yogurt places in Fargo/Moorhead is... their leather coaches, TVs, fireplace and  self served coffee machine that makes 8 different kinds of coffee. They also offer a punch card (which I'm a huge fan of). Like them on Facebook too, because they offer specials and deals throughout the week! Check it out... you won't be disappointed!
<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/6/2011,5/18/2014,3,2,,4,3>This is a beautiful place.  I love that the gallery showcases many local artists.  Has an amazing variety of work from designer kitchen tools to world class photography and paintings.  The yoga studio in back is cozy and comfortable.  The instructors are highly skilled and differentiate their teaching to all levels of students.  Don't miss this joint -- it's worth visiting over and over.

They have EXCELLENT beer selection, including Surley's!  During the summer you can dine inside or outside.  They usually have bands on the weekends during the busy summer season.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,5/9/2014,9,2,,6,2>I'm new to Fargo and love Greek cuisine, so undoubtedly I was excited to give this place a try.  It was amazing!  Everything from the service, to the ambience, to the delicious food, and fabulous wine--it did not disappoint.  It was clean, the servers were attentive and confident, the manager checked in on us at least twice to make sure we were satisfied, and the food was DELICIOUS and reasonably priced.  It's not every day you find a restaurant where you don't know what made the experience better, the food or the service.  Both surpassed my expectations.  Try the Souvlaki and Baklava cheesecake for sure!!!
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,5/8/2014,112,215,2,4,3>I, along with family and friends, have purchased several cars from Lunde in Fargo. I have also bought one from their dealership in Peoria years back. Hands down best dealership in Fargo. I have bought from Corwin and Valley and in my opinion they don't hold a torch to the customer service that you get at Lunde. I mostly dealt with Dennis Senne way back but have worked with Alex Boen on the last couple car deals. What I like about Lunde is that you can drive through the lot or walk around and look at cars without spies in the parking lot flanking you as soon as you unbuckle your seat belt! They are very honest about pricing (best priced) and don't ever try to manipulate numbers to give you a fake deal. Most integrity of any place I've worked with. They also stand behind your purchase. Most recently I bought a 2001 BMW 330ci from them. It was painless and easy. They also worked with me when I needed service and treated me like a valued  customer. Usually at other places as soon as you sign the line you become a statistic. Not here. The service department is great to work with and very prompt. What I appreciate most is that the sales people at Lunde ask what you want, what you're looking for, and don't try to sell you a car just to make a sale. For instance, Alex knows I hate buying used cars and I love warranty. He also knows I'm picky. So when I decided to buy this used, 13-year old BMW last week he was very honest in saying that it wasn't about a car deal, it wasn't about making a quick sale, it was about being realistic of the car and being smart about the buy being that it's a used car. I guarantee every other place would just try get the check as quick as they could  and send you on your way. If you are looking for nice people, no hassles and integrity I would swing through Lunde. Feel free to contact me directly with any questions.
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2014,5/6/2014,33,26,,3,3>As is my normal rule, I like to give places second chances if I am not happy with food or service.  So, a while back I came back to 3 Lyons to give it another try.  I'm glad I did.I have not yet ordered the same things I did before - and, I was so turned off by them the first time, I probably won't - but the things I have ordered every time since have been great!So far, my favorite is the Beef Stroganoff, but the patty melt and the corned beef sandwich are really good, too.The Stroganoff is more an American version - without the dijon mustard - and that's fine.  It's well-made: the noodles are cooked perfectly, the meat is lean and really tender, and the sauce is very tasty, with no grease.  One thing I have noticed, though is that the portions are inconsistent - there can be a large difference between visits, or even between plates at a table.Since this is Fargo, and this place is a bar, you will want to come early.  Starting around 6PM, the tables start to fill up quick!

Aside from doing a great job the customer service was one we wish we saw more often. They were friendly and helpful and took the time to walk through the car with us and break down what was done. We can't say enough about Auto Salon. If you're thinking of getting you auto detailed this is the place !!
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2014,5/3/2014,1,52,,2,1>I've checked out several fitness places around the FM area in the past few years, but finally found one I LOVE. Courts Plus has many options- I most enjoy the fitness classes & plethora of cardio machines. I've visited at various times of the day/days of the week & even when the place is busiest (~5:30pm on weekdays, ~9am weekends), there are plenty of machines/space available. There are LOTS of children here for birthday parties, playland stuff, etc. on the weekends, but what I really enjoy is that it is contained to one area of the building. I am comfortably able to go about my workout business. Membership is a little pricey, but always having space available and a friendly atmosphere more than makes up for that. I've never encountered a gym where almost everyone you come across will say hello or ask how your workout was. The fitness instructors are top notch. My only complaint with the fitness classes is that some don't work with my schedule, but what can ya do?

<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2012,4/30/2014,0,2,,8,3>Great kept secret in West Fargo.  The best non-buffet Chinese restaurant in town.  Friendly service, and great attention to each individual dish.  The value compared to price is spot on.  I would definitely ignore Joel G's comment.
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2012,4/29/2014,0,4,1,7,4>I consider myself something of a foodie, I love to explore other cultures' foods and being from North Dakota, that is not always an easy thing to do.  Even Thai and Sushi places can be hard to find in most of the state until recently, (and Thai is still rare!).  So an African restaurant is definitely exotic, if I had not had such in Indiana when I lived there, I would not have known what to expect.As it stands, I convinced a couple of friends to go with me to try it out while I was in Fargo for a wedding this weekend, and none of us were disappointed.  In fact, we all left the place saying it was amazing.  Huge helpings, great price, and wonderful flavors.  All on top of great service.  I had the Beef Steak with Basmatic Rice and Injera.  One friend had the chicken with the soup and (I think) Pashanti bread.  While the other friend had the Fish with Rice.  We all loved it.  And all three entrees were HUGE.I also had a pair of Sambusas, and I have to say they were the best of all, a lovely spicy meat with great flavors fried in a pastry of sorts, and also big.  And they are only a dollar, this would be a great lunch for anyone in fargo, even three or four would easily make a whole meal, and two would still be a decent light lunch!The restaurant itself is a bit cozy, it's a small mom and pop sort of establishment though, so I'm not expecting five star decor.  All in all, this place has my highest recommendations for anyone in the area who is hungry and in want of something new.  Help keep Fargo's burgeoning food scene vibrant and growing with variety!
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2013,4/28/2014,0,1,1,3,2>Highly Recommended. Men's Hair House is the best in town regardless of which metric you measure it by. I have really frizzy, course hair and used to spend $35+ at salons trying to find someone who could cut my hair the way I like it. Then I found Men's Hair House. Good hair cut, relatively inexpensive, friendly staff, your own TV tuned to ESPN, and a shoulder massage at the end to top it all off. Tell me again why any guy would want to go anywhere else?
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2011,4/27/2014,25,12,1,5,3>This is the BEST Grand Junction in the Fargo-Moorhead area. They have the best customer service, the best line setup and they have make the best fries.I tell everyone who wants a delicious lunch to try this place.The price doesn't break the bank, but you get a whole lot of fresh food for what you pay.If you or someone in your group is vegetarian, they have an amazing veggie supreme sandwich and everything else - so groups can easily find a little something for everyone.Be prepared to wait during the busy hours (11:45 - 1:00 and 5:00-6:30), but the longest I have ever stood there is 10 minutes, so a little patience pays off when you bite into that delicious hot sub.Personal favorite - The Cajun Chicken Ranch, yum!
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/15/2012,4/26/2014,3,3,,3,2>Excellent place to dine. Gives you a big city feel, which is cool for Fargo Morehead. Great portion size, and unique specials. A great fine dining establishment to bring people not from Fargo. You will not be disappointmented.
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/15/2012,4/25/2014,12,84,3,4,2>The Man has being bring his V'dub (fondly known as 'the rocket') to Jaq's for as long as he's lived in Moorhead.  When I finally moved up here, he insisted that even though my Durango (fondly known as 'the beast') isn't an import that Jaq's would be wiling and able to service it well.  I was highly impressed with the level of customer respect I was given, as a woman who knows her stuff about cars, and how prompt the service on my truck was.  We were in and out in less than an hour for an oil change, tune up, tire rotation and fluid swap.  They even ordered some spare parts for the beast to fix the 4x4 and a faulty parking lamp with no extra cost, but the part price!  You can't beat that with a stick.  Good stuff, Jaq's!
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2014,4/24/2014,4,31,,2,1>This is THE best bakery and I wish they could ship me a box every week.  They have amazing service and my ABSOLUTE favorite is Cookies and Cream, German Chocolate, Lemon Drop, Peanut Butter cup, Red Velvet, Toffee Crunch, Black Sheep, Carrot, Pumpkin, Almond........wait......I think I need to start over. I might have forgot some. Bottom line if you want cupcakes and you are even close to Fargo use them. I taste tested a bunch of flavors as they did cup cakes for my wedding.   The toughest decision in all our wedding planning was which flavors to pick. Every cupcake we tried was perfect.
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2013,4/23/2014,1,8,,2,1>I wish they were here all year long. Food is great and the owner is awesome.
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2008,4/22/2014,9,9,,10,1>I was extremely pleased with the restaurant, the service, and the food. Some of the best authentic Italian food I've had. Our waitress was incredibly polite and answered all of our questions.It's definitely a place we would go to again.
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2011,4/21/2014,3,7,,3,2>This is my favorite place to eat in Fargo.  We go here about once a week and I have never had bad food.  Love the steaks.  One of the best places to sit outside in the summer.
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/2/2013,4/20/2014,1,60,,7,2>Gave this place another visit and my golly, it's still good. The place lacked atmosphere for a Saturday night, but we got carryout anyway. No one at all was sitting down to eat and they didn't look overwhelmed with orders. I hope that's not a sign that business isn't doing well!The food was great, again. My wife's pizza was packed to the gills with toppings. They completed my special instructions for my crust correctly.The cheezybread was delicious.I added to my order by calling, after placing it online. The guy who answered the phone was polite and made the change like it was nothing.Give these guys your business!
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/28/2014,4/19/2014,4,3,,5,3>My husband and I decided to try this place out for apps and a couple drinks before going out this weekend. We were both very happy with the food and service. Our appetizers took a little long to get to us, but the waiter really made up for it by making sure we knew he was checking on it and coming over and talking to us. They have a pretty good draft beer selection, much better than most bar/grill places in the area. The atmosphere was great, we sat at the rail overlooking the stage and dancing area. Our food was good, just apps but you could tell everything was home made fresh and not frozen. The prices are good for what you get for sure. Even better is that you can go for drinks and music at night, but can also go in for lunch and bring the kids.
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/16/2013,4/18/2014,17,179,,4,2>Awesome company!! Every time I have a cleaning need I will use them. Very responsive, punctual and affordable! I'm happy they are part of the Fargo community!
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2014,4/17/2014,73,53,,5,3>We use Mosaic Foods monthly for work lunch meetings.  They never disappoint and they deliver, though I would expect there are conditions or limits for that.We often get a bag lunch with something like a wrap or croissant sandwich or salad. We fight over the brownies that come with our orders.  Today we did the Bento boxes.  Several of us have been talking about how good the Deconstructed Nicoise Salad was.  And for those of us still trying to maintain our New Year's Resolutions, the fruit on the side was a touch.
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2013,4/16/2014,8,10,4,9,5>Are you familiar with the feeling that one gets when they suddenly realize something important is happening to them? It can be a feeling of awe, and at the same time excitement, and maybe a even a hint of zen? Maybe its a feeling thats kin to one you might have when you're learning something new and challenging- an a-ha moment-  or any moment that changes you?  That's the kind of feeling you have the opportunity to experience at luchadores. Sure, it's lunch, or perhaps an after bar snack. But it's also more than that- its real, it's different, it's fuckin' gourmet. It's changing the way Fargo does Mexican. I'll even say that its changing the way Fargo does food. It great, and It's a kind of a big deal. Chorizo beans forever.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2010,4/15/2014,48,20,,5,3>If you live in Fargo, ND or are just visiting this is where you will want to go to stock up on your fav alcoholic beverages. They always have deals going on and the prices are much cheaper than other liquor stores around town. get er done the right way! go to Happy Harry's
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,4/14/2014,4,8,1,3,2>Love love love Hu Hot! Fun to make your own creations, I pretty much make it the same every time. Great service and never have to wait very long for a seat. Even when it gets busy it doesn't take long to get through the line. Friday nights are my favorite because they add shrimp to line up. If you have never been here you must try it!
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,4/13/2014,24,7,,4,3>My wife and I went here for a special date night.  We had a great time. The server was friendly and prompt during happy hour.  We tried a sampling of some of the favorite plates.  The food was cooked with a lot of Good taste.  The wife got a steak and it was a little red for her medium well order, but they resolved the problem right away. I would recommend to anyone.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,4/12/2014,5,14,,3,2>I have never had a better egg roll. My husband ordered general Tao's chicken and he said it was super good. The staff is super nice. We have dined in before and sometimes there is a long wait, so if you have kids bring something for them to do and bring a good attitude and patience. The food is worth the wait. Great food, atmosphere is simple. Cash only.
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2013,4/11/2014,26,94,,4,2>We had a bad experience but they turned it around in a good way which deserves five-stars. We only had to wait about 10 minutes to get a table. We ordered some drinks and I had a flavored lemonade which was delicious! The bad experience part came when it took us about 45 to an hour to get our food. They had made my husband's pizza wrong and had to remake it but the staff was so nice about it. The manager came over twice asking if he could get us an appetizer or a soup. They of course comp'd our meal and were apologetic every chance they could get. The food itself was fantastic once it finally arrived.
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2013,4/9/2014,4,13,,5,2>This place fits right in with downtown Fargo and is a good addition to get small plates late at night. The menu is fairly limited to maybe a dozen taco types and several appetizers, but everything is very fresh and presented well. The tacos are all soft-shell and small (and the price is too) so its easy to try different types in one sitting.The bar is full service featuring a wide range of tequilas. There are a few taps and several bottled beers.Overall, its a great place to spend some time while eating small portions. Not really a 'dining' destination as opposed to a place to hang out with friends.I'm giving it 5 stars not because it is a 5 star "fine" dining experience, but because it has character, is fun, knows its place and handles it very well. Plus the food tastes great.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2012,4/8/2014,5,15,,3,2>We have eaten at Maxwells a few times over the past few years and have had an outstanding meal every time.  Awesome wine selection and the food pairings are unique and very tasty.  When we decide to have a special event or want a really nice meal, we always count on Maxwells to deliver.  With a bottle of wine for 2, plan to spend $100 to $120 for the meal.  Well worth it however.The bar also has a nice beer selection on tap with great appetizers.  We stop in on occasion to have a martini and snack just for a change of pace.
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2010,4/7/2014,0,36,,3,2>This place is a refreshing little shop in downtown Fargo.   A great place to grab a simple little Thai lunch.  Not too pricey and always served with a smile.
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2012,4/6/2014,5,25,,4,2>An average burger is 4.99 but its anything but average best burger ive had since eating at red robin. the staff was prompt and attentive explaining how there burgers were made and what best serves various amounts of people (ie: a regular fries serves two adults) the only thing you really need to be careful about is there are peanuts all over this place in huge bags and you can purchase them as snacks (DO NOT get food here if you or anyone your with is allergic) my only negative comment is that the floor was a little dirty
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2011,4/5/2014,17,9,,4,2>Great food and awesome beers. I've been here multiple times and am always trying new foods. It is all delicious. This place would've been 5 stars but my burgers have come overdone a couple of times.Brunch here is also amazing. Plenty of good food: eggs, caramel rolls, fruit... You can order bottomless Mimosas.They also have a patio here which is great during the summer time.
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2013,4/4/2014,2,15,,2,1>Every time I've been there the food and service have been great.  The pizza is the best in town and the variety is awesome.  Definitely one of the best go-to restaurants in the F-M area!
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/19/2014,4/2/2014,16,7,,5,2>I really dig this place.Great "taco truck" style burritos. My favorite is the Smokehouse.You may encounter long lines. Suck it up, it's worth it.If you are going to go for the combo, Avoid the fries. Not bad, but the onion rings or tots are better.Since it's on Broadway, parking is an issue.Oh, and they're open till 3 AM on the weekends. So, super bonus.
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/16/2009,4/1/2014,8,11,,8,3>I love this place. It used to be downtown in Fargo but has moved to south Fargo. Not to be confused with the place in the mall... this place has THE BEST BREAKFAST in Fargo/Moorhead. I highly recommend getting the sweet potato pancakes. Great burgers and other standards. I am not a huge fan of frog legs or gator bites, but if you are I hear they are good. My buddy gets them with a bucket of beer.
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2013,3/31/2014,16,6,1,6,3>Always polite, it is drive through pharmacy only, however if meds are packaged in a large container they will hand deliver to your car!

We went through a lot of vehicles and a couple were sold out from under me. Joe kept searching for the right vehicle even after all of that.  After seeing how well they took care of their customers I have since started working at Corwin Toyota's sister dealership.
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2013,3/29/2014,10,149,,3,2>A frequent favorite in the Fargo area.  I often have allergic reactions to most processed ground beef, but no problems with the great hamburgers here at SmashBurger.  Love all of the "make your own options" from the bun, cheese, vegetables, etc.  The shakes are pricey, but worth splurging on once in a while.  The staff sets them apart from most
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2013,3/28/2014,2,2,5,6,5>The Red Pepper still has it!! This place tastes exactly like the original Red Pepper... Delicious! It's a brand new place that is packed all the time because it is so good . So you will have to wait but it's definitely worth it.. If you want fast food go to McDonald's and cry into a cheeseburger if you want good food go to Red Pepper and don't forget the white sauce
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/10/2014,3/27/2014,26,79,,4,2>Great place to hang out before or after the show at Courtney's Comedy Club.  Karaoke is a blast, the food is good and the staff is awesome
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2013,3/26/2014,3,7,,2,1>Great service, food is reliably good as well. Fish and chips make the grade for those discerning tastes. The patio sucks (wink wink) don't ever go there.  Beers could use a little better selection. Awesome back room for elegant dinners or private parties.
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/16/2014,3/25/2014,13,6,,3,2>Wonderful Sunday Brunch with a great variety of well prepared lunch and breakfast items. Welcoming atmosphere and great service.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2013,3/24/2014,0,3,,6,2>Downtown Juano's is absolutely fantastic; i have no idea what these other reviewers are talking about. Yes, the service may be slower than other places, but the environment creates this. Juano's is about having a real dining experience, not just a quick sit-down thing. The wait staff is always helpful and kind to myself and my family whenever we are there, and the food is to die for. Both kinds of salsa are great, and the special 'hot' sauce is also excellent (by request). And if you're interested, they have a ghost pepper sauce that you can try. The drinks are fab, and the owner, Juan, is always around and sweet. The shredded pork is phenomenal! I honestly cannot say enough good things about Juano's. It's always our go-to 'nice' place to eat. LOVE.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,3/23/2014,0,17,,2,1>I liked the Chopper burger. Great bun, thick crispy bacon, fresh veggies, and lots of good provolone cheese. I look forward to going back. Good selection of tap beers, and lots of TVs.
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2012,3/22/2014,4,76,,6,3>My favorite liquor place in town. The beer selection is good (smaller than Happy Harry's over in Fargo, but still good), and it covers several regional and national breweries(the great Lagunitas beers can be found here, for one). The liquor selection is better than many as well-the only place in the area that I know of that has Death's Door Gin. As for the wine, I'm not knowledgeable to comment on the selection, but the prices are quite alright, and there are many sales. Best of all, the employees here have all been very knowledgeable; if you describe the idea beer that you'd like, they'll give you some good recommendations.
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2014,3/21/2014,8,9,,3,2>Best pho in fargo. I have not eaten anything else here. Just the best. At first when you get you marvel at this size of your head bowl they have. After your first taste you realize you forgot to use the chili sauce that comes with, and then there it is the best pho in fargo.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2014,3/20/2014,1,10,,3,2>This is my favorite library around here. It has a large selection and plenty of places to sit. They have many computers for online access, plus Wifi for anyone who has their own device with them. They hold interesting events, such as teaching embroidery and making Pinterest-worthy crafts. Sometimes they screen movies with free popcorn given out to anyone who shows up. I love this library! :)
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/14/2013,3/19/2014,6,5,,3,2>I've dined here many times and have always found the food to be reasonably priced, fresh, and beautifully presented.  Most of the servers are quite friendly, knowledgeable, and professional.  Warm, subdued music and a delightful view of the mighty Red frame a charming dining experience to be shared with close friends or a significant other.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2012,3/18/2014,9,9,3,3,2>Such a great place!  Came in with an entire hockey team on a Saturday afternoon.  They called an extra waitress and she was awesome!  Her name was Kayla.  She was fast and consistent and very friendly.  Could not say anything bad about this place.  Best waitress at any restaurant ever!  Prices were very reasonable as well.
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/5/2014,3/17/2014,10,20,,4,3>I have a lot of respect for this place after seeing the owner work harder than anyone else for Sunday breakfast. Seating tables, getting drinks, while still managing the crew. It was awesome to see this, but most importantly the food was great. Fantastic buttermilk pancakes, and the breakfast hash was spot on. Just douce some Louisiana Hot Sauce on it and you're in taste heaven, and heat hell. If you're into that sort of thing. They should try to find a way to create more seating though. They're very busy on the Sundays I've been there. The walls are a tad awkward, and the space behind the bar could be minimized to create more seating. That's my only complaint or suggestion to this wonderful little shack.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2013,3/16/2014,11,10,,5,3>My favorite spot for fantastic Indian food. The buffet is amazing and allows you to try several different dishes. The best part about the buffet is that it's never the same. I recommend everyone try it whether you've had Indian food before or not.  This place is perfect for people who are connoisseurs of Indian food or those who are first-timers.  It's perfect.  I do have to say, though, I noticed that they do not make it as spicy as the food usually is and it is probably to appeal to everyone out there..  Never the less, it's GREAT!
<review# 246,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2014,3/15/2014,46,30,,3,3>Great new place on Broadway in Downtown Fargo.  I heard they opened an stopped in for a late lunch.  The place is in the former space of a Pita Pit and I must say that they did a fine job in renovating it.  It is a fairly narrow space with the wood-fire oven right in the center of the space and the pizza are made and cooked in plain sight.  The lunch menu has a series of pizza option as well as a build your own option.  I went with a "lunch-sized" pepperoni and green olive.  The pizza itself was about the size of a football and was served quite quickly (5-10 minutes).  The pizza was fantastic and left me wanting more... I would love to head back for dinner and get one of their large pizzas.  I imagine that it will be similar to a Sammy's or Duane's where a large pizza could easily be devoured by a single person, but I may be wrong.  Along with the pizzas they have a list of some salads and apps that looked quite good.  Overall, this place is a welcomed addition to downtown Fargo and I hope it does very well!
<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/28/2012,3/14/2014,0,25,1,4,3>Delicious, I had two different kind of rolls and so did Hubs they were all very good. My daughter had the kid's chicken teriyaki, she ate it right up and was mooching off our miso soup. Her chicken teriyaki looked so good I was sneaking bites of it and it was as good as it looked. My server seemed kind of new but was kind and attentive so no complaints at all! I would love to come back and try the hibachi grill with friends sometime.
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2013,3/11/2014,0,25,1,4,2>Favorite restaurant in Fargo. The miso is delish, I always get the Red Dragon and Philadelphia Roll. The service is always friendly. The prices are very reasonable and rolls are generous. I've been to many of the other sushi places in town and this is my favorite and the best.
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2013,3/10/2014,1,4,1,7,3>Went there for their comedy night and was really impressed by the cool interior of the place. I've always kind of judged the Red Raven since before when it was on Roberts, but I have to admit that I'm glad I went now. Didn't try any coffee there, unfortunately, but I had a cup of earl grey and it was delicious. Will definitely go again.
<review# 250,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/19/2012,3/9/2014,8,13,3,3,2>This is by far my favorite restaurant in Fargo. I always suggest Bert's when going out with my friends for lunch. The specials always look amazing, but I've still never eaten anything other than the Italian Beef, or the Italian Beef With Sausage.The Italian Beef is packed with beef, and topped with peppers, onions, etc. You can order it without the hot stuff, but they really add a lot. If you get it with a sausage, they just stuff a huge sausage in the bottom of it. I can't adequately describe the perfection. The only reason I don't add that every time is because I tell myself it's healthier without it.The sandwich comes with some wonderful potato chips and a pickle, and is more than enough to eat.If you pay cash instead of credit, they give you a small discount, I think it's 10%. If you're considering it, please give them a try, you will not be disappointed!!
<review# 251,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2012,3/8/2014,0,1,,3,2>The Mile-Hi-Thai wrap was amazing. This place is a welcome change from the average/typical sub shops ALL over town. Gourmet sandwiches, fast service and a nice atmosphere.
<review# 252,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2009,3/7/2014,13,1,1,9,3>If you're looking for an outstanding place for breakfast or lunch, this is worth the trip to West Fargo, trust me.  Almost everything is homemade, service is super fast, and as cheap as it gets.  Try the knoephla soup on Fridays, its the best!  Also, leave room for dessert!Best diner I have ever been to.
<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2013,3/6/2014,32,171,,3,2>Oh yummy for my tummy post-marathon race!  Make reservations if you can because this little place was packed.  Seating was only available at the bar and so that's where I sat to eat my Basil Pesto Penne al dente and how delish it was.  Garlicky.  Smooth.  Simple.  Service was fast and attentive.  I love that they have a gluten-free menu.  The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because their salad was 99% iceberg lettuce.  Oh please, anything but iceberg lettuce.  Maybe frill it with sprouts, arugula, and spice it with some more toppings to give it some color.
<review# 254,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/27/2011,3/5/2014,3,2,3,5,4>My favorite bar in Fargo Moorhead. A great mix of people from college age to the downtown regulars. Check out Poitin, Irish band, many a Friday night.If dark, noisy with a great variety of people is your cup of tea, definately the place to go!
<review# 255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2012,3/4/2014,7,9,2,5,3>I agree with everyone so far about the hotel.  My wife and I used to book a room there as a Christmas gift to each other before we were married.  It was a great gift because we knew we both would love it!  We live in Fargo but rarely go downtown so it also kind of neat to stay downtown once in a while and hit up a few of the bars down there and not have to worry about getting a ride home!Highly recommended (especially if you are trying to impress a significant other!)
<review# 256,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2012,3/3/2014,3,1,1,5,4>I went to a bagle place with the same idea as Boppas Bagles in Omaha NE. It didnt even compare to the quality that Boppas Bagles offers. Truly delicious! And they have great cream cheeses!!
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2012,3/2/2014,1,12,1,4,3>I've only ever eaten one thing here, but it's amazing. Make sure to try the spit roasted chicken. It melts in your mouth.  Decent beer and drink list, and a nice ambiance.
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2013,3/1/2014,58,23,1,5,4>My wife and I wanted to splurge for our anniversary so we thought we would hit up the Ho Do since we had heard so many good things. A cute little downtown location great for a nice after dinner stroll, the HoDo has a great remodeled modern look that doesn't take away from the historic parts of the building that make it so lovely. My wife got the duck and loved it. She said she felt that everything on the plate went very well together and that it was a combination that she would never think to have. I had the bison which was very yummy and had great spice in the dish. It was so refreshing to have some good spice in Fargo that was very Santa Fe inspired. The service was very good. They treated us to some free appetizers for our special occasion. Very friendly and always there to keep the glasses full. Great experience overall.
<review# 259,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/12/2013,2/28/2014,15,46,3,7,4>What an adorable find! We were so happy to fall upon this place while in Fargo....the colours, the coffee, the croissant, the ambiance and cheery colours, were all right up our alley. I only wish we had more places like this in Rochester!
<review# 260,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2013,2/27/2014,9,11,,5,5>okay you fashionistas...make a stop here ASAP. Feel free to take your time, lots of cute pieces. The inventory changes, so make sure to grab an item you love before it is sold out.  The staff here are GREAT...they'll definitely help you out.
<review# 261,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/9/2013,2/26/2014,2,2,1,4,3>This place is like willy wonka's bike factory, I came in and told them what was wrong with my bike and they had it fixed in about 5 minutes!! Definitely going there again!
<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2013,2/25/2014,18,16,2,11,5>I've been getting my hair cut by Chelsey for 7-8 years now. Asides from always getting a great haircut, the atmosphere and conversation is usually the best part of my visits. Chelsey and her husband, Alex, did a great job putting Everett's Barbershop together last spring- very vintage- including barber poles, back bar with mirrors, and photos of family and friends (after all, family is what it's all about with her sister Maureen also barbering there as well).They are very talented young ladies, and more experienced than you'd think. A buddy of mine hired them to do shaves for all the groomsmen the morning of his wedding. Everyone looked great after the old-fashioned shave, and we all had a hell of a good time. Don't forget, the girls do a neck shave with a straightedge after every haircut. It's the "ticket".  You may pay a little more with them- I've been to cost cutters and Great Clips before, but Everett's blows them away. You get what you pay for, people. Plus I think they take credit cards now too, which isn't the norm for most barbershops.
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/18/2013,2/24/2014,15,23,1,9,4>Since moving to Fargo almost five years ago, I haven't been able to find a really good - or any - Vietnamese restaurant.I am so very thankful that Viet Palace has opened and that I, by happenstance, discovered it.I've had the Pho and Bahn mi several times and cannot begin to rave about either one enough.  If you're in Fargo and have 'adventurous' tastes, I would highly recommend stopping in here for fantastic service and phenomenal fresh food.
<review# 264,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2012,2/23/2014,33,26,2,6,3>Being from California, I tend to prefer foods with some spice and bold flavor.  Passage to India fits that bill.I have been here many times.  I have ordered off the menu, but the thing to do is come for lunch during the week, or on Saturday and get the buffet.  Unlike many of the Asian restaurants in the area, the buffet here is excellent; the food is always hot and fresh.The food at Passage to India varies in spiciness, so you can always find something you will like.  My favorite, predictably, is probably the chicken tika masala, but their tandoori chicken is really good, too.It can be a bit pricey if you order off the menu, which is why I suggest the buffet - that, and the variety of food you can taste.I have eaten at many different Indian restaurants in California but, personally, I think Passage to India is offers the best Indian cuisine I have ever had, so far.  At many places, the food on the buffet is floating in grease.  Not so, here.  I would definitely eat here again, as i have many times before.
<review# 265,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/27/2013,2/22/2014,12,28,2,9,3>I've been meaning to go to this place for some time now, but it never worked out for me; until yesterday. Mango's is not the typical Mexican restaurant you'd find in Fargo; it's authentic! My wife and I were out running errands yesterday, and we happened by the place around lunchtime. We're always wanting to try different places in Fargo/Moorhead, and this was perfect timing.We walked in, and they were busy; a good sign. After waiting to be seated for a couple of minutes, the manager, who was working the till at the time, apologized to us, and to the four people in line at the cash register, as he grabbed a couple of menus and seated us himself. I recalled seeing a 'Help Wanted' sign on the door as we walked in, and I'm guessing this had something to do with it. I decided not to hold that against them, as stuff like that can ruin a person's perception of an otherwise awesome place.As we looked over the menu, the prices caught my eye; they were all fairly reasonable! Yet another good sign! Our waitress came over with a basket of warm tortilla chips and a mini carafe of salsa, and took our drink orders. Chips and salsa were good; salsa wasn't super chunky, and had a perfect amount of heat to it. Our waitress brought us our beverages and took our lunch orders. My wife excused herself to use the restroom, and before she got back our food was already at our table! Five minutes, tops! I was really impressed by this, but that soon took a backseat to how impressed I was with the food.In a word, phenomenal! Despite having a decent-sized Latino community (for an Upper-Midwest town, anyway), most of the area's "Mexican" restaurants are Tex-Mex; not this place! Both my wife and I had the Beef Chimichangas, and we shared a Chicken Empanada with sour cream and guacamole. It was all delicious! Some Fried Ice Cream rounded-out our meal. So glad we finally tried Mango's! My only regret is that we didn't try it sooner!
<review# 266,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2014,2/21/2014,8,10,3,5,4>Its a typical mom and pop sort of place. The food comes out quick, and the portions are HUGE! This is my boyfriends favorite place to take his family when they come up to visit because its a "North Dakota experience" which I am still trying to figure out what that means- I also have to comment how inexpensive everything is- however I have to say you cant be watching your calorie intake when you step in those doors!
<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2014,2/15/2014,21,90,6,12,6>There's an old Monty Python jokes that says American beer is like making love in a canoe because they're both f***ing close to water. If this joke offends you, Wurst likely won't rate highly on your list. They carry 2-3 of the mass market stuff (Budweiser, Miller, etc.) because I suppose one HAS to, but thankfully the vast majority of their menu is GOOD beer instead. And much like JL Beers, the menu rotates on about a weekly basis.From hoppy, American craft ales, to German hefeweissen, stouts, ciders, lambics... Let's just say it's a celebration of Bacchian proportions. And yes, they carry lagers, but they'll mostly be more obscure brands and hopefully far more interesting than mass market junk you can get any old place.Their food is outstanding, too! Americans always seem woefully ignorant of wursts other than brats, but no longer! Here you can get mettwurst, German sausage, polska kielbasa, linguica, and a handful of exotics like elk and rabbit. I'd like to see them carry a good bockwurst as well, but the selection is still great. (I've always hated bratwurst, but my wife got it and I had a bite of hers. I still wouldn't order it myself, but it was WAY tastier than any other brat I've had.)The also have jager schnitzel (which was pretty good), a delicious pierogi appetizer with a curry sauce, and the most amazing pretzel I've ever eaten. Three large sticks that tasted fresh made, with the outside crisp and the inside doughy and chewy but still fully cooked. It was like a manly version of a croissant and it was awesome. The beer cheese dip was a little bit conventional, but still very tasty. Even their side salads are excellent, incorporating some spinach for actual greenery instead of just lame iceberg lettuce. And I finally tried the borscht, which was okay.After three visits, the mettwurst remains both my wife's and my favorite. Well, that and the pretzels. ;)Being new, they are PACKED, as in standing room only while waiting, on weekend dinner hours. But there are lunch hours and other days of the week, too. This place is worth it, and I highly recommend it. Probably in my Top 5 for eateries in Fargo.
