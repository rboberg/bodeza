<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2014,11/25/2014,132,200,4,4,1>I've wanted to go to DMK pretty much since it opened, but it's such a trek from my apartment (a whole six minute walk... what a struggle). Finally made it and I am so glad I did! I had the tater tots - my friend totally judged me for ordering the tater tots when there are so many fancy fry options at DMK, but the tater tots were so good! Perfectly crunchy and well seasoned. I then had the Satchmo, which was a little on the small side, but really delicious, with very fresh bread and great breaded shrimp. I finished up with the peanut butter shake - I was really wondering whether I could get it, and I didn't end up finishing it, but it was so, so good. Really fresh and creamy and milky, with a thin layer of peanut butter and just the right amount of real peanut flavor. So delicious! I'll definitely be back.

It came with choice of fries or salad & I had the fries. Both my son & husband had the chicken dinner. They raved and raved how delicious it was...Service was more than great....server very attentive with quick drink refills and the management came over a couple times asking if everything was okay...will return. A gem, no doubt!
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/28/2014,11/23/2014,143,199,1,5,3>The location is situated in a cute part of Evanston, plenty of little stores, a small park, available parking, etc. The food is really good. After our 4th or 5th visit, I've grown to like the steak salad and the steak skillet (with semi-hot salsa) with two eggs over easy (oh no, my mouth is watering). The complimentary garlic bread could be a little crispier but we always ask for seconds. The service is attentive and there is a large clientele so they appear established. We'll keep coming back to try more.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/27/2014,11/22/2014,57,93,,4,2>I was pleasantly surprised by my eating experience here at this restaurant bc of the just "a-ok" reviews on this place.  I originally was at Annie's (which is down the street) but they were so packed I decided I would no longer torture my hungry tummy and come to Alexander's which wasn't as busy.  The restaurant is a little and small and the seating is a little awkward.  There are 2 tables for two smack dab in the middle of the restaurant which I thought was a little uncomfortable.  I had read on the service of this place and though I wasn't met with any rude waitresses (ours was quite polite an d nice!), it was pretty slow.  I ordered the mayan benedict (which I cant find on the website menu so this may have been a special?) and it is as good as I imagined it to be.  The eggs were perfectly poached on to of a bed of black bean patty.  It also came with spanish rice and plaintains. The whole dish itself was oozing with flavor.  I have never experienced a breakfast dish like that and it was amazing.  I would come here again just for that dish. I knocked one star off bc it was also the loudest breakfast experience I have ever had.  It was to the point where I couldn't hear my friend and we were sitting right across from each other. I dont know if it was just echo-y in there but I was starting to lose my voice. heheHowever, the prices are decent and I will definitely be back! Great breakfast joint! Recommended!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2014,11/21/2014,130,318,,1,1>My wife and I had an awesome 35th bday dinner for myself here a couple weeks ago!!! Hats off to Jen Eisen and her staff!!! The service was very attentive and the food was OUTSTANDING!!!!We enjoyed the shrimp and lobster fritters for starters, followed by the Brussels sprout salad. I went with the special steak that was a 16 oz sliced ribeye steak over polenta and mushrooms. The sauce was to die for and my medium rare steak was cooked to perfection. My wife had the halibut and thoroughly enjoyed her dish as well. House 406 is a great addition to an otherwise absent fine dining scene in downtown Northbrook. Oh, and it's not an Italian restaurant either, since we have Francesca's, Marcellos and Oliveris as really the only other "finer" dining experiences in town.....all Italian cuisine.Save this place for a special occasion and book it now!
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2014,11/20/2014,90,224,6,7,8>Sooooo close to a 5-star, it's rydiculous! (If they can use y's instead of i's, so can I.)So I popped yn to the new Evanston location today for lunch and ordered the chycken and avocado sandwych with an orange-gynger drynk. (ok, I'll stop) It was fab. The sandwich was a bit spicy, with roasted tomatoes and a marinated chicken breast, all packaged up with avocado in a really delicious oatmeal bun. The fruit drinks are so fresh, and huge! You won't need the sparkling or flat water taps nearby, but they're such fun, so why not?!The environment here is pure green/cozy/clean, with lots of different seating choices arranged in this very cute round restaurant. I really enjoyed my lunch here, the staff was great and I will definitely go back. I think I'm holding back on 5 stars only because the menu was a bit difficult to find when I walked in, didn't seem to have as many super vegetarian/healthy items as I expected and it was chilly sitting near the windows today - someone should really have turned the air conditioning down considering it was only 55 degrees outside.I bet it will be AWESOME to come here for a glass of wine on the terrace soon... might give 5 stars if that works out.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,11/19/2014,16,109,3,3,4>I've come here twice, both for their soondubu. First time was the seafood soondubu which lacked depth of flavor compared to others that I've had. I also have tried the beef soondubu which was similar in flavor but the meat was tough :( This was the first time I've had beef soondubu so not sure if this is the norm or what...They are very generous with the tofu and it's a good portion for $9.99. There's a special deal where they offer $2 off the soondubu if you order an appetizer with it. Also note that perhaps this place is pretty good considering there isn't another korean place that has soondubu in Evanston. I usually end up traveling to Morton Grove or Niles for a nice fix.I've tried two of their apps: pan fried potsticker and the spicy korean style wings. The potstickers were tasty but not memorable. The spicy korean wings though was the highlight of this place for me! it's nice and crisp and I was very pleasantly surprised that it had such good flavor! I'm a big korean fried chicken fan (tried Dak, Crisp, and Bon Chon chains). These chicken wings were up there with the best of them! I would come back just for these wings again and perhaps try some of the other entrees on their menu! The spicy isn't super spicy so don't be afraid to try it!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/29/2014,11/18/2014,52,196,1,5,5>I am always excited to try new types of food, and so when I saw a Portuguese/African Chicken place was going up in Skokie, I anxiously awaited its opening every time I drove by.  When they finally opened, I stopped by on a late weekday afternoon, and there were several people waiting for food.  I placed my order and waited.  For about 20 minutes, which I thought was a little ridiculous until I read the other reviews for Fogo's.  Apparently at 20 minutes I should consider myself lucky.They advertise made to order, flame grilled chicken marinated for 24 hours, which I imagine is part of what causes the wait.  Made to order means they don't start cooking the chicken until someone orders, and big chunks of chicken take time to order.  Have you ever ordered chicken tenders at a drive-through?  I have almost always been asked to park and they would bring the order out to me because it would take longer and I would be backing up the line.  Imagine that, except every order is chicken.I got the chicken and rice bowl which came with chicken and rice (no surprises here).  The mild was actually fairly spicy, I can't even imagine what hot or extra hot tastes like.  They didn't offer any sauce, so I didn't get any, it was spicy, and that was about it.  Overall, while the flavor of the chicken and rice were good, I felt like it needed something more to take it to the next level, maybe the sauce would have helped, or maybe some veggies or something to mix it up a little?The concept is great, but I think they are still working on the execution.  It is a fast casual restaurant that unfortunately is a little slow.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/16/2014,11/17/2014,10,70,1,5,4>My wife and I had dinner delivered from here last week.  I had the Singapore noodles, egg drop soup and some potstickers.  The soup was a solid O.K. though I didn't get any crunchy noodles with it.  The potstickers were not terrible, but I've had a lot better.  With the Singapore noodles, the flavor was pretty good (I could have used more spice though), the pork quality was good but the shrimp was pretty pathetic.  They reminded me of those little shrimps in ramen noodle cups.  All in all, I haven't wrote them off yet, but next time I give them a try, I'll order something different.

She was patient and super nice. She told us to stop and take a sip of our drinks a few times since we ended up being super serious about our paintings. She was also very accommodating  and on top of it she was nice enough to walk around and take pictures of us ( we didn't even ask) AMAZING! I loved everything about tispy paint, and cannot wait to come back.

<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2013,11/14/2014,0,9,3,4,3>Rolf's has effectively serviced my 2003 BMW three times in the past year.  Other reviewers have claimed they are expensive but I found they were over 10% cheaper than a BMW dealership on a valve cover replacement.  They are willing to drive me home when I drop my car off for a repair, then pick me up after it's complete -- this saves me time and effort to get to them.  I will be using them again and again for my beloved vintage Beemer.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2014,11/13/2014,6,10,2,3,3>The best place for breakfast anywhere!! Their pancakes are amazing, so to the sausage, and the crepes, french toast, omelets, coffee, fresh-squeezed orange juice, etc. I haven't ever had a meal here that I disliked. It's no wonder why the lines are out the door on the weekend mornings. The wait staff is awesome, particularly Anna, and they have no qualms about taking something back and remaking it if it doesn't meet your expectations. If you haven't eaten here you owe it to yourself to give it a try. You will love it!
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2014,11/12/2014,4,13,5,5,5>How could you go to this office and be unhappy?!  From the minute you walk in the girls at the desk are polite and friendly, the office is beautiful and you immediately feel relaxed.  I was referred by a friend for a chemical peel with the medical aesthetician, Aggie, and I had a great experience.  She did a full skin evaluation and discuss what she was planning to do, but more importantly she explained that not only would summer maybe be the wrong time for a peel, but that I would really peel so if I had a lot on my social calendar in the next 5 days it was the wrong time to do the peel, which I can honestly say I was grateful to have been told.  I would have been mortified to go to an event with my face peeling!  She is awesome.  I did a regular facial that day and scheduled my peel for September.  By the way, they also have a refer a friend program which got both me and my friend a discount!

I love both the chicken taco and the sea of Cortez. This is a great place to go with our kids because we can have a drink and everyone eats a good meal at a reasonable price! A really great suburban gem that I wish I had more seating!
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/24/2014,11/10/2014,5,17,2,4,5>I needed a new local nail place and thanks to YELP I found one!I called to make an appointment and Tina (the owner) scheduled me for a no-chip manicure and pedicure. I walked in and was greeted with smiles. They were super busy but Tina still acknowledged me and asked me to pick a nail polish. There's a huge selection of both OPI and Essie polishes. The lady who did my pedicure was very meticulous and did a fantastic job. A different lady did my no-chip manicure and she was as sweet as pie.The environment is relaxing, the ladies are professional, and I am overall very pleased with how my nails turned out. With all that being said.... Check this place out! :) You won't regret it.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,11/9/2014,15,16,3,3,4>I love this place. I've been going here for 8 years now. Its very affordable! $12 for a manicure and $32 for a mani pedi, you can't beat that! My go to girl is Chi. She doesn't rush and she does a very good job. I always call ahead to make sure she is there. If you make an appointment make sure you are ON TIME if you're not there they will just move on to the next walk in the next 5-10 minutes. Even if you do have an appointment anticipate 15 minutes wait time just because they fall behind sometimes trying to keep up with walkins (which isnt a bad thing because you don't want thwm to rush on your nails!). I do have to warn you that the owner (an older man) can come off very rude, but to be perfectly honest it is a cultural thing. Which lwads me to another thing is that most of them don't speak alot of English so it can be difficult to make small talk with them. But other than that they understand your needs nail wise.Overall their technicians are nice, they're clean and disinfect their tools and it's affordable prices.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,11/8/2014,103,20,2,4,3>Probably my favorite Go-To place in Lake Forest. The Deli and Fresh Cheese selection is fantastic. They also have food, drinks, deserts to go or eat in. Since they opened, they really made themselves a part of the community and it's one of a kind in the area. The people that work here are helpful and very friendly, it has a real family feel and that your welcomed. I buy things here a minimum of twice a week. Go there and check it out, the quality of products and pricing is Great.

<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,11/6/2014,11,49,3,3,3>Amy will call you honey, or sweetie and it's meant with the best of intentions... she really does think you're honey or sweetie.The omlettes are terrific, mine was filled with ham-off-the-bone.  Nice and fluffy accompanied by hot sauce, and hot coffee. The potatoes that accompany the eggs were crispy and delicious, and the place, while small, is bright and charming.I've been back a number of times... try the pancakes... with or without bananas.  The French toast (on French bread) sounds better than it is... the French bread kinda fights you... but still tasty.I give it five stars, not because the food was the very best in the world, although it was good... but because Amy makes you feel at home, and that's worth it's weight in gold.

<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/14/2014,11/4/2014,1,15,1,3,3>So much to say and like about this place. First the tacos, tamales, and other Mexican dishes are spot on. Very very casual to eat there - just some tables in the middle of the store. They also have a great juice bar with a huge selection. Real stuff, not the sugary flop like the chains. They have produce that looks like it came right from the farm. I get my salad fixins here. The store features tons of Mexican goods and bakery stuff. They also have a nice Jewish deli section for pastrami and tuna salad. Friendly folks and lots of people from the neighborhood.  I really wish they were open Saturday.

<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2014,10/28/2014,206,413,3,8,5>As of the writing of this review, Patisserie Coralie is 3 days old and Cafe Mozart is now a minimum of -3 days old (gone!). Having spotted a french patisserie while driving back from lunch, this place caught my eye. I saw Macarons listed, but I didn't see any inside. I can't say I blame them, as it's a brand new establishment. The woman running the patisserie seemed to be completely overwhelmed and I wasn't sure if my wife should have tried to thank her in french and pay in euros or not, haha! Meanwhile, the food looks - and tastes, amazing.The desserts here are probably the best I have had in Evanston, hands down. I had an exotic egg, which was made with sprinkled vanilla bean on top to look like an egg with pepper, and it had a fruit/mango jelly inside, with some white chocolate. To comprise of the patty/biscuit underneath was a chocolate/coconut combination, not unlike an israeli macaroon. I guess I made up for macarons with macaroons on this dessert.We also got a dessert tart which looked like a wedding cake, made of hazelnut and a few other delicious items.  Both were noticeably well prepared, and staff was really friendly. I like what they've done with the place.Only after the fact did I find out that this restaurant is related to the creperie st germain (same owner, presumably). While the creperie may have been pretty good but not amazing, Patiesserie Coralie is definitely excellent and probably one of the best places to grab a dessert/pastry I have seen yet. Total win.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/29/2014,10/27/2014,56,146,1,6,4>This review is for the three day GROUPON Juice Cleanse. I saw the offer on Group for 97 (plus 8.50 tax) and decided to go for it. Prior to the actual cleanse, I looked on YELP for descriptions and other reviews- which definitely helped. My sister also signed up for a cleanse so we could reap the benefits of it, together.Ordering: ordering was simple- I called the Evanston location and informed them of my Groupon offer. I was told my order would come in 48 hours later and that they would call me. That Tuesday, Jamila (spelling) called back and told me that my juices would be ready for pick up! I picked up 3 bags with 6 juices each (18) and was ready to begin. The week prior, I was eating low carb/no carb options so going into it wasn't very difficult. Service: The employees at Peeled are so informative and friendly! Winter (who works at the Evanston location) and Jamila were both very open to answering my questions and making recommendations on actual smoothies. I will definitely return for the Smoothies. Juices:Green Lantern: the Green Juice tastes like celery/ginger soup with a hint of sweetness. I'm not a big fan of celery but after the second day- it was a lot easier to drink.Maroon 5: I am a huge fan of Borscht. This had a similar taste to Borscht but it did turn my pee pink (TMI) and was more gingery and kind of sweet. I would've preferred it without the ginger or the sweet. My sister actually liked this one cold. Haute Lemonade- Sister said it was horrible!Cashew Milk: It has a strange taste but it's yummy. Not quite as delicious as a milkshake (or rich) but has a hint of sweetness. Verdict:I wasn't hungry and I'm currently on Day 3 of the Cleanse. To be honest- I did eat a little bit of solid food (small portion of protein) during the day. Also, on the Day 2- I went and purchased an actual Smoothie from Peeled for dinner.Will I do this cleanse again? Probably not. I am sure the Juices are healthy and help detoxify my system- but I'll put my 100.00 on something else! However- I do recommend to try a cleanse if you never have before!

<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2014,10/25/2014,33,130,3,2,2>Well, the word is out. Haewadall is consistently busy at night and it isn't uncommon to wait for a table.  The banchan has improved from my original visit along with their other menu items. The soondubu is still good and I love that the seafood is fresh and never, ever rubbery. This is pretty evident in their ohjinguh bokkum (spicy squid). Order it an tell me the squid isn't cooked perfectly, tender yet toothsome. The Daegu muhri jjim is another dish done really well. Read Hannah H's review about it. While those dishes are excellent, some of their other stews are average. The al chigae and daegu tang (roe stew/spicy cod stew) are not spicy enough and don't have much depth of flavor. Service is friendly but they are constantly running around to different tables so I've learned it's best to ring the table bell when you want their attention. Haewadall is the best option for homestyle Korean food in the area. I think the tables full of Koreans would agree.

They are a family business that has been in highland park for years and clearly there is a reason that they have been here so long "good food". I particularly like their BBQ chicken which is their unique style. Going along with the chicken is a great BBQ sauce. They also have a great slab of ribs that my kids love and I try to cop one or two if they are willing to share. They have a nice bar as well and it's a great place to watch a game and have a drink or meet some friends. It is a small place so if you go during the dinner rush be prepared to wait. Ravinia BBQ is a little place, a hole in the wall but it serves great food and for that I recommend it to anyone!

<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/23/2014,10/20/2014,6,90,4,7,4>I'm so torn on how to review this place...but I will be optimistic.If I had to rate the food, Boltwood would be a solid 4-5.  Service was impeccable -- deserving of a 5.  But the noise level in this restaurant was unbearable.  Hubby and I had a babysitter and don't get to go out as often as we like so when I snagged us a reservation at Boltwood, I was pumped.  Then we walked in the door and I realized that I couldn't hear anything.  Our server tried to explain the menu -- again, I couldn't hear a word she was saying (and I admit to having excellent hearing).  It was so disconcerting that we debated leaving but we stayed.  We were moved to a table in the back which helped, but it still did not alleviate the headache.  I was told that they are getting some sort of noise reduction panels installed, which hopefully will help.  I am used to eating in noisy restaurants, but this was too much.  I'll give the staff this -- they certainly tried to come up with ways to handle this situation.  I wasn't expecting quiet and restrained, but honestly I don't think I can go back until these panels have been installed.  When I do, assuming that the food is of the same caliber, my rating will definitely be upped.The food is definitely new for Evanston (thank goodness).  We started our meal with some pickled vegetables and cheese wrapped in a meat similar to Proscuitto but from Iowa (quericia).  The veggies were delicious.  The char on the quericia was a little extreme -- as a result, it was hard to taste the rest of the dish.We tried the bread with the salted butter -- outstanding.  Then hubby had the tri-tips which were fabulous and I had the sweetbreads with mushroom dashi.  Also delicious.None of the desserts really spoke to me so we didn't order any.Cocktails were good -- I had a homemade highball with CH Vodka and ginger soda.  Delish.  Hubby was excited to see Akari Shogun on tap.I hope to be making a return trip -- once I know that the noise levels have been handled.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2014,10/19/2014,32,212,1,6,5>This review is for the Bollywood Groove cardio dance class on Sundays from 10-11 am.THE MOST IMPORTANT INFOThe first order of business upon arriving at the studio is to sign in on a sheet of paper. Payments are taken care of afterward; the prices are $15 to drop-in for one class, and less per class if you buy a set of classes (attendance would be marked on a card). Payments are made to the instructors directly, not the Foster Dance Studio staff.(The above information was obtained via trial and error the day of my visit, and in fact the confusion which ensued in order to obtain this information is the reason for my withholding 1 star. More explanation for the latter statement is given later in this review.)ADDITIONAL INFOThere were ~20 participants the day I went; most of the people appeared to be regulars, while maybe 1/4 were new to the class. The room we were in was mostly full, and while the studio had some air circulation, I still recommend shorts and a tank top during class, as I was far too warm in a short sleeve t-shirt and yoga pants.The two instructors switched off between songs, which manifested as one woman as the main instructor while the other woman acted as the hype lady (excited whoops, shouts, etc.). The class consisted of a warm up, high energy dance routines (which included a fair amount of jumping), a cool down, and a short core workout. That day the instructors were unable to find yoga mats in the dance studio, so if you're planning on attending I would recommend bringing your own. The moves for the routines are taught quickly, and there were some partner movements as well.Overall the class was good exercise, but the confusion before and after class detracted from my overall experience. Before class, it was unclear that a sign-in sheet even existed, and there was no indication of where we could/should put our things; and after class, it was ambiguous to whom payment should be made. Unfortunately, there's very little information about this class on Foster Dance Studio's website, so I hope this Yelp review can shed some light on the matter.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2014,10/18/2014,29,22,2,4,3>The Art of Beer is a fine establishment for anyone curious about, appreciative of, or passionately crazed by beer.The selection is for the most part American craft beers with local breweries well represented and a few foreign gems included to cover a good portion of the beer spectrum in a tiny retail establishment.The recent addition of beer taps and a limited food menu have transformed the cozy neighborhood store into a worthy destination. I've had the steak tacos on a couple occasions and have had to force myself to stop from ordering more (and more) each time. They are an excellent accompaniment to the ever revolving selection of tap beers. If there is any downside, it's the size of the store. With limited seating, a small group of friends can pack the place. I've been a regular since the store opened in 2013. A great addition to Highwood.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2014,10/17/2014,8,16,2,3,3>Glencoe is a charming little town and right at its center is the Guildhall Restaurant - and what a lovely find it is!Friday night, 8pm, and it was hopping! Loud, most definitely, but happy loud; vibrant, brash, ... raucous even! Folks knew folks, tables cross-chatted with other tables of 'near strangers' - some flirty, some cheeky, some serious but all charming and relaxed.  Everyone seemed to soak up the atmosphere and leverage its benign but wholly-addictive energy for good conversation amongst wonderfully flavorsome food. The large windows threw out to some half-dozen sidewalk tables which were equally busy ... and the sound of the joint traveled up and down the heart of Glencoe and seemed to invite even more spontaneously traffic. Terrific service. Fascinating menu that included fun lamb dishes, plenty of seafood concoctions and unpredictable combinations of pastas, shellfish and sexy sauces ;-)I liked it. A lot.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2014,10/16/2014,155,68,6,11,8>I've been to several haunted houses and I always end up liking Fear City the best.  I really like that they didn't have pitch black rooms where I end up walking out like a bruised peach.  The lines were a bit long even with the VIP tickets, but there were several staff members walking around scaring people and taking pictures to keep us entertained.  There was also a band playing rock music the whole night.  Hungry?There is also a bar with drinks and snacks (just make sure someone from your group is saving your spot in line).  I love that their staff actually interacts with their customers.  I was laughing so much throughout the entire night that my cheeks got sore!  If you came here last year you will notice that there that the main Fear City house has the same basic themes with a few twists.  I won't give anything away, but my favorite parts of last year's themes were still incorporated into the house this year.  This year, the second haunted house (Lady of the Cursed) was different (although I can't remember what the theme of the second haunted house was last year).  We were sent to the Lady of the Cursed house first because the line was shorter.  The guy with all of the statues and books was hilarious! There was only one time that someone in my group asked a question to one of the staff and they were taken aback.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,10/15/2014,362,467,3,5,3>I'm not one to ever really treat myself to spa days (I'd rather spend money on food, to be quite honest), but I really felt like getting a mani/pedi (first time getting a pedi). I decided to give this place a shot after seeing the good reviews on yelp. I made an appointment for 2PM on a Tuesday. I basically made the appointment an hour prior to the actual appointment, which was nice. The first thing I noticed upon walking in is that the facilities are very clean and modern. Olga worked with me on both the manicure and pedicure. She was absolutely fantastic - friendly but did not force conversation. She was also very meticulous with her work and spent time adding nice little touches to make the experience wonderful (e.g. warm towels wraps and a short shoulder massage at the end!) I was basically there for about 1.5 hours (although it took me forever to choose the colors), and my experience was fantastic from start to finish. I also love how they take tools out of sealed bags - points for cleanliness!Only small complaint was I had a gel manicure done a few weeks ago and there was some polish leftover. The cost to remove the gel is $5, but I was not told until she brought out the receipt - I would have paid regardless, but a little heads up would have been nice. However, she was an angel and reminded me of the wildcard discount (I went in knowing I was going to use it, but forgot). I also got to watch the movie Monster in Law throughout mani/pedi, which was fun. They accept credit card, and my total came to $40 (student's get 20% off from M-W), including the additional $5 to remove the gel. I then tipped her $7 in cash for great service. If I decide to treat myself again, I will definitely come back here!
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2014,10/14/2014,1,29,2,5,5>Let me start off with the key point - there is some mighty fine BBQ to be had at RUB.The meats we ordered were both fantastic.  Had both the brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was amazing, super tender, with some good smoke on it.  And it was great both on it's own, and with the spicy BBQ sauce.  Even my wife and daughter (that aren't brisket fans generally) loved it!  The pulled pork was just as tasty, again with or without sauce.  Need to hit a few more of the meats, but I imagine they are just as good.The sauces - they have a nice variety of the main types of "staple" BBQ sauces available at the tables.  My favorite is the spicy style sauce - as I don't care for the sweeter sauces personally (although theirs are tasty).  I also like their vinegar-based sauce for fries.  It's like malt vinegar with a little something extra.The sides and apps we had were also tasty.  Mac and cheese was very flavorful and cheesey - a big hit with the daughter.  Brussel sprouts cooked in bacon were nice, had a little char on them, tasted very good.  Baked beans were also good, with some nice chunks of the meat in there.  We also enjoyed the hush puppies quite a bit.  I also dig the spicy pickles they throw on your tray for you with your meal - they are a nice compliment to all the meat going on.Service was quick, the line just kept on moving.  For me, this is the way BBQ is best, simple on the tray - nothing fancy going on.Long story short - I will be back as often as my waistline will allow it to gorge myself on fabulous smoked meats!  And I will bring along friends and family.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2014,10/13/2014,29,186,1,3,4>What I love about this place, besides that I've enjoyed everything I've tried, is that they have actual bottles of mustard on the table instead of tiny packets hidden away, and the Cholula sauce on every table. I'm a little embarrassed to say that my favorite thing to eat is a plate of naked fries (reasonable, at $3) with globs of mustard and cholula sauce all over it. Delicious! I've tried a few other things, like salads, and sliders. I have no complaints. Of course, there will be loud kids here, especially around lunch, and dinner too...and in between. Well, what did you expect? I recommend it for a casual lunch or dinner, or just a mad hankering for fries. I do wish they had some cheap coffee; it doesn't have to be super good. I would love to be able to buy a  medium cup for a dollar here.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2014,10/12/2014,34,75,2,5,3>Definitely go for the Puriste, though I wouldn't say adding the fried egg is really worth it. Both the crepe filing and the crepes themselves are absolutely delicious, as are the salads. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the service is a bit slower outside, so eat indoors if you're in a hurry. This place usually has a $10 for $20 Groupon going, which makes a meal here a great deal.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2014,10/11/2014,90,300,4,4,4>I love wine. I love small wine shops. I love small wine shops that have a wide selection and a range of prices. I love small wine shops that have a wide selection, a range of prices, that have wine tastings, and are in my neighborhood. I love Wine Goddess. My first encounter was during the Custer St. Fair, when I had a lovely rose after is had my fill of beer. The woman I talked to who was manning their tent was incredibly friendly and helpful, which made me want to visit again. This business is a great addition to Evanston, one that will be in my regular rotation.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2014,10/10/2014,2251,305,7,7,6>When I heard they were finally updating this restaurant last year, I was so excited. I know people were sad to see the old place go, but it needed a serious facelift. And boy did it ever.The new interior makes me think it belongs in "Horse and Hound." Dark inviting wood with modern touches so you don't feel like you're going to your parents' restaurant.On two occasions, I've had lunch here and ordered the fish specials both times. I was really pleased with both, as were the people I dined with. Sometimes fish dishes can be boring but the kitchen serves an elegant plate.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2014,10/9/2014,151,436,7,9,8>I came here lured and intrigued by the dim sum Sunday brunch.I have to say that this a much better dim sum than the one tried in Chinatown, which was just awful and definitely not my thing.The dim sum bunch at Koi has definitely some tasty items such as the shrimp cakes and spinach wraps. The great thing that these are small bites and that you can try a lot of items on the menu. The Jasmine tea is just delicious and bottomless mimosas are great as well. I think my favorite items on the dim sum menu were the sweets, they are really tasty and unique and I don't know any place that offers them.The service on Sunday is little rushed, there was one waiter that really stood out, and he rolled with the dim sum cart and explained everything in great detail and what he had. The other dim sum cart driver was not that great. The waiter was kind a non- existent, I am not sure what he was doing but he was not by my table. The one dim sum cart guy was like my waiter eventhough it was obvious it was not his job. I hope that he is compensated for his hard work because he really became my server.Overall, I would recommend this dim sum Sunday brunch experience it is a lot of fun and there are some great finds.....its like a dim sum scavenger hunt.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2014,10/8/2014,66,161,3,5,4>This is the world's friendliest Chinese restaurant!  The owner recognizes my fiance and calls him by his first name.  The food is some of the best Chinese I have had.  My fiance swears by the Mongolian Beef. It is slightly sweet and is very tender.We decided to eat in the other day.  Service was a bit disorganized since we were told to sit wherever we wanted.  It took a few minutes to get menus and our server, but after that everything was good.  Our server took the time to make a suggestion of a noodle dish since according to her the thing I ordered was not very good. They make their own noodles in house, and the quality shows.
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,10/7/2014,168,197,2,3,3>Being someone who truly enjoys cooking, this place is a mecca for anyone looking to add a little something extra to your meals.It's a small shop with a ton to offer.  When you first walk in, you get that feeling seeing all of the vats of specialty oils and vinegars.  The small tasting cups are a must try for those that want to spark their taste buds.  Small sips are the way to go for those weak in the palates.  Some of my favorites are:Tuscan Herb Olive Oil - traditional tastePersian Lime Olive Oil - great for fishSmoky Bacon Olive Oil - um BACON!Apple Balsamic VinegarChampagne Pear Vinegar Chocolate Balsamic Vinegar - Don't ask, just taste it!!I'm very impressed with the quality, taste, and friendly service in the place and look forward to filling up my bottles frequently!

The whole process took an hour and a half and I was very pleased with the results.  Kevin and Jeannie are very personable and aim to please.  Their shop is clean and bright.  I would definitely recommend them and I will be back!

Little boutiques all wrapped up into 1 store. There's something for everyone in here. I really liked the paintings and the homemade candles. If you need a cute gift for a friend, you can probably find something here.

Back when I was able to eat gluten, I would devour their pita like a mofo. If I had to complain about one thing, it'd be the fact that they have Pepsi products and not coke products in the fountain. This boy needs his diet coke, ya dig? Eh, no biggie, though, if I get thirsty enough, I'll drink their honey mustard. It's like sex in a ramekin. YUMMO.

<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2014,9/30/2014,19,70,6,8,5>All of the new hipster bs restaurants in Evanston should beware. Peckish Pig is the best of the lot.  The atmosphere, staff and clientele are a lot more diverse and authentic. This IS Evanston after all. Not Winnetka. Drinks are reasonably priced, The staff is awesome, and the patio is cute as can be. The food is good but I would love if it were dumbed down just a little.  For example the burger has goat cheese and the ketchup is not Heinz. Why?  Evanston needs a restaurant with delicious simple food. But that's just me.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,9/29/2014,1,27,2,3,4>This is our third time. Omg. It was a fantastic meal. Started with a wonderful pea soup w croutons. Soup was just the right consistency...not too watery nor too thick. Croutons very tasty. Shared the mussels with Len. We both agreed they were terrific. Next I had short ribs. Made over 4-5 hours on a lovely bouquet of vegetables. Fabulous sauce over horseradish potatoes. Heaven. Finally we shared a berry crumble with ice cream and whipped cream. Superb meal. Highly recommend this place.

This time I came in excited due to the fact that my job (personal chef) very rarely allows me to have my nails done, let alone long nails at that. Since I have some free time I took full advantage of my time! I came in asking for a Gel Full Set, I'm also a Halloween fanatic and wanted something ghoulish. The woman who did my nails was more than willing do the design. At the end she even asked if i would like sparkles, which of course I said YES to! My nails came our beautiful. I love them, they are so cute.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2014,9/27/2014,2,20,2,4,3>As an avid lover of coffee stores and good coffee, I was frustrated with my lack of options for the longest time. Anyone living in Lake Bluff knows that you can get either Starbucks coffee or coffee from a restaurant that just makes a large pot of it for the masses. I just walked into Prairie for the first time today (having completely forgot about it initially) and was pleasantly surprised. It's a small joint, but the Americano I am currently sipping is better than anything I've had within a 15 mile radius. So coffee lovers of the North Shore rejoice! Come in and support the store. Hopefully this hidden gem will make it through the winter with your help.

They have a bakery and excellent baked goods (bagels=yum) too, and you can even order a giant sandwich, (The New Jersey Bypass is not for the faint of heart), and eat it there with a giant Dill pickle, chips, a cookie, and a drink. They have lox cream cheese in the fridge and smoked lox at the counter. They're super-popular with the locals, so don't expect to find easy parking, though the new building does help with that a bit.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2014,9/24/2014,4,15,1,6,4>I love this gem of a bookstore, which is tucked in an alley in downtown Evanston. They sell used and new books, as well and some jewelry. I've heard that they're known for their cooking books. But for me, the real treasure is the children's section. It's curated well, with a fantastic selection of beautiful books I haven't seen elsewhere. They also have children's books in several languages and in translation. Plus, a cute reading spot with little rockers, etc. The people who own the store are very welcoming and helpful. They also gift wrap books.

We also got the milk and honey salad, which was good, but if we had to drop one menu item this is the one we'd have chosen, and we got the smoked tofu wrap which was AMAZING.  They smoke the tofu in-house and it was seriously like nothing I've ever had before.  I was blown away with how amazing everything was.I will definitely be back to found.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2013,9/22/2014,0,5,3,2,1>This was my first visit to VV, and as I always do when I enter a record store I told the clerk this was my first visit. If a store is decent, they'll give me a tour of their inventory. If they aren't, they'll ignore me or worse. I'm glad to say I was given the full tour and at first had no idea it was the owner of the place. He was very nice and his explanation of the store's layout was informative. He only got a little prickly when I asked him about the grading system, telling me all of the records on the first floor were mint or excellent, but that's fine as it made things easier. I can't think of any other store set up this way.Entering this classic record store is like being invited to the home of an audiophile who's been collecting for 30 years and allowed to browse his most cherished records. Where other stores keep "the good stuff" behind the counter or locked in a glass cabinet, VV has it all out for display where I could handle as many as I liked. It was great seeing in person scarce records I'd only heard about, getting to check out the condition first hand and read the back panels. Nearly every record on the first floor has an informative, hand-written note about which version it is and why it's rare. Yes, there are are some high priced records here, but there were also plenty in the average price range too. The store is about equally divided between the collector's records upstairs and the "bargain bin" downstairs where records are uniformly priced at $4 each or three for $10. I purchased three classic LPs by the Eagles downstairs for ten bucks, albums I'd seen priced much higher at other record stores.Upstairs, I splurged a little and bought a bootleg I'd been after for a while. The price was about what I'd seen online, it wasn't a bargain, but there was no shipping and no risk, I didn't have to worry about grading or rip-offs. And I guess that's the bottom line. In one hour I got to browse a selection of scarce and rare records it would've take months or more to find elsewhere. I could handle them personally without someone breathing over my shoulder. There was no risk, no bidding, no shipping cost and no damage from the Post Office. Within twenty minutes, I was home experiencing the instant gratification of finding a great LP and listening to it right away. I hope VV is around another 30 years and I think we should support our local record stores. Worth every penny!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2014,9/21/2014,98,320,2,7,3>My wife and I stopped in here this weekend to check out the scene. We had already eaten somewhere else, so we didn't get to sample the menu (which looked really amazing). However, we did try a few beers and cocktails. The staff is really well trained and they know their beer and cocktails quite well. We had a few conversations with a couple of the bartenders and staff that were quite educational for us. One thing we did notice was that the lighting seemed a bit too bright for this type of establishment. It seems like they are burning 100 watt bulbs in a place where 60 would be more than enough. Regardless, the menu looked very enticing and we vowed to return in order to try it.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2014,9/20/2014,32,156,2,6,6>This is such a great, tiny, classic grubby diner. It is REALLY grubby, but I find that to be half the charm. The menu is on the wall and like, maybe 2 paper menus, our waitress managed to procure some for us but then took them away, but you don't even need the menu. Just like, any combination of egg/bread/meat, and they will make it. I had a veggie omelet and hashbrowns well done, plus toast. So good! I mean, nothing too creative, but i think we can all agree we secretly prefer nice and simple to fancy and creative, right? Also, they give you a full pot of coffee that they just leave on the table, so you will be well-caffeinated.The only complaint I have, literally just one!, is that they are not open sundays. Sundas are the day on earth I need such a place the most!
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2014,9/19/2014,108,103,1,6,3>This is a cozy little Thai place right next to Trader Joe's with a corner window area in the plaza.I came here with my family on a Saturday afternoon for lunch just a little after they opened (doors open at noon).It was a neat little restaurant, very clean with glossy wooden tables. We were seated in a booth by the windows and their service was friendly and quick.Between three people we ordered 3 dishes and two drinks: Thai iced tea and iced coffee, Curry fried rice, Pad Thai and Rama Broccoli. You will also get iced water infused with lemon, which is a plus!There was plenty of food and we had enough to take home for leftovers. The Thai iced coffee and the Thai iced tea WILL be very sweet. I believe that's how it's supposed to be, and most Thai cuisine is too... but just a fair warning!I enjoyed a relaxing lunch here, and they have a wine for dinner as well. For their Rama Broccoli with Tofu, their peanut sauce was also on the sweeter side (as opposed to peanutty). But Rama Broccoli is my go-to dish and I was pretty happy with it! Great service with decent portions, and a good option to grab some grub while running errands.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2014,9/18/2014,132,200,1,4,5>Officially the best (and cheapest) bubble tea in Evanston - hurray! I was so excited for this place to finally open, and now it has and I've gone twice in the last week. I had the mango smoothie, and I only had it with half sugar, but it was still incredibly sweet - definitely getting even less sugar next time. And I'll be back for the passion fruit smoothie - I love passion fruit and I can never get enough of that. Overall, great location, relatively quick service, and great prices means I'll definitely be coming here again and again.
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,9/17/2014,1,14,1,4,4>The staff are friendly and prompt, and they were able to call in another massage therapist so we could go for couples' massages! They do not have one room for both, but it was great nonetheless. I've had Swedish and deep tissue massages here, and each one has been amazing! They know how to feel and recognize trouble spots, and how to work them... I leave feeling like I'm on a cloud. The last time I was there it seems they now have spa pedicure seats... I may have to go again!
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,9/16/2014,25,52,,3,4>The first time I had Piron's chocolate was at a gala for charity back in 2000.  I couldn't believe I'd been by the shop dozens of time and never noticed it.  Since then, it's become my go-to place when I'm in need of a high-quality gift of chocolate.I would pick up bars of their high cacao dark chocolate for my nephew on occasion, some truffles or toffee for a girlfriend.  On my visit of February 28, 2014, I discovered their hot chocolate.  I purchased my first electric guitar down the street at Guitar Works up the street, and found my sales guy there so laid-back and helpful that I also picked him up a thank you, some chocolate covered raspberry animal shapes.What they have is beautiful, not just flavorful.  Hard to say to chocolate that looks to be a piece of art.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2014,9/15/2014,60,245,,3,3>A recent expansion has made this a great place for outdoor dining. There is now plenty of seating indoors as well where it could be nearly impossible to get a table for a burger in the past.Good bar food and some specials. Cold beer and friendly servers. They now host private parties in a new area above the restaurant. The new back bar hosts live music on weekends. I miss the outdoor seating at the old Glenview House but this place is making me get over it. They also have a little 'living room' that's a cool touch with a fireplace and big leather sofa's. The only complaint is the tiny bathrooms.This is quickly becoming my burger/tavern joint due to one of my favorites 'Hackneys' pricing themselves out of my market. But I'll save that for their review.
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,9/14/2014,5,29,2,4,5>Whether for breakfast or lunch, the food here is fantastic.  Eggs benedict and bagels and lox are always good for breakfast and the pastrami, corn beef, and chopped liver sandwiches here make for a great lunch.  The sandwiches are significant and can often make for a couple of meals.  The bread is delicious here too and it is hard to leave without taking a couple of desserts home for later.  Friendly and helpful staff as well.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2014,9/13/2014,34,166,3,4,4>Bobby to the rescue! Delivery or take out this is a great pie. There is a few places to sit for a slice but it is set up for take out. I know that the pizza is always a hit with the kids and the wings are meaty and the perfect amount of spice. Beyond the food is Bobby he is a very nice guy, like shirt off his back nice.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2014,9/12/2014,220,174,3,6,6>Back in school my college classmate always had butter chicken cooked in the basement kitchen of her mom's house. We found ourselves getting through our college days sustained on this butter chicken and basmati rice. Looking for the same tastes of this home cooking has been hard to find and I am always on the lookout for a substantial butter chicken replacement. The drive by this busy intersection does not allow one to take in the store front signs for this restaurant. Unless one was stopped by the Shell for gasoline, then the store front sign would be visible. Tucked into the corner and adjacent to the gas station, what was once the previous spot for Krispy Krunchy Chicken, now stands a new Skokie eatery.Recommended by the local eyebrow threader in neighboring Morton Grove, who claims "very good food," I decided to try out the place. Anticipating the wonders of Indian/Pakistani cuisine I arrived on a Monday. This day was not to be the day to try out the food as they are closed on Mondays. A couple weeks later, with a cloudy outlook and drizzly rain outside, I found myself on a Thursday afternoon, at the doorstep. Only one other customer was awaiting their order when I stepped into the main entrance. The doors open up to the take out only counter and next door grocery.  After ordering, I was asked to wait five minutes. Whiling away the time, I perused the rows of Indian/Pak grocery goods and spices along the aisles and the refrigerated and frozen pre packaged foods along the back wall.An order of Butter Chicken with 2 tandoori Naan $6.99Tandoori Chicken in Paratha $3.49/each2 Samosa $1.25/eachadded up to $14 plus change.Butter chicken on presentation might not be great to look at since the oil from the sauce made it's appearance settling on the top of the dish and seeped out of the container into the bag. Not a problem after first bite, the melding of all the spices with the tender chicken made for good eats, but the heat was probably toned down to satisfy the masses. The tandoori chicken paratha was very tasty and the chicken was moist and tender. I was impressed over the onions layered throughout the wrap. The heat was just slight. Can not say about the samosa because we were just too full to eat another bite. I still have leftovers from the chicken. A couple mehs were the naan bread became too chewy at the ends wrapped in the foil and the oil from the butter chicken maybe even a little more heat to the prepared dishes. Many drink choices and dessert options.Minimum of $3.50 for credit card use.I am adding this place to my list of food options around town. Enjoy!
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,9/11/2014,57,93,1,4,4>The best Thai restaurant in the area! I have been here a couple times and have enjoyed my food each time.  The food is very delicious and the staff is very friendly.  I used to think thai food was the same everywhere but I have had some BAD thai food.  This place doesn't skimp on portions and the dishes are not drowning in grease. There are lots of thai restaurants in the area but I come here (even though I pass up about 3 other thai places) to get my thai food cravings. Highly recommended!
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2014,9/10/2014,94,254,2,5,6>My kids have all grown up with Nemo's since they all went to New Trier in what seems like many moons ago, but I tried it myself for the first time and really enjoyed the turkey with cheese sandwich. It was really tasty with the CSS (Captain's Special Sauce) which is not too sweet or sour, but just right! They use real turkey breast and you can taste the difference. Have the sandwich toasted...umm yummy.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2014,9/9/2014,14,122,1,4,5>I'm glad we followed my wife's suggestion to have a late Saturday dinner here.Froggy's is truly a Highwood  institution.  At one point, I had the feeling that it was resting on its laurels and slowly slipping into restaurant  boredom.  It now feels like the fresh next generation of the institution.There are two rooms for meals--the main dining room and a bar indoor garden area.  Late nighters are seated in the bar area.  The bar area is fresher than before (the irritating heater noise is gone).I think my wife suggested the restaurant being in the mood for duck.  This entree is of the old tradition--it came perfectly done, subtle sauce.  The waiter picked up on my wife's inquiries about gluten free  bread (they do not have it) and made sure of the order being to her satisfaction. I had French Onion soup and veal with mushrooms.  The soup had croutons instead of a slice of bread.  The melding of cheese, croutons and onions with a rich broth was excellent.I munched on the non-gluten free bread--it was crusty, chewy and tasty.The veal special hit its mark as well.  Mushrooms with a rich sauce added to the depth of tastes,Our waiter was very young, not one of the familiar regulars.  A suitable image for the 'new' institution--he was attentive and friendly, making sure of our desires and gently suggesting that the kitchen would be closing shortly (at 10).But I have to get a better understanding of their wine by a glass or they have to rethink what is being served.  The Bordeaux I had was trying to get caught up to the excellent meal that was served and not quite getting there.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2014,9/8/2014,52,54,1,10,7>So incredibly thankful for these guys and the magic that they do.I was in need of a last minute cake and called to see if they had any that was ready for pickup. They informed me that they usually don't have them but can make a cake within a couple of hours if needed. I agreed and ordered an 8.5'' mocha chiffon cake that was all ready for me to pickup within 3 hours.And oh, what a cake. Incredibly moist, fluffy texture, and immaculate looking on top of that. I'm here wishing I still had leftovers as I write this review. They added my personalized message on the cake (ps: "bosing" = boss and it was for my dad who's the biggest boss of them all) and were extremely friendly when I came and picked it up. They've been around for 5 years now and I can't believe I've waited this long despite the fact that it's a 2 min drive away. Will surely be back here for more. Need a cake? Craving some cupcakes? Want a quick cup of coffee? Le Sucre's definitely worth checking out.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,9/7/2014,38,121,2,9,8>I'm a self-proclaimed health freak, so imagine how excited I was to find out that LYFE Kitchen opened in Evanston! In fact, to show my diehard support, I came here three times in one week. I got lucky once and even met Jeremy Bringardener, one of the Food Network's "Chopped" champions! Awesome. As a vegetarian, I was delighted that they had separate menus for those with dietary restrictions (i.e. vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free). Having multiple options for once made my life slightly more difficult, but it's not the most terrible problem to have in the world. Here are must-try's:1. quinoa crunch wrap coupled with hot sauce 2. kale banana smoothie 3. flatbread with roasted mushroom and goat cheese 4. baked sweet potato fries5. chocolate & banana budino6. FREE chilled sparkling water  Overall, this is a great addition for healthy dining options in Evanston. Fellow health freaks will rejoice!
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/28/2014,9/6/2014,3,19,1,3,4>There is nowhere in Chicagoland that is would rather eat than in the terrace overlooking the golf course on a lovely summer evening. The food is amazing and the staff is always so helpful and accommodating. The facilities are beautiful. The pool area needs a bit of updating, but I believe that is slated for 2016. They really go above and beyond for the events. Fantastic place.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2014,9/5/2014,14,9,1,3,3>This is a third place for my husband and I. They have happy hour deals throughout the week, and they have a good variety on the prices. You can pay more for a really good burger, but they also have a retro menu with selections under $6 ea. The grilled ham and cheese is my fave for a quick Saturday  lunch along with an Original Sin pear cider.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2014,9/4/2014,7,7,2,5,3>Tom at Presidential Roofing is the only contractor out of 5 companies that paid attention to my requests and provided an itemized estimate for everything that I needed. Tom was also the only contractor who followed up with me after the estimate to let me know that it had been performed and to contact him with any concerns. We received an honest estimate with explanations and clear acknowledgement of expectations for possible additional costs.The work was completed within the given time frame. We received a beautiful new roof, skylight, gutters, downspouts, additional proper venting, flashing and aluminum fascia/soffits. Professional quality and professional installation. All of this and an affordable price.My old gutters had Gutter Stuff filters installed. I forgot to mention this and was worried it would be discarded with the old gutters. I was happy to see that my gutter filters were saved and put aside. Greatly appreciated. I went onto the roof to inspect and to put my gutter filters back in and was very happy with the worked performed. Great work and installed with care. The gutters felt strong enough to hang from, but I wouldn't recommend trying! I also appreciated the 3"x4" size downspouts. My neighbors downspouts now look inadequate.My home and property was clean and free of any debris. Previously I had used tar for do-it-yourself repairs and got in on siding where my roof meets that siding. They went above and beyond by cleaning up that old tar where the new roof was being installed. It was not expected and again greatly appreciated.Our home is no longer an eye sore. I highly recommend Presidential Roofing.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2014,9/3/2014,6,16,1,4,3>Overall an awesome dining experience. We really enjoyed the location (near some beautiful homes and cool shops). Also appreciated the outdoor seating! We were seated and served promptly.I ordered a caipirinha and my date had the white sangria - and both were mixed excellently. I ordered the lentil salad, which came on a bed of spinach lightly drizzled w balsamic vinaigrette. My date ordered the Thai peanut noodles. Both were full of flavor and didn't sit heavy on us at all! The most pleasant surprise was the speed with which we got our food after ordering.Lastly we took advantage of the yelp coupon and ordered dessert. Our mixed berry cobbler was decent but dry, and needed some local vanilla ice cream to complete it. Friendly, fast service, good drinks and great food. We WILL be back.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,9/2/2014,33,15,3,4,4>Cozy  is super cute! My theory is that a vintage collector procured so many neat items that he had no more room for, that he decided to open up a whole establishment to display his treasures. Traditional, feel-good noodle dishes as well as interesting original creations are presented just as artistically as the restaurant. The taste is also excellent, and the waiters are open and friendly. Charming and unique, yet nostalgic and homey. Great place to go with friends.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,9/1/2014,130,318,2,3,5>Any event thrown at Everts Park in Highwood is more than likely going to get a minimum of 4 stars from me. I LOVE this park, complete with circular walking path with complete access to all the food trucks and other vendors that line the outside. Throw a gazebo in the middle of it all with live music and a few good friends and it's hard not to have a great time. My sister invited me up here last night after work b/c she's good friends with Sarah from the Fat Shallot food truck. I quickly took her up on the invite b/c the truffle fries from the Shallot are simply the BEST I've ever had from anywhere, including any brick and mortar restaurant. Seriously, they must have some magical machine in that food truck that just churns out amazingness!! Well this time they had spicy sesame fries as well, and wouldn't ya know it we had to order those as well as the truffle fries. We also split a buffalo chicken sandwich that was tasty as well. I'm still going to say that the salami sandwich is my favorite sammy I've had from them, although Sarah explained that you can add ANYTHING to the grilled cheese they make, including salami so that sounds like a winner in my book. We walked around, sipped on a couple beers from Revolution Brewery and enjoyed the market as much as possible until the weather got just a bit too chilly for us to stay. While I noticed attendance was a bit low probably due to the weather, Highwood put on a better event on a Wednesday night than my hometown of Northbrook did with the St. Norberts block party last Saturday night. Our block party here in town had great music, but that's about where the comparison ends b/c Highwood just seems to have excellent local restaurants that are always willing to participate in events such as the evening market. They also attracted some excellent trucks last night, Fat Shallot, Toasty Cheese, Grillers, etc. You've done it again, Highwood. I can't wait to come back for the craft beer fest, inferno fest or any other fest they decide to host here in Evert Park!!!

She listens to exactly what you want and will give her opinion if asked. I always love hearing her thoughts on what I should get done. I never have to worry about her cutting more than I asked or doing something without asking. Her prices are reasonable as well! You should definitely check it out!

<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/18/2014,8/29/2014,13,122,2,3,4>I've got a nicer bike than I used to, and I ride it a lot more. I managed to break my chain not long ago, also taking out my rear derailleur. They fixed me up nicely, also re-truing the wheel, and I didn't feel scalped at the end. I was without my bike for a few more days than I would have liked, but they completed the repair in the time frame they estimated in person (over the phone they suggested they might be able to get parts overnighted, which made me think the repair would be faster), and the bike felt perfectly dialed in when I got it back. I'd use them for service or perhaps a tune-up again.They also get points for having an outside air hose available during business hours.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,8/28/2014,35,244,1,4,4>Most people walking in to see a seamstress are there about a pair of khakis, get a suite or dress altered. I took in a pair of motorcycle over-pants. She didn't pause for a second or throw me out... I like that! Everything looked great when I picked them up and for the amount of work being done, I felt like it was too cheap. I may have to go back and pay her some more, seriously. I love service with a smile and I got that from all their employees. Just doesn't happen as often anymore. So next time I need "normal" clothes done, I'm headed back to Sewing Masters!
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/22/2014,8/27/2014,58,347,1,3,3>Good surburb sushi! I was definitely impressed.This will definitely be on my mind when I want sushi (though I don't think they deliver or use grubhub unfortunately)... Here's why:1. Fresh fish... what a concept. Not sure why so many places skimp on this. Lack of competition? A clientele that can't tell the difference? Eh.2. Parking! Not so much a suburb issue, but seriously... having to settle for crappy sushi vs dealing with city traffic... I like a place that avoids both.3. Fast service - I placed an order after I walked in because I had questions, and the sushi was ready in minutes. With a hot kitchen app, the whole order took around 5 minutes!4. Generous portions - The prices on the menu might look steep, but having put up with Chicago prices, you will be very happy with the amount of fish. $15 for a specialty roll might seem high, but it's like twice the diameter of an 8-pc roll from a city joint... plus fish wrapped all the way around the large circumference. You do the math.The menage a trois was very good. Interesting flavor and textures without hiding the fish entirely. You'll also find the same generous portions of fish in the spicy tuna salad! I'd skip the Golden Scallop - way too heavy and greasy after 2 bites and you can't even taste the scallop.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2014,8/26/2014,54,205,1,4,4>Alright...this place is awesome! Can't even begin to explain how nice the staff is and the froyo is amazing. I love how close this place is to our house, we walk there quite often and hope more people check this place out. They change the flavors once a week so it's always different, which I love! It's great for kids too. The have dry erase tables with neon markers...fun for all ages :)Go people, GO!!!
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2014,8/25/2014,88,154,1,4,5>Came here for their $9 lunch special and left happy and full! We both got 2 meats and 1 veggie, which comes out on a huge plate with a side of 4 breads. You can share for a sharing fee of $2 but I don't think that would be enough food for two. We finished everything! Our favorite was the beef stew- mild. The ethiopian coffee was also delicious, and is 2.50 with unlimited refills. Service was great and quick. We were the only ones here (it was 3pm) and she was very friendly and fast. We ordered, got our food, ate, and paid all in 30 minutes. Definitely give it a try if you are around for lunch. The lunch special runs from 12-4:30, which is much later than the neighboring reataurants!
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,8/24/2014,56,146,3,8,7>The only thing bad about this place are the hours- from 12-4- because if I could have it my way- I would want this place to be open for longer periods of time! (Esp because I work during the week and would not be able to make it!)I can understand the limited hours- this place is run by volunteers! Really fun volunteers with cool stories and an appreciation for "great finds".Today I stopped by after I had spent the morning downtown with 30 minutes before the store closed. I had two "great finds"! One 100% silk Ann Taylor skirt that was a size too small (my mom altered it so now it's perfect!) and a vintage Lion Head Anne Klein belt! What was amazing was that the skirt looked brand new (silk would have wrinkles if it was worn) and the belt looked like new as well! The best thing is that my total came to be $5.00, and the entire purchase benefits Shore Community Services, an organization that assists children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The store is clean, the staff member I met was friendly, and they have everything from books and toys to purses and wedding dresses! Wonderful store and I like how things are very well organized and I truly commend whoever runs it! Great job!Notes:-credit card can be used for purchases over $10.00-street parking is free and there are ample spaces right outside the store!
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2014,8/23/2014,49,140,1,5,3>I really like this place! I came here the first time due the grand opening coupon I received in the mail, and had such a positive experience I returned about a week later.This is an extremely clean salon (something I consider super important given the tools they use and the potential for infection). The staff is pretty friendly, although I found my first technician to be friendlier, and speak English more fluently, than the second technician.I loved the pedicure I got here- because if the coupon, I upgraded to a pedicure with a 15 massage, and had no regrets. Unlike other places, they actually set a timer for the massage, so you know you're getting the full service. My technician was also super nice about the water temperature- some places make the water way too cold! She even offered to add hot water partway through, since she could feel it getting tepid. My second visit was for a gel manicure. They have a really extensive selection of gel colors (and multiple brands!), which I really appreciate. It was a detailed manicure- my one complaint is that the technician bumped my hand and smudged the polish, and I had to ask specifically for him to fix it. Small quibble, and I will return!
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2014,8/22/2014,163,595,4,6,5>I have found my go to place for fresh Seafood in the north shore.  This place is great.  The wife and I came here over the weekend for lunch.  And we feasted for what came out to about $45 before tip.The oysters are your standard blue points.  They are nice and big.  I honestly would not get these again because at $9 for a half dozen its a little steep for blue points.  But fresh and flavorful either plane or with the mango salsa they provide.Next was the ceviche tostadas.  The order came with two.  And they did not skimp on the ceviche.  Each tostada was drowning in a pile of ceviche made from what I believe was salmon and potentially some other fish.  The lime and onions may be overpowering for some, but I had no complaints.Now its time for the drunken shrimp.  I was thinking it would be more along the Chinese version where the shrimp are stunned in baijiu, but I was wrong.  It was some sort of dish that had a cream based sauce and I'd have to guess some booze to make them 'drunk'.  I really have no clue what it was but damn I want more.So now we're onto our main and we shared a lobster roll.  Fresh, light flavors, refreshing, and LOBSTER.  It was loaded with meat, celery, and spices.  This with a side of hush puppies are you're good to go.We finished with their coffee.  Now most of the time I wouldn't mention a drip coffee. But this was a Mexican style coffee that was already spiced with cinnamon and was perfectly sweetened.I will come back here fairly often.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2014,8/21/2014,78,54,1,4,3>My boyfriend and I went here last minute around 7 o'clock and we got sat right away. We had a nice little table right by the window. They started us off with some complimentary fried plantains and chimichurri, it was a great start and a nice change to bread and butter. Then we got a crab cake appetizer and it was phenomenal. It had a papaya slaw on top and the flavors blended nicely. Tasted like fresh crab. For our entree we asked the server what his favorite was and he surprised us with a mushroom stuffed skirt steak which was amazing. I don't normally enjoy steak but this was exceptional. Really high quality with a nice crust and great flavors. Our server was very attentive and kept asking us how everything was progressing and if there was anything he could get for us. This was really nice opposed to a lot of waiters now a days not really seeming like they care. Overall it was a really great experience and i definitely will be returning.

The space is very open and relaxing with fresh produce on display, a refrigerated section with cold pressed juices ( there was a special today for $2 carrot/ginger) try this amazing dessert made of chia seeds, coconut milk, shredded coconut and berries,) and some baked goods in the front. There's a huge array of drinks from cold pressed, freshly made to order juices or smoothies, some desserts and other healthy treats which is a great alternative to the overly sweet and processed foods out there. I tried the 'strawberry fields' smoothie with strawberry/blueberry/peach/kale/coconut milk and it was not too sweet and was filling. For the fresh smoothies you can opt for a choice of soy/almond/or coconut milk or coconut water.On my first visit, I tried 'one love' which is freshly made to order with apple , lime, mint, and kale. I really loved this drink and will get it again..also tried a sample of 'let it go' smoothie which is essentially like a chocolate milkshake...so yummy!There's a huge variety of drinks to choose from which can appease the pickiest of eaters. Additionally, the owners are so nice and I'm happy to see them so active within the community at various events. Congrats on your opening and I'm looking forward to making my way through the menu!
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,8/19/2014,26,129,2,8,3>Another Friday visit to The Curragh.   Was supposed to be the boys and I, but the ladies wanted in too.   We called ahead and they were able to accommodate the 11 of us.   The restaurant was jumping.   Very busy.   The experience was really A++.   Supurb night.  With this many people, I got to see a lot of different food choices.   Everyone liked what they ordered.   The appitizers consisted of (kids) cheese sticks.   Wow did they look good.  Freshly made.   Authentic.    The corned beef rolls looked fantastic too.   The chicken nachos... wow..... to bad it was Friday in lent, so I chose to NOT enjoy the super looking appitizers.    It didn't really matter, because with 8 kids....there wasn't much left.I got the fish n'chips.   Wow.... AWSOME tasting dinner.  The fish, the tarter sauce, the (steak) fries.   Perfection, filling, one of the best.  Cooked perfectly....  We didn't take much home.  The desert consisted of the brownie with scoop of ice cream.   Luckily the Waiter told us about the size.   We split hit his desert between 3 people.  It was still too much.   Great brownie.Ok... In a nutshell.   The food was great.   The service rocked (thanks Colin). The band was a perfect touch....  Welcome to the neighborhood Curragh.... Really glad you settled here.   I will see you again soon.
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,8/18/2014,11,26,,3,2>I had a great experience for my first visit here. Came in today with my mom and I was feeling a bit under the weather. I always crave spicy thai soup whenever I'm not feeling well & I decided to check out Simply Thai and their Tom Kha soup. When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee at the counter who was very welcoming and answered any questions we had. (I only ordered the Tom Kha soup with tofu- so that's what I'm basing my review off of until I visit again and try more of their menu items)The soup was freshly made, super hot(temp) and LOADED with tofu & mushrooms. It was excellent! The broth was seasoned very nicely & had a little kick of spicy heat. It was prepared swiftly & the employee at the counter handed it to me and told me to feel better. Very sweet. I look forward to going back to try more of their dishes & try one of their many smoothie flavors.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2014,8/17/2014,18,149,2,4,3>My husband and I had lunch here for the first time about two weeks ago. We were both very happy with the experience and will definitely go back. The space is bright, open, clean and nicely decorated.We had a salad and a sandwich, and both were fresh, flavorful, nicely portioned, and well-presented.Our service was excellent.Prices are spot-on for the experience.
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2014,8/16/2014,206,413,6,7,6>Hoosier Mama devours my soul, and probably my organs if I give it enough time as well.I have to say that it not only amuses me how much Tanya V loves the place but that I even run into her when I go over there myself. Listen to her review on the place - because she knows what's up.Not only do they make amazing pies which range from sweet to savory, but they make sandwiches, salads, etc. So don't think of this like a Baker's Square that you only go to pick up a pie, think of it like Farmhouse but also with pies.  You do have the coconut cream, banana cream, chess pie, and also savory curried pies. The variety is pretty good, and that's not even getting to the awesome veggie sandwiches.Agreeing with Tanya - seating is nice, staff are friendly, and the place basically has nothing but excellent food.  They also have a two person bathroom (not a stall), which is....odd. I have no words to describe it. This happens to be a great place to escape a rainstorm, which has occurred 2 out of the 3 times I've gone to Hoosier as well.There is one word of warning though - if you come in at the wrong time, expect there to be a line - because there is almost always a line during busy hour and you may be waiting some time for your food/drink/etc. All in all, everyone should come here once - and then pray you don't get addicted, because it seems quite easy to do so.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2014,8/15/2014,19,10,5,6,5>Quirky decor. Interesting food. Where else do you get lamb sausage quesadillas with garbanzo beans with rice and lentils for breakfast?
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,8/14/2014,32,212,1,7,3>I tried the beginner bikram yoga class, which was 90 minutes of atypical yoga in a room that's set to 105 F and 40% humidity. Why "atypical?" You won't find sun salutations and vinyasas ("typical" yoga) in bikram, rather you'll spend about half your time doing difficult standing poses (e.g. dancer's pose) and half your time doing sitting poses (e.g. camel).Although I've done yoga for a while and am a fit and active person, I found that class to be extremely draining, perhaps one of the most difficult exercises I've attempted. A number of other first-timers only managed a handful of poses before resorting to merely sitting on their mat. The instructor assured them that for many people the first class is spent simply sitting in the heated room for the full length of class.Speaking of the instructor, Holly was wonderful. She gave clear instructions, encouraged participants by name (even though she had only met many of us briefly), gently corrected mistakes, and explained the purpose and benefits of various poses. In general I appreciated that she didn't indulge in idle chatter; the periods of silence were complete and purposeful.After class, some of the regular members approached me to chat. They were all friendly, supportive, strong believers in the benefits of bikram, and clearly dedicated  to this studio. I think these people reflect very well on this business. Additionally, the studio was modern, neat, and clean, and there's a private lot for easy parking.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2014,8/13/2014,8,16,5,3,3>Alchemy Coffee House are very serious about their coffee - or at least they appear to be ... because it takes a full 5 minutes of labor, pipes; steam; thermometers; widgets; stirring and sweat before my extra-shot 'for here' latte to be completed. I almost felt I should hold it high above my head and shout some Kenyan / Zulu Lion King thing before sipping the fine brew in awe and wonder! The place is not impressive to look at ... in fact ... pretty darn dumpy ... but that is its charm. It has a cheap wooden counter, an old second hand refrigerated (I think) display case for some dodgy (but expensive) pastries / scones and then the two pieces of magic that clearly help to explain the joint's name :: Alchemy Coffee House ...  In the back room is a wooden pallet containing a few random bags of raw coffee beans some half torn open and then ... the sexiest green coffee roasting monster machine you've ever set your fortunate green eyes on!! WowZa. But the potions we pay for are via the coffee brewing machine (I lack the correct knowledge to attribute its correct name) which is a wonder of stainless steel pipes, knobs and funnels; fussy, high maintenance and perhaps a bugger to clean ... this machine is majestic! I'd buy it diamond from Tiffany if I owned it! (Alas!)The kid behind the counter (literally a kid!) -- Merlin's Apprentice (?) -- knows what he's doing and 5 minutes of wand waving // a flurry of hands turning and twisting and shrugging (?) et voila ... The result is divine coffee! And sitting outside on a Sunday morning drinking and enjoying what the Catholic Church once called "The Devil's Drink" is hilarious because my poor wife and kids are suffering Sunday Mass at SFX just up the road. Ha. The Irony!
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/16/2014,8/12/2014,29,219,6,7,7>Tasty Mediterranean food and surprisingly great pizza. Very family friendly and good service. The waitstaff ( all family??) tried to please and accomodate.Meals come with soup and the chicken kabob was juicy and flavorful. Babagsnoush was fantastic and my kids loved the pizza.My only complaint is that my Sauvignon blanc was too warm, but I did what any other tired mom of toddlers does-- stuck an ice cube ( I know, I know) in it and drank up. Its a great place to take the kids and we will certainly be back soon.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,8/11/2014,5,52,5,7,3>Here is the lesson you learn when you shop at Jerry's: buy meat from a butcher, not at the supermarket. Need a 14-pound brisket? Yup, they have it and they will put it aside and wait for you to arrive before they close for the night.It is that simple. Fair prices, GREAT service and very high quality product. They also carry various sauces, soups, frozen items as well as farm eggs and plenty of time-tested advice. There are three top-notch butchers on the north shore and Jerry's is squarely among them.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,8/10/2014,90,224,2,10,5>I'm really rating my instructor, not the school as much since I haven't needed to interact with the school since starting lessons, but that's a plus too, so... Five stars!!!I contacted the school a while ago to learn more about their piano lessons for adults, and the owner responded quickly that they had opportunities and instructors available for about $30 for 30 minutes lessons. I went in for a test lesson to see where my skills were and if their recommended instructor was a match, and he was!Nate Raskin is my instructor and he is fantastic. He's young, but already has the patience and instinct to guide his student in exactly the right way. He is super talented, but doesn't have an ego about it, and he's extremely aware of strengths and weaknesses, and how to work with them right away.I seem to be the only adult student around during my lesson times right now, but I couldn't be happier with my choice to take piano here and would highly recommend the school. Their online sign up and payment process is a little clunky, but they're aware of it and are very easy to work with. Their pianos are fine and the lesson rooms are a-ok. Love it here and wouldn't go anywhere else!
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,8/9/2014,362,467,4,10,5>There are restaurants that pretend to care about their customers, and restaurants that really put an effort to reach out to them. Farmhouse definitely earns a spot in the latter. After my less than stellar experience with brunch, the manager reached out to me and invited me back to dinner. I went with a friend and I had a great experience. I ordered the Wisconsin ivory char and it was fantastic. The char itself had a wonderful flavor and the fish very juicy. I usually leave the skin, but it had such a rich flavor that I ended up eating that as well. My friend had the elk medallions, which he enjoyed. For dessert, we ordered the pecan walnut pie and the chocolate bread pudding. Both were great! The chocolate bread pudding was warm, rich and chocolatey without being overly sweet. Our server was courteous and friendly. Service was a bit slow at times but that gave us time to relax and enjoy our meal. Would definitely recommend this place for a date night, celebratory dinner, etc. Will be back!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/14/2014,8/8/2014,23,321,2,7,4>Well, we came here and I had done my research and was all set to order the coq au vin until the husband asked the waiter what he would recommend off the savory menu.  The waiter listed almost all he crepes except the coq au vin, so I switched.  I ordered the Cassoulet Toulousain, duck confit, house made garlic sausage, stewed flageolet beans, carrots, celery, bacon lardons.  This was warm savory and delicious.  Flavors were layered upon each other but as good as this was, the husband's Bourguignon, Beef chuck & shin braised in red burgund wine, pearl onions, carrots, mushroom caps, bacon lardons was even better!  This crave-able crepe will bring me back again and again!  It was rich in flavor, melt in your mouth and cooked to perfection!  For dessert we split the Marquis, Chocolate crepe, dark chocolate mousse, glazed mix berries, white chocolate sauce.  I went with this because hubby wanted to.  I would have rather had one of the fruit choices.  But given everything, if I had been in the mood for chocolate it would have been perfect!  The chocolate mousse filling was creamy and delicious.  Also, they didn't skimp on the filling.  Yummy!Service was great too!  Attentive but not overly so.  We also enjoyed the quaint atmosphere.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,8/7/2014,34,75,6,9,7>The lunch specials here cannot be beaten on their quality to price ratio. You get tea, soup, and a giant plate/bowl of food for under $10. Unlike most sit-down places on Noyes, this one is super quick, so you don't need to block off a whole hour for lunch if you don't want to. Also, unlike most sit-down places in general, it feels completely acceptable to come here by yourself. I have never had to wait to be seated at Mandarin House, even in the middle of the lunch rush and even when I've come with a large group of people. I can't really explain this because this place is really popular, but somehow they make it work (probably the super fast service). I always get the beef bibimbap with hot and sour soup, and I stand by that combination. You can upgrade to a hot bibimbap, which is the exact same thing but served in a hot ceramic pot instead of just a bowl, so your food stays warm the entire time, and your rice gets nice and crispy, if you're into that sort of thing. Is it worth the extra $3? That's kind of like asking if it's worth getting your burrito with guacamole at Chipotle: it's an intensely personal decision that after careful meditation, each of us must make for ourselves. Choose wisely.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2014,8/6/2014,51,66,3,9,3>We've loved having occasional dinner at Valley Lodge in Glenview. So we were really excited to hear that an outpost of Valley Lodge was opening in the briefly occupied Big Black Dog space in (much closer) Wilmette. The menu is very much the same as in Glenview: classic, traditional American fare--a nicer Supper Club kind of feel. Not quite as northwoodsy as L. Woods, but similar. We split pork chops (yum!), bbq ribs (tasty, midwest oven style) and a reuben. Portions are huge (think about splitting meals). The food was honest goodness. Great beer list with a bunch of regional craft (Greenbush IPA!) and stalwart nationally distributed stuff like Stone. Solid, reasonably priced wine list, too. How they reconfigured the space works. What once was a pretty awkward room, now has better flow. My only gripe is it is really, really loud. Like, can't have a conversation with people at your table loud. Seriously. Awesome addition to the burgeoning dining scene in downtown Wilmette. We'll be back.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,8/5/2014,22,16,1,3,2>Beauty and Balance is a total joy as a salon -- spirit / energy, cut, color, customer service. It doesn't get better. t followed Kelly from place to place for almost 10 years but had not been to Beauty and Balance for six years. I am back and I don't see myself leaving. Kelly is an awesome stylist, a great business owner, and a terrific person. She listens. She's creative. She's intuitive. She gave me the best haircut I've ever had and I am so grateful! I also watched her interacting with the people who work for her and she seemed like an exemplary boss. This place is about beauty -- inside and out -- which is extraordinary for a salon. Treat yourself to experiencing yourself as an extraordinarily beautiful human being.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2014,8/4/2014,49,11,3,3,3>Went for the first time a few days ago. It was great. Really cozy atmosphere. Affordable prices is what they advertise and it's true. Service was great. Our server was Sheila, and she was so attentive and personable.The food is exceptional. I had the small spinach salad, which was great. Bigger than I expected but the tangy dressing was delicious. The stuffed green peppers were awesome. I got one stuffed with meat and one stuffed with ricotta and mushrooms. The mushrooms were beyond delicious. My friend got the lasagna, which she liked. They do give you a lot of sauce with the entrees even without pasta. For dessert we had tiramisu. I'd recommend it. Between the two of us, dinner was $29.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/5/2014,8/3/2014,5,13,2,3,3>I have been looking for a while before I found a place that had good corned beef hash skillet, and guess what, this is the place and the corned beef hash skillet is AMAZING. My wife and I have been coming here for breakfast, and I don't think we ordered a single item that we didn't like. The service is friendly and good. If you are planning on coming on the weekend, try to be there before 9:30am, otherwise, i might end up waiting.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,8/2/2014,13,12,1,4,3>Coast is a welcome addition to Central Street!  We had a party of 5 for dinner on a rainy Saturday evening, no reservations, but we were seated right away since we arrived so early. We had multiple rolls, nigiri, edamame, and chicken teriyaki (for the 4 year old), and everything was wonderful. We especially liked the wasabi roll. The decor is very hip, the service is attentive, the employees are friendly, and we will certainly be back. If not to done in, for carry-out.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,8/1/2014,19,16,1,4,5>Simply the best. I can only vouch for the cookies and doughnuts, though. But the cookies are life changing. Turtles are a must must must try, linzers, sprinkles, dipped in chocolate with sprinkles, smilies, almond dipped in chocolate. Try some cookies! I've also had a doughnut. It was a cake doughnut with chocolate frosting. Pretty darn good. Give this place a try-- you won't be disappointed.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,7/31/2014,6,15,3,13,4>I almost did not want to write this... I don't want it to get overrun! From the few times I have been here I have been delighted with the quality of the meats, authenticity of the prepared products, preparations, and the owner. I took home a slice of the the Country Pate. It was replete, with boiled egg centered inside each slice and the flavor was sublime... how you want a pate to taste... simple yet complex. And there was the Merguez Lamb Sausage with it's hints of spice (cumin, paprika?, garlic, etc)... all the flavors were spot-on and in balance.I picked up some Bacon as well. They offered a rosemary and a smoked, I got both. They are simply some of the best bacon I have ever had. Yes, its bacon and any bacon is good... No, this is the real thing and is leagues better than anything else I have had. They also have a Guanciale that I will be going back to try... The owner is really nice and seems to be dedicated to delivering small scale, locally sourced (from farm to shop), and honest ingredients. He spoke of knowing the farmers and how they raise the animals... What more can you ask from a butcher/deli? Too much to say about their philosophy and all that, you can check out their Facebook page for more details and you can Google about their former "E & P Meats" history. Okay... you get the point, awesome place!
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,7/30/2014,3,21,,3,2>I've never eaten in the restaurant, and from some other reviews, I guess that's a good thing? I'll judge for myself at some point :) Anyway onto my experience from their delivery.We have ordered from here MANY a time off GrubHub. The food has always been absolutely delicious! I love their crab rangoon and chicken egg rolls. The crab rangoon is always crispy on the outside, not too greasy and perfect mix of cream cheese/crab/scallions. The egg rolls also always perfectly crispy! The fillings is seasoned well, I love to dip it in a mixture of the duck sauce and spicy mustard. The pork pot stickers are pretty good too (a bit big and doughy), I just wish they gave more sauce with it. I have to say I am completely in love with the wonton soup! It's always perfectly seasoned, the right amount of veggies, and the wontons are just perfection. My only complaint is that they need to offer a larger size! I'm completely serious too...offer it in a quart size!!We LOVE the sesame chicken in this household! Definitely the tastiest I've found in Evanston! General Tao's is also incredible and spicy and delicious. I highly recommend the chili stir fried spinach. One of my absolute favorite things to get!
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,7/29/2014,6,20,,3,2>Excellent customer service--you don't find that very often these days. Bob and his staff are wonderful to work with. They make the process very simple and stress-free. Their work itself is outstanding, and is done in such a timely manner. Prices are beyond reasonable. We needed 20 plaques done, approached them at the (very) last minute, and they managed to get them done on time. We were grateful for their efforts, and certainly intend to work with them again in the future.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2014,7/28/2014,13,31,1,3,2>Great place for kids!  I have a 6 and 4 year old and they really enjoy the lessons!  The master is really patient and uncompromising on form and skill.  The kids really like him and comfortable with his teaching.  They have a great one month special to try it out !  They are not pushy at all and really want to see if your kids like it or not .  Wonderful find in the north shore for tae Kwon do!
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2014,7/27/2014,0,33,1,4,2>I have gone by this restaurant for over 30 years and finally tried it for lunch.   I was very pleased with the food and the service.   Our waitress, Caroline, explained everything on the menu and made suggestions.   I had the cheeseburger which was excellent.   My friend had a chopped salad with shrimp.  The carrot cake for desert was great.  The manager, Chris came over to see how everything was.  Highly reccommended, wil be back.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,7/26/2014,12,57,4,2,2>Great service and precision cuts.   The men are all very friendly and welcoming.   The first time I came here it was a little intimidating to walk in and then I was immediately put at ease by how friendly and welcoming everybody was.   Don't leave without saying goodbye and shaking everybody's hand.  You're part of the family.  TV and a fish tank if you like.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2014,7/25/2014,13,103,3,4,2>I confess - I'm really not a regular coffee drinker.  I have maybe a dozen or so coffee drinks a year.  It's really just not my drink...  Newport Coffee House makes such a good Americano, however, that I can't help but sit up and take notice.  Not too strong, not too bitter, not too sour, not too... well, not too anything.  Just an exceptionally-pleasant even-bodied drink that even I can smile about.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,7/24/2014,137,206,3,7,7>I've been here twice for brunch and want to make it out a third time to try dinner. I'm not too familiar with the area, but PP definitely gives off a nice vibe and a fresh breathe of air compared to most of the places nearby. Everything on the brunch menu sounds unique and delicious, but for now I can only vouch for the two items i've tried. The first time I came here happened to be during Passover, so my options were limited. I ended up getting the Potato Cakes - poached egg, smoked salmon, and dill cream. It sounds just like it tasted - healthy and scrumptious! I highly recommend this option...I also had the House Made Flatbread - bacon, egg, goat cheese, onion and sage. It's a great choice for brunch.. I would definitely get it again. My fiancé likes more simple things in life and he got the Fish & Chips both times. The coffee here is perfect - just what a nice cup of joe should taste like. The service was excellent both times and the ambiance of this restaurant is great too. It's very open, light, has a rustic feel to it, and much bigger than it looks from the outside. My only complaint is that they sit everyone very close to each other in one area of the restaurant where as the other half is open and free of people. We walked in and were seated immediately both times for brunch, but I hear it gets busier during dinner hours. Overall, Peckish Pig has everything a restaurant needs to have - great food, service, and vibe!
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2014,7/23/2014,4,25,1,3,2>These guys! My insurance called them when I needed emergency roadside and I'm sooo glad they did. First, they were there within 20 min on a Saturday evening. Second, they knew what was wrong as soon as they came out (axle) and gave me a rough estimate. They looked at it first thing in the morning and had it ready by 1 the same day, including additional things I asked for and needed (oil change, fan belt). The pricing was very reasonable and most importantly they don't charge to evaluate problems like most places in Evanston. Oh, and bonus: they are really friendly. This is definitely my new auto repair shop!
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2014,7/22/2014,17,84,1,3,2>This place is full with authentic people and food, so it's good for a reason. The service is stellar, the food out of this world, and the price reasonable. If you like Nepalese or northern Indian, don't wait! And don't let the fact that this nice sit down joint is in a strip mall next to the DMV fool you. I'll definitely be back. Heck, I make trips from Evanston just to eat here regularly because it's so good. They also do super-spicy if you ask for extra extra hot, so get ready! Yay!The vindaloo, sopas, garlic naan, and every other dish I've had here is great. (I've had at least 6 or 7 different dishes, and almost always get at least one vindaloo.)

Order was exactly as described and out of all the places in Lake Bluff, this would be on top of the list compared to how other places make their burgers greasy. Would definitely recommend if you're craving an all american meal!
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,7/20/2014,64,24,,3,1>This place decidedly takes you back to another time; and is not like these cookie-cutter ice cream/froyo shops that are on every corner.The ice cream is delicious and homemade, and the employees are friendly. It's a nice twist that they offer traditional Mexican snacks as well.If you're in the area, and you're thinking about going to the local 31 Flavors, check this place out!Highly recommended!
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2014,7/19/2014,15,54,,13,9>I slipped on some ice back in February and when I tried to see my GP I found he'd cut his hours drastically.  Either I had to miss work or find someone else.On a whim, I came to this office because it's close to my home.  Boy did I get lucky.. Dr. Fertlemeister (who works Thursdays) is really good and really kind.  They also take my insurance, so visits there never cost me over $20.I actually wound up going back to Dr. Fertlemesiter several times until I started physical therapy.My husband has also come to this location (which is how I knew about it) when he had a sinus infection.  It was quick, efficient, and we got the help we needed.  I'm actually really shocked at the negative reviews here.
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2014,7/18/2014,291,119,4,6,4>WOW!! The wings here are truly delicious!! I met a few people at a party who told me that they would drive from downtown Chicago to Evanston, just for an order of Buffalo Joe's wings, and now I can see why. These wings are so simple and made to perfection!! They are the right amount of crispiness and the sauce is ON POINT! Plus, the portion size and price is not bad either. One order of wings is around $8 and you get like 10 wings!! DEAL! Tip: Get the normal waffle fries and not the one loaded with stuff - the WILL get soggy because it's drenched in canned nacho cheese sauce and and buffalo wing sauce. ALSO, if you want to place an order for a Super Bowl party... do that like 3 days in advance, this place gets so many orders that you won't get it if you order the night before!! - They are just THAT good.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2014,7/17/2014,108,103,6,16,8>BEST NO-CHIP PRICE EVER:This might be my new go-to place to get a no-chip manicure!  For $17 it is the BEST deal hands down.  I've read some of the other reviews that went across the board... but you won't find a better deal for a quality no-chip for hundreds of miles.  What's also great is that you don't need to actually purchase the groupon.I came here for the first time and asked about the original "regular price"... but there wasn't one!  $17 is the set price for their customers... it's not a deal to attract new customers to then raise the price later.  So that's why this place deserves some lovin'!DETAILS IN PRICING:$17 for a regular no-chip manicure$5 for removal$5 for a French no-chip--No coupon needed for any of these prices--There was a minimum charge (I believe $15?) for credit card use.--They prefer cash only for tips.THE NAME/SIGNAGE:There was a Groupon under the establishment "Toni G" Salon and Spa.  I asked my nail technician why their Groupon was under a different name and she said that they are in the process of changing the name from "New Nail & Hair Obsession Day Spa" to a "Toni G" Salon & Spa... which is definitely an easier name to remember.  But it is too cold outside currently to install the new sign, named after the owner, but they'll change it when the weather gets warmer.EASY PARKING:Being my first time here, at first the location was hard to find (because there wasn't a clear sign on the outside)  but it is right next to a frozen yogurt place called Cocomero and across from Annie's Pancake House.  There was plenty of free street parking on the side streets off Oakton Ave.THE 4-Star EXPERIENCE:I've had a no-chip manicure only once before, but this place is also quality.  It was no-fuss, they have a decent color selection: maybe 50 or so to choose from.  Conversation was decent, pleasant but limited... and I'm not the person who normally chit chats throughout the whole process so for me, it was fine.  My nails were filed nicely and the tech was precise.  My friend got the French and was VERY happy with the results.  We joked around afterwards that she had the nails of a bride... And with such fabulous nails, where was the party?  When was the wedding?  Haha. In all, they did a fabulous job.I called in earlier in the day to make an appointment, and it was hassle-free, straight forward and I was told of all the pricing in advance.Depending on your preferences, if you like your nail tech to focus SOLELY on you during the whole experience... this might not be your favorite spot because for a majority of the time, the nail techs were chatting amongst themselves in Assyrian.  They also used paper towels instead of hand cloths and there was less friendly chatter with the client.  Then again, I didn't mind but I'm just pointing out differences between nail salons.SUMMARY:A great place to get a no-hassle, quick and quality no-chip manicure!  I've never had a regular nail routine, but at these prices, it's hard to resist.  The French manicure was beautifuly done ($22 total) and my regular mani ($17) was flawless.  No complaints, I would come here again and bring a friend along... since I feel like I'm getting a two-for-one deal :)Also there are 20% off coupons by the cashier for Cocomero next door... to grab dessert after being pampered.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2014,7/16/2014,9,183,2,4,2>I've been to Tapas Barcelona a number of times now and while I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars for some reason, it deserves more than 4. Really wish I could give it the 4.5 stars it deserves.The food is always delicious. I honestly don't think I've had a bad dish at Tapas Barcelona. Some of my favoritesDates & Bacon - very good, not really any better or worse or different from anywhere else, but that's fine by me.Goat cheese & Tomato sauce - wonderful. absolutely wonderful, a fairly common dish but one executed very well.Pincho de pollo - excellently cooked chicken with a deliciously unique cumin mayo. Great way to counter some of the heavier/tomatoey dishes.Rigatoni con salchicha - Almost always get this one and it's a great value - surprisingly large portion for a tapas dish.Tuna cannoli - interesting take on a cannoli, somewhat subdued but intricate flavorsPuffed Pastry with lamb - fairly small but a lot of interesting flavorsOctopus - one of the few I probably wouldn't get again. octopus is good but not much flavor and rather oily.I always really like the Spanish margarita they have there - brandy, orange liqueor, and lemon. Haven't seen this many other places but I quite like it.Service can be great or quite terrible, there's simply no middle ground. The most recent time it was superb, the waiter knew details about everything on the menu and food came out quickly exactly as we requested it. Other times, I've had to wait and wait only to then ask again for the same dish and have the waiter realize he didn't put the order in or the kitchen lost it. Really hit or miss service.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,7/15/2014,1,31,,3,2>We love Koya.  It started as a very small restaurant with about enough seating for 20 people.  It's since been discovered and they've expanded in to the adjacent staff but it is still an intimate restaurant.  The sushi selections are fantastic - we love the Hawaiian, Philadelphia and spicy rolls but there are a lot of creative ones from which to choose.  There are also options for non-sushi items such as teriyaki, sukiyaki, bento box and the like.  Prices are higher than when it was new but the quality is really top rate.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,7/14/2014,1,15,,3,2>My mother and I had a very dinner at Jerry's this evening. We started off with the beet salad.  Just like one of the previous reviewers said, this was literally all beets which made me very happy!! I highly recommend.For our main course, we both had the fried chicken. It was perfectly crisp and juicy. I get full very easily so I was able to save one of my pieces for later as well as the corn pudding. My mom also substituted mashed potatoes for the corn, which they were happy to do.  The Roquefort sauce was DELICIOUS!!!!Overall, the service was very pleasant, workers were helpful and the atmosphere was lovely. The prices were a little on the high side, but what do you expect? The restaurant is in Winnetka.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/5/2014,7/13/2014,32,156,3,6,4>Y'all know I love a hotdog, and Herm's is TOPS. I am so excited to add it to our regular hotdog dinner rotation. Just a few standouts: MILKSHAKES. the smalls are enormous. Split yours with a child, perhaps. HOTDOGS. they are cut spiral? and kinda crunchy? and fat but not overwhelming, with perfectly steamed buns. nice sized pickle. FRIES. well, fries are just normal, but you can get them with merkts cheddar, which takes them to amazing. SALADS. yes I had a salad at a hotdog stand bc I am a sucker for a good greek salad, and this one did not disappoint. If you love giant chunks of feta and tons of kalamata olives, this is the salad for you. ICE CREAM CASE. there are frozen bananas. and choco tacos. and king cones. A king cone and a hot dog, plus a (pepsi, ugh, but they do have dr. pepper) drink from the fountain or a coke (yay!) or cel-ray (i love any shop that sells cel-ray) from the cold drink case and I'm a happy place.The decor is standard hotdog shop, but with plenty of tables and an awesome mural. Plus, there are a few arcade games if you are a slow eater and need something to entertain your 7 year old so you can finish your salad in peace. And the staff is probably the friendliest ever.Herm's, I'm so glad to know you, and I'm excited to have a long relationship together.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,7/12/2014,132,200,1,6,4>I stopped here for the first time just a few days ago. I've been meaning to, since I live literally right down the street from it, but I rarely have the time to stop and browse - and this store was made for browsing. I picked up three books for about $8, and the owner was incredible. He let me browse at my own pace (very, very slow) and, after asking me if I needed help, just left me alone. I realized I forgot my wallet at home when I went up to the checkout, and when I asked him if I could hold the books there for a few minutes, he actually offered to just let me take them and come back later to pay! I didn't take him up on it, but it was pretty incredible that he offered. Definitely coming back here once I'm done with my books!
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,7/11/2014,0,13,,8,3>Tang Nail & Spa - what a wonderful place! After looking at Yelp, I gathered that this place is reasonably priced and that they do a good job. With this I expected a somewhat dated and under maintained salon and I was prepared to be okay with that. If the service is good, the appearance of the place is not all that important to me.Fast forward to my No-Chip Mani and Pedicure yesterday, I was blown away! A nice, clean salon which has been open for about a year. I had made an appt for 4:30 but was running late after work. My nail technician, Helen, patiently waited and was so so so sweet! THANK YOU Helen for giving me a wonderful Mani Pedi!I'm not the type of person who gets their nails done regularly, but this place might change my mind. Great job to the ladies at Tang Nail & Spa.
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,7/10/2014,0,11,2,4,3>I stopped in here while on a walk and got the Whole Wheat Seeded loaf.  I thought I'd be smart and ask them to slice off a few slices to eat before they wrapped it up nicely in paper and string so that I could munch on my way home.  Yeah...that bread didn't stay wrapped long as I quickly tore into the loaf for more and couldn't stop.  The bread was so perfectly delicious!  The outer crust was nice and crusty while the inside was delectably chewy and light with just a scattering of seeds to keep it interesting.  $7 is a little pricey for my everyday bread but it certainly was a nice treat and I can't stop thinking about it and wanting more. The bread kept nicely on my counter for the following day. The space itself is done especially well with the salvaged wood and fixtures.  I wish they had a little more space for some tables to sit and enjoy but hopefully they will be able to expand in the future.  The sandwiches looked delicious but would love if they did them made-to order where you could choose your bread and filler.  Pastries were also beautiful.  I can't wait to try more!  I think I'm in love.  Keep up the good work, Hewn, I look forward to watching this business grow!
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/14/2014,7/9/2014,1,29,1,5,2>We just took our daughter here on a bit of a gloomy day, and she had a blast!  If you asked her, the favorites were the water room, face painting, and the outdoor park.As her dad, for an occasional trip, the $11/person pricetag isn't too bad, but I certainly wouldn't want to pay that too often.  They have a membership option available if you plan on going a lot, which is nice.  The lady that sold us our entries also mentioned that if we decided to go with a membership that day, they would apply our admissions to the cost.I liked the wide variety of experiences available for the kids here.  From exhibits geared for role-playing, science, exploration, creativity and art...there is likely something for every kid to enjoy.  We even got in just in time to see one of the chicks hatching, which my daughter thought was pretty cool.This is a great, nearby museum option for some fun times with the kids.  I would recommend it highly!
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,7/8/2014,12,11,4,6,4>One of the best reasons to go into Evanston! I grew up going to Dave's but I never really appreciated it until later in life. I am more of a frequent customer nowadays. They have a wonderful and extremely helpful staff who answer all my questions and give me more information than I ever knew I wanted :)In general, they have an awesome collection of stones, fossils, and jewelry. I have been extremely happy with each and every one of my purchases. The museum downstairs is great. I always hear kids coming up the stairs going "That was awesome! Did you see how big that one was?!" The fossils down there are pretty sweet.I recommend you check this place out. It's great for browsing and exploring, but even better for finding amazing stones to take home. Great for children of all ages.. 50 is the new 11.. right? Go there tomorrow. I promise you will love it!!

It actually felt warn and nice. I bought another package to do another area because I was so happy. I can't say enough great things about this salon, so friendly and easy to deal with. Pricing is very fair and set so that a customer wants to return. Don't miss this place!!!!
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,7/6/2014,14,6,7,11,6>Ropa Vieja with Cuban Rice, and Sweet Plantains: the perfect plate (even the waitress said so after I put in my order). Don't forget the Cafe Con Leche as a post-meal pick-me-up! I grew up in Miami and this place is the closest match I've found to Miami Cuban food in Chicago and the suburbs.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,7/5/2014,150,103,4,14,4>This is officially my first non-restaurant review, but it had to be written!  This past Saturday, I had my hair and makeup done because I was emceeing a Northwestern event that night. Although pricey ($150 originally - $135 after the student discount), everything was done perfectly. If you come, expect to pay a lot, but also expect to be super pleased with the results!I called for a hair appointment around 1pm the day of, and they were able to schedule me in at 3:30. I believe my hairstylist was named Nicole. I showed her a picture of my dress (a one-shouldered black gown) and told her that I wanted some sort of hairstyle with my hair gathered on one side. She took into consideration all my requests and created a beautiful curled, low, side ponytail. With lots of hairspray and bobby pins, it was able to stay in place from 4pm to 5am. I was actually planning to do my own makeup, but after seeing how great my hair turned out, I asked if their makeup artist (Elizabeth) was available -- fortunately, she was! It was $60 (including fake lashes) and took about 45 minutes. The lashes she used were separated, with 5-6 on each eye, instead of the long strip that I usually use (I'm not sure if I'm just really inexperienced with makeup, but I found them really cool). Also, she asked to see what kind of jewelry I would be wearing, and purposely made my eye makeup lighter to bring attention to my necklace and dress. The only tiny thing I could possibly complain about is that she made my skin tone extremely light in comparison to my normal skin tone; although it looked amazing in person, my face looked scarily pale in flash photos.Overall, HAIR- 5 STARS and MAKEUP- 4.5 STARS. I'm just going to round up to 5 stars because they were super professional and courteous (offered me tea), had a student discount, and really made sure the hair/makeup fit with my dress/jewelry. I'd definitely come back again if I needed to be prettied up for a fancy event!
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2014,7/4/2014,88,51,5,6,5>This is my staple food as a student at Northwestern. It is one of the closest restaurant to campus. Perfect for a quick lunch in between classes. The food. My favorite dish to get is the Seafood Soondubu. It's a hot spicy stew with tofu and seafood. I was surprised at the amount of seafood in the dish, definitely more than I expected.The Kimchi Albab is a great dish to treat yourself! It's vegetables, beef, rice, kimchi top with salmon roe. It's served in a stone bowl so the rice keeps cooking and gets crispy.The service is inconsistent. They are fast at getting food out, but they often don't remember to refill your water. It's a clean nice restaurant. Perfect for Northwestern students. But there are other great Korean places in the Chicago area.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2014,7/3/2014,68,150,2,8,7>LYFE Kitchen has great options for those who like healthy food! They even have separate menus for non-vegetarians, vegetarians and vegans. I tried their fish tacos and was really happy with how fresh everything tasted. The portion size was also very reasonable - they're careful not to give you too much or too little food. I also tried their ginger mint chia water and liked it a lot, but if you're not a fan of ginger I wouldn't recommend it. Overall, really delicious food in a well-lit restaurant and you leave feeling extra healthy!

<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,7/1/2014,0,11,6,9,7>THE BEST SUB I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND I'M 45 YEARS OLD. I've been eating sandwiches for decades now, and I've never had such a great experience at a sub shop. I was recently talking about good sandwiches in the suburbs with a woman. She told me that she and her husband love to eat at Nemo's in Winnetka. Always open to trying new sandwich places I stopped in at lunchtime and WOW, I was really surprised and overjoyed to eat Nemo's turkey club. Great flavor. Great bite and texture. Great everything about it! This is a sub I'd be proud to give Chef Robert Irvine if we had lunch! I can't tell you how rare it is that I eat something that truly blows me away. Usually the world is full to bursting with horrible chains run by people who must hate food, because they serve such incredibly nasty garbage to the world. I have a saying, if you don't respect yourself, how can you respect your customers. NEMO'S is run by people who have respect and love for what they do, and it shows very beautifully in the quality of their sandwiches. I feel I've won the sandwich lottery discovering this place!What a terrific sub! And the man at the register, he must be the owner, is one the coolest, friendliest dudes I've ever met. THIS is the way you run a sandwich shop! GREAT service. GREAT food. GREAT experience. I'd give 'em more stars if I could lol! Blessings,L.O.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,6/30/2014,14,122,3,8,6>The highly trained staff at Sweet Peas reflects an intensive marketing/training effort by the management.  Bravo Sweet Peas!We were finishing a wonderful Mother's day dinner in Lake Forest and we realized what better than to top off the night with an ice cream.  At 8:59 p.m. or maybe 9:01 p.m. or 9:05 p.m., daughter called Sweet Peas to find out if they were open.  They were about to turn the lights out, but would wait the 10 minutes it would take us to get there.We walked in to the shop and there stood the very nice girl who smiled and acknowledged our call, working solo at the night's end, no doubt looking forward to the end of the work day.  We placed our order--Waffle cone, two scoops, Zanzibar and vanilla; cup of chocolate peanut butter. We thanked this very friendly girl and she made sure that we knew she was very happy to have been able to serve us.Daughter, an ice cream connoisseur, confirmed that as usual the chocolate peanut butter was par excellence.  And I thoroughly enjoyed the vanilla scoop, then rich dark chocolate scoop.Sweet Peas (for me) alludes to Popeye among other things.  There's an old TV playing old B&W shows.  Nice back-in-the-day touch with the great ice cream.That Harvard School of Business strategy of hiring young enthusiastic pleasant servers is brilliant!  Great ice cream served by great smiling servers.  Nice going Mr. Sweet Pea!

They encourage walk-ins and I like being able to go in on a whim. Some women like to go to the same person. I don't care because they all do a nice job. It is peaceful, clean, and up to date with all the newest colors. The after service bonus is a short back rub and there is a reward program that adds up to a free manicure. All in all a pleasant experience.

It was an upscale bowling alley with bocce (have no idea how you play Lol), and a nice bar area. I ordered a Goose Island Matilda and the chicken club sandwich. It was very good. Very friendly staff as well. It was a great experience and will go there again. $7 a game (usually $5 but we went after 6) and $4 for shoes, not bad for such a nice place.     Excellent place for a birthday party. Keep that in mind!

More recently, in looking at lightweight jackets, the sales team member was also very knowledgeable without being pushy, which I appreciated.  Be sure to check around the store for the sale section; I've been tempted by discounted jackets and layers and usually they have most sizes available in each sale style, which is great.

My favorite menu items are the taramosalata, skordalia, saganaki, dolmades, and the chicken kabobs. My husband always gets a lamb dish and has LOVED every single one! Oh, their bread is sooo yummy as well! I eat so much of it, I end up getting full! Doh! I love that there is free valet, we are always greeted with a warm welcome, and the servers are attentive, but not overly attentive. If you go during the warmer months, definitely sit out on the patio...it is lovely...I feel like I'm on vacation! :)

Breakfast croissant, served open-faced, has all the great tastes you'd look for in your breakfast. My current Fav is the Bocado: bacon, avocado and Monterey Jack cheese. Fabulous! Of course, it goes without saying that the above items were splendidly complemented by Kevin's Potatoes (they come into the place as actual whole potatoes and get transformed by culinary artistry into a little bit of Heaven)Be sure to bring kids or - if you haven't any - enjoy the many you will see enjoying Kevin's cooks cooking!

It was definitely more than enough food, and we were stuffed by the end. I wish the server had gone through and pointed out which part of the dish was which; we ended up figuring out what the different meats were, but it was harder to tell with the veggies and now I don't know what to order when I come back.We went in on a Tuesday evening and got our food in 10 minutes; granted, the restaurant was pretty empty.Next time, definitely trying the Ethiopian coffee and desserts!
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2014,6/20/2014,78,77,1,6,4>Phenomenal meal (I ordered the ahi tuna and my date, the cedar plank salmon) in a beautiful restaurant with an upscale atmosphere.From the free bread with specialty butter, to the fresh salads with flavorful dressing, and then to the main course. Jolanes nailed it. Ahi tuna was a great cut, clearly fresh, perfectly seared. Salmon was the perfect texture with a garlic seasoning rub that perfectly accompanied the cedar flavor. Neither over cooked and both delicately plated.Our waiter, Phil, was friendly, accommodating and enhanced the overall experience with timely and personable service. While I didn't dabble in dessert- they have quite the decadent selection staring at you when you walk in. Each pastry was literally calling out to me, begging me to indulge.Love it here. Highly recommend trying.
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2014,6/19/2014,58,347,1,6,4>Updating to say that I've really come to enjoy this path for a nice relaxed spring/fall ride.Scenery gets much better past Glencoe but the roads are also more rough, so I don't know how well road tires would fare on those trails, but it's really gorgeous! There are also some nice segments from Kenilworth-Glencoe (a park, some nice patches for grass for picnic, etc). Yes, the lack of lighting still sucks, and having to get past the Wilmette portion for a peaceful trail is still pretty annoying (though after about the 3rd time I finally remembered where to go at some confusing points), but I think the narrowness isn't an issue given the relatively low volume of (much more friendly) riders and runners.As much as I disliked the qualities of this path when I first rode on it, after so many trips it's really grown on me, I guess. Plus, they just repaved may portions of the trail in the fall. There are still a lot of bumps for some reason, but it's certainly quite a bit smoother.Can't wait for all the snow to melt!

The walls are painted in a nice color, there are pillows (and candy!), and a plethora of magazines and comfy couches. The waiting area has coffee and there are fresh flowers everywhere! Helen, the new owner, chatted about how she recently had a grand opening with "grand opening prices" (12.00 for a mani, 36 for mani/pedi, 30 for no-chip) and I had to try it!. Helen is funny and caring- in that Asian-mom sort of way! I loved how welcomed I felt. The manicure itself was a really relaxing experience! For 12.00, my hands were wrapped in hot towels, my cuticles were carefully trimmed, my nails were meticulously painted and I even received a back massage! That is an amazing deal!The manicurist, Judy (pick her!) has been working with Helen for half a decade and is super friendly. She's a mom so she instantly makes you feel comfortable and she's also a very hard worker! Judy is personable and genuine- she is careful with her tools and always made sure to ask if the towels were too hot! We actually even spoke a few words to each other in Spanish!Go to Crystal Nails if you want a relaxing experience where people take their time, are hospitable and welcoming! PS: prom and graduation special! 30.00 mani & pedi with student ID!

Same with the two dining room areas, as it's easy to view a sporting event from every seat in the house. I had a burger that was decent for bar food, nothing to write home about. But I did like that you can order tots or sweet potato fries instead of regular FF. I'd like to try the pizza and some other items on the menu before I can completely comment on the food.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2014,6/16/2014,88,154,3,9,5>This is a cute little burger shop. We came on a Saturday evening, around 5pm, and were greeted promptly by Annick, our friendly server. She explained everything to us and was very helpful. We decided to go with a black cherry cheerwine soda (3) the #1 Burger (9) and the Satchmo (12). Since we had a Northwestern wildcard, we got tater tots for free with our entrees. This is the current promotion, but our server did tell us that it might change in the future. The tater tots were very good, and their ketchup is special too. I really enjoyed the #1 Burger and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes bacon. The Satchmo I didn't like quite as much. It's basically a shrimp and crawfish sandwich, which I would have really liked, but I didn't know that it came with scallions all over it, which I'm not a fan of. There were too many to pick out so I just enjoyed the burger instead.Side note: the bathroom is really cute since it has chalkboard walls, and they have chalk that you can use to write on it. It's also very clean. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, but I don't think it's very good for groups. You will probably end up sitting next to people you don't know, especially if it's busy. We sat at the counter by the window and enjoyed people watching while we ate. They also have handy coat hooks under the counters. Come with a friend or two, and enjoy a delicious burger!
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2014,6/15/2014,163,595,4,6,6>This is one of the best kept secrets in Evanston.  Its probably because its not in the 'downtown' portion nor near any trendy shops.  But once you go inside this place you willl be pleasantly surprised.  It is clean, nicely decorated, and a nice parking lot to boot.So the wife and I went here on a Friday night because they have live music on Thursday-Saturday after 7pm.  We are immediately seated and I start looking over the menu.  The menu is 90% different itterations of fried chicken (different pieces) or fried fish with waffles or other sides.  There are also salads and other stuff, but we're here for some home cooking.We get a half a fried chicken, two pecan waffles, some fried catfish, collard greens, cheesy grits, a sweet potato pie, and a few beers.  The bartender, while she said she doesn't know much about beer, she was learning and knew more than she realizes.  The beer selection was great.  I had a fatty boom batty and the wife had a bourbon smoked cider.Off the the food, it was a lot of food, but it did not last.  I will definately be back to enjoy this place.
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,6/14/2014,14,104,4,5,4>There is almost always a line, but it is well-worth the wait. The owners and servers are a little quirky, and the decor includes some arts and crafts chandeliers giving the restaurant a definite hipster vibe. That being said, the food is outstanding-- these hipsters can cook! Definitely try the cheese flakey and cinnamon glazed bacon. Everything else is fair game, as well. Their lunch and dinner menus are great, but I would definitely make my first visit a breakfast or brunch.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,6/13/2014,4,9,1,5,3>This is a new nail salon that opened up in the area. My sister and I came here for manicure-pedicure treatments and loved it! The place is clean and modern and the quality is good. The pedicure was standard with some nice touches like a leg scrub and massage. The pedicure massage chairs are also nice and comfy. The manicure was also good and my specialist was very detailed with the quality. Afterwards the girls have us nice shoulder runs which completed the experience. Will definitely be coming back!
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2014,6/12/2014,40,126,1,5,3>I didn't purchase my Lexus at this dealership but made an appointment to have an oil change here because it's close to where I live. I called the day before and setting up an appointment couldn't have been any easier. I believe that you can also go online to set up an appointment if you prefer.My appointment was at 6:40 pm and if pulled into the service area..they quickly jotted down the mileage, confirmed that I came in for an oil change, and said it would be about an hour since he had two technicians in the evening hours. No problems, very easy. There were hardly any people and it was a very relaxing atmosphere.The lounge area is really comfortable, you can opt to sit in some comfy chairs in front of a tv, sit at a circular table, or a cubicle. They had cold refreshments that you could help yourself to (water, coke, sprite) and you can even borrow an IPad to play on while you wait. Win-win!Definitely would come back to have service done to my car.

We scheduled a time and guess who was on-time and guess who was late!!!!  Sorry Brad.   Well luckily the wife/kids got home to let Brad's employee into the garage.We were promptly given the cost.  VERY reasonable.  The tech (Eric) did a great job.   Cleaned up everything.   Greased / oiled everything and adjusted the door perfectly.   I also saw Eric test all the various safety features.  Very professional.   I highly recommend this company.  I am very satisfied.   Door fixed less then 24 hours after it broke.

After doing so I found this shop a few blocks down and decided to stop in.I was greeted with, "Look! It's Ms. Saigon!" by one of the ladies working behind the counter. Being Vietnamese, I took this as a warm welcome.If you are looking for clothes or furniture, this may not be the place for you. I was on the hunt for little knick-knacks to add to my home decor.I found a vintage style jewelry box, a mini vase and two other milk glass pieces (oh how I adore anything milk glass) all totaling under $5. On a plus side: they take credit card if your purchase total exceeds $10.On my way out another worker said I got some great finds and told me I should keep my diamonds in my new jewelry box :)I will post a picture of all my new treasures.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2014,6/9/2014,22,299,1,6,3>We were being invaded by little black ants this spring, I tried my usual harry homeowner counter actions but did not seem to be making a dent. I also was not able to determine any obvious access points. I looked on Yelp and these guys were highly rated and local. Plus there was a Yelp deal for $40 bucks off. I called in the evening when I got home from work and a person actually answered the phone, said they would send someone out next morning between 9 and 11. Guy shows up at 9:30, i like them already. Tim, who it turns out is the owners son, is not only a professional, but friendly and easy going as well, you could tell by talking to him that he knew his bugs. They are not cheap but neither is your daughter's happiness ;) They address all kinds of nuisances up to small rodents and offer a quarterly contract to stay on top of it that is optional. The stuff they use is biodegradable within 90 days and is safe for kids/pets/plants. It does not kill on contact but rather infects and ultimately destroys colonies.Hopefully I will be ant free sooner than later but if I have any problem, their work is guaranteed. If you have a bug problem, use these guys, they are truly family owned and local.Happy earth day indeed ;)

It was an interest in passing as a new sport to get into, and I managed to remove a lot of skin off my knees and feet, unfortunately. They do have a great environment for BJJ if that is something of interest. The trainers were very professional and it was a very open environment. The studio itself is rather small, but works.I will be back....once the skin heals :)
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2014,6/6/2014,16,109,3,6,3>I love coming to this place for my watch services! They're great at figuring out what's wrong and providing me with honest and reasonable prices and times to fix it. change in batteries is a straight up $10 and they can change it in 10 minutes - exactly what I want and need. I've also brought some jewelry in to fix before and they've been great at giving me prices for it. i had a costume jewelry fixed before and they did a very nice job. I've also brought in finer jewelry, a gold 18k ring that has a super thin band that I broke. They helped me patch it up though the material they used to patch it up wasn't the same quality as the original material - understandable though. I also broke this same ring again later in the year and ended up taking it to Cottage Jewelry who actually did an even better job so if you have something very delicate and fine, I would suggest you taking it there instead. They're a little bit more upscale and fit better with the gold ring I needed fixed. Everything else though, I would come back to Virag for!
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/24/2014,6/5/2014,49,140,3,4,3>I love Foodstuffs! Amazing gourmet food shop, filled to the brim with delicious pastries, cheeses, prepared foods, and lined with darling baskets to bring it all on a picnic. I used to frequent the Lake Forest location when I was an undergrad, but I had forgotten all about this one until this weekend. I originally intended to go to Great Harvest, but after poking my head in at 9:30 on Sunday, seeing a completely empty place and all plastic wrapped pastries, we elected to come here instead. Great choice! My croissant was delicious, and my fiance's raspberry muffin was so good I kept stealing bits of the crumble topping. The small downside is that they do not have an espresso machine, but I was able to get a latte at the Starbucks two doors down and they did not mind me drinking it in here. We were able to pick up a few things for dinner and some treats while we were here, and will definitely come back to get Ravinia supplies once the season starts!
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2014,6/4/2014,57,116,3,5,4>Cute place for the little kids - clearly the audience it is geared for.  Tons of candy and Froyo.  They've got a ton of flavors available - there must have been 10 the day we were there.  It's the usual fill your self a big cup of yogurt, pile it on with a ton of different toppings and the dig in.  The toppings tend toward the overly sweet candy type - gummi bears, sprinkles, oreos, crushed butterfingers, etc.  And the yogurt was awfully sweet.  I'm more of a tart yogurt with fruit topping kind of guy, so this place wasn't quite my cup of tea.  However my 11 year old thought he had died and gone to heaven (mixed cup of cookies/cream and chocolate yogurt with gummi stuff, sprinkles, hot caramel, and oreos on top.  Yuck.  But I guess there is no accounting for taste - he was very happy.There was a birthday going on while we were there and all the little girls in attendance (maybe they were 9 or 10 years old), seemed to be having a great time.I'd say bring your kids, but if its just adults, no so much.I wasn't super fond of the froyo, but I'm giving this 4 stars just for their ability to make my kid very happy.  And after all, its all about him not me.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2014,6/2/2014,35,14,2,5,4>WORKS MIRACLES. Miracles.I took my shoes in on a Thursday; it was relatively busy, but I was helped immediately. I had called in early that day to try to get an estimate on how much my shoe repair would cost, but was told to come in with my shoes.I brought in BCBG beige suede heels that were in a disastrous condition. Basically, there were vomit splatters all over the shoe and scuffs everywhere. To make matters worse, I left those heels in my trunk for more than half a year to discover that the splatters had changed color and seemed to be a part of the shoe. Embarrassing? Yes... (don't judge me!)The guy looked at it and didn't seem too hopeful he could do much and had no guarantees. Initially he said they would be done in a week, but I needed to be done by Saturday (2 days from then). And he said he would get it done! He charged me $22, which included waterproofing, which I thought was fair (: They accept payment immediately and pick up later.I came in on Saturday to be ASTONISHED. The heels looked brand spankin' new! I really wish I had taken a before and after photo because he literally did magic on my shoes! Amazing!

There are tables and couches at which to have a sit, and they even have a few board games if you're so inclined. The friendly staff members are happy to help you pick something, as well as provide plenty of information about the wine or beer served at their weekly Saturday tastings.

<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,5/29/2014,90,224,4,8,4>I decided to try spinning last week for the first time (whaaaaaaat!), and RevSpin is just a couple of blocks from my place, so it was the obvious choice for a trial run. I sent a pre-spin email to them asking what they recommended to start, and they quickly answered that their Level 1 course would be perfect and that I would just need to show up about 15 minutes early to get the lay of the land from the instructor.So, I did that and the instructor was literally waiting at the door for me. (not on purpose, but still... very welcoming). I explained my newness and she walked me through how to get on the bike and manage myself during class. I took my seat in the front row ('cause I'm brave like that) and KILLED IT. Well, I survived it ... but I'm giving myself big props for that.Spinning isn't for quitters. Expect to sweat your cheeks off for 50 minutes regardless of your fitness level. You control your own resistance at all times, so if you don't sweat it's your own fault.I really enjoyed the class, loved how the instructor cared about my first-timey-ness and the space was pretty perfect. It got a little warm in the room at times, and I would've loved an extra burst of cool air now and then, but I did see some fans there (that just weren't on?!) and could probably ask to set-up near one if it seemed necessary. I'll find out tomorrow when I return for my 2nd spin!!
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/6/2014,5/28/2014,362,467,5,14,4>This is a review for the juice cleanse, so for those of you who are looking to see whether you want to invest the money to try it out, here it is: I've always wanted to try the cleanse but the high price tag and the thought of giving up solid foods for three days were deterring. But when I saw the Groupon for 50% off (discounted price of $97), I figured I might as well try. In terms of logistics, it was super easy to arrange the pick-up. 1. I bought the Groupon. 2. I called the number given. 3. I was able to pick it up the NEXT DAY (Groupon asks that you give up to 2 weeks, so guess I was lucky). 4. I go in on a Friday and then have all the juices bagged and ready to go. NOTE: You DO have to pay an additional sum of money for tax when you pick up your juices, so make sure you bring cash/credit card/whatever. You pretty much have 6 juices a day, 4 unique varieties:1. Green Lantern: tastes quite salad-y, but the kick of the lemon makes it easy to go down. Definitely not delicious, but at least I could drink it without holding my nose.2. Haute Lemonade: lemonade with cayenne pepper. You can really feel the kick for this one! It was surprisingly spicy, but it was also my all-time favorite. 3. Maroon 5: If I were Adam Levine, I would sue Peeled for naming this horrible drink after my band... Beets and carrots = deep magenta, absolutely nasty concoction. I had to hold my breath and down a cup of water to get past this one. 4-5. Repeat Green Lantern and Maroon 5.6. Cashew milk: Strange texture and flavors, but after having the Maroon 5 twice in one day, it was heavenly.You're probably wondering: 1. How did you feel? 2. Were you hungry?1. First day was the worst for me. I actually only got through 4 out of the 6 drinks... it was too much liquid for my body to handle and the nastiness that was Maroon 5 made me feel sick. I also took a ridiculously long nap on day 1 and was exhausted. Days after that felt fine and it was a lot easier to get through the juices. 2. Surprisingly, no. You are pretty much drinking a minimum of 16 cups of liquid a day, so I was never hungry.Would I do this again? Probably not. I lost a total of 5.5 pounds (almost all water weight), so this is not a way to actually lose real weight. Did I feel absolutely amazing and fabulous after? Meh. I would say I felt "lighter" but that's probably because I had no food in my system. Also, it's too expensive to justify the results. Did it "jumpstart" healthy eating habits? I was really portion/food-conscious for a couple days after, but now I'm eating normally again, so for me, not really. What I would do differently IF I went through it again: Wean myself off processed foods a few days before. I think the biggest reason why I struggled so much day 1 was because I literally dived headfirst into the cleanse (I mean, I finished an entire box of Oreos the night before).All in all, a worthwhile experience, but I don't think I would ever go back and do it again.

<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2014,5/26/2014,23,321,,5,2>I like this place.  I can't say that I love it.  It's not what I would call luxury or exceptional.  They do a fine job.  I have come here a couple of  times now for a pedicure.  On my most recent visit I brought my adult daughter with me.  They were able to give us both pedicures at the same time which was convenient.  I only wish that they would spend just a bit more time on the leg massage part. The location is kept very clean which of course is important.  The massage chairs that you sit in for the pedicures are really nice.Though it was the very end of March during this visit we were still in the midst of the polar vortex so boots were still the footwear of choice.  They were really great when it came time to leave by wrapping our toes in plastic so the fresh polish wouldn't be destroyed.

So, the Botanic is a favorite with our family. We can walk the kids and the wife can get her flower nerd on. We end up here quite often. There are many beautiful garden vignettes to explore. I love the Japanese garden. When you're on the island it is easy to imagine being transported halfway around the globe. During the summer they have live music and dance lessons. Super fun for the kids, as well as the senior set. The cafe is a good spot to grab a light lunch. Pro tip: the place is free. You only pay for parking. So, ride your bike in and save $20.

I tried 2 sandwiches, the #1 and the tuna (I forget the number) but regardless both were outstanding! But the best thing out of my meal was the arrancini, or as I refer to it "the rice ball thing". That was simply remarkable. Ontop of all the great food was great prices, and friendly service. My total was 14 dollars and some change and the cashier saw I only had 14 dollars in hand then twenties, and instead of making me break a twenty he just said it's alright, don't worry about it.

For dessert, my first choice was the crème brule with malted milk balls, but they were sold out.  We then had the brown butter cake which was fantastic.  Service was perfect.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wine list and made some great suggestions.  The flow of service was spot-on as well, and we never felt rushed or delayed.I would definitely recommend MH Fish House to anyone who asks.  Prices were fair for the quality of the ingredients and portion size, service was perfect, and it's close to the house.  We will definitely be back.

I am personally picky about who does my eyebrows just because I've had a bad experience where it was uneven. When I go here I always go to Emmy (that's how it sounds like, but its actually spelled differently). If she's not there I will go to Sonia. The owner is an older "fabulous" [loud] lady and can push you in to services you dont want so just dont feel bad to say no. Nonetheless the girls here are really nice. I would just call ahead of time to see if they can fit you in because I tends to get very busy here. Price wise its not bad. $6 for threading womens eyebrows and $4 for upper lip. For men's eyebrows I believe its $10, but you can always call for pricing.

The owner has great taste, service and product. They don't pressure you into buying anything either which is a huge plus since I hate being stalked... small boutiques usually annoy the heck out of me because they're always on top of you. I also like the fact that the owner is involved with the community and she's always there to help. She has a heart for the neighborhood which is so valuable if you believe in the neighborhood ideal.

The process you go through with the, to choose frame, mat and glass can take some time (and should for expensive or hard-to-match pieces), but it is totally worth it. Local people with roots in their location make a difference. Not the cheapest place in town (I would get a simple job done somewhere else), but for anything you are hanging in sight, this is the place to go!
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,5/15/2014,2,12,1,7,5>My husband and I had a great evening here yesterday. This cafe is the perfect venue for dates. They have a very cozy design and my favorite combination of "white tablecloth on a background of burgundy and dark wood". The cafe is very tiny. We came without reservations, and found the table. but probably in popular days such as Friday or Saturday reservation  required. I was pleased with my meal and the size of dish. It was not huge like in American restaurant , but was not tiny like in many French restaurants when  you need  to have 3 - 6 plates to not be hungry.Price for dinner for 2 persons  is 60 - $ 70 with wine and dessert. But you can only have a couple of appetizers  for 9 - $ 12 and  coffee for price like  $ 30 dollars if you do not plan a big dinner. I'll probably be back here.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2014,5/14/2014,0,12,1,6,4>We've been here a half dozen times or so. Firstly, they service bread and a a simply excellent Rosemary olive oil. As for main course(s), the Tapas philosophy is always great for getting a dynamic mix of serving types in one sitting. The Salmon Ahumado is a personal favorite! If you come here then I also would highly encourage you to try the Red Sangria as it is in my opinion, the best thing about Tapas Barcelona. When so often Sangrias are overly sugary and watered down, this Sangria feels almost authentic in that you can actually taste the wine(s).

When I was younger me and my friends would joke about coming home from work, getting off the train, and going to grab drinks together. Since turning 21, it turns out... that does happen a lot. Honestly, I had never gone into Glenview House until this year. Since I've been home this summer, I've gone quite a few times. The first time, I was mainly there for dinner with a friend. I had the Three Beef Burger as it came highly recommended from our waiter. The burger was pretty good. A little dry and a bit above the "Medium" I requested, but still pretty good.But let's be real, you don't come here for the burger. If you're going to the Glenview House, you're probably grabbing a drink. The beer selection is great and has all (well not all...) the IPAs, Lagers & Ciders you could want. Definitely try the Small Town Root Beer... and maybe order a bowl of ice cream to go with it too!In terms of appetizers (bar food), I've had the Potato Skins, the Wings and the Spinach & Artichoke Dip. My favorite was probably the dip, but overall, the portions are a little on the smaller side. My favorite part about Glenview House though? Tuesday, they have half price beer and whiskey flights. Which means you can get a taste of a few different brews for as few as $4 or $5!I don't know how much longer I'll stay in Glenview after I graduate college, but Glenview House will always be one of my favorite hometown bars.
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,5/12/2014,11,24,1,6,5>My wife and I stopped in for a quick dinner before a movie. I had high hopes for the place based on previous Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed. It really is a great neighborhood restaurant with a strong sense of character. The Greek personality is evident in every aspect of the restaurant, down to the warm shoulder hug that the restaurant's manager gave me as he asked if we were enjoying our meal. We most certainly were.My wife had a large African prawn that was as delicious as it looked on the menu. There was nothing small about this prawn. It clearly had a well-fed life prior to ending up on my wife's dinner plate. It tasted delicious too, stuffed with cheese and herbs that made the mouth melt.  I had the beef kapama dish, a short rib cooked in a tomato (and cinammon) sauce that sits on top of a plate of pasta. The ratio of short rib to pasta was just right. Sometimes after eating short rib, I feel weighed down, but I didn't after eating this lovely dish. My only complaint about the dish was that I would have liked a little more sauce with it. The flavor was delicious and I wanted more of it!We started our meal with a beautiful plate of fried zucchini. It was a pretty big plate and when they delivered it to our table, I thought there was no way we'd get through the entire thing. Of course, after realizing how crisp and delicious they were, we devoured all of them.  Even though it was fried, I didn't feel all greasy afterward. They know how to apply a light touch at this restaurant.The servers and the entire staff were extremely friendly and much more welcoming than the average north shore franchise. We're coming back!
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2014,5/11/2014,108,103,8,10,7>Buff Joe's.... always works their magic.When someone mentions it, the response is usually: "omg Buff Joe's, it's SO good let's go there NOW!" said quickly, almost panicky in one breath.  Or followed by: "I need Buff Joe's, why'd you have to mention it, we need to go NOW!"When someone mentions your favorite type of food, you have a mini anxiety attack when your mouth waters and you need dem wings... That's kinda what happens... no matter what time of day.I always get a single order of Suicide Wings (topped with jalapenos) with a side of waffle fries ("Buffalo Chips" $1.89).   Your order will come with celery and ranch, and a wetwipe (which you will certainly need).  Sometimes I'll wash everything down with an RC.Their wings are freshly fried, then tossed in tangy sauce.  A single order is $7.99 and you better bring cash because it's CASH only... but they have a generic ATM right inside the restaurant in case you forget.They also serve beer and these little oatmeal chocolate chip cookies in a huge tub by the cashier, which look heavenly, but I never have room for dessert.  Also, they have a "XXX" sauce which is a spicy habenero-type darker red sauce... which I have only requested on the side as a sample because I heard eating an order with that sauce is brutal for your tastebuds.  Try it on the side first to see if you'll like it because once you start it's so spicy it hurts.So maybe I have an unhealthy relationship with this place.  But if wings were ever going inside my stomach, they better be from here.  When friends visit from out of town, I'll take them to Buff Joe's and with a serious face, say: "These are the best wings in Chicago."  (Deep dish pizza will be tomorrow night...)I only go to the Clark location, although there are two others on Green Bay and Howard.  After I have gone and out-done myself again in the form of massive wing consumption, I say I've reached my Buff Joe's quota, forever.  But of course I end up coming back the following month or so.This stuff is on par with being one of my last meals on urf.  Heaven on urf...earth.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2014,5/10/2014,2,24,,4,3>THIS PLACE IS GREAT! I love how they have froyo, bubble tea, and sushi all at one spot! Really inexpensive, and the fish is very good! Talked to the man who prepared my sushi, who happened to be a sweetheart, and he explained how it comes in almost daily. I was there when it first opened and even then they had their act together, it's been a few months so I can only imagine how much better it's gotten! Oh and another thing that was very nice, the man who prepared my sushi was earnestly asking about the quality of the food and how he thought it could be improved. That was so nice! Definitely a place to go back to over and over again.

No other hands will touch my S60R.  Top shop, good pricing, but more importantly, they are there to connect with you as a customer.  You will not be disappointed.
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2013,5/8/2014,131,47,4,11,7>I started ordering from here using Grub Hub a while ago.  It had really great reviews on there, so I figured I'd give it a go.  They deliver super fast, fyi, so don't go by the "estimated delivery time" or else you may get caught in the shower like I did once.Their chicken kabobs are super moist and seasoned wonderfully.  Their beef schwarma is also amazing!  I would definitely recommend either of those... or a combo of both.Hummus wise, I much prefer their jalapeno hummus to their plain.  It has more flavor, and it's not really all that spicy, so if you are a wuss I wouldn't worry about it too much ;-)Their rice is amazingly flavorful, and you get so much that I usually have enough rice left over for one or two meals.I've had both the lentil soup and the stew that they make.  They are both quite good, but I prefer the lentil.Honestly, I like this place better than Pita Inn... so, give them a go!
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,5/7/2014,20,82,1,4,4>Soooo excited that they added the ability to book your appointment online from their website.   It is formatted to also work on a mobile phone browser so you can easily pull up their schedule and the type of service you want and see when each stylist had an opening.  I just booked an appointment and it took about 3 min.  Much less time than it would have taken to call and since it's 9pm they are closed so I would have to wait untilTomorrow to do it anyway. This is a huge plus in my book since it is so convenient  and  saves time!
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2013,5/6/2014,24,55,3,5,4>I've been going to this practice since 1985. Dr. Abt is my dentist, I don't trust anyone else with my teeth. He not only practices dentistry, he is an active professor of dentistry and continues to do research on the most vexing dental problems.You won't see this practice advertising, they don't need to. All of their patients come from word of mouth (no pun intended). These guys are the real deal, their clients are the most educated, discriminating professionals on the North Shore. Come to this practice because you want to deal with nice people and receive the best care of your teeth. They provide great service and never suggest unnecessary procedures. There is NO upselling here. If you want teeth whitening or cosmetic dentistry, you'll have to ask them for it. I would recommend them without reservation.

We get the pan pizza WELL DONE, which is important. The crust is flavorful and crispy, the sauce is really fresh and tomato-y, and the cheese is gooey and delicious. If you want an extra delicious treat, get your pizza with sausage and broccoli. An unexpectedly delicious combo that has become our regular order.
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2014,5/4/2014,5,28,,4,2>Good food, cute atmosphere. I think we may have been the youngest people in the place, and am guessing this place is popular with the older crowd.We ate at the bar and were very happy we did. There was a long wait, but full menu at the bar was easy and immediate. Service was great and we would come back here again!
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2014,5/3/2014,55,123,,8,4>LOVE this place. Service is great. Every time I'm there, I always get a warm welcome. GREAT customer service. One of the big reasons why I return.  I always get the chorizo nachos, my sister always gets the chicken torta. Always consistent and delicious. Their sauces are soo addicting. Whatever that creamy spicy orange colored sauce is.. Heavenly. Thier juices are awesome, I don't know what the red one is called but it was great. Al pastor tacos are to die for.The establishment is clean. Prices are very reasonable. Parking sucks but where doesn't it in Evanston, you can park in the library lot and walk a short distance over. Highly recommended!
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/2/2014,5/2/2014,132,200,1,6,4>I was here with a friend for Restaurant Week and I regret nothing. I had: the cheese curds, the burger, and the peanut butter tart. The cheese curds were so beyond good. My friend said she'd heard people raving about the cheese curds, but I honestly couldn't see how fried cheese could be all that good. And yet... it was. If I got the chance to go to Farmhouse again, I'd probably just order cheese curds - we were stuffed after just eating that huge bowl of cheese curds, and probably could have just left satisfied then. I will say that I didn't like my burger as much as I thought it would. I had it medium rare, but I thought that it was pretty dry, and the bun was huge. I ended up only eating the top half of the bun, because I was just so full! As for the peanut butter tart - I will say that I was never, ever so grateful to see a smaller portion of dessert than I expected. Absolutely delicious - although the peanut were a little too cinnamony, I thought - great textures, an awesome combination of flavors. So, so delicious! Oh! And they gave us some white chocolate cherry scones to start (compliments of the chef) and they were freaking delicious. I'm pretty sure they were the best scones I've ever had. I often find scones to be too dry and grainy, but these were perfect. I would definitely go back - and I would definitely get the cheese curds. Oh man. Mouth heaven.
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2014,5/1/2014,127,267,,3,3>We signed up my daughter Katie here in December after her elementary school hosted a taekwando demonstration by UTC head instructor Master Jeong.  At UTC, Master Jeong (a sixth degree black belt) gave my daughter instruction in some basic moves, and then talked to my husband and I about what they focus on at UTC.  We were impressed.  In addition to a great physical workout and martial arts training, kids are taught the importance of values such as respect, perseverance and self-discipline.  Character is key, along with fitness and conditioning.  Every week, a different "life lesson" is emphasized.  Kids can earn black attitude stripes for demonstrating organization, good manners, respect for teachers, love for parents, good personal hygiene...even for completing book club sheets.The taekwando studio (right across the street from H-Mart) is clean and well-maintained.  Importantly for us, parents can be present and view the lesson from the lobby.  Some drop off their kids as lobby space is tight, but my husband and I like to know what's going on in class.  Kids are initially asked to attend classes twice a week (you pick the days/times) and I appreciate that flexibility.  We pay $99.00 a month (the uniform is included).  Testing for new belts starts at $55.00, I believe.Ultimately, the instructors - Master Jeong and Master Nahm - make the center worth recommending.  I've observed they are both excellent at working with kids.  (Master Jeong is funny and laughter is common in class).  Without being overbearing or intimidating, both Master Jeong and Master Nahm command respect while making the classes fun, high-energy and motivating.  My daughter looks forward to going.UTC offers taekwando classes to kids starting at age three and a half, all the way up to the adult level.  Master Nahm also teaches an adult kickboxing class (that I was told is an intense workout).  Kids camps, birthday parties and anti-bullying seminars are also offered.

The cocktail menu is perfect - a good selection of tried and true cocktails, each annotated with the year it was created (1800s, anyone?). The food menu is small, but quality. You can get a bowl of almonds or a larger meal - something for everyone. They have local artists' work on the walls, atmospheric lighting, really friendly servers, and good music. It's small, it's not a pick-up joint, it's not a scene - it's a great little place to go hang out with friends or a date/spouse and relax with good food and drink.

<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2014,4/26/2014,33,130,4,7,5>After seeing the crowd tonight, I think it's safe to say the neighborhood is very happy Lucky Fish has opened.  The place was packed at 7:30 but my friends and I were seated after only waiting about 5 minutes.  The menu has a lot of options that sound good so it was hard to choose just one thing.  My friends both went for the lobster rolls and if I hadn't gone to Maine this summer and eaten amazing Maine lobsters straight out of the water, I would've ordered the lobster roll too.  That trip ruined lobster rolls for me and now I can never order them outside of New England. I went for the shrimp po boy with hushpuppies instead.  We also ordered a 1/2 lbs of cod for to share.  The po boy was filled with plump shrimp and I would happily order it again.  Hushpuppies were a little on the dense side but still very good.  Both my friends thought the lobster rolls were a little too salty and dressed in too much mayo. Angela S has a picture of the menu showing $13 for the lobster roll but on this night it was $14.50. I don't know when that picture was taken but it couldn't have been that long ago. I noticed the prices of some other menu items have also increased by about $1. The cod was a hit with everyone and were portioned like fish sticks instead of big pieces so it made it easy to share.  Service was ok.   We weren't given any napkins or silverware with our food. Initially, we thought someone would come around after dropping off the food but no one did.  We had to flag someone down and even then, they only gave two settings and two napkins when there were three of us.  That isn't enough to keep me away though. I hit up Curry Hut from time to time for lunch but they haven't been very good lately.  Thankfully, I now have Lucky Fish as a tasty alternative.
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/30/2013,4/25/2014,137,206,4,7,6>I am very happy to have La Taquiza as my 100th review of 2013 - it definitely deserves it!!! I've been back twice in a two week period and had the Tinga Torta both times because it is just that damn good. Tinga is freshly shredded chicken breast with spicy chipotle and with garlic, onion, and tomato- phenomenally good - the perfect amount of spicy to your meal. The torta bread is also freshly baked and soft, exactly what you would want in a meal. My fiance had the tacos the first time around and the Chicken Torta on his second try and agrees with me on it being one of the best Mexican meals around.Somehow, on our first hungover visit, we missed the fact that it had a Smoothie Bar, so this time, I got a delicious chocolate banana smoothie and he got the Papaya which is exactly what I will get next time - the perfect taste and flavor.The lady working there is incredibly friendly, and when we were there the first time around, she was so nice and went over the menu and told us a little bit about everything. I highly recommend to make your way to this place. It's off of Shermer in a strip mall that I've never noticed before. There was a train wreck a couple years ago and the road near the restaurant has been blocked off, so I am sure this place gets missed by many. Overall: The best Mexican meal I've had in 2013 :)

The shop is warm and inviting with a large table to sit and eat at. And the meat. Oh the meat! They have everything you could need. I tasted the salami and it was killer. They had all kinds of exotic meats and cuts you don't see everywhere. While I didn't try the lamb bacon, I am excited to one day! They make all their own deli meats and I know my lunches are gonna be that much tastier from now on. I brought home some of the house bacon and man was it good. In addition to all the meat, which I could stare at all day, they have lots of great local pantry items. They have a small area for produce which is all from different local farms and labeled with the produce. I bought the biggest shallots I have ever seen, like humongous. The owner said they were treating this week as a soft opening so they could talk to customers and introduce people to their products. It sounds like there is much more to come with rotisserie chickens and made to order sandwiches! I can't wait to try more!

<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/6/2014,4/22/2014,167,216,4,7,6>It's not necessarily the same as eating in the South and the service can be very slow but it's the best South of the Mason Dixie eating I've had in the Evanston area thus far.  I highly recommend the fried green tomatoes (echoing everyone's sentiments), the spicy bloody mary (indeed, very spicy AND strong yet very tasty) and anything with grits or smothered in gravy.Both brunch and dinner are good here.  Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but typically have been seated within 15 minutes of arrival with parties ranging from 2 to 8 people.  At dinner, the free corn pancakes (or johnny cakes) are good but you have to be into the concept of them.  They remind me of Southern restaurants I've been too and are good coated in butter a little hot sauce.  I always order the fried green tomatoes, which come out piping hot, usually 5 in an appetizer size serving and covered in shredded lettuce and scallions.  The tomatoes are juicy and the breading is crunchy and a little bit spicy - just thinking about them makes me want to head over there for my own order.  It's a size big enough for sharing but they're good enough that you might not want to!All of the portions are enormous - my brunch order of the Southern Eggs Benedict was huge, with what felt like a pound of spicy roasted potatoes, a big scoop of cheese grits (yum), and two rounds of cornbread, covered with a generous slice of ham, two poached eggs, a whole roasted roma tomato and a lot of creole hollandaise which is essentially hollandaise with a generous sprinkling of creole seasoning.  It was delicious, though I definitely needed maybe 1/3 of the potatoes.  The fried chicken dinner, again massive in size, is a good bargain though I wish the chicken was a little juicer.  It is legitimately a half of a chicken fried.  The chicken, sadly, was solid but not amazing.  The collard greens are really good and vinegary and the mac and cheese was good but again not amazing.  My friend's mashed sweet potatoes were really good though as were the regular mashed potatoes.  My other friend's jambalaya was also really tasty.Come check it out; just be sure to be very hungry and willing to wait a bit from a service standpoint.

For 5 dollars (no, not a footlong goofy) you get rice, salad, chicken breast, grilled beef, grilled pattie, gyros meat and one fried chick pea ball (Filafel). Now the meat sizes are small but the variety makes it very heavy. It also comes with creamy white sauce and fiery hot red sauce. They are moving to the former Barnum and bagel location by Dempster and Skokie Blvd which makes it even more convenient for us. Nice work Pita Inn!

I eat just about everything, but am not too big on the REALLY exotic stuff like the blood meat. They offer a buffet on the weekends and it's awesome. They have so many choices and so many of the staple dishes. The lumpia, caldareta, beef steak, sinigang, menudo, and turon are AMAZING here! My husband loves their kare kare. Basically everything offered in the buffet (items listed above and the lechon, adobo, longanisa, etc) are good and it's reasonably priced. My only issue is that the food isn't always hot. It's on the lukewarm side. Maybe they could do something to fix that issue.

<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,4/17/2014,0,22,1,10,5>I've been coming here for 10 years with 2 cats and 3 dogs. Prices are completely reasonable, care is great, people are friendly, and it has that comforting animal hospital smell (gag). Never had a bad experience. They take new pets of existing customers only. For those who are upset that they are not taking new customers- they are too small to be taking new customers- the existing customers are too happy to leave.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/6/2014,4/16/2014,14,42,1,6,4>This restaurant is a solid 4 if not 4.5. I have come here on several different occasions. The atmosphere is nice and food quality top notch. I really enjoyed on how the matradee spent so much time with us picking out the right bottle of wine. He was so helpful and found us and our party the bottle that we were looking for. I really come here when I want to sit down for a nice long dinner and not be rushed. It is truly a top notch restaurant in everyway here. There is a valet parking and is so convenient here it is the only way to go.
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,4/15/2014,26,20,4,10,6>Evanston' first brewery! I went there on the first Sunday, just two days after they opened, and it was nice and quiet there, so we were able to get great service. The six beers on tap were all great. They offer 4oz samplers, 1/2 pint, 1 pint, and growlers to go. The prices are good, especially for the quality of the beer. The Smittytown Tart (an ESB with cherries) and their porter were my favorites. They also have a rye pale ale, an ESB, an IPA, and a wheat beer with blueberries. So it's a bit of something for everyone. They could dress the place up just a bit, but they're new and will have plenty of time to make minor improvements. I hope they start serving some food though, at least appetizers. Overall, a great place to hang out and have quality beer.
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2014,4/14/2014,58,347,4,7,7>Poochie's... it's not until the weather's gotten so bad that it's not easy to drive there that I fully realized how much I miss being able to eat their delicious burgers whenever I want...Everything I said before is still true... except the important part is... Poochie's is consistently delicious EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I've literally never had a bad meal here, though I usually stick to either a variation of the charburger or the turkey burger. It's always juicy and cooked perfectly with just the right amount of char flavor, and while the hand-cut style fries aren't always fried for each individual order, they are never soggy or cold, though fresh is best, of course!My favorite is definitely that magical, juicy, meaty turkey burger. I don't eat it to be healthy since it's definitely just as fatty as a regular beef patty, it's just different and altogether delicious. I have not been able to find anywhere else that makes a legitimately delicious turkey burger.Poochie's has become my favorite quick burger place in the area. And their consistency deserves the full five stars!
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/2/2013,4/13/2014,94,254,2,8,7>It's been a favorite dining spot for me since my pre-teen years and I have to say...it's still the same...the greatest thin crust pizza ever! They serve more than just pizza, such as salads, sandwiches, burgers, and appetizers, but you really only come for the pizza. They serve a very nice, very thin, almost paper thin crust with just enough fixin's to please any crowd. It's always busy in here when we come and they have a full service bar. It's casual and you order sandwiches, salads, or pizzas on the right side of the restaurant and the left side is for drinks, sodas, and beer. They sell by the pitcher as well.I love coming here with the family and now I come with the grandchildren!
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2014,4/12/2014,56,146,2,7,6>I don't judge a nail salon exclusively by the salon itself but rather by the quality of its employees. I definitely recommend Kelly Nails for their friendly and efficient staff.I came here for a mani-pedi (my no-chip had grown out and my toes needed some spring refreshing). I walked in at 10AM (they open at 10AM, not 9AM) and was greeted by friendly nail techs who had already started the pedicure whirlpool chair. I picked out a few colors and sat down. What I noticed immediately was that this place is efficient. One of the managers (I think) started to help remove my no-chip (with a special no-chip removal process) while Tiffany started my "luxury pedicure"- for a few dollars extra you get a hot towel and special skin scrub. Pedicure water temp was great! (I've had super freezing water before- no-no).What I love about Tiffany is that she is fast and super efficient. She was friendly and we actually had a conversation about her family and my dog and her background. She's super funny, laidback and was smiley and friendly! She completed my pedicure and while waiting for them to dry- started my manicure. The entire painting process was fast and efficient- and I went to the dry-bar area to dry. This store has a selection of jewelry and Hello Kitty items for sale and also does permanent makeup, hair extensions, waxing and extensions. Their nail polish selection is decent and the space itself is wide and airy.Minus one star because I felt rushed- she had another client immediately following while other nail technicians just sat around. It also felt really chilly in the salon.
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/31/2014,4/11/2014,34,75,2,7,6>My friends and I come here every week for breakfast. This place has everything you're looking for in a diner: good coffee, nice selection of egg, pancake, etc breakfast dishes, pleasant waitstaff, and cheap prices (they also do a Wildcard discount). I've been coming here for over a year, and still haven't gotten tired of the food. Also a great place for any sized group.
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,4/10/2014,291,119,4,7,5>This place is fantastic! It's super close to school, fast service, great food, and good deal! They make their own pita bread here and it tastes like heaven. I highly HIGHLY recommend getting CHICKEN SCHWARMA. Whether it be on your plate or sandwich, the chicken here is so juicy, tender and flavorful!!! I'm drooling thinking about it. I also love their falafels - nice crispy crunch and consistently good. I went there twice in one week... lol.. just because I couldn't stop thinking about it. The beef schwarma was okay... not nearly as good as the chicken. And I loved the hummus and hot sauce they have. You just can't go wrong. GO!!
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2013,4/9/2014,88,154,3,9,7>We had no idea this place existed until I was craving a burger and Big Twist popped up on yelp. Thanks to the good reviews, we decided to give it a try and it was great!The exterior of the restaurant kind of looks like an old convenience store (orange and white striped roof) but the inside is spacious, clean, and modern. We were very impressed by the decorating and the quality of their furniture. There were also 3 large flat screen TVs! This would be a nice place to hang out with friends.They had recently just updated their menu so they only had one to look at on the counter. We decided on the On the Sunny Side Burger (6.49), the Zing Chicken Rice Bowl (6.99), and the Spicy Cheese Bites (2.99). The On the Sunny Side Burger came out on a cute wooden slab and it was good. It was giant! It came with bacon, a sunny side up egg, and a hash brown. After eating half, I was full. The cheese bites were interesting- giant cubes of cheese (not sure what kind). The Zing Chicken Rice Bowl was giant! The leftovers lasted me two more meals. The food was all very good. It tasted fresh, and healthy, even.  Service was excellent. We met the owners, and they are very professional, friendly, and made us feel very welcome. We will definitely be back, and you should give them a try too!
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2014,4/8/2014,163,595,5,10,9>I really cannot speak highly enough of this place.  The wife and I decided to go here on a whim on a Thursday night.  We get in and it has an old school feel that just works well with any Italian restaurant.The place is definately small (maybe seats 30??) and the tables are close.  But it all adds to the intimacy of the environment.So my wife and I started with the fire roasted artichokes.  Fresh, clean and simple.  The only complaint was they gave 3 and there were 2 of us.  Good thing there was a knife to split the last one!So I got some veal meat balls and shells.  Absolutely perfect, and enough for me to eat the next day at lunch.  My wife got some lobster ravioli with vodka sauce.  That sauce was amazing, the ravioli had great flavor and texture, but I personally would have wanted a little more lobster.
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,4/7/2014,3,26,3,8,6>I absolutely love coming into Bluemercury! The layout is wonderful and they carry an array of different products - from hard to find-in-America products like Darphin to Laura Mercier makeup and wonderful hair lines like Oribe and PHYTO Hair Care. The store associates are always friendly, never pushy, and best of all, they are generous with their samples (which note to other companies - the more generous you are with your samples, the more likely I am to buy that product in the future from YOUR store!). The location is convenient - right on the corner of Central Avenue and 2nd Street - and there is plenty of free parking all around. If you're a beauty junkie like me, or just want to restock on some products without having to drive all the way to the mall, I highly recommend that you stop by!
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,4/6/2014,11,25,4,11,6>The ambiance is what makes this place so fantastic. And the tap selection. And the friendly service. We thought the menu was just a little limited when we went in, but they had just opened and I forgot to ask if the menu might be expanded later. We just had soup and drinks to celebrate St Patty's Day. The location is perfect in The Glen and they have both local and traditional beers. Of course, you can go up the street to the Yardhouse and get a better tap selection. But, it not as warm an friendly. (The bartenders spent considerable time with us.) And, I really place a lot of emphasis on ambiance and this restaurant got it right. It is a nice addition to the Restaurant scene in The Glen. This review doesn't really reflect the food so much, but I will update is as I return and try new menu items. Five stars means I would return again and again. This is a place I plan on frequenting.
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/22/2014,4/5/2014,12,30,5,6,5>Minestrone! The warm panini with mozzarell & peppers. The Pepper & egg sandwich. Feel free to skip the $6 take-home personal pizzas they sell here. No bueno.You don't really get any kind of Sopranos fantasy that you're at Satriale's or anything, since you eat in an enclosed shopping center that looks like it hasn't been renovated since the early 90's, on a small table in front of a lady's plus-sized fashions store, with Muzak in the background.  BUT! The food is amazing. I also thoroughly enjoyed the guy behind the counter with the Black Flag tattoo slicing the meat who looked like he was up to no good.
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,4/4/2014,6,26,2,6,5>Great choice if looking for a higher end restaurant in Evanston. Located in a cozy space underneath the Davis Street metra station. The New Year's Eve tasting menu included: sweet corn and coconut soup (too sweet), pan seared branzio filet (excellent), black berry cabernet  sorbet (very nice), seared New Zealand lamb loin (see note below), baked Camembert cheese and caramelized pear (outstanding) and milk chocolate Italian butter cream cake (to die for). Instead of the lamb loin, I had an excellent risotto with fresh spinach and mushrooms (special order). I've eaten here several times over the years and have never been disappointed. They have an extensive wine list, and the wait staff are professional and knowledgeable. This restaurant is not inexpensive. The above meal was $85 without wine although they did give us a complimentary glass of Cava which was very good. This is a great choice (local, fresh, reliable, unique) to go for special occasions. I'm looking forward to my next visit.

Very friendly people and they always give u extras for free like cards and ribbons etc.   It's like home when u go inside the shop, they really know how to cater your needs. I'll never go to any flower shop until this one closes down which I hope not. ..

ZOMBIE DUST OMFG RIGHT HERE. After being saved a six pack for one of the wonderful people who works here, I will never, ever shop anywhere else. Also: the wine selection is great. Also: the small liquor section is also great. Please, no more Davis St. No more desperate Jewel nights. Just go to the Wine Goddess.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/28/2013,4/1/2014,49,140,2,7,5>I love the Naf Naf in Niles, but live and work in Evanston, so it isn't very convenient to go there. I was thrilled when they opened this location! It's a different set up than in Niles- you can only get a bowl or pita, no plates here, and the meat selection is more limited. It's exactly like Chipotle- you order your food and they make it in front of you. By the time you make it to the register, your food is ready.I've been a handful of times since they've opened, and have experienced good service every time. When it's slower, the management has given me free pita/baklava (Tip- their baklava is not made in house, and is very skippable), and they're happy to let you try anything you'd like. When it gets crowded, the line moves quickly. The food is delicious, it isn't expensive, and the service is good. Also- the music here is the best! I don't typically like what they play in restaurants, but if you're into reggae/hippe music, you'll love this place- Sublime, all the Marleys, Gentleman, Pepper, Ben Harper, Rebelution, Jack Johnson. I'm from NorCal, and this is a blast from the outdoor music festivals I grew up going to.
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,3/31/2014,57,116,2,6,5>This is a really great little (and I do mean little) Taco place.  We love it and come often to pick-up dinner of Friday night after all the kid's activities are done.  Its one of the few places that everyone in the family loves.Guacamole is fresh and delicious.  In fact everything here is fresh from the guac to the tortillas to the pineapple (more on that later).  This is definitely not your run of the mill taco place.You can get all of the standbys here - Tacos al Pastor, skirt steak, Old el paso (ground beef) for you gringos.  I'm a big fan of the Crispy Shrimp with watercress and  Serrano cream.  My wife goes for the tilapia or vegetarian and the kids are all about the skirt steak.  Also worth mentioning is the yummy al Pastor, spicy pork topped with a refreshing slice of pineapple.  I usually get two shrimp and one al pastor.  Two tacos for the kids, three for me.The place itself is cheerful but small - I bet there are not more then 15 seats in the whole place.  Usually this is fine but it can get crazy on Friday night, so I recommend take out.
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2014,3/30/2014,2,61,3,13,6>Awesome shabu place. Just a note that this is korean-style shabu (most places are chinese style).  The difference? Not much, but the flavors will be slightly different and everyone gets their own broth pot (instead of a large shared one).Food was good, service is great, and the price is extremely reasonable.  For those that have never done shabu before, here's the breakdown:Choose a meat choice, choose a vegetable assortment choice, choose a broth, choose dipping sauces, choose extras (optional).1) Beef is by far the most common meat choice, I think most people will have trouble distinguishing between the 3 qualities of beef, so you can opt for the cheapest one. 2) Vegetable assortment comes in 2 choices, so pick the one that you fancy.3) Broth also has 2 options, Seaweed-based (much cleaner) or Chicken-based.  You then have an option of adding additional seasoning, Kimchi or Miso, to your base broth, so 4 potential combinations.  I had seaweed+kimchi, was very good.4) You get to choose 3 of 6 dipping sauces.  Ponzu is pretty standard for most people and  I particularly enjoyed the asian mustard (has a bit of kick, so be weary).5) They have tons of extras you can add for a price.  I highly recommend adding the kalgooksoo, it is worth the $2.Once you've ordered, the servers will come and pour the broth into your individual pot and bring your food.  Here are some rules to "proper" shabu:1) Let the broth get to a boil before dumping stuff in. If you put stuff in before the liquid boils, things will not cook and it will take even longer to get to a boil.2) Put in small amounts of stuff at a time, usually enough for 3-4 bites.  Wait 30-60 secs for stuff to cook (depending on what it is), fish out to plate, eat, and re-load the broth with more stuff.  Adding everything you have into the broth is not recommend, nor is putting in one cabbage at a time.3) Dip your meat/veggies in the sauces, wrap in the radish wrappers if you want to, and enjoy.4) Periodically use the strainer to skim fat out of your broth.5) Save any carbs for the very end of your meal (aka noodles). Over the course of your meal, the broth will thicken and become enriched with flavor from all the stuff you've put in.  This is when you want to cook your noodles.6) Be satisfied.

Since I have a teenage son, I have visited them often lately. Quick, thorough and so easy. They managed my car rental for me and negotiated with my insurance agency. They even replaced my rear bumper for free after the tow truck scuffed it. I love these guys!!
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2013,3/28/2014,5,8,3,18,15>Went here with my family for lunch. Our normal is Lalos in Glenview so we decided to give this place a try since it's closer to our house in Morton Grove. The food was great. My dad doesn't normally like skirt steak, but he and I liked the steak here. It's very tender and full of flavor. Mine came with a garlic sauce but they put it on the side without me asking. It was good, but thankfully it was on the side because it allowed me to enjoy the steak plain which needed no improvement. My dish came with plantains, cheese, rice, leeks, black beans and steak (I can't remember the name but it has Las Fuentes in it) and everything was great either on their own or eaten together. The tortilla chips were so good, freshly made and warm each time they came out. The salsa could use some improvement but was good enough. The margarita was delicious and comes in 12 or 16 oz or can come by the pitcher. Service was great. Prices are more than one would expect but the portions are large so you get what you pay for. Will definitely be stopping by here again.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,3/27/2014,32,212,4,8,7>While the American Toby Jug Museum may have an inconspicuous street-level entrance on Chicago Ave., downstairs there is a spectacular display of colorful and curious Toby and character jugs. In fact, this museum hosts 8,000 jugs, which are (usually) ceramic jugs molded to depict the full body (Toby) or the head (character) of a person or animal. The jugs span the early 1800s to the present, and most of the jugs are of American and European make, but there are also a handful from other parts of the world. It was fascinating to walk through the aisles of jugs and see the historical evolution of styles and crafting ability. Don't forget to look at the mirror behind the jugs so you can see their backsides. The museum staff are very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions. I highly recommend making a trip here!
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/20/2014,3/26/2014,29,98,4,8,5>This place is a pale shadow of its other burger outlets, primarily on the grounds that its menu only features s few of the dozen burgers they are known for. Fortunately the several french fry treatments and the milkshakes translate over perfectly. I topped off my spicy #4 and cheddar fries with a delicious espresso milkshake.There's the whole fish side of the place that I'll have to get into on my next visit.The space, where Kim's kitchen and then Fraiche were located seems too small to handle the business volume but time will tell. For the first week of business I was really surprised how decent the service and kitchen were.

They take their time and are meticulous. So no, you can't be in and out in 20 minutes--it's not that kind place- a manicure takes 45 minutes and your nails look amazing after.The owner makes the most wonderful sugar scrubs-- I wish he bottled and sold them.Even though I'm not here as often as I want to ( those kids keep eating up my time!!) the owner always greets me as though Im there every day.My older daughter loves coming here and one should always trust a 4 year old!

And the first 10 times I came here, I didn't even have the pie!!But now, I've had the pie, and the chicken pot pie, and the little stuffed savory bites and that MEAL SALAD - OMG THAT MEAL SALAD - and it is all good. As a pie diner goes, this is the sh*t. I don't think that I've EVER tasted a better pie crust. I would re-order everything I've had AND on top of all that - they also play really good music. And the Chai Latte, ugh SO good. And they have their own recipe book with instructions for recreating that perfect butter crust, and they're totally hipster. JUST. SO. GOOD!I rarely use this many all caps, so ... trust this, if you want a good lunch or pie and coffee or salad experience, go to Dollop/Hoosier Mama.PS - they have good wifi and other people working and drinking coffee and tea for hours, so you will feel comfortable whether you're alone or in a group. They have every type of seating option - couches, big tables, small tables, counter, etc.

<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/8/2013,3/21/2014,362,467,4,8,6>This was probably one of the most impulsive stops I have ever made. I was literally driving back to my apartment from O'hare when I noticed on Yelp that Le Sucre was on the way home. Decided to have faith in fellow Yelpers (4.5 stars with 100+ reviews!) and made a quick stop. By the time I had gotten there (around 4pm), the cupcakes were mostly gone, but I managed to snag a Red Velvet and Salted Caramel. The lady working at the front is very friendly. I overheard her talking with another customer and apparently the place is pronounced something along the lines of "Le Sook" instead of "Le Sook-ray" as I expected. Anyway, I digress.The good: - cupcakes are moist, a good size, good frosting to cake ratio, not overly sweet.The meh:- Although I appreciate the more subtle sweetness of these cupcakes, the flavors were almost too subtle... as in I had a couple bites of the salted caramel then a couple bites of the red velvet, and the flavors were quite similar. If you blindfolded me and had me try a bite of both, I'm not sure I could've distinguished the flavors. - Two cupcakes came out to about $6 with tax. A bit on the pricier end. I would give the cupcakes 3.75 stars, bump it up to 4 for friendly service.

It' seems weird at first to get a massage with others in a big room but it's very relaxing and it didn't bother me to have others in the room as well.  It's a fully clothed massage and they work your entire body.. not just your feet.  The staff is very friendly and I felt comfortable telling them what I wanted.(I've been to a similar asian-owned massage place and they weren't as welcoming..kind of mean actually. I was so afraid to tell them anything and everything hurt and tickled. Long story short: most stressful hour of my life..laughing and crying from pain is a lot of work!)...but not this place!I highly recommend this place. You can't beat the price and you will wish it was never ending. Super relaxing, friendly staff, clean... can't get any better!

Bill and Bernie (store manager I believe) two of the most genuine and savvy guys in business, pawn shop aside.  The store is not only an outstanding place to transact silver & gold, but has a stunning selection of vintage odds and ends. They have some interesting jewelry, not much vintage, but great pricing and fantastic attitudes. Next time you have a silver or gold piece to sell (or a piece you're not certain about), coins, or simply something usual and interesting, stop in and speak with Bill. I promise you'll make his store a habitRon & Belle Kolman.

Sure the prices are slightly more expensive than your local Walmart or Dominick's, but that is the price of good food and of supporting local businesses. Their coffee pork chops are amazing, as is their chimichurri flank steak. Rick is always a great guy to talk to and more than willing to order something in for you if you want a special type of meat.

This is my first experience with private acupuncture (only had community prior) and I am in awe of the effects. I went to Lori initially for TMJD, and have since sought her assistance during a very stressful time in my life for anxiety and digestive issues. Her treatments are right on the mark without fail. She listens and is truly professional and kind. And I love the lasting effects I get when she sends me off with an ear seed or two. I am a huge fan, and now cannot imagine life without my treatments at Wellspring!
<review# 255,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2014,3/15/2014,2,27,2,6,5>My review is based on vitamins and supplements only. The selection of food is good for a small store. The prices are a little high. We usually shop at Whole Foods but JD Mills has a MUCH BETTER selection of vitamins and supplements! We first went here because we were looking for several supplements that the Whole Foods supplement/vitamin employee had never even heard of and a smaller store in Rogers Park had never heard of . The employee at JD Mills knew about both the supplements we were looking for, took us to exactly where they were and there were multiple brand choices for each. We then looked around and found a good selection on a lot of different products. We have been going here for vitamins and supplements ever since.

<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/22/2014,3/13/2014,2,11,3,10,6>I cannot imagine why this bar has only 3 stars at the time that I am writing this review. This is how to navigate the World of Beer: 1. Bring your own food - you can actually do this! So buy a rotisserie chicken from Whole Foods, or some Naf-Naf across the street, or go crazy and bring a crockpot full of German sausages for all of your friends to enjoy at your table.  This is an amazing perk.  2. Order off the draft menu, which is constantly changing, and has 20+ options, all of which are good quality, exciting beers and ciders.  Plus, all beer tastes better out of the tap.  (Or so says people who I find to be more experienced than I).  I agree the bottle menu is super confusing, unless you're coming in specifically for a "barrel-aged, imported blah blah blah".  If you're not looking for something too specific, or if you have an open mind, definitely look at the draft list!3. If you need a server, smile at one hopefully, and they will usually stop by to take your next drink order.  They're not pushy here, so you can just hang out and read art textbooks while your S.O. watches the game, while making two beers last three hours.  I enjoy this aspect.  I find it to be very helpful to my cheapskate, lightweight ways.  I've never had bad service here- even when it's busy, I've seen the servers out on the floors scrambling, and I know they get to me eventually, and they're usually cheerful and upbeat when they do.  Love it!  When it's not as busy, I've always been able to make my next order easily and efficiently.  Everyone here is doing a good job!
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2014,3/12/2014,130,318,6,10,6>Took my baby's mama here the other night to celebrate Valentine's Day. We enjoy going out before or after the 14th to avoid all the riff raff and crowded-ness. Glad we did, as the dining room was only about half full on a Tuesday night. I also purchased a Groupon here, with the idea that it would be a a bit lighter on the wallet for such a  fine dining experience as Michael is. Probably one of the best Groupons I have ever purchased.Wife and I each had a five course meal. First course I had two beautiful divers scallops and the wife had a potato soup, both amazing. Our main courses consisted of a foie gras stuffed hen and a duo of beef, and desert we had the praline souffle and some kind of canolli. The food and service were absolutely fantastic.One small problem was the temperature in the room. My wife was freezing her butt off almost the entire time. Every time the door swung open it seemed to send a gusty draft throughout the room. We asked the waiter and he told us they were experiencing issues with the furnace. While it wasn't a deal breaker for us, it hindered our experience a little bit . But it also allowed for me to cuddle my boo a little closer, and since we like to share meals, it was certainly a "Lady and the Tramp" type feeling and brought us just a bit closer :-)Overall we spent about $150 with the Groupon and three glasses of wine. They also added 20% gratuity to the bill, which I think is a bit high to add as an auto grat. Now, having come from the service industry, I ALWAYS tip 20% for great service, and it was nothing short of attention to detail and terrific service at Michael. I would have tipped the 20% anyways. However, I'm not really a fan of adding that much of a grat unless we are talking about parties of 6 or more. In any case, if this is a fine dining trend then excuse my French, as I only come to places like Michael for special occasions. I would definitely come back here again when I can afford to do so. This is a terrific fine dining spot that has the feel of being in the city. We loved the location right on Green Bay Road, with the Metra train flying by every so often. Really a nice spot and a beautiful restaurant to boot.

I came in near closing time on a Saturday, and not once did I feel rushed. They were quick but precise; not to mention the amazing massages they provide after. I definitely recommend this place! Prices are low, but quality is definitely high.
<review# 260,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2013,3/10/2014,98,61,3,10,6>I can't believe I forgot to write a review for this place.The quality of the sushi and sashimi here is far better than the other locations near Northwester/Evanston area. It's the most authentic and my favorite this about the place is that it's CLEAN. The plating is clean, the food is clean, and the interior is clean. It just makes the whole eating experience better.Food: chirashiI tend to always get the chirashi whenever I goto any Japanese restaurants, and honestly, the chirashi here at Kuni's is far better than other places, but still not fabulous. I have yet to find a restaurant in the Chicago area that has a decently priced but delicious chirashi - any yelphelp?

If you have never tried a sandwich at this place, I recommend the Al Forno or Country Club (if you like spicy food), Chicken Caesar, Made Man (barbeque sauce), Classico (vegetarian) and Meatball (if you don't like chicken). You also have the option of creating your own sandwich, but being the busy Northwestern student I am, I just always go for the menu items instead. Home made chips are 50cents extra, but totally worth it. Just wish they gave out more chips than just 8-10 pieces. Haven't tried and don't plan on trying the soup because I am not a soup person, but I'm pretty sure there are other reviews that talk about it.

We also had the onion ring appitizer.   It was really good.   Homemade.   The french fries were also above average.   The server was ok.   Very personable, but needed help on the drink re-fills.   Ok... To the main attraction.   The fish'n chips.  Superb.   Really great Cod.  Hand dipped and fried to perfection.    The portion wasn't big, but that was ok.   I would go back for this meal.    Maybe make the kids try something else.

I crave the cappellini pomodoro with chicken and frequently order delivery to satisfy the urge. The portion is huge, two meals worth or more, and their sauce is light with a lit of flavor. Skip the bread. I order sundried tomatoes, kalamata olives and chicken to make a great pizza. Delivery can be a bit slow, averaging close to an hour but plan ahead and it is worth the wait.....or go eat in.

Andy is super nice and is more then willing to work with you on figuring out what are the most important repairs to fix on your car. Andy also made a list for me in other small things that need to be fixed on my car that I can get repaired on a later day.  My car drives beautiful now besides some other small things that will be fixed on a later day. THE best part of all this is the thank you letter I got from them in the mail.
<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/28/2013,3/3/2014,48,93,4,8,6>Interesting concept, similar to a Chipotle, where you choose the meat you want on a plate or in a wrap, choose rice or kasha, choose toppings and then choose a sauce.  They have  house-cooked lavash chips which are light and tasty.  We tried an assortment of things and found the chicken to be our favorite, although the kibbeh was good, too.  Enormous portions give you big bang for your dining buck.  Atmosphere is generic.
<review# 268,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,3/2/2014,108,103,5,9,7>"Wholly" cow.... YES.  Mexican food done right!The vibes, colors and flavors of this place are fantastic.  I never really thought of Lincolnwood as a town with a thriving food scene, but after having dinner here, I couldn't be more wrong.I've always driven past this place on Touhy and seen Wholly Frijoles from afar.  (In the summer, they have a lovely, decorative outdoor patio area for diners to enjoy the sun).  Their name would pop out at me from a large green sign and I'd wonder what went on behind those doors/windows along a strip mall.  I can't even say "Wholly Frijoles" without smiling :) i.e. a good sign.If this place could represent Lincolnwood, it would constitute an establishment worth visiting all on its own.  They don't take reservations here, but you can call ahead (on the same day you're planning to dine) to be put on the "waiting list."  You will only be seated if your entire party is present, but there are plenty of chairs in a petite waiting area.On a Friday evening for last minute dinner plans, I called to be put on a waiting list at 6:40pm and was seated by 7:05pm.  The greeter asked our party of three if we wouldn't mind sitting at a big round table, because the smaller tables were all taken at the moment.  Hungry and eyeing the plates heavy with delicious food being whipped around us towards other tables, we opted to be seated immediately... we couldn't wait to eat.Three ladies around a huge circular table... no problemo.  The more room to set down our food... haha.  Between the three of us, we ordered:APPETIZER:-guacamole (sliced jalapenos on the side)... $7.25-steak tacos (3) with a side of tortilla soup... $9.50MAIN COURSES: **Apologies, I don't have all the exact names**-Bistec dish (steak marinated in Corona beer and lime)-Chicken-Breaded ShrimpThe main dishes were around $18.00 per head and they came with your choice of tortilla soup or salad and a side of beans.  Based on the reviews, the soup seemed like the favorite.  Expecting it to be like chili, I was surprised that it was more like a lime-infused tomato soup, with fried tabs of tortilla adorning the cup with a drizzle of sour cream.I ordered the first course (the bistec) and had it cooked medium-rare.  It came out tender, succelent, the sauce was rich and flavorful (with a strong hint of beer) and I felt like it had been marinated forever, allowing all the flavors to seep in.  It came with two kinds slices of grilled squash (jicamba?) and a type of mashed potato with an orangey hue (sweet potato?).Sorry my descriptions are so vague... guess I was too busy enjoying the food!  I tried a little bit of the other courses and they were great, and I was wowed by the plating and presentation.  The atmosphere was lively and festive, the decor was colorful and the service was warm.  There was no room for dessert.**Heads up** They do not split the bill for individuals.  Our server was attentive, friendly and all the staff handled a bustling Friday evening very well.  It's BYOB... and it's the kind of place where the server would bring over say... a gigantic, glowing dish of fried iced cream and a neighboring table would look over, all want it, and engage in friendly conversation, joking about their jealousy.Next time, I'll be adamant... and save room for dessert.
<review# 269,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/11/2014,3/1/2014,32,156,6,8,8>Does Michael's even NEED a review? No. but I do love a hotdog, so here we are.Michael's is the quintessential HP eatery-- TONS of teenagers, and lots of families where everyone is getting hotdogs but the mom, who is eating a salad, and service is very friendly but clearly no one is in a rush (read: takes FOREVER.) The hotdogs are good, and the burgers are REALLY good. Merkts cheese, which is always a plus. DELIGHTFUL '90s decor in the giant room in the back-- it feels like the Max, or a really awesome teal-and-purple 90s bar mitzvah party. I mean, I love this place. So weird. It has everything you could want if you like greasy food from a grill, salad, baked potatoes, or frozen yogurt.

<review# 271,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2013,2/27/2014,23,10,10,10,8>The next two notches on my belt will have a name: Lawrence Deans. As you enter the bakery, the 'farmhouse' screen door conjures childhood memories of autumn days when you'd enter a home, leave with a warm cookie and have that door slam behind you.  Let me give you a run-down/description of what I've had here. Be aware I sacrificed a lot for this review and it was mostly related to my weight. I did it for all of you. I swear. Banana muffin: I am extremely picky with sweets that have the word 'banana' in them. Most of the time, artificial flavoring is added to underline the banana flavor. Every single time this makes the food smell like a used gym sock covered with a gorgonzola sauce. Not the case at Lawrence Deans: the banana muffin here is simple, and wonderful. The flavor of bananas comes from, well, bananas. The muffin has a few chocolate chips on top, and a hint of spice. Aztec cupcake: I'm fine with not going to the museum of the Templo Mayor now.  Imagine an unbelievably moist chocolate cake with the warm flavor of cinnamon, cardamom and a touch of cayenne. The chocolate whipped cream topping pulls all the flavors together. If Hernán Cortés tried one of these suckers, he'd forget about gold. Almond cupcake: If this cupcake had one thing to say it would sound like Scarlett Johansson in her raspy breathless voice utter "So. Was that good for you?" The top of the cupcake has the texture of marzipan, the cake underneath vanilla/almond and a feather-light whipped topping. My recommendation? Go to the store. Get a pack of Lucky Strikes. Get this cupcake. Consume it. Have a good smoke. Cookies: (chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and oatmeal): All of these cookies are amazing. Get the variety pack. Find your favorite. My favorite is chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, and oatmeal. Chocolate Walnut Fudge: I have used this sentence once: This is too decadent. It's like saying there is too much money in my bank account. Yeah. Right. Well, this fudge is great and decadent. A small piece is satisfying. The coffee is great, the staff is friendly and passionate about what they do. From the store front to the packaging of their sweets, Lawrence Deans, is well, top notch.

They have a huge fruit and vegetable department, with tons of fresh produce. And the meat counter and deli is outstanding. What we really like is that they have lots of imported foods (Eastern European and Asian).

This was the greeting of a very excited owner as soon as I walked in to the establishment.  I thought, "challenge accepted!" Being from Mexico, I'm very picky about my tortas.  I ordered the chorizo torta which is made from chorizo in house.  I took one bite, and I was in love!  The crispy and warm fresh bread combined with the fresh and well seasoned chorizo made me think of the tortas back home.  Another thing I noticed, is that I didn't even touch the salsa bottles.  The torta was a perfect mix of flavor, spice, and jalapeno peppers for a kick.  No additional salsa was needed to add to the flavor.  I would highly recommend for you to come to this place and try their tortas.  I am so glad this place opened in Evanston.  A great little place like this in my neighborhood is what I've been dreaming of for quite some time!!

Also the lobster roll appetizer is excellent-- high quality ingredients for reasonable prices. They also have a great selection of entrees for non-sushi eaters.

Will be going back.

I came on a Saturday morning at 8:30am before the typical crowds of the day comes in and I loved it! the service was super attentive and the food came out quick but not in a way that you'd think it was prepared and made with love and care. I'm not a pro when it comes to deli food so I had lots of questions and my server was fantastic and helping guide me to trying the Nova Platter. I originally wanted to try the white fish salad but he advised me that it was a little dry when I asked him how it was - I always appreciate honesty when it comes to service. The Nova Platter was so delicious and exactly what I wanted and needed! It came with a bagel of choice and either original or chive cream cheese. CHIVE CREAM CHEESE ALL THE WAY! The bagel was lightly toasted and was very fresh and soft. The cream cheese is a generous portion, was full of flavor, light and fluffy, and melted in my mouth. Combined with about 6 slices of nova, I was in salmon heaven :) I left completely satisfied and would absolutely come back again to try their sandwiches and matzo ball soup!

This place is amazing! Downstairs, there is an awesome little (free) museum, with dinosaur eggs a dinosaur femur masquerading as a bench and a cave bear fossil and just tons of awesome little things. I could easily have spent an hour down there investigating all the little displays they had. And the ground floor! Oh, man. They have the greatest collections of trinkets in all sorts of price ranges. I saw the most beautiful shells for very reasonably prices, and I passed up on a pendant that I've already decided to head back for. So happy I discovered this place, and I'll definitely be back!

<review# 279,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2013,2/19/2014,150,103,3,10,7>My new favorite bar in Evanston.It's kind of hard to find this place, since they don't have a sign or # on their door. It's very dimly-lit and quiet inside, creating a warm, romantic ambience. You could come here for a date, or with a group of friends (most of the crowd there this past Saturday night).All the cocktails I tried were amazing. I asked the server for a recommendation if I typically like a whiskey base, and she suggested the Artist's Special (bourbon, sherry, lemon, groseille red currants). It was SO delicious - It had a very sweet and fruity aftertaste, and I'm always a fan of strong drinks that don't taste strong! For my second drink, I asked the bartender to create something similar to the Artist's Special, and I ended up liking that one even more. Meanwhile, my two guy friends each ordered the "Dark & Stormy," which was also delicious!For food, we sampled the Cheese & Charcuterie Plate - though I felt that it was a bit pricey for the amount of food we received, everything was extremely delicious. The meats were fresh & the ginger figs paired so well with the cheeses! Also, I thought they could've given a bit more bread, because we ended up with more cheese & meat leftover after we'd already finished the bread. Overall, although the food was a tad pricey, the delicious cocktails and amazing service more than made up for it. The owner and bartender really treated us like valued guests, conversing with us and asking to take a photo with us at the end of the night! I really loved my overall experience here, and I will be back often, as well as Peckish Pig (same owner as Ward Eight) when it opens!

I looked through some pictures that others have posted, and as soon as I saw those cute painted tree rings, I knew I must purchase them. I made my way to Evanston on Friday (too bad it wasn't for #shopsmall Saturday) and walked around until I found Paramour Bungalow. I absolutely adore these types of smaller boutique shops but never seem find anything that could be cute AND useful. This shop definitely proved me wrong... they have sooooo many freakin' cute and useful things and I cannot wait to come back to purchase them :)A few things that caught my attention: candles shaped as eggs in "egg containers" (ok, not too useful, but super cute :-p), adorable wooden boxes specifically to store wedding/engagement rings), lots of things associated with owls, coat racks, and a variety of artwork to hang on walls in the kitchen, living room, etc, Full of unique and creative homemade items, this is a great stop for holiday shopping for those "hard to pick gifts for" family/friends on your list ;-)

<review# 283,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/24/2013,2/15/2014,9,17,4,6,5>Amazing.  I drove by one evening last week while searching for small gifts for some beloved (but tough to shop for) coworkers.I was instantly smitten.  Everything is so amazing.  Airplants, cards, scarves, bags, amazing jewelery, glassware, I wanted it all.The woman working behind the counter (I assume she's also the owner) was so kind and helpful, and wrapped all the gifts up in cute bags and boxes.  I'll be back, and hopefully to buy something for myself!
<review# 284,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2013,2/14/2014,14,122,3,7,8>A good sandwich for a fair price.I had the sub with beef, turkey and cheese.  The french bread roll was good and the meat was good quality.  Comparing it to other restaurants like it--it has a comfortable atmosphere--a sports memorabilia wall and tables set out for you to eat there.  There's a t.v., but it's not blaring.  You get your sandwich, you eat it, you talk and you leave.  Mission accomplished.The soup of the day was chicken and well made.  All in all, a good value.  Not a place to take a hike for, but if you're in the neighborhood, I'd say go.
<review# 285,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2012,2/13/2014,6,31,3,10,6>First of all, I need to make a comment about how convenient their online booking system is. I was browsing spas in the north suburbs at 2:00am (couldn't sleep) and easily made an appointment for that same day. How easy is that? OH, and I also have to mention that if your service isn't available that day, the system will tell you the next time it will be available. AMAZING. I wanted to get around three services done and the system let me know the earliest possible date to do all three at one time. Talk about convenient.Shimmy was my technician for my microdermabrasion and facial. She was so sweet and talked me through everything she was about to do. She kept checking to see if the pressure was too much and wanted to make sure I felt comfortable. I felt so relaxed to the point where I fell asleep. Definitely worth the money. Also, this place always gives you a way to save money. (On their site, you can get $10 off if you register for an account on their booking system).Some other offers they have:$35 mani/pedi on Tuesdays$50 facials on WednesdaysThey offer something else on Thursday. Just give them a call; they'll be more than happy to let you know!
<review# 286,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2014,2/12/2014,143,199,3,8,6>Had the Nikita special which is a double cheeseburger with plenty of gyros meat on top. I also ordered a large fries with it and it was all very good. The gyros meat had darkened, crispy edges which made it even more delightful. Plus, there was so much of it, they are very generous indeed.  The burger reminded me of the Hukilau cafe (Oahu) burger which has teriyaki beef on top of it. The place itself is very small with perhaps space for 12 diners so it's a cozy and intimate place for really good and greasy food.
<review# 287,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/1/2013,2/11/2014,3,20,2,7,7>We shopped and shopped for a dress for my daughter's eighth grade dinner dance. Wanted young and fun. Found it on the clearance rack at JCPenney. It was on clearance and probably left over from Christmas (we bought in May). Anyway, it was cheaply made, had a zipper that was pulling away from the dress and was ill-fitting, but still super cute. We paid $23 for it. On a friend's referral, we took it to Sewing Masters. They rebuilt the dress by taking it in (evenly all around), shortened the straps, resewed the zipper, etc. We picked it up and it was perfect, pressed and ready to wear. For $35! A steal!! We will be back and will recommend Sewing Masters.
<review# 288,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/21/2014,2/10/2014,23,40,3,7,5>I've seen a couple chiropractors over the years, and I'm generally pretty skeptical about whether they do any good or not. In the Chicago winter, with all the snow shoveling, I must have strained my back, because it's really been bothering me the past few weeks. My wife sees Dr. Sebby and she recommended him to me, so I gave him a shot. I walked out of my appointment with my back feeling SO much better. Felt like a different back. Seriously - he's very professional, knows his stuff, and is great at what he does. I look forward to going back.
<review# 289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/27/2013,2/9/2014,35,244,6,8,7>Last week, after calling the "local" locksmith in Glenview and getting a dismissive tone... spray some WD-40 in it, they said! ... I came to Yelp and found the 5-star Non-Stop folks, thinking.. . you can't be that consistent, I was pessimistic, but called, only to find a happy voice on the other end of the phone, I described my needs, I was assured they could help and I could have a tech at my home the next afternoon. Sure enough, he arrived on-time, walked me through my options and fixed my main problem and updated a second lock I decided on during the visit. While he couldn't re-key the luggage on my motorcycle (it was wishful thinking), I was very happy with the expediency and flexibility of Non-Stop.
<review# 290,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/18/2014,2/8/2014,10,70,3,7,5>I have been waiting for this place to open ever since I first heard of the possibility.  I was not disappointed.  I had a half dozen raw oysters to start and they were much better then expected.  I was a little fearful of eating oysters so far from the ocean, but my fears were quickly laid to rest.  I then had a lobster roll.  The bread was great and the lobster hit the spot.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other seafood options.
<review# 291,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/27/2013,2/7/2014,22,299,3,7,2>This place rocks! A great third place close to home. We were actually headed to the Happ but noticed Stormy's when we parked. Upon walking in the place was packed, adults and families. Grabbed two seats at the bar. The wife orders a fat tire and I ordered a smithwick. Person brings me the smithwick and says the tap just ran out so I can have that one on the house. He gives me a sample of another beer on tap that he recommends and I get one of those too. I am not in this joint five minutes and already I'm digging it. Plenty of sports on the TV this night, bulls, sox, cubs, hawks. A real interesting and lively mix of folks on a Friday night. Some guy has a hair helmut that I never quite get over. The best way to describe it is  darth vader helmut but gray.For food we order the nachos and the parm garlic wings. Both do the trick and do not disappoint. Prices are reasonable, much more so than I expected given it's location. Way to go Stormy's, we will be back.
<review# 292,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2014,2/6/2014,40,126,2,11,6>I have been going to Egea for at least five years now, and it started with a gift certificate from one of my students.  Thank you for introducing me to a great establishment! They have excellent masseuses (Chaya and Sarah can work out any kink).  You start with a warm greeting when you walk in,  put on some flipflops, and then you're brought into the dressing room where you can put on a cozy robe and wait to meet your masseuse.  Once you're led into the room, you get to soak your feet in a warm bubble bath while you have a short  consultation on any issues that you may be having.  Then the magic begins.  I always love ending with a seat in the shower with the steam..and appear all aglow and relaxed.  You can take as much as time as you want going back to the 'real world' but while you're there, you can have a nice cozy escape.
<review# 293,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/21/2013,2/5/2014,58,347,4,6,5>I came one afternoon for a late lunch when it was freezing, and I liked the food here enough the first time that I came again 2 days later, which is pretty rare for me. But after coming twice, I think they've got some kinks to work out still. 3.5 stars for now.Price. Can add up to be an expensive lunch, but once in a while it's worth it. The best bang for your buck in my opinion is definitely the gorditas.  I think they taste the best, with the thick corn shell that doesnt get soggy the minute the foil wraps (the tacos do), and for $1 more than the tacos you get rice and beans. Burritos look like they have more meat (and probably rice and bean too), but for $6 it's nothing close to the size of a filling Chipotle burrito. I wish they gave a little more than just a tiny sprinkle of onion and cilantro for burritos, too.Service is super friendly. Everyone is helpful, confirms accuracy of big orders, and works hard to fill orders. I was offered samples of meats that I was unsure of, too.Food. It's great. All the meats I've tried are very aromatic, with beautiful bold blend of spices and a nice kick to most of them. Can't go wrong with carne asada or al pastor. More importantly, they're all distinct and unique. I also love that their beans are cooked through and seasoned, and their rice is fresh and nice too. I tried a chorizo empanada and found it a bit too dry though. Looking forward to trying more.Speaking of trying more things, it's a bit frustrating now that I can't because they're always out! I'm so curious about their cochinita pibil, but it's always been out twice, once it was just starting to be cooked again after running out. I hope that as they learn what to expect for lunch services, they'll keep things constantly available and learn anticipate when they need to cook more of something :/The lunch line is not nearly as bad as it looks. It's out the door because the indoor area is small, but I think it's probably 10 minutes max if you're at the door - certainly faster than Al's next door. Right now they are working very efficiently, but sometimes I think saying, "oh we're out of ___" and having to repeat to every customer what they do have, and waiting for the person to decide can slow them down. I wish they'd update their kitchen board daily/whenever something runs out if it's going to be a common thing.So food, awesome. The growing pains, totally understandable, but I'm going to reserve 1.5 stars until further improvement. Such a nice option to have on Noyes, definitely going to be coming here regularly in the next year.
<review# 294,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/20/2013,2/4/2014,51,66,2,7,5>Finally, a brewpub in Evanston! Temperance Beer Co. opened today in an industrial park of a space hidden behind a strip mall on Dempster. Lots of folk out to snag a sample of the first fresh beer in Evanston in forever. Its a great big open garage of a space. Glass garage doors. Communal tables. Painted brick on a wall. Wood paneling on another. Nice people behind the bar. Some really good and some fairly forget-able beers on tap. Six in total. Shirts and hats for sale. Food truck in the lot. Big deck waiting for warmer weather. This place has promise and will only get better. A good start. Check it out.
<review# 295,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/16/2013,2/3/2014,19,132,1,8,3>The pastries here are amazing and I'm absolutely thrilled to have found out about this place. I went in upon the recommendation of a friend and bought several pastries to try. They were all delicious, which was a sentiment echoed by my colleagues who also tried the cakes.I decided to order two big cakes for a party, a big dobos and a long pineapple-orange creamy tort. The owners were very accommodating in figuring out what to get and what size. Ovy also did a *fabulous* job decorating both cakes (even though I had only really asked for a small decoration on one). They both looked absolutely terrific and got lots of ooohs and aaahs at the party. Most importantly, people thought they were fantastically delicious. I have never seen so much of a birthday cake disappear at a party. It wasn't cheap, but what customized cake is? And again, the quality was superb. I am excited to continue going to this place.
<review# 296,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/16/2013,2/2/2014,0,18,1,6,4>I highly recommend Ben's TV. My plasma tv stopped working. I found Ben's TV on yelp and based on the reviews decided to give them a try. They're a true mom and pop store. Ben's wife answers the phones. I had some questions before deciding which way to go (i.e. repair or not repair) and she had me talk with Ben. They gave me the option of bringing the tv in or having them come to my home. As I had a problem with a home theater system, I elected to have them come to my home. They were easy to schedule with and showed up right when they said they would. The ended up taking my tv (after fixing my other home issue), and one day later they called to say that my television was fixed. The day after that, they delivered the tv back to my home and installed it back on its' bracket.In the day of the big box stores, I thought that personal service like this had become extinct. Ben's TV has earned themselves a new customer and they'll be my first phone call should I require any future A/V assistance.
<review# 297,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2012,2/1/2014,5,30,3,9,4>This is a beautiful shop! There is a workshop on one side where you can see the building and on the other are beautiful instruments and selections of CDs and books. I literally called on a whim. Just thought to myself, "Hey, I want to learn how to play violin." and it went further when I realized I'm an adult and I can just pay to do it if I wanted to. So I looked into it and found this shop not too far from my house and saw that they rent violins. Only $70 for three months. And because they are hand crafted and expensive, I thought I'd need a background check and full body scan... but no! I found a violin teacher through their site (Josh Huppert... highly recommend him if you're an adult learner), asked him what materials I needed, walked into their store and told them all that I needed, and I was out of there in 20 minutes! Part of the money I pay goes towards a future purchase and the rest is for insurance. Noah helped me and he was very nice, personable, and pretty funny. He told me all I needed to know and answered my question while checking me out. I didn't feel like he was annoyed, but I also wasn't intimidated to tell them I didn't know how to play at all, just that I wanted to learn. If you're wondering if you should give it a shot, I'd say, YES! Go do it! It was such an easy process. They can answer all questions, provide you with a beautiful rental piece, resources, and a list of fair-priced instructors. I highly recommend them!
<review# 298,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2013,1/31/2014,43,121,2,4,5>Newport Coffee House is a well-kept secret.  It's located in a nondescript strip mall off Waukegan Road.  It's spacious inside and has been quiet both times I've visited.  It definitely has a somewhat barren (in a good way), independent coffeeshop feel to it.The barista was friendly.  Their drip coffee was good, and so was their mocha.  The banana bread was just alright.  Newport is a great place to get work done; I just wish it were open a little later into the night.
<review# 299,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2014,1/30/2014,56,146,8,10,9>From the moment I booked a room and throughout my two day stay, I felt like a VIP.First and foremost the staff at the Skokie Hampton Inn are informative, meticulous and extremely efficient and caring. They are friendly and are extremely welcoming. I've never felt so welcomed and excited to be at a hotel! The service here is incredible! Aside from not having a vase I asked for (received flowers) the staff was so accommodating and genuine! The woman who runs the morning breakfast (more about this later) is so sweet and it felt like we were eating at her own kitchen! In fact, they take this "Hampton Inn is your home away from home" mission statement so seriously that when I commented on how delicious the maple sausage was, the wonderful employee actually made me more!!!When my friend wanted an extra blanket, because the staff member had lots to do and took a little longer he made up for it with gummy bears and treats! Such a nice touch! In terms of the room itself, I'm impressed by the quality of the suites and I wouldn't even mind living here for a few months! The rooms are clean and there are unique touches! For example, there is a heat lamp in the bathroom and the kitchen suite comes stocked with mini dishwashing detergent! Such an incredible touch! Finally, when I walked into the room I discovered that the first square of the toilet paper roll is nicely folded into a triangle! Who does that!?Finally the breakfast buffet! This was a fully stocked bar with anything you want from juice to cap n crunch to maple sausage and eggs to coffee to bagels to yogurt!!! I have been to breakfast buffets before but this was quality! I will definitely return to this Hampton Inn! Clint- thank you thank you thank you!! You and your staff made my graduation weekend incredible and we felt so much at home! Five very bright stars!This place is effin amazing! They were able to make me my favorite breakfast sausage! Can I live here?!!!!
<review# 300,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2014,1/29/2014,88,154,2,12,7>I've been waiting for this place to open, and I'm so glad it finally has. It's a fast food Mediterranean place, and it's delicious. When we walked in, we were greeted right away and offered a sample of chicken shawarma. We looked over the menu a bit and decided to go with the OMG (Olive Mediterranean Grill, cute, right?) plate for $8. You get your choice of a healthy spread (hummus, baba ghanouj, or yogurt), two favorites (bastami rice, Moroccan couscous, tabbouli salad, chick pea salad, and Mediterranean salad), and a healthy protein (chicken shawarma, steak kabob, Mediterranean chicken, steak shawarma, chicken kabob, or falafel). Then, you have your choice of tahini, hot sauce, or both. They arrange it all very nicely on your plate, and you pay at the register and find your own seat.We ordered two plates so we could try a variety of things, and here are my favorites:- Both the hummus and the baba ghanouj are very good. They scoop the hummus on your plate, and add spices and olive oil. The baba ghanouj is more green than I'm used to, but it was still delicious. They also give two mini pieces of pita to eat with these spreads. - My favorite salad was the chick pea salad. It was very flavorful, but wasn't too spicy. Also, it didn't have any onions. It has cherry tomatoes though, that are very juicy and fresh.- The couscous is amazing!! You should definitely try it.- I really enjoyed the spicy chicken kabob. It was tender, flavorful, and juicy. You get 4 pieces with your meal. The steak kabob is okay too, but the pieces aren't as consistent. One of my 4 pieces was perfect, but the other 3 were a little stringy and dry. The flavor was still good, though. - We also tried the baklava, and it was a sweet way to end our meal.Overall, we really enjoyed our experience here. Everyone, including one of the partners, was very friendly and helpful in explaining the process to us. They had a good amount of business already, and everyone seemed to be enjoying their food! There is plenty of seating, and there is an additional room in the back. The atmosphere is very nice. It's very clean and modern looking. If you're in the area, you should check OMG out, and have a quick, healthy, and delicious meal!
<review# 301,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/12/2013,1/28/2014,18,123,2,9,5>After going here a couple times I think why some people like Landmark and some people don't is the same reason: this place doesn't go out of it's way to be anything it isn't. Looking at that positively, it's called being unpretentious. Looking at that negatively, it's called not trying hard enough. One review I read on here mentions having made reservations. Really?! Reservations? It's a neighborhood bar with mostly burgers on the menu and plastic tables and chairs outside.  I think this place is a bar first and a restaurant second, but I also feel they do a great job with the food.If you like seafood, I recommend the crab cake or cod sandwiches, which are both amazing. Also their burgers are good. I can't really recommend anything that requires a knife and fork (the "entree" side of the menu which only takes up half of one page) because I simply don't think it's what they do best.I also have to say that each time we've been here the service was good. The wait staff has always been nice and they've always seemed present and aware, looking you in the eye and being friendly. Sure, they've made some mistakes with the orders once or twice, but it's never been a catastrophe and they've always made up for it.For a simple bar and grille to hang out at I think Landmark does a great job.
<review# 302,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/13/2013,1/27/2014,66,210,6,7,6>OMG a baklava place by my house that isn't drenched with honey...and they have other goodies there too like fresh baked croissants and kinafa?? Damn. DAAAAAAMN.I got a baklava platter from some random fruit market as dessert after a birthday dinner and it was pretty delicious. Lots of flaky phyllo, they used almond (which is kinda rare it seems, usually they use other softer nuts like pistachio or walnut...), and it wasn't as gooey as some places... and after that we ended up going to the actual store to get some fresh stuff.So the store was nice, clean.  There are so many different kinds of baklava there I was in heaven. Everything we'd tried was good. I hear in the morning when the croissants are fresh you can smell them outside, wafting in the wind.  I found it weird that they sell croissants but I read that this is a French/Lebanese fusion kinda place so it makes perfect sense. Love it. Will definitely be back!!!
<review# 303,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,1/26/2014,49,140,4,11,5>I had a few small jobs I needed completed around the house, and spent a long time looking for a handyman that would come to Evanston. I tried calling the Fix It Company, as they were recommended by my management company, but they never returned my calls or scheduled the service. Enter Patrick. He returned my email promptly and was so helpful and polite! I contacted him on Monday, and we scheduled an appointment for that Sunday. He showed up on time, worked efficiently, and was a very nice, friendly guy. Normally I don't like to have men in the condo when I'm alone, but I would feel comfortable having Patrick come back to fix something else, even if I was home alone. His rates are also very reasonable.It's been a few weeks, and everything Patrick fixed is working perfectly. Highly recommend! Will definitely use him in the future, and will be recommending him to everyone I know who needs a handyman. You will not regret hiring him!
<review# 304,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/13/2013,1/25/2014,3,17,4,9,6>Ohana is like a one-stop support shop for expecting families and new parents. I am so glad I found them mid-pregnancy! My husband and I went to their 6-week childbirth class, which was a really great balance of info rather than adhering to one "method" or set ideology. It really made me feel prepared for labor. We used their doula service as well, which proved to be very helpful and supportive during our unexpected induction followed by emergency c-section. Jocelyn and Gisele helped us stay calm and rational through the surprising turn of events. I also made sure to take advantage of their 6-week Mom & Baby group, which was incredibly supportive for me. Each week was a facilitated discussion with other new moms about different very important aspects of new motherhood (i.e. relationships, unwanted advice, work identity, childcare, self-care, myths of motherhood, parenting styles, etc). It was a great balance of facilitation and just natural flowing conversation. Not to mention it was a great reason to get out of the house! Just like their tagline says... Ohana is where I built my village. I'm so glad to have the "mommy friends" I made at Ohana!
<review# 305,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2012,1/24/2014,3,23,4,11,4>I've been coming to Perfectly Polished for several years, and I can't believe I still haven't written a review. I mostly come in for pedicures and the occasional no-chip. The service is always great, and my nails look great . The end result is all that matters, so what else can I ask for. I would have given a five star review, but I had a few occasions of nails not filed evenly or dead skin not polished off all that well (still good, just not 5-star-worthy). That being said, this is still the best place in Skokie that I've found so far. I have to say, this is the only place that really does expert no-chip. First, they have a huge selection of colors from several different gel polish manufacturers (like OPI, Gelish, etc.), so you're going to find the exact color you want. Every other place I had a no-chip done, it quickly bubbled and peeled, but not with Perfectly Polished. Yea, this is the only place I'd go for a no-chip mani that I know will be worth the money.Perfectly Polished tends to get pretty busy on lunch breaks and after work hours, so I highly recommend making an appointment if you want to get in after 4:00. In my experience, they've always honored my appointment slot. I am aware of other reviewers having problems with appointment windows being given away to walk-ins, but this has never happened to me in the past two years since I discovered the place. The funny thing is I stopped going to my old salon and gave Perfectly Polished a try precisely because the old place couldn't keep appointments.
<review# 306,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/21/2013,1/23/2014,0,31,5,10,5>We've gone to Carriage Hill for almost 20 years. They took care of our first dog Spunky who died five years ago and they take care of our little Hotshot. Fran and her team are amazing. And today I think they are more amazing. There was a notice about micro-chipping when I picked up Hotshot today. I realized that I had to contact the microchip company b/c we just moved. Bobby said he would get the number off of the microchip for me. I called the company and guess what? I had never registered Hotshot. Thanks to Bobby and the rest of the CHK team for putting up that notice. Without it, my micro-chipped dog could have been lost and the company would have had no way to contact us. Kudos to everyone at CHK - we're huge fans!!!

Glad to write in that the girls in the beauty salon keep me looking up to date and make me feel brand new over and over again. This is the first time I have actually colored all of my hair and not that I needed it since I'm not graying yet, but the color is vibrant and makes me feel and look younger so kudos to the team and keep on doing what you're doing!!
<review# 312,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/4/2013,1/17/2014,168,197,7,8,7>Came here for dinner the other night to light crowd.  The staff on entrance was extremely friendly and really made the experience a good time.Our table started with the guacamole dip and chips and freshness counts!  I could have eaten a dozen bowls of it!I ordered the Chicken Burrito platter.  I am a huge burrito fan and they did not disappoint.  The only thing that would have made my burrito better...spice!  I am a spicy food addict and while I know most burritos aren't spicy, a little heat would have blown this thing out of the water!The presentation was clean and colorful with the usual accompaniments of rice and beans.
<review# 313,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/26/2013,1/16/2014,90,224,5,10,8>Angela S. is right, this place does feel like a year-round art fair! Some of the artists featured are quirky and cute, some are talented tailors and knitters, some make extraordinary candles that smell soooo fantastic, and some make Chicago-themed paintings. There's a little bit of everything here, and it looks like it probably constantly changes.I found gift items and bags that I will definitely be back for asap. This is a great place to go to find that unique, handmade item for yourself or someone you like. Prices are all over the place (probably depends on the artist), so look at everything and you're sure to find something to buy.
<review# 314,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,1/15/2014,54,205,5,8,5>Trivia on Thursdays!! Great place!  We won second place, no big deal.  The bread and butter at this place are to die for.  I mean it's ridiculous how good it is.  I could eat loaves of it....the servers are great, especially this guy Greg, he really is amazing.  Very helpful, great personality, funny.  I love this place also because it's really close to home.  We can go in, have a cocktail or 12 and walk home!  I think they're having a little bit of an identity crisis, I'm not sure what type of restaurant they're trying to be, but I like it.  The bar is very sports bar, the patio is average and the dining room is something you'd find at a steakhouse or something.  I don't know if that's even explained properly, but it's very different, unclear of what they're going for.  Anyways quit reading reviews and just go check these places out. :)
<review# 315,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/23/2013,1/14/2014,213,113,5,7,6>Good pizza & Great deals.  (2 for 1 pizzas, $8.50 Lg. pizza Mon, Tues, & Wed., and FREE 10" pizza or 1L soda for orders over $20).  They've always been real friendly every time I order from here and quick.It's not the greatest pizza, but for the money and service, it'll do just fine.
<review# 316,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2013,1/13/2014,362,467,6,7,7>New restaurants in Evanston tend to have a rather quiet opening, but Naf Naf opened with a bang. I heard that they were giving out free pita/shirts from 11am-3pm today for their grand opening, and I got there at 11am. Thought it would be rather empty if I got there right on time (maybe a small line), but I was completely wrong (guess I underestimated the power of free food)- line was already well out the door. My friend told me that I HAD to try this place, and I even heard someone say they came all the way from Wilmette for the grand opening. My first thought was that I would be disappointed by the food - overhyped things in general tend to lead to disappointment. Wrong again. I got the chicken shawarma pita with hummus, purple cabbage salad, sumac onions, pickles, hot sauce, and tahini sauce, with a side of naf naf fries and a drink (all free!). I always hear people rave about shawarma in general, but I've always been disappointed - I've tried it several times before (including the famed chicken and rice in NYC). BUT I loved my food at naf naf. So many flavors and textures in one meal - loved every bite of it (so much so that I ate well past my bursting point and pretty much had to hobble up to class). The service was efficient and extremely polite. The owners (?) were in the restaurant as well asking how people liked the food. Interior is clean. Also like how you can watch staff make the pita bread when you're in line (although I felt kinda creepy pressing my face up against the glass). Welcome to Evanston, Naf Naf Grill! Will be back :)
<review# 317,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/25/2013,1/12/2014,20,82,4,5,3>I've used Now We're Cookin' for work related events 4 times.  Each time I have been pleased,  which is why I keep going back and recommending the space to others.  They were helpful in setting up the space with tables in the layout we needed, providing a screen and projector for our presentations.  Having the large kitchen with a large island is great for buffets and as a place for people to sit.  The kitchen along with the adjacent area with a large dining table gives the space an open and  homey feel.  Normally I'd avoid spaces without lots of windows but the high ceilings and skylights there is plenty of light and doesn't feel like you are boxed in a room all day.Each time Now We're Cookin' worked with us to provide meals and refreshments that were wonderful, fit our themes and loved by the attendees.    That's a tall order given that we all work in the food industry.  The food is made fresh in their professional kitchen in the back of the venue so it' s not food delivered from a caterer that is made hours in advance and just kept warm until serving time.   It was nice that we couldn't hear any noise from the kitchen during our meetings.  Parking is on the street or in a lot around the corner.  If you are there for a long meeting drop your car off at the car wash around the corner and they'll wash it  and park it i the lot for you while you are busy enjoying your time at Now We're Cooking.  Get there early enough and they may even have time to detail it.Bottom Line:  It's hard to find  meeting spaces that are unique and not  drab hotel conference rooms.  Now We're Cookin' fulfills that need and provides great food without having to deal with a separate catering company.  Each time we have sessions there I look forward to the food.
<review# 318,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2013,1/11/2014,98,320,5,6,5>We love stopping in here to pick out a handful of chocolates every once in a while. The owner and staff are always very nice and helpful. The chocolates are really delicious, but my favorite is the toffee. Everything is a little on the pricey side because it's handmade, but it's just as well, otherwise we'd be eating much more of it than we should.
<review# 319,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2014,1/10/2014,57,93,2,6,5>I LOVE this place!!It seems healthy.. you have all the food groups..sort of. They have tons of veggies, healthy grains options like kasha , proteins-chicken,steak,pork,etc, and the best part is.. they give you tons of it.  I usually get the combo platter which includes all of the meat options(they're all SO good.. I can't ever choose just one of them). They've recently expanded their plate so the portions are ginormous (see pictures). You can share with 2..maybe 3 other people.  Everything is seasoned so perfectly: the salads, meat, and side options are all so tasty..  The grains can taste a little bland if eaten by itself but I prefer it that way bc it complements everything else so well.For a healthier option, I would recommend coming here.  The staff is very friendly too making it a great place to dine!
<review# 320,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/9/2013,1/9/2014,206,154,6,9,5>I found my Thai spice! Stumbled upon this place when I was in Skokie and I am happy to say that I did! The waitress was friendly and happy to give me some recommendations. I had yellow curry, spicy beef salad, tom kha (ordered tom yum, but was pleased with the tom kha) and sticky rice. The beef in the salad was over cooked and dry but the flavors were fantastic! The yellow curry had the potatoes, carrots and broccoli on the side which was different but nothing you couldn't combine on the plate yourself. I love sticky rice and was happy to see the waitress did not look at me sideways when I ate my dinner with my hands slopping the plate with my sticky rice (it is a Thai way to eat things that makes a  lot of sense and the way I learned it while spending time in Thailand - so I was not being an animal :)). The tom kha was nice but needed the extra kick of spice or it may have fallen on the sweet side and there was a lot of broth compared to ingredients which I found a little disappointing. The spice range was 1-4. I had 2 & 3 and I found the kick to be just what I wanted. I like spice so if you don't you may want to stick to 1 or 2, as 3 was pretty spicy hot. I would definitely go back the next time I am in the area. The price was reasonable and the portions generous. It is probably more a 3.5 stars, but it took me a long time to find Thai food that wasn't sweet and had a kick! Something important to say here is that this is a THAI restaurant! Not a Thai, Chinese, Japanese concoction that I have seen around. Once a restaurant starts branching out to multiple cuisines, it loses the authenticity and heart. Right now, there is construction out front and parking is tough but you can park out front, it just looks like you can't.
<review# 321,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/2/2013,1/8/2014,9,183,4,5,4>Let me start by saying the service is the absolute best you'll get. Incredibly nice servers, the owner was there walking around talking to people. It was a slow night so he put an extra kebab on everyone's plate who ordered the special. One of the other people I was with had the carrot soup and took half home but they basically refilled her cup of soup to take home.That's customer service done right. The food's quite good too for the most part. The negative for me was the the lack of spiciness - I like my food spicy but everything was served with tahini sauce and no hot sauce. Eventually I asked for some and received some. But I also thought the lentil and carrot soups were average at best and the falafel was very dense.But again I say overall the food was good. I had the beef schwarma and it was great, very flavorful, well cooked and a good portion as well. I added some hot sauce to mine and I very much enjoyed my entree. The two others at my table had the chicken schwarma and the nightly special (which was a collection of kebabs, zucchini, and something else). I tried both and both were quite good.Dinner came with some free baklava for dessert which was very tasty (bit oily) but an excellent way to cap of a meal.I don't like commenting on decor, but the decor was drab and we all had different plates and different silverware which just seemed in such contrast to the excellent service.
<review# 322,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/15/2013,1/7/2014,50,82,2,8,5>We usually hit this place for a quick breakfast if we are at Golf Mill.  The food is consistantly good.  The reason I like it so much is that they don't mind if you have a special request.  The chef tries his best to accomodate the customers.  The omelettes are really good!  Soups and sandwiches are also very good and reasonably priced.  It's a friendly atmosphere, with a great couple, husband & wife who run it.
<review# 323,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/23/2013,1/6/2014,130,318,4,7,5>Those of you who have read my reviews know that I am dedicated to shopping at local businesses and not the big box stores. So when I decided to venture out to get some supplies for our backyard garden, I went with a local business rather than going to a Lowes, Home Depot, etc. SUPER HAPPY I DID!!!Ferraro Garden spot is just a complete hidden gem in Northbrook!!! I couldn't have found a better place to shop for heirloom vegetables and herbs for my garden. In fact, I was here in late Spring this year and waited until now to write my review b/c I wanted to see how beautiful my ORGANIC veggies and herbs turned out. Well, thanks to Michelle and the staff at Ferraro Garden Spot (and Mother Nature for bringing us plenty of rain this summer), my garden was beautiful to look at AND absolutely delicious to pick and eat from!!!! I may have spent a tad bit more money,, but the knowledge and friendliness of the staff here was unparalleled to any other gardening center I have ever been to. Ferraro is dedicated to fresh, ORGANIC products. This was a HUGE factor for me b/c my wife is strictly using organics to make baby food for our little girl. We also do a lot of juicing in our home, and organics is highly recommended for juicing as well. The quality and selection at Ferraro for organics blew away the selection I saw at Lowes. I was able to get around the store quickly and easily, and again, the staff here was SUPER nice and helpful in not only helping me choose what to plant, but giving me tips and pointers for planting and maintaining my garden. This REALLY came in handy, because as a first time homeowner who came from a 1000 sq foot condo in Wrigleyville with no yard or area for plants, I would not have yielded the type of garden I did this year without the tips I received from the staff at Ferraro.Now come on folks, compare this experience to a Lowe's or Home Depot.....I always find myself lugging around a giant pallet cart with me and getting lost in aisles. You're lucky to get any assistance at all, and when you do, they seem either annoyed and are short with you or the level of expertise just doesn't seem all that high.Trust me, people!! Shop local and get to know the people in your community!!! Companies like Ferraro that have been a family business for years are the real experts b/c they have REAL passion for the business they created!!! I will be back every Spring to stock up for my garden!!!! They also have pumpkins and hay bundles for Halloween/Fall decor so I'm sure we will be making our way over there again soon!
<review# 324,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2013,1/5/2014,9,11,1,6,3>Swung by there for the first time today, after meaning to check it out for a while. Really cool place. I'm just starting to learn about beer and stuff like that, so for me what you're really paying for is the knowledge and expertise. The guy behind the counter, Roy, was very knowledgable and recommended some great beers. They do daily tastings and offer more tastings on the weekend. Felt good to support local business and learn some things about beer. I suggest you check it out!
<review# 325,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/16/2013,1/4/2014,51,187,3,11,6>I always get the lean pastrami on rye. And it's big enough to have left overs. It's a little on the pricier side by that's compared to places like Jimmy John's or Subway and the value and quality certainly warrants the price difference. The other day I went and picked up 6 sandwiches, 2 deserts, and 5 drinks and the total was about $80. But again, the price here reflects the quality. One tip, if you're not sure what to get but have a general idea of what you like, ask the deli person to make you what they like with your preferences as guidelines. That's how I decided the lean pastrami was my favorite. And those people have the experience to know how to leave you satisfied!
<review# 326,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/23/2013,1/3/2014,18,149,4,7,4>I wish I had walked in to ArrivaDolce long before now... I've been twice in the last month, and plan to go back regularly. What I like:* really friendly people behind the counter - and they're not young kids (sorry young kids, I like you, too!), so there's a level of experience and maturity that I like.* delicious homemade soups, sandwiches, and coffees* great baked goods* great buzz/vibe in the store - people having meetings, reading, working on their computers - it has a good "hang out" feel to it* eclectic art and decor* gelato! What I don't like:* it's just a bit tight with the tables so close together, but hey, I guess that's part of the vibe that I just said I liked, so I'll go with it.
<review# 327,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2013,1/2/2014,98,61,4,7,4>This review is for the LUNCHI've been to Found several times for dinner, but this was my first time coming here for lunch, and I think I like Found even better!!- arugula and parmesan flatbreadYou usually can't go wrong with Found's flatbread. So far, I've been satisfied by all their flatbreads except for one. This one was perfect for lunch - great amount of greens, and I personally love arugula so this plate was great. The vinegar seasoning on the arugula also complemented the parmesan really well. Yum yum. One thing is that you have to eat it before it gets cold, because otherwise the cheese doesn't taste as good.- smoked salmon salad tartine with radish, crème fraiche and baby mustard greens on baguetteHmm. I'm pretty sure you could eat this as a sandwich? But I wouldn't because the two giant lumps are really big! Much easier to cut and eat with a fork - and also easier to share with other company. This was my favorite dish, because it was a good mix of hardy-salmon-meat + lots of greens + bread. 3 pluses in 1 dish.- peameal bacon sandwich with dijonnaise, kale, pickles and hardboiled eggsNot the bacon I was expecting, but wow, this bacon was very meaty and delicious. And they deep fried it so that was an extra plus. Do you like pickles in your sandwich? Because I usually do, but the pickles in this sandwich was SO SO SO SO SO SOUR! I literally did that baby-lemon face because it was so sour. It tasted better without the pickles.COFFEE. OMG. So all three of us ordered coffee so he offered to bring us a french press of the coffee. Wowwwww. The coffee here was delicious!!!!! And they give you nuggets of brown sugar that made the already delicous coffee even better. The coffee was extra thick and dark and super fresh. Trust me, I know my coffee, and they've had one of the best restaurant coffees I've ever tasted.I think Found has a better atmosphere during lunch! With the light coming through the windows, a cup of coffee, delicious food, AHHH. So great so great.When I came here for dinner, we had to order more than one dish per person to feel satisfied, however for lunch, the portions for each plates were perfect for each person. Very cost efficient and delicious.
<review# 328,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/27/2013,1/1/2014,26,129,2,4,3>This is a VERY unique place.    Take the family if you want a fun experience. This place is a time zone.  Step back into the 70's.     I took the extended family for a family dinner.   Everybody had a good time.    We took up 3 booths.  The teens, the Tweens, and the P's.   Pitchers of pop, some brews for the wife, appetizers and some pizza.They were out of root beer, and Dr pepper.  What on a Friday night....come on....  No biggie, nothing to loose sleep over.   The appitizers were marginal, but came out quick.   It's almost a serve yourself joint.   No wait staff.   The pizza took a bit longer, but was surprisingly good.  THIN CRUST.    The decor is old, the service was so-so, the food was ok.   The experience was unique, which equates to Family Fun.   We will be back.

Oh how wonderful!We usually go here in a big group with one Korean friend who speaks Korean. I know, I know... but I've been here with just a friend or two and survived; you just have to know to ask if you need something, but it really helps to know what you're going to have to cut any guesswork.Very consistent meat marinades and service. For AYCE, I prefer only kalbi and the um... I don't know how to spell it... but it sounds like cha-da-bah-gi. They have numerous banchan (little side dishes) and the pickled radish! Yum! Green onion mixture! Yum! I enjoy it more than other KBBQ places I've been to especially for their consistency.

My kids got the Mac n Cheese and a Hot Dog. I had a Cheeseburger with Merkt's cheese on it. Anything that has Merkt's on it is amazing!!! The menu is pretty standard for a "Chicago Deli" Plus others things and salads for the North Shore moms. It's also great for kids.

Every time we go in we always leave with such a good feeling and it's such a pleasure to speak with the doc's.  We've had the pleasure of meeting with Dr. Fox and Dr. Hartzen on several occasions for our pups and you can really tell they have such love for all animals. They're fun, funny and just intelligent, caring doctors. The staff is great also. We've had to call for advice (ie: dogs getting skunked or dog bites) and they've always been helpful over the phone without making us come in if not needed. They also have the best de-skunking recipe ever! This is definitely our life time vet, they make us and our dogs very happy customers.

They set the Buffet table up and then came back the next day and picked everything up.Great food, great service and reasonable prices.
<review# 336,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/20/2013,12/23/2013,29,22,4,9,5>We had heard good things about Fish Head and were eager to try the new Highwood eatery. The wife and I popped in on a Tuesday evening. The renovated space is bright (maybe too bright) and evocative of the sea - a cruise, the Caribbean - and felt a little unfinished, but we don't generally go to restaurants to look at the walls, we go for the food.The kitchen at Fish Head is the star. We started with the Yuca croquettes, which had an interesting texture and mild flavor, and the Machupichu Ceviche, which was simple, bright and delicious. One thing notable about the food is that the ingredients are allowed to tell the story. For some diners this might taste like the food needs salt, but for me it was a refreshing, deeper experience of paying close attention to the flavor.Because Fish Head is very new, the service is still a little shaky. Our experience was not lacking anything (our server was very personable and appropriately attentive), the atmosphere of the room felt like the staff were still trying to work out the pace and rhythm of the service. For the main course I chose the Sango de Pescado, a plantain and seafood soup, and the wife had the flambéed shrimp. Both were excellent. The menu had many more items we intend to try out on future visits, we will definitely return.

<review# 340,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,12/19/2013,32,212,,7,4>Thank you Yelpers for helping me find a watch store in Evanston! For $10, I got several links in my watch strap removed. This $10 was a one-time fee; any future adjustments to this watch are free. The service was excellent and friendly.Virag Jewelers is half a jewelry store, half a watch store. This split was reflected in the merchandise they carry, as well as the the kinds of requests customers had when they came into the store. The patrons were generally 30+ years old and were repeat customers. Virag Jewelers is family owned and operated and has been for many, many years. While I was in the store, another customer said she had been coming to the store for 40 years. In addition to watch and jewelry repairs, adjustments, and cleaning, Virag carries a multitude of watch straps and metal chains in a variety of styles and colors. They sell new jewelry, watches, wall clocks, and some vintage pieces (e.g. pocket watches). They also offer battery replacements and engravings in crystal, metal, and wood.I would say that their selection of jewelry is eclectic: some crystals, some jade, some beads, some pearls, some diamonds, some rings, and some earrings in unusual designs and styles.  As for watches, they carry Seiko, Bertucci, and Kenneth Cole Reaction.
<review# 341,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2013,12/18/2013,23,45,2,3,2>My family recently decided we needed a new casual restaurant for us to go to after several less than stellar visits to our regular haunts, so we've been trying out lots of places in the area lately. I have no idea why we have never come here before after years of driving by it - I think we found our new place! The ambiance was great - cozy, a big fireplace...a "lodge" is certainly a fair description. I loved it. The service was very friendly and incredibly attentive. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich and my father ordered a burger. We both thought the food was EXCELLENT and for the quantity as well as quality of the food, it was a bargain at around $10 each (you get a choice of regular fries, sweet potato fries, chips, or veggies. I had the regular fries and thought they were delicious. My dad had the sweet potato and liked them as well). My grilled chicken sandwich was huge and incredibly fresh tasting. I will def come back again! My only concern is that since the place is so small, I've noticed sometimes that driving past it that the parking lot can get pretty jammed. I can certainly see why, but I would probably avoid during peak times!

Do not fear if you know nothing about clay, the owner Andrea is phenomenal. She was extremely patient and knows her stuff. I tried it out on a spontaneous Wednesday and loved the experience. I want to come at least once a month, and seriously for the affordable price that it is, why wouldn't I! Love this place!
<review# 344,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2013,12/15/2013,29,219,2,3,2>I bought a groupon for a no chip mani and pedicure and gave this place a try. After a brief hiccup with redeeming ( which turned out ok in the end) I walked away very happy. My pedicure was amazing and my feet look great 2 weeks later. The manicure was meticulous. This is not a quick mani place- they take their time. Though I often frequent another nail place in the area, I will  abdolutely return here again, especially for a no chip manicure.Also my wiggly 3.5 yr old wanted her toes painted. The woman took her time cutting and filing her little piggies and painting to perfection. She wants to go back for a manicure!!
<review# 345,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2013,12/14/2013,7,156,1,4,3>This was my first visit to Kabul House with my husband & son. My son had been here before and recommended it. I couldn't  have been happier with my meal, the service, the presentation, everything was spot on. I ordered the single lamb kabob which came with rice (I chose dill rice) and a few vegetables & soup. The one kabob was plentiful and the rice portion very generous. The soup (chicken noodle) had an exotic flavor and was divine. I tasted the lentil soup & that will be my next choice of soups. We also shared the beef dumpling appetizer which was very tasty and nicely spiced. My husband had a Belly card so we got a free drink and my son did a Yelp check-in and got an additional 10% off the check. Will definitely be returning soon.
<review# 346,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2013,12/13/2013,52,196,3,4,4>How does a bakery survive on just cakes & cupcakes?  By having the best gosh darn cupcakes available in a 10 mile radius.I have never been disappointed with any of their cupcakes, which is to say something since I have tried almost all of the cupcakes they offer.  The Salted Caramel is the best, but all of their other offerings are almost just as delicious whether it be the Red Velvet, Carrot Cake, Strawberry, Blueberry, or the Chocolate.  The icing really makes the cupcake and has the perfect amount of sweetness.  My parents, who generally don't like cake all that much and are much more discriminating than me, only had good things to say about their cupcakes.These cupcakes aren't the cheapest, but they are well worth every penny.  Every visit I've had here, the staff has always been very friendly and helpful.  If you're looking for your next sweet tooth fix, this place is it!
<review# 347,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/15/2013,12/12/2013,56,185,4,6,6>I love shabu shabu. Something about dipping what seems like an endless assortment of veggies and meat into boiling broth brings me peace. I have never had non-homemade shabu shabu so I was pretty excited to find a place that specialized in it.Their broth is a little bland when they first pour it in, but they have many spices, including S&P, to help flavor it. I would suggest the seaweed broth because the chicken broth makes everything taste like chicken (of course, if this sounds appealing to you, all power to you. The one thing the chicken broth is good for is creating the right flavor for the "risotto" at the end).When you order your meat, the prices really do mean something. I don't remember exactly what they call each cut of meat but look at the prices. The quality of the meat is directly proportional to the price of it. Also, if you've got an appetite, I'd suggest getting an extra serving of meat.I love the array of sauces they bring you. I don't use half of them and my favorite is the Ponzu and Go-chu-jang (Korean Chile Paste), but a wide selection gives you the illusion of power. And who doesn't like to feel powerful?Since the cooking and dipping is up to you, there's really nobody to blame but yourself if your food doesn't taste very good.One last note: they play an endless soundtrack of Christian praise songs that are performed by only a piano. If you've been going to church and have a database of praise music in your head like I do, you'll have a fun time trying to figure out which song is currently playing.
<review# 348,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2013,12/11/2013,23,203,,6,5>Simple, no frills place with authentic Mexican offerings--- tacos, tortas, or burritos with your choice of carne asada, chicken, or tinga.I loved the sign that asks patrons to be brave and eat the "real Mexican way" and too not be high maintenance by asking for substitutions as it will change the flavor of the original creation.  I opted for three different types of tacos with tinga being my favorite - bold, flavorful, and had a nice spivey kick to it.  The chicken was bland in my opinion and needed help from the hot sauce.  Hubby had the bomba burrito and really enjoyed it.  It was a no brainer to have the Horchata to wash all of it down! Really liked this place and loved that we can add it as a go-to place in the neighborhood.
<review# 349,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2013,12/10/2013,33,130,4,9,6>Whoa, this place totally surprised me!  My friend and I were looking for a new place to try and I randomly threw out Euro Plate as a suggestion for the sake of making a suggestion, not to actually eat here. After wasting 30 mins talking about different options, we decided, why the hell not, lets just check it out. The place is tiny. From the street I thought it would be deeper but it is literally 5 4-top tables and the counter where you order. My love of good potato pancakes runs deep so I gravitated towards the goulash/potato pancake dinner while my friend tried the Euro Plate sampler because he just can't commit to one dish. I don't know if it's because we had no expectations but when my food came out, I was pretty excited to see two huge potato pancakes, smothered in goulash, with a side of carrot salad(my choice but they have other options).  My friends Euro Plate sampler looked awesome too, especially the polish sausage. Pancakes weren't too thin or too thick and had great crispy edges! I don't know who's in the kitchen but I now LUST for them! The goulash gravy was beefy, seasoned well and had a good amount of beef but it was all about the pancakes for me! Perfection!My friend said there wasn't one thing on his plate he didn't love, especially the cabbage roll. He declared it the best he's had.  What started as kind of a throwaway suggestion fortunately turned into an incredibly satisfying meal.  I'll be back without a doubt!
<review# 350,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/4/2013,12/9/2013,137,206,3,4,3>Fujiyama deserves 5 stars for the sushi, because they are THAT delicious and incredibly fresh. I eat a lot of sushi and have been to many restaurants in the suburbs. I used to come here with my sister a long time ago and remember it was always good, but then we found Tatami (which has since gone down) and I stopped coming to Fujiyama. I decided to give it a try a few months back and came back again last week as I was craving it so bad. Out of all the sushi places in the 'burbs, Fujiyama has by far the freshest sushi ever. Their menu isn't too extensive, but that's how it should be in a real, authentic restaurant. The prices are fairly steep, but you pay for quality here. All the rolls I've had were delicious - Spicy tuna, ebiku, ebi tempura, Doba roll and Fujiyama roll. Last week, I ordered a roll that was pink around the fish, but I forgot the name - it was AMAZING! Service is pretty good, but last time, i had ordered 5 rolls and a few sushi pieces, but they never brought out the 5th roll because the busboy who wasn't supposed to serve us, took the sushi from the chef without checking. I didn't mention anything because we were full, but the check had the 5th roll on there, so of course, I asked to take it off. My other issue is that they don't really take carryout orders - i called once and they said they were too busy, which I find a tad ridiculous. When we were eating inside, a couple came in wanting to order for carryout, but they gave somewhat of an attitude at first, though they honored their request of two rolls. Take away the service issue, this is a 5 star restaurant in the suburbs and I highly recommend it to anyone who knows and loves their sushi.
<review# 351,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/2/2013,12/8/2013,0,23,,5,2>Just returned from our first play at Oil Lamp Theater. We saw Three Viewings, a comic trilogy performed by 3 actors who were really wonderful. This 40-50 seat theater is the essence of what "Chicago Theater" is known for... an intimate space, great actors, a modest ticket price and a WONDERFUL production. The hospitality setup in this space makes you want to come 30 minutes early, join your friends, have a beverage (yes, it's BYOB for the wine, and free soft drinks!) eat cookies and relax. What fun. Ample free parking in the lot right outside the door. I am constantly amazed at the professional acting to be enjoyed in our smaller theaters like Lifeline, Writers Theater, and now the Oil Lamp. Put Glenview on your list of North Shore theater towns to discover. They have new productions every month, get on their e-mail list.

The neighborhood is not terrific, but this is a great find if you are looking for the best burger in town (British style with hash browns).

This is not always fast food, but worth the wait.Enjoy! Jennifer

I've gotten a lot of gifts here, and they've all been well received. I love looking through their scarf bowl ($1 for silk scarves!), their jewelry (tie bars are $1 - I've gotten so many of these to give as gifts), and their kitchen items. Everything is so organized in this store, and I always feel welcomed - the staff is super friendly and, even when they're busy, I've always felt like they weren't too busy to take out something from the display cases for me to look at, and they've never made me feel bad when I decided against it!

<review# 355,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2013,12/4/2013,75,193,,2,2>My favorite salon for haircuts!  I've been coming here for a year or so and I love it, even if it is on the pricey side.  I always request Audrey because she's amazing!  She is super sweet and friendly and is a blast to talk to.  When you first come in, Audrey will sit you down and discuss the sort of cut/style you want.  Then she'll give you some advice if you ask for some and she has never guided me wrong.  Audrey is a master stylist so her haircuts cost $63 but I promise you it's totally worth it!  I have never walked out of here not liking my haircut unlike other places.  She actually listens to what you want and when you ask for an inch off, she cuts off exactly that and nothing more (I've had many experiences with stylists at other salons not listening).  She is also awesome because she never pushes products on you.  If you ask for suggestions she'll recommend products but she never tries to make you buy any.  Also, if you ever need a bang trim you can come in and get one for free!  How awesome is that? The vibe here at Art & Science is sort of upscale, hipster chic and is not pretentious at all for the price.  They also offer you water, coffee, or tea when you are getting your hair done which is great.
<review# 356,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2013,12/3/2013,7,21,1,7,3>On a recommendation from my brother, I visited Christopher Duquet twelve years ago while searching for an engagement ring. Being a typical young guy, I knew little about diamonds and fine jewelry beyond what I could read on the internet. Christopher was immensely helpful, and designed a ring so beautiful that my wife and I became customers for life. Buying a piece of jewelry from Christopher is a collaborative process, and he and his team's creativity, patience, and ability to understand what you're looking for help bring it to reality. Even if you are not quite sure what you want, Christopher's ideas are endless, and he will help create something you will love.  My wife recently bought her 5th piece from Christopher. She wanted to create an everyday ring using our son's birthstone. We went in to talk with Christopher, discussed some of our ideas, and he and came up with a design that we never would have dreamed of, all while keeping our budget in mind. Within a week he emailed my wife renderings of the ring. From there he (patiently!) worked with us to tweak the design to make it just right for her. Four of her five pieces are rings that she wears everyday, and each one is worthy of being an heirloom piece. The careful design process and consideration that goes behind each piece makes them that much more special. We highly recommend visiting Christopher Duquet. Everyone we have sent has been just as happy as we are, and we will certainly be back.

The place was very clean (which is a must for me). Because I made my appointment the day of, they weren't able to get me in for a pedicure but I will definitely be back to try it out. Sundays are one of their busiest days so if you're looking to get in for a mani/pedi, I would suggest making an appointment in advance. Overall, a great experience - it might be my new favorite place to get my nails done!

<review# 360,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2013,11/29/2013,33,194,5,4,2>We eat thai food a lot. I think we've worn through our neighborhood usuals so when we get a chance to try a new place, we'll usually go for it. I met my wife here for an early after work dinner last week. We haven't been here in years, but the layout looked like it hadn't changed in over a decade. We tried the chicken wings and satay for appetizers. They were both good if unspectacular. For our entrees, we went with the pork pad thai and the chicken massuman curry. i was in the mood for pad thai, so I killed that dish. My wife liked the massuman curry a lot, so she killed that one. It's a slow cooked chicken which is different than in most massuman curry dishes we've had. It was also mild enough that our one year old could have it with no issues. The portions were smaller than in most thai places, but they were definitely sufficient. The only ding I have is that the service sooked. I know, I know, lame joke. The service was actually ok, but mostly nonexistant. We'll stop in again, I'm sure.
<review# 361,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2013,11/28/2013,24,55,3,3,2>It may not be sexy on the outside, but this established diner continues to earn its stripes. I was starving at 9:30 p.m. on a Thursday night and couldn't find an open restaurant. Kappy's wasn't what I had in mind, but at this hour, I couldn't be choosy. Theresa, my waitress, welcomed me like I was her first customer (even though they were about to close), warmly greeting me, and letting me know that I could order anything on the menu even thought it was almost closing time. I ordered the avocado omelette. It took what seemed like forever to come out. Just as I was about to complain, she brings me the biggest omelette I've ever been served, so choke full of vegetables and avocados. It was absolutely delicious. I understood why it took so long, it was massive, fresh and very tasty. Who would have thought I'd have such a great experience at a late-night diner on Dempster? Will definitely come back.  They tell me that in two weeks they're remodeling the entire restaurant, looking forward to seeing what's in store.
<review# 362,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/13/2013,11/27/2013,58,347,3,5,4>Shana moved! She's working at the location of someone else's salon now but we were still able to schedule appointments with her directly.Back in May my mom came here for a digital perm, which lasted like 5 hours. My dad and I had no idea it would take that long and decided to just sit and wait. In that time, I watched Shana and Kelly work meticulously with clients nonstop and deliver great styles one after another. My dad was so impressed he asked to be squeezed in for an appointment, because he hasn't seen such precision anywhere else (her technique is actually really interesting). Even on that busy Saturday when she was running a bit late with so many clients, she never rushed anyone and styled everyone's hair after their cut, making sure they were satisfied.So I convinced bf to come get a haircut with me the next time I needed one, at her new location. I have always been impressed at her patience. Even my old stylist tended to rush through things, but Shana had great technique and painstakingly made sure everything looked the best. Before Shana, I've never had anyone spend more than 5 seconds chopping off my hair for bangs, but after Shana they've never looked better! I didn't think it was possible to be this satisfied with a haircut, honestly. BF's desired length and style brushed dangerously with a derpy buzzcut, but Shana managed to satisfy his desire for shortness without making it look weird. That is SUPER impressive, especially compared with his last haircut...Her English isn't perfect, but she's super sweet and communication is no problem. Ask for her advice, and she's not afraid to disagree if she thinks it won't be a good idea, and in my experience so far I was right to listen to her.I don't want to give up my much more convenient, super sweet and completely capable stylist in town, but it's definitely worth the drive to come to someone who truly, truly understands hair and cares about the satisfaction of their clients, Asian hair especially!

I always walk out with something I bought for less than ten bucks. However, you get what you pay for! I always refer to LINCOLNWOOD as the mall where I can afford everything! Not literally but the prices are affordable and not like Old Orchard or Northbrook Court where the thrills aren't cheap! The quality of the stores are average but it's always great to find treasures among sale racks! I once found a pair of 70 dollar jeans marked down to 11 bucks that fit better than my 200.00 jeans! They do have stores that local malls lack like Spencer's and Hottopic which I do shop at bc they have hello kitty to feed the 13 year old in me :)Their food court is meh but they have great nail salons! Lastly this place holds a special place in my heart bc my first love worked here a long long time ago before he became a cop! Alltogether now: awwe! Lol

The only way to sweeten the pot is to hand out free sake.We've come here several times now and we are always seated immediately.  The restaurant is split into two rooms, which help to decrease the ambient noise.  On the times I've ordered to go, the service is also very prompt in getting me in and out of the door.I've tried most of the basic maki rolls: California, shrimp tempura, etc.  I personally enjoy the Moon River roll (shrimp tempura, jalapeno sauce and eel sauce) and the ubiquitous Spider roll (soft shell crab).  Their rolls are fresh and well-made.  Also, if you stop by for lunch, their bento box is a pretty solid deal.Did I mention most of their rolls are at the $5-6 range?  In Lake f-ing Forest.  I'm not sure you can beat that!  This place has definitely won me over.

Even though the lunch special is only from Monday-Friday (great deal by the way, only 4.95!) the food was still super affordable. We weren't that hungry so we got a combination plate to share. It came with 3 pieces of chicken (juicy and delicious), 3 pieces of steak (great marinade), and 2 lula (seasoned ground beef, shaped like sausage). You also get your choice of rice pilaf, but we looked indecisive so she offered to give us half and half of the mushroom pilaf (really good! Even with the onions. Could definitely taste the mushrooms) and the armenian rice pilaf (cooked in chicken broth wirh roasted noodle). Yum!!! You also get your choice of salad, and we got the cabbage one. Very fresh, light, and tasty.  It also comes with your choice of side, and we got the hummus. The pita was very thin, but was great! Even though we were sharing, we couldn't even finish since the portion was so big.The owner was also super friendly and nice. We definitely felt welcome, and had a wonderful meal!

Why is he working in Wilmette? Quality of life.The chef is young and hip but aims to please. Not a snob yet.The owner is one of the head mucky mucks @ Miller Beer. Translation: he has deep pockets and this is but a labor of love. The burger was great!These people left the city to escape the gouging , Obamazombies , tickets, fees, fines, and hassle. THEY wanted a place they'd dig themselves and they've done it with Nicks.Was everything perfect? No. But they aim to please and they'll toss whatever if you aren't crazy about it. So speak up if needed. Wanting to be loved permeates the place. They actually want to fit in and be loved by the community as opposed to other places that are "too cool for school".Living in the big city has messed me up. Forgive what you'll probably misread as snobbery. (Know that I was raised in poverty on dirt roads w/ my nearest neighbor a half mile away.) I found the prices near laughable. What? 10 bucks for mixed drinks? Those drinks are 20$ to 25$ Downtown.  Food Prices? The Butcher and the Burger (which is awful) charges double. Parking? FREE!What's not to dig?

The crowd was small for the most of the night, which might not be great for the owner, but i found it excellent. Its a fairly small place so a large crowd would just be annoying. We were able to play darts all night without worrying about hogging the boards or whatever. This place is slowly but surely becoming one of my favorite spots to grab drinks and with the specials this place is very fair priced. +1 more star from me and next time i am going to get food. If this place can dish out some good grub it'll earn all 5 in my book. either way you should check this place out, i think you'll like it. My kinda dive - yelp away
<review# 370,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/9/2013,11/19/2013,39,68,2,5,3>I recently found out that Dollop would be coming to Evanston and was so excited to be able to have it close to home. I brought my roommate with me because she loves coffee and pie, both of which can be found here. With their partnership with Hoosier Mama Pie Company, I think that it's a match made in heaven. Because today was their opening day, it was so busy with the line to the door but it moved along pretty quickly and everyone was so friendly. Their menu is extensive, offering things from pies, quiches, to sandwiches, salads, pastries, and many drink options from teas to lattes to just a casual espresso.I got the lemon meringue pie because I love me some good lemon meringue pie and it did not let me down. It was just the right balance of tart and sweet and the meringue was so fluffy... Like a cloud. AHAHAHA. And the crust. It was perfect. I actually usually hate pie crust as I'm so picky about it, it's easier to just say I don't like it but it was so flaky and well done, I'm lamenting the end of my pie. AND it looked so good that the people in line who saw me walk past with it asked me what it was and told me they would get it.UPDATE: My roommate got the mushroom gruyere quiche and the maple pecan pie and BOTH of them are delightful. The quiche was creamy and warm--but not so heavy as sometimes quiches can get--just the right amount that would be perfect to curl up with in your bed on a rainy day when you can't bring yourself to emerge from under the covers. AND the maple pecan was just right for autumn as the maple flavor flirts with your tongue and the pecan provides such a satisfactory crunch as your teeth bite down on them. The seating is a little sparse for the space but maybe it's actually perfect--open enough that people feel invited to sit down and stay a while but not all day on one cup of coffee. But maybe that will be me--I think the space would be so nice to study in or write my thesis in. I'm so much more excited about my second trip here because there are so many things that I want to try... Basically their whole menu. Hohoho.One of the best things about the space is that they have floor to ceiling windows that let so much natural light in. This place is of the most pleasant things about Evanston that I've found. What a space. (:
<review# 371,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/20/2013,11/18/2013,206,413,5,4,4>The obvious: cheap, fast cleaners. You can drop something off at 5pm to get it at 3pm the next day. That is pretty significant, if you are in a big rush to get stuff cleaned. Overall, they do fine with the cleaning and handle tuxes along with regular clothing.The not-as-obvious:Their tailors can do alright to fix things, but they're just not professionals. I've had a number of things tailored there and suffice to say I do not put Kenny's in consideration for tailoring work going forward. The "how the heck? Ain't nobody got time for that":So sometimes Kenny's can't promise the super fast cleaning they are known for. I know, it's rare. What turns out to be the reason? Apparently heat can break the boiler, or at least that's what they told me. So if you're in an urgent rush in hot weather, and need something pressed? Might want to call to make sure they can handle the schedule you're requesting.Also keep in mind that while they have two locations - the one on Chicago simply ferrets your clothes to the location on Dempster and back. So unless you need to pick up at the Chicago st location, you may as well go to Dempster because everything is done there anyway.

I ordered a cappucinno and we relaxed in the very pleasant surroundings (a hint of a 50's club or a clubby bar).  Two complimentary flutes of champagne were brought to us with another wish of happy birthday.  More smiles.The menu is varied--from burgers to the unusual.  The typical usually has a creative twist to it that enhances and the unusual is always well executed.  Recommendation: sit, relax and savour.  This is a perfect setting for all of that.
<review# 373,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2013,11/16/2013,143,199,,4,2>Yes, good home cooking and TFC. I like the nilaga, caldareta, adobo and menudo. The white rice is consistent as well. Patis and Tabasco at every table - sweet. Masarap dito. For $5.50 you get two main dishes with two scoops of rice. The food is all very tasty, I really enjoy the bulalo and Kare Kare as well. There's a buffet but that's just too much food for me. Make sure to come before the big lunch time crowd on Sunday as the place is very small. They really should try to occupy twice the space because it gets way too crowded at times.
<review# 374,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2013,11/15/2013,66,161,3,3,4>This is my wedding venue.  It was the first place I visited, but I still wanted to compare.  After three visits, I knew it was the one.  The decor might be a bit dated, but it is made up in value and service.  It is set right on the Des Plaines River and the forest preserve.  It even has a walking path that would be great for pictures.On a side note, did you know that this used to be the Villa Venice?  The Villa Venice was a well-known mobster hang out where the Rat Pack performed.  If you do not believe me, Google it!I have been working with Lindsie Parker, and she has been just amazing so far.  She has been extremely responsive and flexible.  She was willing to work with some of my ideas and create a customized package for my wedding.  I am going to come in at (or possibly under) my catering budget.My wedding is not for two years, but I have a funny feeling things are going to go well.Updates to come!
<review# 375,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2012,11/14/2013,1,6,2,6,4>The Pink Nail & Spa's Glenview location opened very recently, so my mom and I decided to check it out for mani-pedis.  It's very clean and comfortable inside - everything is brand new!  I especially like the nail technician Sam - she's very friendly and sweet.  Appointments are not mandatory, but recommended to minimize wait time.  They have a really good deal Mondays through Wednesdays - only $35 for a regular mani-pedi.  Highly recommended!  I will definitely be going back.
<review# 376,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/6/2013,11/13/2013,90,224,5,8,7>Let me first admit that I have a love for all things mid-century modern and design-driven. If it looks clean but also kinda quirky and cute, I'm SOOOOO in.So, Paramour Bungalow specializes hardcore in all things clean but cute. Towels with snarky little sayings, lambswool blankets with drippy rain clouds (WANT!), monsieur and mademoiselle mugs with mustaches, typography-themed decor, goofy sweater dolls, VERY expensive candles, oddball porcelain dishes, phonograph-styled iPhone players, etc. - it's all here.You want something unique but super high-quality and design-y? Then this is your store. Don't expect to find anything here that you'll see at any other Evanston store - or possibly even Chicago store - but do expect to find something perfectly special. The owner mentioned that they source their pieces from artists around the world, so the items are handmade and probably won't last.They also have many, many funny and special greeting cards - the ones that are worth buying and sharing. And tea. They have loose tea.I could keep listing special little things they have, but the list would probably be different by the time you get there, so pop in and see what's new yourself. I know I will.
<review# 377,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,11/12/2013,54,205,4,5,3>How can I be the duchess and not have a review?This place is wonderful.  We've been numerous times within the last couple months.  Twice for brunch, once on a Sunday and once on a Saturday.  And a couple times at night to take advantage of their wonderful bar deal!  The brunch is awesome, Sunday's is really great, prime rib, chicken, turkey, ham, pasta, the works, and it's $15.95.  Saturday is more my style...$8 and everything you need, eggs, omelette's, potatoes, fruit, french toast...the only negative about that visit was the waiter's comment..."did you even taste your food?" I thought it was kind of rude, I know he was just trying to make conversation and be funny, but probably not something you should say to customers at brunch in Lake Forest, of all places.  The bar deal is wonderful, $2 sliders, buffalo chicken strips, flat breads, I'm not sure what's all on it, but with the purchase of a drink you get some really great food for really cheap!  We'll take advantage of this again, no doubt!

<review# 379,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2013,11/10/2013,94,254,1,10,6>I like the free California roll for checking in at Yelp. It was better than expected for a Thai restaurant. I ordered the Emerald noodle special and hubby ordered beef Yakisoba. Both were delicious and filling.There was plenty of seafood in my dish and my dish looked bigger than the Yakisoba. The decor is simple and I love that it is a BYOB place.
<review# 380,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/28/2013,11/9/2013,6,20,3,6,3>Stopped by to kill time while waiting for my little brother to finish up at the dentist. Been meaning to try this place for quite some time. Staff was super friendly immediately upon entering. The place was definitely clean and had such a cool feel to it. Colors are great,  furniture is very modern, and I absolutely loved the open bird cage design on the wall. I grabbed two orders of sushi to-go; there wasn't any delay, and I was out of there pretty quickly. The lady helping me, Bridget was so kind. It's really rare to find true customer service this days. The presentation of the food was superb. Unlike other sushi places, the rolls were not sloppily thrown into a foam container. Instead, they were carefully placed in a tray that was actually convenient to use as a plate. At first, the thought crossed my mind that the food was a bit overpriced, however I quickly denounced this upon my first bite: delicious. Beyond that, the ingredients actually taste fresh, and it is evident that they are of a higher quality than most places. I don't mind dropping a few extra bucks in exchange for cleaner, better-tasting ingredients. And the pieces were actually larger than most restaurants, so they were very, very filling. This may be my new favorite sushi place! Will definitely be back. Definitely a wonderful addition to downtown Skokie.
<review# 381,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2013,11/8/2013,362,467,3,6,3>Saw this place on the "new businesses" section on my Yelp home-page, and I knew I had to visit. Not a huge fan of Mexican food, but I love trying new, local places. Went in for lunch. First thing I noticed (to my disappointment) was that there are no places to sit. There are small countertops that you could stand and eat at, but the restaurant itself is so tiny that if you go at a busy time, good luck eating without having people bump into you. Owner was friendly and she was glad to answer my questions. I ordered the fried tilapia burrito while my friend ordered the carne asada burrito with chips and guac. I had originally planned on eating my meal in the restaurant, but due to the unexpected seating situation, I had to make the 20 minute walk back home before I could start eating. Therefore my fried tilapia had already gotten soggy, and my burrito wasn't hot. However, I could still tell that the flavors were solid - the pineapple mojo added a nice tanginess to my burrito. One thing that really impressed me about the meal, however, was the chips and guac. You get a generous portion of both for $8 (more than enough for two people to share), and the guac was great - had a slight tangy, citrusy flavor that's really addicting. I'm actually NOT a fan of guac (yes, kill me), but I couldn't stop eating it!Prices are very reasonable. $6 for a burrito, $3 for most tacos, and $4 for gorditas.

<review# 383,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2013,11/6/2013,10,153,3,4,3>I am slightly on the fence between a 3 and a 4 but as Nell had her co-worker/assistant/whatever call in sick and she had to handle the entire class on her own the night I attended, I will round up to a 4.One point I was slightly disappointed in was that couples did not have actual individual stations/appliances to use on their own. I know this is inefficient and in the end allows a sense of team building, but ultimately I guess I feel like I'm there to enjoy the experience with my significant other. Oh well - did meet some nice people!The recipes utilized were very good and actually fairly simple. Pretty good help from Nell who walks around answering any questions and offering help where necessary.At the end you sit down at a large table with the other couples - I can imagine this being a bit awkward if people are not very social. Fortunately the other couples during our Date Night experience were fairly social and everyone got to meet some nice new people.Good experience overall and, oh yeah, for the guys out there, the girlfriend/wife will love it!
<review# 384,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/25/2013,11/5/2013,206,154,4,5,5>Some of the best chicken around AND they deliver! Everything I ordered was hot and came within 30 minutes! I had the chicken, red beans and rice, veggies, and mashed. Their tortillas were melt in your mouth goodness and the flavor of the chicken is noteworthy. I was surprised that a relatively fast food restaurant would take time to provide such quality food. The only thing I took issue with was the ratio of red beans to rice. The rice came in a condiment size while the beans in a full container. I will be back and will definitely order again!
<review# 385,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2013,11/4/2013,98,320,2,3,2>This little place is right around the corner from us and we've been meaning to try it for a while now. Finally got a sitter and had a real date night. The restaurant itself is very charming and quaint, with that low-level lighting that sets the mood just right. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful in getting us a great bottle of wine and recommending dishes.My favorite plate was the gnocchi appetizer. It was served atop short rib in a broth, with strong hints of delicious rosemary. My wife had the Veal Scallopini and she raved about it. I had the Shells, which is a pasta with crumbled sausage and peas in it. Very tasty! For dessert, we had the vanilla bread pudding, but asked them to substitute the vanilla gelato with the bourbon pecan gelato. So incredible, we cleaned the plate.
<review# 386,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2013,11/3/2013,108,103,3,5,4>Before I even had their food I already had a good hunch about this place.Here's the sitch:Drove by on Oakton and saw De-Jred on a street corner. I thought: "There's a Jamaican restaurant in Skokie now?! What? Sweet!"  Skokie always has boasted its multicultural and multi-ethnic persona.  It's the Ellis Island of the northshore and hosts the annual Festival of Cultures.  Skokie is trying to re-invent itself and encouraging a new wave of establishments in the downtown area.So, how fitting to have such a unique restaurant in such a place!I called to place a pick-up order and stated that I'd like the following three things:Large Oxtail & ButterbeansSmall Jerk ChickenSide of PlantainsVoice on the line: "Is that all?"Me: "Yes...um, ..."[hung up the phone]I was taken aback because I was about to say my name, ask about the pick-up time and how much I owed.  This restaurant doesn't mess around with telephone chit chat (in a good way).  After the initial shock of providing what seemed, like not enough information to "complete" my order... I knew already, this place is COOL.  As in... if I came home and asked my mom what's for dinner, SHE wouldn't give me a bill and say, "Be back at 6:30pm, that'll be 20 bucks and what's your name?"  I would just show up, and eat.  Likewise, this restau has a mom&pop's family-style demeanor.When I arrived to pick-up my food (a guesstimated half hour later), the kitchen was a two-person show.  Run by (what I believe to be) a friendly married couple and also the owners, I was greeted by a big smile and a warm welcome.  They were chatty and you could tell, cooking Jamaican food runs in their blood.  They've been open for 4 years and as I was paying, Papa De-Jred himself asked if I will be coming back.In summary, the oxtails were my favorite, flavorfully stewed to a barely-need-to-chew delicacy... and their platters come with plantains and cabbage (in addition to their beans & rice).  You get a LOT for what you pay.From a good hunch to the shortest phone take-out order I've ever experienced, the answer, Mr. De-Jred, is yes.
<review# 387,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/20/2013,11/2/2013,9,183,3,3,3>I don't go here often actually, but I don't know why. Every time I go to Dixie Kitchen I'm always very happy with whatever I order. Then again, probably better for my waist line that I don't eat here regularly - don't go in expecting plenty of healthy options. Delicious, not healthy.I've had a fair bit of the menu; on prior visits I've had everything from catfish to burgers and it's always been good. I remember pairing the burger which had a fantastic bbq-esque sauce on it with some Southern beer I'd never heard of and it was phenomenal. This most recent time, I got some jambalaya and fried plantains. The jambalaya was excellent, could've used some additional spicing perhaps but I'm really nitpicking. And the fried plantains...well, you can't screw up fried plantains they're delicious everywhere - although the sauce was kinda strange to me. The jambalaya had plenty of sausage and chicken and such, quite a thick sauce/soup/stew whatever you want to call it. I'd definitely get it again.It's on the low end of a $$ restaurant. I find the decor a bit tacky but I don't really care in the end because it's all about 'does the food taste good.' And Dixie Kitchen tastes great.Oh, and, if you somehow save room for dessert, the bread pudding is a slice of heaven

<review# 389,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2012,10/31/2013,1,4,4,4,4>Just moved into town, this is a great place. Rob cut my hair and is continuing my pursuit of a righteous pompadour for this coming Halloween. Excellent barber, he's just moved to HP about a year ago and I highly recommend him. They do straight edge shaves there. I did not try that, but it was cool to see a full service Barbershop for MEN. I paid $21 for a regular hair cut price and tipped $5. Cash or Checks only.
<review# 390,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2013,10/30/2013,41,28,3,4,3>I am obsessed with this place. Coffee, prosciutto, bread, and a good atmosphere. I really don't need anything else. I just missed La Macchina's tasting menu so I decided to duck in for a late lunch on Saturday around 2pm. It seems the staff is still working on getting into the groove of things but overall, I had a really pleasant experience. We were asked numerous times how everything was going, if we were enjoying our food, and our waters were continuously filled. All in all, I would give service a solid 4.5 and seeing as they are just starting, I have full confidence that they'll be up to a 5 in no time. So we ordered the tuna, fennel, and caper bruschetta as well as the meat platter with prosciutto di parma, salami soppressata, and mortadella and speck. I really enjoyed both dishes. The capers and fennel evened out the strong tuna taste that I usually am not a fan of and it sat on a piece of beautifully buttered crostini. The meat platter was equally as delicious but I have yet to come across prosciutto that I haven't liked so...take from that what you will. Our waiter was kind enough to give us an order of gnocco fritti even though we didn't order it. It was very similar to fry bread almost. Puffed pieces of fried dough. Can't really go wrong with that. Overall, a solid experience and since I didn't try the bulk of their main menu (such as entrees) I don't feel as if I have the judgement to give them 5 stars. I'm excited to see how they will improve over time and next visit, I will for sure try the polenta with sausage and peppers and a piadina!

Also, the chicken salad is dynamite!!!

<review# 392,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2013,10/27/2013,3,26,2,4,3>I've been to ArrivaDolce many times and I absolutely love it! Its cozy and warm space makes it the perfect place to catch up with a family member or friend. I always get their cappuccino with a scone or muffin and the outdoor seating reminds me of cafes outside the US. There's something nice about stepping outside the corporatized coffee culture and supporting small businesses locally. We really need more relaxed, European-style cafes like this in the US. I highly recommend you stop by.
<review# 393,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/18/2013,10/26/2013,38,121,5,6,5>Whenever I pass by, I think of 2 things:1. Old MacDonald had a farm. E-I-E-I-O! 2. Animal Farm. Does that mural facing Church St. pay homage to Orwell's novel? Nerdy, I know, but I can't help it!Being curious about the farm life vibe this place was giving off, I had to check out this restaurant. Their menu and rustic ambience definitely stay true to the Midwest. The drink and food menu include ingredients that are all regional--within a 200 mile radius of Evanston! In fact, some items on the menu have IL, IN, MI, or WI in their names. Very environmentally-conscious move, Farmhouse. I approve.Since we're in the Midwest, we naturally need to talk about their beer battered Wisconsin cheese curds! Balls of warm, soft, chewy, stringy goodness! Unlike cheese curds I've had in Milwaukee, these ones from Farmhouse use less oil in their batter. This means less bloating. My stomach thanked me afterwards.As a vegetarian, I was hesitant to try the food since this restaurant makes you think of poultry, but I was pleasantly surprised to find vegetarian-friendly items. Their forest mushroom & poblano pepper Old World grains burger was tasty and had a unique texture.  If you want to enjoy quality food in a rustic ambience with attentive service, definitely check it out!
<review# 394,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2013,10/25/2013,98,61,4,6,3>Tapas Barcelona is the best "tapas" style restaurant you'll find in evanston. And the price is not too bad either. I went with 3 other people, ordered 7 plates, and we were all very satisfied.Queso De Cabra Con TomateDatiles a la SevillanaFilete con PatatasChipirones PlanchaPollo al WhiskyAlbondigas con TomateMejillones PlanchaQueso De Cabra Con Tomate: Baked goat cheese in tomato sauce, nicoise olives, garlic bread. You can't go wrong with baked goat cheese in tomato sauce and garlic bread in ANY restaurant. But I really love how the garlic bread is cut into bite size pieces so I don't have to stretch my mouth to eat it (trust me, this happens a lot with this dish in other places).Datiles a la Sevillana: I came here for this, and it has never disappointed me. It's quite small, and doesn't even LOOK that appetizing in its messy plating and toothpicks. But put one in your mouth, and the bittersweetness of the dates with the salty, crunchiness of the bacon really compliment each other, and is one of their best plates. Must have. go. now.Filete con Patatas: Grilled ribeye! I wasn't expecting much from this dish, but it became one of my favorites. Wow. The ribeye was very very tender and perfectly cooked to medium (even though i like medium-rare), and the sauce was not overwhelming so you could really taste the MEAT instead of the SAUCE. I hate it when restaurants drench their meat in sauces, and Tapas Barcelona did a great job with the balance in this dish.Chapirones Plancha: Grilled squid. Very very tender and a good balance of saltiness and acidic vinegar(?) seasoning. Great bite to have in between the more "heavier" dishes.Pollo al Whisky: Okay. DONT GET THIS. The waiter told us that the kitchen was closing so we asked him for a recommendation for one more dish. He IMMEDIATELY said pollo al whisky, so we went with it. Total disappointment. I'm now thinking maybe he wanted to get rid of it in the kitchen or something ahah. The chicken was very salty and looked terrible. It looked like it came straight out of a freezer and someone BOILED the chicken? Anyways. The potatoes that came with it were good. Not the chicken.Albondigas con Tomate: Beef meatballs. So good! I was a little sad that only 3 meatballs came out when we were a group of 4, but the sauce and the meatballs were very good, and the sauce went really well with the bread that came in the beginning, so if you're not planning on ordering a lot, get this plate, and ask for extra bread and dip dip dip away!Mejillones Plancha: Grilled mussels. I have no idea if its related to the season, but the mussels were the size of my pinky nail. The nail part, not the finger. It was TINY. I had like two mussels, so that equals the size of my thumbnail, right? Ehh, it was alright...I guess, I can't tell because I ate so little ahhaALL IN ALL, the food is good, but the one complaint is have is the presentation of the food. Seriously, if they just put in a LITTLE more effort into the plating, this place has so much potential! I don't understand why they have to use the most unflattering plates, and just throw the stuff on there. I understand that its tapas, but you eat your food with your EYES first!!
<review# 395,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/10/2013,10/24/2013,51,187,1,8,4>The ambiance is incredibly surprising based on the looks of the building from the outside. It's cool and chic with soft jazz playing. A live band of two guys started playing halfway through our dinner songs like "Don't know why" by Norah Jones. The servers are in all black with the black silk tie, high-backed booths, soft lighting, ample, yet spacious seating... definitely a bit of a pleasant shock. Even the restrooms were impressive with the gray paint, dark red tiles and chandelier.I'll definitely go back and sample other menu items. We split the check and I paid $28ish for the catfish, waffles with grits & eggs; a sweet tea (no free refills), mac & cheese and cobbler. What I paid for was easily enough to feed two people or one person with left overs.Now to the Fantastic food: WAFFLES- delicious. Not crispy though which I was a little sad about. and the cinnamon flavor was a nice touch.CHICKEN smothered with gravy - FABULOUS! decadent, tender, juicy, flavorful. Home run for sure!CATFISH - very well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Would definitely have again.SWEET TEA - perfectly sweetened.SWEET POTATO PIE - perfect size for two. It doesn't have the marshmallows on top so if that's what you're craving don't get this. It's more like a pumpkin pie with sweet potatoes.PEACH COBBLER - very sweet and gooey and great! The pie shell bits are mixed in and soft though so if you're looking for crunch this might not cut it. CORN BREAD - slightly on the dry side but still tasty and also sweet.And sadly, the not-so-fantatstic food.GRITS - Really? These weren't grits and being a southerner I was slightly annoyed, yet embarrassed that they tried to pass them off as such. They were watery without any flavoring. Even with a healthy dose of salt, pepper, and butter they couldn't be saved.MAC & CHEESE - literally noodles with shredded cheese and butter. Not tasty. And for $3.50 I could've tried the collard greens instead.EGGS- ... .... Extra yellow... ... Very odd. Scrambled without seasoning. It didn't match the standards that the excellent food and decor demanded.

<review# 397,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2013,10/22/2013,11,73,1,5,5>Great place to take your dogs. If you are boarding, they have a very nice facility with different levels of kennels, depending on the needs of your dogs. They are careful to only allow dogs that are not a threat to their other guests (you have to bring your dog in for a day care session before boarding overnight, to make sure they get on with others -- kind of a hassle, but well worth it for the peace of mind). My dogs love it there!
<review# 398,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/8/2013,10/21/2013,49,140,1,5,3>I really, really like Hewn! The interior is lovely: gorgeous, rustic wood everywhere. The store is a bit small, but it's very empty. There's one shelf on the wall where you might be able to set your espresso and pastry, but no tables. They could easily fit a couple of small bistro tables inside, and I wish they would! There's a bench in front of the store, but otherwise, this stretch of Dempster St. is sadly benchless. I tried the chocolate croissant and the morning bun, and both were fantastic. Both were restrained: the chocolate croissant was not overflowing with chocolate, so you could really appreciate the buttery flakiness of the pastry itself. The morning bun was thoroughly cooked (not doughy at all), and the cinnamon sugar was lovely and caramelized on the bottom.I will definitely be back to try other pastries and to pick up one of their delicious looking loaves of bread!
<review# 399,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/25/2012,10/20/2013,60,8,3,7,4>I've been going to Kuni's for almost 10 years and every visit has been pleasant.  I always sit behind the sushi bar so I can watch Kuni San prepare his fish.  Keep in mind that Kuni's is closed on Tuesdays and often, fresh fish fly in on Wednesdays.   I typically get the Omakase(Chef's selections) and have never been disappointed.  I also ask Kuni San if they have any Hamachi Kama(yellowtail jaw) available as they are not on the menu and have limited quantity each day.  Another one of my favorite is the Aji Nigiri(Japanese Horse Mackerel), which is only available on some days.  Kuni's is reasonably priced for the quality of the fish you get.  It's not the best sushi in Chicago but is the best for the value.  The wait staff can smile a little more but I'm willing to let that slide for their good food.
<review# 400,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/29/2013,10/19/2013,155,68,1,3,3>I love their uni shooters & oyster shooters (when they're available).  I've tried a lot of their rolls and my favorite is their Kansaku roll. Keep an eye out for Groupon deals.  It gets busy on the weekends so call to make a reservation as it is quite a small restaurant.
<review# 401,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2013,10/18/2013,67,185,4,5,5>I came to the library looking for a book that I need for grad school....well that's not entirely true....I was looking for books that I could reference in a paper, without actually reading them or knowing what they were about...silly paper guidelines.  Anyway, when I walked into the Vernon Area Public Library, I was immediately reminded as to why I spent so much time in libraries when I was a kid.  They have almost anything you want, for free!!Ashley and I made our way to the CD and DVD collection and rented about 10 movies and 10 cds each!  I don't want to pay to download music on iTunes, so I rented a bunch of Pink Floyd and Rolling Stones CDs and uploaded them into my own iTunes.  Ashley added to her music collection by renting a bunch of Zach Brown Band CDs.  We rented comedies, dramatic movies, scary movies, etc.  And I'm not sure if it's just this library, or all libraries, but the collection was pretty up to date.  Fairly new movies were on the shelves (like ones that came out earlier this year and in 2012).  New CDs also stocked the shelves.  It kind of makes me mad thinking of all the money we have spent at Redbox and on iTunes.  This is obviously just a little section of the library, if I ever got into reading, I would probably never leave the VAPL!
<review# 402,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2013,10/17/2013,0,18,,5,3>My first car buying experience and it went so well. I had contacted the dealership ahead of time asking about what was in stock, price ranges etc. I had Derek help me, i believe he does alot of internet sales. Anyhow after some back and forth with me being picky down to color and adding a back up camera, i finally came in for a test drive. I had my step mother tag along because she is the one in the family known for negotations. Don't get me wrong i did my homework using consumer reports and kelly blue book. Holy cow, the price for the forester was lower then both. No negotations needed. Honestly where do you go from there, when they offer below the listed dealer price. It took a few days for my Forester to come in, and when it did Derek was there (on his day off no less) to help me set things up like blue tooth for my phone etc.  Great experience. Oh and the finance guy was a gem too very personable.
<review# 403,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/3/2013,10/15/2013,180,1540,3,3,4>I have now returned back to Prairie Moon consistently as my workplace has thrown past events there using the back room space, come as dinner/brunch options for the family, and then, again, most recently last month as part of our board's annual dinner where we had fantastic customer service and the food was delicious.Overall, you can find something for everyone considering that our group had pregnant women, gluten allergies, pescatarians, and vegetarians where finding an option for everyone isn't always the easiest thing to do but Prairie Moon came through for us.  They still have a great selection of beer and wine to boot.
<review# 404,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2013,10/14/2013,32,212,3,6,3>I've had a great experience with Dr. Kochikaran (aka Dr. K) and her assistants at Lakeside Dentistry. I came for two visits, the first for cleaning and x-rays (and other stuff you do when you see a dentist for the first time in a while), and the second for replacing some old sealants on two of my molars. For both visits she and her staff were thorough and efficient. I like that she explained what she was doing, warned me if I would have to keep my mouth open for a while, and gave me the option of raising my hand to indicate if I needed a break or was uncomfortable. I'm also a fan of the plastic safety glasses to keep any stuff from getting in my eye.Dr. K seems popular; she's usually booked out 2-3 months in advance, but I think she's worth the wait.One more thing: on the forms you fill out as a first time patient, there's a section in which you describe your feelings towards dental work. While I don't get anxious when I visit the dentist, I thought it was nice that if you were the kind of person who felt stressed about dental visits, there was a place where you could indicate your level of discomfort.
<review# 405,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,10/13/2013,29,219,4,5,4>My latest experience here was fantastic and deserves a new rating. This fitness instruction is not for the beginner but I'm now a believer that it can change your body.The owner was incredibly friendly and went out of her way to assist me and honor the previous deal.i attended a class later in the day where there were only 4 people in the class so the instructor was able to correct form but maybe such a small class isn't as motivating for some. I enjoyed it but my takeaway is that if you are new to shred, regardless of prior exercise experience, you should try to attend a class at off times ( afternoons/ evenings) to get the format and form down. The morning classes will still have those wait lists although I was informed that shred will be adding more classes so maybe that will help. The class was hard, but its self paced so I could have toned it down, but the instructor pushed me through an amazing workout that I wouldn't do on my own (and I am incredibly motivated).I also had a few moments to look through the clothing racks ( there is a small boutique up front of activewear) and they carry super trendy lines like split 59 and so low. I like to wear cute workout clothes all day so this is just a bonus- shopping and a workout! I have a feeling ill be a regular here and for those wondering if it will change your body, I'll update in a month or so and let you know, though I'm certain I already know the answer.
<review# 406,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/22/2013,10/12/2013,220,174,1,8,4>Weekday Buffet at $9.99 serving meat, vegetarian, rice, fresh veggies, and desserts.  Naan and tandoori chicken  become your lunch buddies hang out with the rest of your lunch buddies. Personally for me the spice factor was on par, which by my standards is not hot enough for my lunch partner who loves spicy hot.  The meat dishes consisted of a fish, a maghalai chicken dish, and curry goat.  There were crispy cauliflower prakoras, paneer, palaks, biryanis and basmati rice dishes. The service was on par and the dishes were cleared off in a timely manner. Go and taste an Indian experience found in the Glen.
<review# 407,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2013,10/11/2013,18,256,4,5,3>Sarki's is a long time north shore fixture, they are famous for their omelettes.   They have off street parking.  I rated it as good for groups, this is true as long as your group is no larger than 4.  Seating is limited.  There can be a wait around brunch time on the weekends, as the north shore hipster/college crowd awakens and descends like a swarm of hungover locusts on this location.  If you are not into being surrounded by teens and twenty-somethings, arrive before 9 am, as they are not awake yet.  Good coffee.
<review# 408,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2013,10/10/2013,52,196,5,6,5>A little over $2 - 1 square of their deep dish pizza (sausage, pepperoni, or cheese)$5 - 2 squares of their deep dish pizza and a bottle of pop.They usually have some squares ready to go, or at least ready in a few minutes.  Good pizza, reasonable prices, served up almost at fast-food times, and open late?  Ladies and gentleman, this is why I'm fat, this is why I'm fat, this is why, this is why, this is why I'm fat.  Just kidding.In all seriousness, they serve up some really good pizza here.  Evenly distributed toppings.  A chewy yet crunchy, deliciously gluteny crust.   Perfect ratios of toppings/cheese to sauce to crust ratios in their deep dish pizza.  When it's fresh, it's perfect.  Not a traditional Chicago deep dish though, more like a pan pizza.
<review# 409,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/23/2013,10/9/2013,21,49,,4,2>I actually happened to stumble upon this place when look for a place to eat with my father who pretty much only likes to eat Chinese food when he can. We decided to try it out though we weren't really looking for an upscale, pricey joint. Luckily we were properly dressed. When we opened our menus, we were greeted by a pleasant surprise- some authentic dishes. For appetizers, we ordered two dim sum dishes: Xiaolong Bao and  the Shrimp Dumplings. The Xiaolong Bao had a thicker, doughy wrapper which I do not like as much. They did well the flavor department, but not excellent - I felt the soup was not spectacular. The Shrimp Dumplings had a good ratio of wrapper to filling, but the flavor was kind of standard and not special.For entrees, we ordered from the Eggplant with Sole Filet Fish which was in a  Szechwan style sauce and the Braised Pork Belly. The Eggplant and Sole Filet Fish was probably the least authentic and my least favorite dish. I found it to be very tasty, but there were various flaws. The eggplant and fish themselves were great, but the dish was drowning in sauce which is not typical of Chinese cuisine. You want to be able to savor the flavors of the fish. On top of this, the sauce should barely be considered spicy which is definitely not what you expect when you order Szechwan or Hunan food (the dish was under Hunan on the menu). The star of the night was the perfectly cooked braised pork belly; the pork literally melted in your mouth, and the sauce was a great combination of sweet and salty though it may have slightly overpowered the pork itself.The service was okay. Our server was attentive, but did not talk much. He had clearly memorized the menu, but could not tell us more than what we already knew based on first impressions.Overall, coming here was a positive experience especially because of the pork, and I look forward to the next time.
<review# 410,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/17/2013,10/8/2013,31,7,2,4,3>While looking for a quick bite to eat and avoid the whole sit down dinner (not easy with two kids) my husband and I came across Aguas Tortas on Yelp.The experience:The menu is great and priced very well. We ordered the steak tortas without cheese or sour cream to go along with some pico de gallo and chips and it was delicious! What sold me on the place, besides the food, was meeting Juan who is apparently the owner. He is so friendly and likeable. Very rarely do you come across great customer service that makes you feel good. He told me that I would love his tortas and if I didn't he would reimburse me ( i am sure he was kidding but still). He was right though, his tortas were sooooooooo good!The place is small with a few tables. Some are bar height and others are much more family friendly (however, too small to accommodate babies or toddlers). We look forward to coming back soon. We will try and bring my little ones next time but probably in the later afternoon after the lunch rush so the kids wont be cramped in a corner. Cant wait to try the tacos and tostadas!

She was very communicative, and honest, and our wedding's success had a lot to do with her.  She hooked us up with great vendors, helped us stay within our budget, and most importantly, was really really really pleasant to work with.  I hope I have another occasion to work with them again!
<review# 412,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2013,10/6/2013,18,5,2,3,2>Since moving to NIles, we have become regulars here. HSI has so many great elements to them such as their incredibly delicious burgers, spinach & artichoke dip, many flat screens, and EVERY DAY (of the week) drink specials. It's your typical sports bar minus crazy, bumpin', and drunkin' 21 year olds running around. Don't get me wrong, the crowd is young and mixed but my days of having drinks spilled on me are over and that will not happen here. Speaking of drinks, that is the ONLY category that HSI loses a star with me...they could be a tad stronger. More importantly, the very nice staff and bartenders always takes care of you and makes things right. Overall, HSI is a casual, comfortable, and cozy place to eat and/or drink at any time of the day or week.
<review# 413,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2013,10/5/2013,13,19,,6,4>I called around 2:15 on a Tuesday and asked if they could fit an appointment in that same afternoon. They answered quickly, friendly and accommodated the request. I could come by at 3! I had simply said I had long hair (it's to the small of my back) and needed a cut. She quoted me $60. When I got there, there were 3 staff members all doing hair and all turned to the door to say hello. I loved the acknowledgment! Elda was my stylist and finished her client in a timely fashion to make our appointment. We had a consultation over some magazine photos I had earmarked while waiting. (The shop had PLENTY of periodicals.) I had told her I wanted something more drastic from what I normally do, but when she saw the length and natural wave to my hair, she talked me into keeping it safe and going more layered GRADUALLY. Since I wasn't entirely convinced what I wanted anyway, it seemed like a good plan.First impressions: The store was cool, clean and smelled pleasant. The décor was modern and minimal; the color scheme neutral, yet soothing.During the consultation, I shared with her that I needed a color too, but I could just stop at CVS and pick up color if she didn't have time. She MADE the time. She cut me first, then applied the color. It sat on my hair longer than I would've liked (an hour-plus), but I had several inches of gray outgrowth and the ends were quite washed out from previous store bought dyes. I'm a brunette, so my hair was a flat, mousy salt-and-pepper mix on the crown and reddish-brown on the ends. She had taken another client while the color sat on my hair. I was getting antsy, but I was also very appreciative that she made both cut and color happen. Even after the cut, there was a LOT of hair to apply the color. The end product was an even, shiny, rich brown that I absolutely loved. The cut: I had wanted one more layer, but she was adamant not to put it in. She thought it wouldn't look good and that I'd be unhappy later. I deferred to her advice, but after a day, I think I want the layer. I had mentioned bangs too at the time. Those she said I could come in for anytime. She never charges her clients for bangs. Nice. Overall, I was very happy with the experience.

I thought the accompanying beans were great though...nice and lardy.  The surprising highlight was the chicharones taco.  While I was hoping the pork skin would crispy instead of soft and gelatinous, the flavor was awesome. It probably isn't for people who are squeamish about unusual textures but I will say it's worth a try even if gelatinous textures aren't your thing.  The salsas were pretty mild in flavor and heat, even their spicy.  Next time I go, I'm going to try the gigantic tortas.  They are ridiculously large!  There was a table of guys who all ordered tortas and couldn't stop laughing at how big they were.
<review# 417,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2013,10/1/2013,137,206,3,3,3>I cannot believe that I haven't written a review for this place yet.. wow! I've been here way more times than I can remember and had some priceless memories here during high school days. Walker Bros was always our choice to go to when we had late arrival and we came here for breakfast after homecoming more than on once occasion. It also helped that one of my good friends worked here for many years, so I would always get hot chocolate on the house (which, btw, is one of the best especially during winter months). As for the menu, I've tried so many things, but my favorite for some odd reason is their grilled chicken Caesar salad that comes with this bread type thing- it's seriously the best one around and I can't think of any place that comes close to it. Everything I have tried has been good - Chocolate Chippies pancakes (the half order because 3 is more than enough) is my fav from pancakes, but all the rest are yummy too. Their "Three Pigs in a Blanket" is a cool option as well as the lox platter. I can go through the whole menu, but I see no point as there is not one item I can think of that I would not recommend. Walker Bros gets insanely packed during the weekends, so come really early or expect to wait. During the summer months, they have a very nice outdoor patio which is a great thing to take advantage of. Service has pretty much been on par throughout all these years, and so has their carryout option where the food was always hot and fresh and ready on my arrival. It's definitely one of the best breakfast places around, and though it's a chain, it does not bother me one bit. I have been to other Walker Bros locations, but this has always been my choice by default.

<review# 419,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,9/29/2013,4,20,1,3,3>Call me biased, but I think that Pequod's has the best pan pizza in all of the Chicago-land area. The best caramelized crust in all the land. My advice is, try the pan with peperoni and sausage, and then ask for a side of ranch dressing to dip it in. HEAVEN does exist on earth people. I'm really excited that Keith has decided to build a new location across from the Metra station, I really hope it brings in as much business as the Clybourn/Webster location. They have an amazing lunch special, a personal size pan pizza with one topping, plus a draft beer or fountain drink for roughly $5. Always make sure to drop a little change in the Caitlin Bull foundation container as well :) VIVA LA FOOF!

They've always been incredibly friendly, used meticulous craftsmanship, and are reasonably priced to boot! Over the years they've resized many rings for me, remade earring backings, fixed watches, converted a bracelet INTO a ring (wizardry!) and fixed numerous delicate broken links. I walk in there and it feels like family. Great company!
<review# 421,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2013,9/27/2013,56,185,10,8,6>It's tough to break 3 stars as a buffet. Usually if you're cheap, your food sucks. If your food is high quality, you're going to leave a dent in my wallet. This impossible balance between price and quality leads to a boring 3-star rating. To break out of that 3-star-death-zone-of-Yelp-rating, your food needs to be exceptional at a decent price or dirt cheap and edible. Ginza definitely falls in the category of the former.At $30 (including tax and tip), you'd have to expect a lot. And they deliver (Not actually deliver, but deliver on your expectations. Just clarifying). Crab legs, sushi, sashimi, scallops, oysters, and lobster are all readily available.The ambiance is nice and although their selection isn't as vast as Royal's (will there ever be anyone who can match their selection?) the quality makes up for it.Also, one of the girls that works there is attractive. I don't know how this relates to the food or for how long this information will be relevant, but just thought some readers would appreciate it (It's okay, nobody knows it was meant for you).TLDR: if you're going to spend $30 bucks on a buffet, choose Ginza over Royal.The TLDR was too long so I didn't read: Go to Ginza.

<review# 423,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2013,9/24/2013,58,347,4,5,3>It's sad how many times I've driven the ~50minute round trip or taken a 15+ minute detour just to come here for drinks since my first visit here a little over a month ago, especially when I have several options much closer to me. Those minutes and gas really add up! So I'm adding a star. (for consistency of quality)The freezes taste so irresistibly refreshing! I can count on every trip I take to be preeetty worth it. I usually take them to go and it'll be gone within the drive back. EXTRA ICE is key. They've been understanding about it, and it's perfect as long as I ask. As I said, I like it to have a thicker consistency, not a "freeze" that melts as soon as I stick a straw in it - that seems to be their default, so ask every time.Watermelon lychee, I've been staying with that every time, and it's a reliable choice.  Bf has been more adventurous. Everything we tried tasted very real, as in not artificial tasting at all.Real fruits. I don't know if they actually add more sugar to their drinks, because the once his drink (mango peach) didn't taste too great was because it wasn't sweet at all, and all you could taste was tart unripe mango :( I'm not picky very about the texture or taste of the tapioca though so... I have no clue if theirs is done "correctly." Aside from my first time, I hadn't encountered any under cooked ones, and that's about it.
<review# 424,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/3/2013,9/23/2013,25,10,4,6,4>I'm hesitant to write this review, simply because I love how empty the park is most of the time.It is tiny, but it's by far my favorite place within a 100 mile radius. Just don't stick to the trail - explore! There are little overgrown paths around the lake that make for a marvelous walk. There's a family of deer who live there, alongside seemingly hundreds of darting chipmunks, squirrels, and these silly birds that prefer to sprint for brief bursts rather than fly away. The lake has fish (including orange coy fish) that show up in the hope for a free meal the second you post up on the patio overlooking it. There are also at least 4 turtles, one of which is pretty sizeable (at least 3 foot long), but also the shiest.Great place to sit and meditate.
<review# 425,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2013,9/22/2013,168,637,3,3,4>Great BBQ. I especially love that they have Turkey and their Burnt ends cannot be missed. That have more sides than most of the other BBQ places in the Chicago area. The Baked Beans and sweet potato souffle are amazing. We went with the combo plate for me and my four mostly little kids. My seven year old loves ribs, so we went with that and turkey and brisket. For $17 you can get three meats and two sides. We went with the sweet potato souffle, baked apples and baked beans. $2 extra for one more side. Its $2 for an individual side or $5 for a pint. Great food and competitive prices given their location. I even went here for lunch a couple of years ago after getting a colonoscopy.
<review# 426,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2013,9/21/2013,37,8,,4,2>I have finally found the best nail salon in Glenview!It is very conveniently located next to the Jewel on Waukegan, very easy to access and tons of parking!I made my appointment for a Tuesday morning and I always recommend setting appointments on weekdays during the day as to avoid any rush there might be on the weekend. This also allows the technicians to take their time and make sure everything is absolutely perfect.My no-chip mani/pedi was just that! Absolute perfection! Not only did Joe my nail technician spend quite a while removing the builder gel I had on, but made sure not to hurt/damage my natural nails underneath! He was very sweet and made me feel very relaxed. Joann my technician for my pedicure was just as sweet and made sure the shape of my nail was just to my liking.Everything went 100% perfect and after everything was done, they made sure to ask if I enjoyed the service. I loved the fact that they had a sign displayed that said "If anything is not to your liking please let us know and we'll make it right".I believe this salon takes great pride in their work and always puts the customer first.I was in from out of town visiting family, and I wish this salon was closer to me otherwise I would be a regular!

The only thing is, I noticed that in the car, he was shedding everywhere! There were little white hairs (he is a bichon/yorkie mix) everywhere in my car and I've just never experienced that with my other white dog.  I haven't noticed it with other groomers either, so I'm not sure if it was the shampoo they used, technique, or something else. Very nice people though. Gave us peanut butter snacks he LOVED!
<review# 428,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2013,9/19/2013,88,154,,2,2>This is my favorite place to get lunch in Evanston. Even on weekends! For 6.95-8.95, you get a drink, choice of hummus, falafil, soup or salad, and an entree. And it's all delicious. Can't go wrong here!I almost always get the hummus. They give fresh pita with it, and it's very filling. The coffee is also surprisingly good. My favorite entree to get is the Shish Taouk (Chicken Kebabs) which is always so flavorful, juicy, and delicious. It comes with yellow rice and veggies (green and red peppers, carrots, potatoes). I always have enough food for lunch the next day, too! The waiter is super friendly and funny too.If you're ever in Evanston for lunch, this is the place to go!
<review# 429,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2013,9/18/2013,61,40,6,3,7>I had a brow wax and pedicure. Both were excellent! I usually hate pedicures because my feet are sensitive but their high quality tools made it so much better. It's also nice that I didn't have to endure any of the constant up sell that they do at most nail salons.
<review# 430,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/20/2012,9/17/2013,19,132,,3,3>I went back for one more visit to see if I could find a massage therapist who would be a good match. I really do like many things about Egea and the location is very convenient for me so I didn't want to have to stop going there. This experience was much better and right after I booked another appointment. My recommendation is that you let the staff know what type of massage you like when you call to make an appointment. Then if that person doesn't work out, I recommend explaining what you prefer in comparison to what you got and hopefully they'll point you to a good match.
<review# 431,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/25/2013,9/16/2013,6,10,4,4,4>It's all about the jibarito sandwich! For $6.25, you get lettuce, tomato, cheese, onions, and your choice of meat sandwiched between two fried plantains (starchy fried bananas). I chose pork, which was very tender & juicy, while my friends chose the steak. It's pretty messy to eat the jibarito sandwich, because the fried plantains don't contain it's contents super well, but that's okay, since the taste is all you need (though I did pretty well keeping my sandwich from falling apart). The papa fritos con mojo fries were also very good.If you're okay with a family-owned restaurant/cafe -- and that means a couple of children running around and only one unisex bathroom -- this is a tasty, affordable lunch place to check out!
<review# 432,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2013,9/15/2013,20,82,1,5,2>Sooooo happy to have a new restaurant in Wilmette that feels fresh and modern without being too stuffy!Kudos to whoever designed the space since CK Arthur's that was there before had started to loose it's old charm and turned to dusty dive feeling.  The makeover is amazing and reminds me of many nice downtown restaurants not the traditionally focused places typically in the Wilmette area.  Sadly the great design didn't include thoughts about the acoustics and it is very very noisy!!!  It was hard to hear the wait staff and have a conversation with my companions.  Unfortunately that can be a big detractor from the overall experience since it put my brain on sensory overload and it was hard to focus on enjoying the food and friends I came there for.  Also was sad to see there weren't tables outside for good weather.We were a party of two and ended up eating at the bar since the place was packed and they had two seats just open on the end of the bar!  Often I dread eating at the bar because it's crowded and the stools are uncomfortable but that wasn't true at Nick's.  We had a nice view of the kitchen, the bartenders were very attentive and checked in which us often to see how we liked things.  Service was pretty good with a number of folks checking in on us to be sure we were satisfied.  Looking at other reviews it seems they are working on shaking some cobwebs out and get the staff trained.The bar offered a nice selection of beers and wine.  I ordered a signature Blood Orange Margarita.  It was well done with fresh grapefruit juice.  The only thing that threw me off was it wasn't orange in color because they were using blood orange liquor.  The grapefruit juice was fresh squeezed and the final drink was nice twist on a Margarita.  The rest of the signature cocktails looked pretty typical - nothing really pushing the into current mixology like some gastropubs do.  Staying close in with Moscow Mules, etc.  Was happy to see they have a chef designing the dishes so they were more thoughtfully done with fresh ingredients and well presented compared to many places in the neighborhood that are more cook driven.  The food was well executed with nice flavors but the chef doesn't push too hard into current flavor trends and sticks with basic recognizable profiles.I had a BBQ Pull Pork sandwich that the bartender and passing waiter said was their favorites on the menu.  The meat itself was flavorful even the bits that didn't have sauce on them which is a good sign since many places rely on the sauce for the flavor and leave the meat pretty plain.   The meat was more on the dry side with some shredded that were a bit crispy - it wasn't too dry just not juicy  and tender like some pulled sandwiches I've had.  The sauce itself was nice and didn't overtake the sandwich  They topped it with some cole slaw that gave in a nice bit of crunch and coolness on a great brioche bun.  It didn't take long to devour it. A solid sandwich for sure that I would order again.My friend had the vegetable lasagna.  She really liked that it had nice chunks of vegetables and a fresh flavor.   We finished with the seasonal bread pudding with a scoop of Homers ice cream on top.  My friend had tried to order the banana split but they were 'out of them.' The bread pudding was really good moist with raisins and spices.  The portion was a great size that could be shared or if you are a bread pudding lover like me - eat yourself if you had saved room.  OVERALL:  Food was thoughtfully created, presented and tasty.  So glad to have good fresh food in Wilmette.  Love the well designed casual modern atmosphere but wish they would fix the sound issue it's not just loud but distractingly noisy which that along with the lack of outdoor seating made me knock a star off.   Finally a restaurant in Wilmette that I would feel comfortable meeting my hip city friends in and even bring my kids to for food that feels more real.  I'll be back for another try to see how the rest of the menu is.
<review# 433,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2013,9/14/2013,14,122,,6,3>What a way to end an enjoyably long 4th of July weekend!  Sunday, latish, we wanted to go somewhere we hadn't been, wanted something that was different.  Success!Longitud 35 claims to be a fusion of South American tastes.  This type of food is not within my wheelhouse or any claim of expertise or experience, but what I tasted was artistically spiced and convinced me that I had somehow embarked on a quick trip to South America.The restaurant is on one of two main Highwood streets--quiet on the outside, not splashy.  There are a few outdoor tables with umbrellas, fitting in with other restaurants along the street.We entered an attractive, modernly decorated restaurant.  It had some stone tiling, richly painted walls and a few pieces of statement art (South American I assume).A very friendly host greeted us and took us to our table, explaining the menu.  The menu features organic food, divided into large plates (usually to share I'd say) and smaller plates.We had two of the larger plates: one was trout--thin, baked and moist with an exotic crust that was flamboyant, but not overly piquant; the other was lamb chops--several chops, grilled perfectly to the temperature requested.  Each came with sides--we had variations of sweet potatoes and vegetables, the lamb also came with a salad of your choice.And we liked everything about this place: our friendly, attentive waiter (a young South American Nathan Lane); our gracious host (friendly, explaining that they opened in November after being in catering); the crowd (this Sunday, it seemed like a hangout for several affable Highland Parkers); the décor and room (warm colors, quiet lighting, art work, tables comfortably set apart) and most importantly, the food--I've looked at the menu and see numerous delights to come for when we return.This has some expense attached to it, but unlike some other experiences over the weekend, we felt that it was the restaurant that offered a true value with excellent food.Oh--the evening's finale was a simple cup of coffee--rich, South American coffee.  The end of the end and very enjoyable!  Go and enjoy!
<review# 434,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2013,9/13/2013,206,413,3,3,2>Grand Food Center appears to be basically like a whole foods or a sunset foods. I really can't tell the difference. That's good and bad.The plus: you don't have to go to WF (north or south, in evanston) and deal with the parking issues.The minus: it's basically the same stuff, almost entirely.  You're not going to find something here that you haven't seen anywhere else.For those who said it's pricey, I think you fail to realize that they are basically a whole foods and not a jewel - along with appropriate organic options. Considering that, I'd put this squarely in the realm of "whole foods competition". If you know what you look for when you shop WF, you would be able to find it here as well.
<review# 435,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/11/2013,9/12/2013,143,199,3,4,2>Two in the afternoon and got the Fatty's burger (Today was a Good Day), ok....enough of recalling Ice Cube's rap which mentions a 2 am visit to Fat Burger and no, Fatty's is unrelated to Magic Johnson's Fat burger in Cali and Fatty's also has a more popular Lincoln Park location. Fatty's also has friendly staff and cook (Steve). We parked right in front and it's across the street from Evanston Township High School. We were enticed to come here by Groupon. Cool 60's and 70's soul (Papa was a rolling stone and Lionel when he still with the Commodores) playing continuously and a big flat screen for games. We ordered the MVP and Free Agent burgers, we went with the 1/2 pounders as we're 28 Days Later hungry (Boyle) when we see red meat. The bread was buttered and grilled - nice touch. It was also a nice size for the patties - which I enjoyed. The Free Agent comes with an over easy egg and the MVP comes with avocado slices (the good fatty). The burgers were great. The fries were ok (in comparison to Burger Philosophy on Bryn Mawr) and could be a bit crispier. However, this place focuses on the main item - their burgers, so no disappointment here.
<review# 436,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/22/2013,9/11/2013,23,203,,8,3>It took me a while to realize this but the best massages do not necessarily take place in those zen-heavy spas that offer cucumber water.  In fact, the best massages are those that truly understand how the body works.  Such was the massage I got from Therapeutic Kneads. It surprised me to know that this place was located within my neighborhood as I have been searching high and low for a place that I would consider my "go-to" spot when my muscles are calling it quits from running and the everyday stresses of life.  I definitely knew I had to go before a long road trip.  I booked a 90-minute massage and my only regret was that I could've had it for even longer.  Anna, my masseuse, provided perhaps one of the best massages I've had in my life.  Every knot and every tense spot were given such attention that I truly felt like butter when all was said and done.  The staff members were friendly and pleasant and I appreciated that even though they offered many products for the body such as therapeutic pillows and such, no one tried to push you to buying anything.  I can definitely say I have found my place!
<review# 437,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/26/2013,9/10/2013,77,182,2,2,2>As with most Korean places in the Chicago area, I'd recommend coming here with a Korean-speaking person.This place is tucked away in a little strip mall, but do not be fooled -- the food is really good (albeit a bit on the pricey side). My friends and I split three whole chickens in three flavors: BBQ, garlic, and corn. The corn one was a bit *too* spicy for my liking, even though we had requested a medium level of spiciness. Also, if you love elotes like I do, do yourself a favor and get the corn cheese! It's basically corn covered with melted cheese and a variety of other spices; delicious! Also, the strawberry soju is surprisingly good and sweet.The interior is all dark and divided into little booths. Sort of dramatic and ominous... I felt almost like a vampire. But in case this vampire got cold, the booths also provided lap blankets!Bonus for the button that summons a waiter right away.
<review# 438,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2013,9/9/2013,81,67,4,8,2>Ummm... Freddy Sanchez can cook for me any time!Came here for lunch with my sister and other family. SMALL joint with one communal table and then a few small tables.My sister knows what I like. Since I was running late to meet, she took the liberty of ordering and did phenomenally. The guacamole here is excellent. Fresh, made to order, with HOT and just salted chips. Can order the guacamole anywhere from, in terms of spice level, mild to hot. Ordered was the mild because some in our party can't handle heat.Tacos ordered for me was the Duck in Mole (Pato en Mole Negro) and the Pork al Pastor.The taco tortilla (shell/ holder, what ever you like to call it), is fresh pressed and griddled masa, so this is a soft taco and akin to having something like a really good tamale. The fresh masa is a nice touch.The Pato: Nice and earthy mole sauce that plays well with the rich duck meat. Just a few drops of the red table sauce (these sauces aren't all that hot and compliment the food very nicely) sprinkled with sesame seeds and pickled onion. I ended up having a second one after polishing off this one and the Al Pastor. it's a favorite.Al Pastor: Spit roasted and layered pork with onions, spices and pineapple. The way it SHOULD BE! You can see the spit in the back. Bright tang from the citrusy marinade and nuance of spice, cutting the richness of the pork. Bits of orange and pineapple in the very tasty salsa and crispy fried jalapenos for a nice kick of heat. As said before, had a second Pato as well as the Crispy Camerones: Beer battered shrimp, serrano cream sauce and radishes. Another winner.Did have a bite of my sisters Baja Fish Taco and wasn't "wowwwwed" but I also can't stand tilapia. Least favorite fish next to Asian Carp (which is not only nasty and inedible...) I digress.It's too bad this place is so small. Come in at the wrong time and you could get stuck without a seat, but the food here is excellent and comes out fast. Is it cheap? No and I think it speaks more so to the quality of ingredients. And no, these aren't MONSTER tacos either. The tacos are aout the same size as Big Star... Similar price as well. Many say; this COULD be the Big Star of the North Shore and others say "wha... What a rip off..." And those reviewers heap praise on Big Star? I'm confused.In going through some more of the reviews here; tacos don't get loaded with rice and beans, only a Mission Style (SF Mission District) burrito does.  And a menu is just that, it's a MENU and not a parts list for you to "mix and match". And it's counter-service taquera... Sorry that you are so put out to get your own frickin' water.

<review# 440,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2013,9/7/2013,57,93,3,5,4>My new patbingsu (Shaved ice dessert) spot! This place replaces the old "IceT" cafe and my friend was a little disappointed they don't serve waffles like the former place did.  Upon walking in, there isn't too much to look at since they opened pretty recently.  The walls are dull and the menu is tiny as well.  It seems they only serve patbingsu and coffee so I was a little sad I didn't have too much variety to choose from. I thought I overheard the server offer cheesecake to someone but I didn't see it on the menu. But.. their patbingsu was so good! I love that they used fresh fruit and not those fruit cocktails that come from the cans.  There were fresh mangoes, kiwi, and strawberry..and SO MUCH MOCHI! I don't like patbingsus that are way too sweet and this one definitely was not!  Most places also skimp on the mochi but they were pretty generous.They also serve cup-sized patbingsu's which is something I've never seen in other suburban korean cafes. The place has a lot of potential and I can't wait to see what else they will offer.  I really hope the menu I saw is not the extent of the items they will serve in the future.  I give this place 4 stars because the server is friendly, patbingsu is one of the best I've had, and the place has a lot of seating. I would definitely come here again!

<review# 443,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2012,9/4/2013,10,153,,3,2>This place has personality and character. That is simply the best way to describe it. The menu is limited though it sounds like there is a bit more now than when it first opened (3-4 different paninis, a salad, one beer, few different wines, and any cocktails that Scott can make!).They have done a great job with this small space (10-12 inside seating and another 8-10 outdoor) and making it unique and attractive.

Theirs is very  good!  They make their pub burgers from ground sirloin and they are great.  Carol's homemade twice-baked potatoes are great and they always seem to have veal shank when it is unavailable from other places.  Overall, you can't go wrong at Jerry's Quality Meats!!

My husband had the chicken Lin. Only bad thing about this dish, there was not enough!! So flavorful. I had the orange beef. I think this is the best dinner I have had out in ages!! The beef was tender and not a hint of fat. Onions, broccoli and green peppers in with a sauce that had just the right amount of spice. I highly recommend this restaurant!!!

The bartenders and staff are fun and friendly, and gave my friend and myself great drink recommendations. The cocktails are delicious, and the staff have unbelievable knowledge about spirits and drinks. The ambience was relaxed, dimly lit, and intimate. They are very detail oriented, which really upped the service level. This would be a great date place. The bar also features local art and music, which I think is awesome. I'm really glad the area has a new hangout spot! Looking forward to returning many times.

Everyone's friendly, helpful and efficient. You don't need a reservation but they will take them a day before for peak hours. They open til 8 pm with the last send off at 7 pm.

We were hesitant to dine here because it didn't sound or look like a place where we could bring our son. Luckily, we stopped by for lunch and it's totally family friendly in the dining area! Big plus. Like I mentioned, we've gone twice. I neglected to mention that we enjoyed it so much that we went twice in one week. The North Branch burger was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Better than I expected. Delicious. My wife loved their chopped salad so much that we had it on both occasions. We also tried the chicken tenders which were a large portion, crisp coating, and juicy. For sides, the season vegetable was actually dressed and seasoned not just a pile of steamed broccoli like some places would give you. Their mac and cheese was ordered for our 1yr old son, but it was tasty enough to be happily finished by us. All in all, it's a great place that seems to be locally owned and would be great for adults looking for to watch a game and grab good food and beers as well as for families looking for a dinner out.
<review# 451,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2013,8/27/2013,75,193,5,6,6>Wow TK's totally took me by surprise!  If I had known the food was this good I would have come earlier, especially since its located around the corner from me.  I would give service, food, and atmosphere all 5 stars.  This space used to be an Egg Harbor Cafe back when I was in high school but TK's is an awesome change/addition to the small strip mall.  The layout of the restaurant is typical bbq style where you order at a counter and then they bring the food to your table.  This was mine and my friends' first time here so we took awhile looking at the menu trying to decide what to order.  Since we couldn't decide what we wanted, the owner was so pleasant he let us sample some food.  We tried the burnt ends since he overheard me say I love burnt ends to my friends.  He then let me know that they prepare their burnt ends sandwich a little differently from other bbq places.  They add some diced pepper and other flavors where it tastes more like a stew than normal burnt ends. The burnt ends sample was yummy but not the exact taste I was in the mood for.  I ended up ordering the sliced brisket sandwich and a strawberry cider.  One friend ordered the half slab of ribs and the other had the pulled pork sandwich.  All of us were extremely happy with our choices.  My brisket was juicy, flavorful, and had a great smokiness.  The sauce came in a little cup on the side so you could control how much or any sauce you wanted on your sandwich (which is a plus for me!) My strawberry cider was yum-my! It basically tasted like juice but I felt like trying a girly beer.  I tried a sip of my friend's shandy which was very light and refreshing.  One cool thing they do here if you get your beer in a cup is that they fill the beer from the bottom up through a hole to decrease the foaming at the top.  The top of the hole is magnetized and they seal it with a little magnet.  Tip: If you bring in 20 magnets, you get a free sandwich!! Nom!I definitely recommend coming here if you're feeling in the mood for bbq!  In my opinion, this is the best bbq place in the north shore area.  Bonus: There was a Bill Murray and a Noah Pukerman (Mark Salling from Glee) lookalikes working here!
<review# 452,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/13/2013,8/26/2013,32,301,4,5,4>Finally had the oppurtunity to come back here, still loving it. We got take out which included the beef Lard Na, chicken pad woon sen, and a free golden crab (crab rangoon). The promotion free golden crab or spring rolls is great! I really enjoyed the golden crab though my favorite still remains at mandar inn. The lard na was delicious and the beef was so good. I tried my girlfriend's pad woon sen and thought it was freaking delicious, i mean come on who doesn't love glass noodles. She told me that she prefers the pad woon sen from simply thai in northbrook but i havn't had it so cant comment on that. This place has probably the BEST duck sauce, i think that's what it is(comes with the golden crab). i dont know if it's red pepper or something but its in there and it gives it just the right amount of tang and a huge boost in flavor...i thought i was gonna drink it lol.Lastly, their prices are very fair for your portions. i still hold that one dish can be split between two people, but they are super yummy so you may not want to share.side note, everyone we came into contact with was very polite and seemed genuinely nice
<review# 453,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2013,8/25/2013,48,257,4,6,3>Cupcakes.. GREAT.BUT...when I went in the people behind the counter were too busy to pay me and my two girls any attention as they were talking to their credit card machine guy.  I was trying to order and they seemed very distracted and couldn't give me the time of day.  They continued to ignore me and ask their credit card machine guy questions. I felt ignored and rushed. I ordered several cupcakes and loved every single one of them.  I did order a iced coffee but at 3pm they had no iced coffee. Note to owners.at 3pm when the kids are getting out of school, have fresh treats for the kids and moms and fresh iced coffee so moms can get through the afternoon misery. Anyway, counter people totally ignored us, and rushed us, but the cupcakes were to DIE FOR. SO SO SO good. No iced coffee, BAD.  Get a cute HS girl to work the counter, don't ignore, have afternoon coffee ready.  WIll be back despite the bad customer service cause the cupcakes were THAT GOOD.

Boars Head is their Go-To brand, awesome.I went with the Cajun Turkey Hero and it saved the day for sure!! Got it toasted with all the fixings. a 12 inch was about 10 bucks, but it was NOT your normal 12 inch. Could have been just fine eating half of it but it was so good I thought better of myself than to stop at just the half :)Come hungry and be ready to wait a few minutes, it takes time to prepare perfection :) You can also call ahead and pick it up. I will be back here often!
<review# 455,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2013,8/23/2013,1,15,3,7,3>Excellent. Great food, big portions, quality ingredients. It is not Pat's Place. Why people would even try to make a comparison amazes me. It is in the same location and serves breakfast and lunch but all comparisons should stop there. This place is clean, bright and contemporary in everything from the setting to the menu. Yes, it costs more than Pat's and rightfully so. I have dined in three times and carried out once. The staff is friendly, the customers are all smiling and I have yet to walk in and not know someone eating there. Every time I have been there the person I dine with takes half of the food home the portions are generous! Hopefully the novelty will not wear off and the comparisons to Pat's will stop. This place is really good!
<review# 456,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2013,8/22/2013,19,12,3,5,3>I just ate this not even 2 hours ago so it's not even fully digested. I just needed to share this with everyone! Get the Chef Special #1 (It might be something different later. Soo... Go. Right now.): Your choice of curry (I got Panang Curry) poured over a sizzing plate of Grilled Salmon. I wasn't expecting it to be entertaining when I got my food, but my server came out, put the tray down 5 feet away from me, and poured the little pot of curry onto the skillet of Salmon (over grilled asparaus) and it was sizzling and smoking and it smelled ah-mazing. It tasted even better than I thought it would! I'm recently trying to eat spicy food so I chose 2 out of 4 on the spiciness scale when she asked, but it's Thai food and I'm suuuuuuuch a wimp so it was more of like a 3 of 4 on my own scale. I didn't care though because the curry was delicious and I sniffled and held back tears as I finished the plate. While it's not the cheapest thing ($6 more than the regular plate of curry because of the salmon, so $15 total) on the menu, I definitely think it's worth getting. The portions aren't huge but who said they should be? This is how we Americans get so obese! Overall, I loooooooved it and I'm so glad I went.
<review# 457,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2012,8/21/2013,23,10,5,6,4>After tasting the ice cream at the Village Creamery, I know how James W. Marshall felt at Sutter's Mill when he found gold.On a hot summer day I stumbled into the Village Creamery. I expected the typical array of flavors: chocolate, vanilla, and a few flavors with chunks of fruit, chocolate and wafers.  I did not expect to see halo-halo, queso, ube, etc. The service was fantastic and the cashier was kind enough to let me sample several flavors.Here's what I tried: Halo-halo Fiesta is an ice cream based on a Filipino dessert. Think of a South Asian version of Ben and Jerry's "Everything But The . . .".  The original dessert is a blend of shaved ice, evaporated milk, beans (adzuki, kidney, etc..), several fruit like toddy palm, coconut and typically topped with flan. As outrageous this may seem, it makes for a fantastic ice cream. The fruit, beans, and other ingredients are not overwhelming; they are sprinkled in with enough prudence to make it accessible. Imagine a cold cappuccino on a warm day in San Gimignano. A gentle breeze twists through the olive trees as you lean against the wall overlooking the rolling hills. That's the tiramisu at the Village Creamery. Nuff said. Melon was the flavor that made my knees buckle. The flavor of this ice cream is absolute perfection. It's as if chunks of cantaloupe were ground into a cream. It's rich and refreshing. Durian is not for everyone. The fruit looks like something out of a science fiction film. It has been said that "it smells like hell, but tastes like heaven". The ice cream tempers the smell of the durian, and offers just a pure taste of the fruit. Like the melon, this recipe showcases the flavor perfectly. At the Village Creamery the flavors range from exotic/unusual to classic, but the consistency is in the quality of the ice cream.
<review# 458,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2013,8/20/2013,98,61,6,8,8>First of all, unicorns, they rock. the end.Next, I'm a huge coffee fanatic, and I have to say that unicorn has one of the best quality coffee beans in Evanston (well, more specifically, around the Northwestern campus). Of course you can buy shipped Intelligentsia or other awesome brands at the nearby Whole Foods, but unicorn get's their Alterra beans freshly delivered, and you can buy the beans straight from the counter.One complaint I have about the place is that it's not very "study"-friendly, meaning that they don't have many plugs around the place, and most of their tables are round and too small for someone studying with a laptop, multiple books, notebooks, etc. But their lattes and coffees taste amazing, and they always have some nice indie music playing so the atmosphere is great. Oh, and they always switch up the arts on the walls so it's never boring waiting around for your coffee!
<review# 459,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2013,8/19/2013,33,145,1,4,3>Had the chance to pop into the newest joint in Evanston this past Friday night.  I thought it would be hard to get a table, but they had plenty of reservation time slots if you use their online booking system through their Facebook page.  Seemed like a lot of people waiting for tables, guess they didn't know about the reservation system.First, this is the perfect fit for the dreaded restaurant space in the Hilton Orrington.  I've seen so many restaurants come and go in this space......Sushi, Steakhouse, Sushi, the list goes on.  I think we've got a winner here.This is right on par w/Found and The Cellar.  Similar beer selections and food.  I did like the beer selection as it is mostly breweries within a few hundred mile radius of Chi-town.  Thumbs up for that!Started off the meal w/the flat bread of the day and an order of cheese curds  Both were outstanding.  You could almost make a meal out of the starter items.  Might be ok if you were to dine solo at the bar.  For the entree we tried fish & chips and the stuffed trout.  I thought the fish & chips was quite tasty.  Usually fried fish comes across light and flaky.  This version seemed to have a thicker coating, perhaps more meaty fish.  Tasty nonetheless.  The stuffed trout was loaded with seasonings and flavors.  Also quite a colorful presentation, I shoulda taken a picture.  I probably won't order it next time since their were so many other good looking options on the menu: chicken, duck, steak, walleye, etc.  We skipped on dessert and went next door to Andy's to get the summer special....Key Lime Pie Concrete.......how could we resist!  Bottom line, bump this spot up to the top of your Evanston dining choices.  You won't be disappointed.  FYI, service was very friendly and attentive.
<review# 460,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2013,8/18/2013,41,171,7,7,5>Okay, I've never been to a soul food or chicken and waffle joint, but Chicago's Home of Chicken & Waffles was not what I was expecting.  I almost felt underdressed because the decor was so nice and refined from the leather seating to the striped fabric in the booths.  Irregardless of how I felt about my attire, they make you feel so welcome here.  Everyone was dressed from "night on the town" nice to t-shirt and jeans.  We were seated at a booth and we were waiting for our waiter.  Then someone came who wasn't our waiter, but noticed that we weren't being attended to and he just took charge to make sure we were being served.  That was awesome.  I had the Saint which was 1/4 chicken and waffles.  It was so good and they made sure you were rolling in maple syrup.  I also ordered a side of mac and cheese, which was delicious.  My friend upgraded to Carol's Treat, the chicken with gravy and onions, and the pecan waffle.  She let me taste the gravy and the pecan upgrade and it blew my mind.  I had no idea that the chicken and waffle could get any better, but it could if you get the gravy and the pecan upgrade.  Another friend opted for the catfish instead and chicken.  It was amazingly delicious too.  I don't think you can go wrong on this menu.  I wish I had known about this place during Lent because this would've been my go-to Friday spot.  There is more stuff on the menu, and I can't wait to try it, especially the desserts.We were also lucky enough to go on a Sat evening and they had a jazz band playing.Oh, and I almost forgot.  Their coffee specifically blended to pair well with their waffles is really smooth.  I didn't have to add anything to it, since it was good by itself.
<review# 461,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2013,8/17/2013,26,129,3,3,3>This place rocks.   I have used them for the family dinner and also for parties.  I really like thier regular pizza.   My wife loves the pan (spinach).      The party pizza is a great deal and feeds twice as many as they say.   The kids LOVE the Goode & Fresh soda.  They love the blueberry, and I like the black cherry.   The chicken fingers are great for the kids.    Good meat.We have ordered sandwhiches and salads occasionally, and they are good too, but the pizza always suffices.The service is the best.  I have never had a wrong order, or had to wait for the pick-up.   The occasional delivery is perfect and quick.   The owners are always there and are involved in the community.   A glenview icon!
<review# 462,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2013,8/16/2013,1,12,1,4,3>I've been here three times now and my experiences have gotten progressively better and better. New restaurants always take some time to get into a groove, and the Lake House has done it. The live music was fantastic! I've had the salad bar, wings (amazing), cheese curds, calamari, gnocchi with vodka sauce, and the beef and mozzarella sandwich and have not been disappointed. Our server on Friday night (Feb 15) was Rebeccah and she was amazing. She was friendly, polite, attentive, gave great food suggestions and was a joy to be around. This is really the only place near my apartment that has good food and the atmosphere I like...and good service to top it off.
<review# 463,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,8/15/2013,67,185,9,8,6>C'mon people!!!  3.5 stars???  WTF this place rocks!!!  If I went to Beverly Hills and I told someone, show me what Beverly Hills is all about, they would probably take me to Rodeo Drive.  If someone told me to show them what Lake Forest is all about, I would take them to The Grille on Laurel.  The people here are classy, and the food is delicious.  Maryland does crab cakes and football, LF does classy people and delicious food.Ashley and I came here one Friday night and had a drink in the bar.  That's when my ever wandering eyes found the "Late Night Bar Special" sign.  After 9pm on Fri and Sat, they have $2 bar food!  Mini burgers, buffalo chicken strips, BBQ Chicken pizza.  My sixth sense is the ability to find cheap eats even in the most affluent communities.The servers and bartenders are all really nice, there is live music in the bar at night, and the weekend brunch is out of this world good.  Sunday brunch is $16/person with everything you can think of, including a Prime Rib carving station.  I'm not a prime rib fan, but my dad and brother in law went to town on it.  Saturday brunch is only $8 and includes almost everything that the Sunday brunch includes, except the meat carving stations and other "lunch" designated foods (like pasta).The Grille on Laurel also has a fish bowl of Andie's mints (I spelled that wrong) when you walk out the door.  What a nice little send-off!
<review# 464,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2013,8/14/2013,38,121,4,5,4>If you're a nature-lover visiting from out of town during the summer, definitely check out this garden, but remember to wear insect repellant! If you don't have a car, or don't want to pay $25 for parking, you can take the UP-N line on the Chicago Metra. One day is not enough to check out 385 acres of the garden, so if you're short on time, definitely check out the Japanese, English, and Regenstein Fruit & Vegetable Gardens. The garden occasionally hosts free events--the first time I went, I attended a free cooking show and 2 free plant demonstrations. I'm now the proud momma of two potted plants! :)
<review# 465,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2013,8/13/2013,51,66,3,5,3>A very chill, old timey pub grub spot. Nothing fancy, but that's not a bad thing. Play a board game. Watch a game. Grab a beer and relax. Good burgers, reuben, chicken sandwiches, and fish & chips. The salads and soups are fairly solid too. In warmer months, the deck is a fantastic place to hang out with your pals or your family.
<review# 466,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2013,8/12/2013,56,146,1,5,4>Glad I "Found" this place!I was skeptical because this place seemed like one of those restaurants where the decor outshines the food.I was pleasantly surprised because the food is AMAZING! So amazing that they sold out of the chicken liver mousse (that I will have to return to try).My friend and I had the kale and chard salad- it was so deliciously nutty yet so light and perfect for summer!We also had the polenta with almonds and mushrooms- my friend commented on how she could eat an entire bowl!We also had the root vegetable and quark flatbread- and learned that quark is a type of cows cheese- the flatbread is covered in hummus and sweet potato and was very unique in flavor!The dessert was good and the service was fantastic! Our waters were always full and the staff was so nice!The bathrooms are really nice (including free tampons- nice touch)-but all in all this place is fantastic. Great decor, excellent food and a good location (was able to find lots of parking).
<review# 467,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2013,8/11/2013,32,212,2,11,4>Though this is a small office, there is a good selection of glasses, much better than the selection I had at the Old Orchard Lenscrafters. Dr. Grinman has good taste when it comes to picking glasses, which is funny considering that he has never needed or worn glasses (or contacts, for that matter). In addition to picking out a new pair of glasses, I also tried on ~6 brands of daily contacts over a period of two months.  I'm really happy that Dr. Grinman let me try so many brands for a good length of time (he gave me a 5-day supply for each brand) because I have dry and sensitive eyes which responded differently to each type of contacts.Last but not least, the staff were nice, professional, and helpful. If you're looking for a new optometrist, I highly recommend Dr. Grinman. Bonus: this office accepts the vision care discount program that comes automatically with Northwestern's student health insurance, so this office is a great option for students looking for a local optometrist.
<review# 468,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2013,8/10/2013,163,595,2,8,6>Yolo.... great restaurant, and not a place you try because of YOLO.  Yolo is short for yolotli which is Nahuatl (Aztec language) for heart.So enjoy your random fact of the day as I will tell you why this place is leaps and bounds above your normal Mexican joint.For started they do a mole negro.  This is one of the most difficult dishes to make in Mexican cuisine.  This places uses over 30 ingredients.  And then they only like in the 20's to have this over chicken.  Keep in mind that this is a bargain over Topolobambo (where their version with a 28-day ages rib-eye will set you back a cool 49, but this is not a fair comparison as anyone that had Rick Bayless' food can attest to).  I'm just trying to point out how amazing it is that this small place in Skokie is making food that I would say is fair to compare with some of Chicago's best Mexican eateries.We also got some pork roast with a green sauce and peppers.  After going into so much detail about the mole, I really do not know what to say here.  But trust me, I was extremely happy with this order.  It was a large piece of pork, perfectly cooked and spiced.For desserts we went for a piece of flan and a horchata.  The Flan, holy shit, I didn't think flan was capable of being so amazing.  Its texture was a little thicker than other flans I've tasted.  Then there was cinnamon chocolate drizzle on the plate that added an entire new element to a traditional dessert.  After trying this I could say you can easily just come here for dessert, but then you would be missing a world of amazing food.
<review# 469,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2013,8/9/2013,180,1540,1,6,3>I originally came here with my sisters using the Groupon deal for a mani/pedi and it was such a great experience.  It feels super clean and comfortable - we loved the chick flick option on their flat screen tv on the wall and enjoyed the variety of colors with both OPI & Essie.With an option of tea and water, we were able to relax in their comfortable massage chairs and get our pedicures done where they did a fabulous job.  I also feel like Trendy was well ventilated and didn't reek of the heavy polish fumes (we came in February where it was snowing and it's not like they had the door open).  I've been back since they offer a 20% discount Mon - Wednesday for Northwestern wildcard holders so a mani/pedi is only $35!I ended up hosting a spa party here for 6 women and they were really fabulous and accommodating, as well - great service and we enjoyed our glasses of wine with our service..

<review# 471,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2013,8/7/2013,98,320,1,4,3>I grew up in southern California and have lived in many places where really good Mexican food was just a given. Since I've moved to Chicago in the last 15 years, it has been a long and challenging quest for me to find really decent Mexican food anywhere in this town, especially the North Shore 'burbs. The reviews on Yelp make Lupita's out to be mediocre, which at first is astonishing to me. Having just eaten there an hour ago for lunch, I can tell you that both my wife and I loved everything we ordered. The chips and salsa were so delicious and not like every other Mexican place for miles around. The chicken mole enchiladas were absolutely amazing in every way possible. Even the rice (which I normally don't even touch) was tasty enough for me to finish. I also had a side of fried plantains which were perfectly prepared and just the right ripeness for a sweet flavor to come through. My wife had the ground beef tostadas and kept remarking how delicious they were. Little Lupita came by the table to deliver our entrees herself and she was incredibly sweet. All in all, you can't help but get the impression that this food is made with care and love, not just throwing it together as quickly as possible. I can see why some people don't like this place, and it has everything to do with the fact that they have only experienced the poor quality Mexican food that other places serve and over time, they have grown to simply like it that way. Somebody even commented that Chili's fajitas are better. Really?  I rest my case.
<review# 472,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2013,8/6/2013,23,321,3,4,3>For transparency sake, I must declare that my husband I tried Nieto's for the first time the other during restaurant week.  The restaurant week special was a three course tasting menu for $30 - a great deal!We were very warmly greeted at the door by Debbie, the owner.  Then, the staff was so friendly and even enjoyed a small toast with us.  I already liked it so much better than the stuffiness of the former Carlos' restaurant.I began my meal with a blood orange margh - tini.  Highly recommended!  So yummy.The three course tasting menu began with a soup and salad combo.  The soup was a corn and shrimp bisque.  It was creamy, warm and delicious and on top of that it was really pretty.  The salad was a beet and brie salad.  This too was extremely tasty.  For our entrees we had the choice of lamb chops, fish or duck.  I had the lamb chops and I am only slightly ashamed to say that they were so good that I had to pick them up and make sure that I got every delicious morsel off the bone.  The chops were accompanied by spinach, a crispy polenta and a piece of  vegetable terrine.  The crispy polenta was only okay but the other sides were outstanding.  My husband had the fish and it was being touted through out the restaurant as the outstanding item of the night.  (I don't know because I didn't even taste it because mine was so good)  For dessert I think it was tiramisu but they didn't say for sure - anyway it tasted good!We learned that when it's not restaurant week they offer a four course tasting menu for $48.  We will certainly be back for that!

The lo mein chicken is tasty with big cuts of chicken.

The owner is really good at picking out technical books that show things 'the way they were'--fascinating stuff. I'd like to see a little bit more mathematical texts in there, but that's a pretty specialized niche, and probably asking too much. One of my very good friends is in here a lot more than me, and I'm always jealous of the books he picks out. Plus, said friend won a raffle for a couple tickets to a really great jazz concert, so everything about here has been really great!The record selection is perfect, too--love seeing some of the old classics here, along with a huge stack of very inexpensive records which are all in great condition.

<review# 476,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2012,8/2/2013,12,20,6,9,6>I am hesitant to review Revolution Spin because now everyone will know about the best kept secret of the North Shore. Revolution Spin is not a gym or spin studio...but it's an addiction. The feeling of satisfaction and euphoria that comes over you when you challenged yourself and finished an intense 60 minute ride is spectacular and absolutely addicting. I love that so many of the classes incorporate spin and strength training. The Boot Camp classes are beyond amazing (I wish they had them every night). Even though I have a gym at my work I still go to Revolution Spin b/c of the variety of classes they offer. Plus it is so convenient that you can book your classes on-line. It's not like a big box gym where the instructors turn on black lights and blast techno and call it Spin Class. The instructors at Revolution Spin care and really challenge and motivate you to work hard. Pros: The instructors, equipment, music selection, variety of classes.....basically EVERYTHING!Cons: (This isn't so much a con but more of a FYI.) If class is full you will sweat like an animal. It's a small studio so it gets really hot.

Tony was a pleasure to work with and thanks to him, my daughter's fifth birthday party will be a party to remember!

When I walked in the door I immediately felt the lighthearted aura of the store.  This wasn't a monstrosity of metal shelves, long aisles and overwhelmingness; it was pure innocent FUN.  Becky & Me Toys has a diverse selection, some brands I recognized and some that were new to me.  The staff is friendly and gives excellent recommendations each time I'm there, whether I have some idea of what I'm looking for to begin with or not. I never feel pushed or hurried to make a sale.  I love knowing that I can always pop in there and walk out with the perfect thing.  So far the toys have held up in their quality and have provided my kids with hours of enjoyment.  This is one happy mama!

<review# 480,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/11/2013,7/29/2013,137,206,,3,2>We came here with a group of 7 (reservations made that same Friday) and all of us had a great experience. I used to come here back when this was Red Star, so I was very impressed to see the changes made throughout the restaurant. It has a very hip and modern feel to it, yet it feels upscale. If you want to know what a true North Shore dining experience is, then Bobby's is the place for you! I am glad it is here though, because this area definitely lacks in upscale restaurants. For appetizers, we shared the Sweet and Spicy Calamari and the Chicken Wings Oreganato. Both were good, but nothing too crazy to remember. We also had their Beet Salad, but I was not a fan of it. They served bread with this amazing garlicky butter that was oh so good! For an entree, I had the Chicken Caprese (boneless breast of chicken sautéed in white wine with plum tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, and basil. It was tasty, but I wouldn't get it next time. Bobby's Burger was a popular choice in our group and I may need to get that next time...They do make their own desserts, but all of us went with different flavors of gelato. I had pistachio gelato, which had real pistachios in it. I wasn't a fan of it either - it wasn't sweet or creamy enough and I hate the actual peanuts, so I was just eating around them. Overall, our waiter was incredibly nice and attentive and the food, I would say, is a little above average. I will come back here at some point in the future, but probably not for some time since there was nothing that really stood out for me.
<review# 481,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2013,7/28/2013,33,130,1,6,3>New favorite lunch special!  I used to think you couldn't beat Pita Inn's lunch deal but Siunik has proved me wrong.  Not only is it cheaper, the quality of meats and rice are superior here. The meats are grilled when you order and not held in a tray.  Chicken is tender and the beef cooked just right, never dry and overcooked. The hummus is thick and while the bread has always been warm, it isn't my favorite. The side green salad is always bright and crisp, minimally dressed.  Pita Inn has its place....second place.  I hope Siunik sticks around for a while. This location hasn't had the best luck so it always worries me.  There is nothing on the menu that disappoints
<review# 482,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2013,7/27/2013,6,51,,8,4>This place blew me away.  Easily the best restaurant in Evanston by far.We came here for my husband's birthday and opted for the five-course prix fixe tasting menu with wine pairings, which was extremely reasonable (and totally worth it!) at $75 for the tasting and $25 for the wine pairings.  The wine pairings were spot on, very unique, and also very generous - while they were supposed to be 2.5 oz pairings, I'd guess they were more like 4 oz.The food itself was stellar.  The best course was the lamb followed closely by the escargot, but the monkfish and pierogi were also amazing.  The dessert was a solid end to the meal, but did not blow us away.  The bread selection was also fantastic - their focaccia was to die for. As for the service, while we had to wait slightly longer towards the beginning and end of the meal (only a few minutes), the pacing of the meal was excellent with enough time to finish our courses and savor our wine before the next.While initially a bit nervous about blindly choosing the five-course experience (the courses are chosen by the chef), this turned out to be fantastic as we might not have ordered those courses on our own which would have been a shame.We really enjoyed our meal and are almost certain to be back soon, perhaps for my birthday!

They've now replaced their gelato with their new all-fresh fruit popsicles. These are not the artificial sugary sticks you find at the supermarket that color your tongue red. They are refreshing, healthy, and natural. My favorite flavor is peach followed by green apple. This is the best summer treat, although a tad expensive at $2.50 a pop.
<review# 484,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2013,7/25/2013,94,254,,2,3>I'm fortunate that this sushi deli carry-out is on my way home from work. I have been going for years and the deli serves great sushi-quality fish, whole or sliced, sells all the condiments and side dishes to make your own sushi or sashimi as well as the option to order from their own sushi/maki menu. You can call in or order online and it usually takes them 15-30 minutes to prepare the freshest sushi to your liking and at reasonable prices. Each month they have a $13.99 special with the main entree usually a large special maki roll, appetizer, salad and miso soup. How can you go wrong? They have a great selection of sushi and maki on their menu: give it a try!Next door they also have the Sea Ranch grocery store so if you want to buy dumplings, ice cream or Asian vegetables to serve with dinner, that's an option, too!
<review# 485,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2013,7/24/2013,56,185,6,8,4>People have probably written everything there is to write about this place. The wings are great. The waffle fries are great. Et cetera, et cetera...However, I'm about to drop some knowledge on anybody who is unfazed by how society views them. Bring a tupperware container full of white rice and make sure you have enough people to order the party platter.When you get a platter of suicide wings, a pool of butter, hot sauce and jalapenos ends up gathering at the bottom of the aluminum tray. If you take the rice (which the tupperware hopefully kept fairly warm) and mix it in with the sauce, you will experience Buff Joe's in a way you have never experienced before. For the ones who don't mind doing a little extra work, rip the meat off the last few chicken wings into smaller chunks to create a complete dish.This also works if you take the wings as take-out but nothing beats getting the wings right out of the fryer.So, do you dare take on the challenge? Hopefully I'll be seeing a few more people with tupperware the next time I go. I'll be sure to say hello.
<review# 486,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/20/2013,7/23/2013,58,347,3,5,3>What do I say about the Baha'i... eh. Just come see this place. You will not regret it, even if it's just for novelty's sake, and for being able to visit one of 7/technically8/maybe9soon of these in the world. But it really is gorgeous.Come in the afternoon, take some nice pictures during the day/sunset. Go inside and sit and feel extremely peaceful for a while. Go read about the history of the place downstairs - I never like doing this, but this was pretty interesting. When it's darker out, drive/walk by on Sheridan Road. Whether you approach it from the north or sorth, there's a part of the road that curves, and suddenly the temple is within view. It looks like a majestic illuminated dome. Probably my favorite way of seeing it.DO IT!
<review# 487,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2013,7/22/2013,22,299,3,6,3>Took the wife and fam here for her birthday, good call. Started off with the special, rhubarb rita, too sweet for me but the wife enjoyed it. First we had the baked feta, warm and yummy. The only thing we would suggest is that Prairie offer some veges to eat the feta with instead of the insane influx of bread. The bread was good but waaay too much bread, they just kept bringing it. I had the fish and chips - rock solid choice and VERY good. Everyone at the table, even my kids were picking at my fish. Two things about the fish and chips, one, do not be like me and drown it in cider vinegar like I normally do. I tasted it with and without and it is better by itself without the vinegar. Two, the potato wedges that came with the fish I thought were dry. My wife ordered the moussaka, it was good and she enjoyed it. My daughter ordered the spaghetti off the childrens menu and I do not think she cared for it which is saying something because she is a total pasta head. I don't think the sauce was meaty enough for her.My son ordered the mac and cheese. The atmosphere was pleasant and so was the service. Price is fairly comparable but I would say for the extras you get - supports local sustainable farms, fresh ingredients, homemade, handcrafted that is well worth it.I almost forgot dessert, a fresh strawberry shortcake that was wonderful.
<review# 488,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2013,7/21/2013,23,74,7,9,7>Holey moley, me o my, these zapiekanki are the apple of my eye!  I've been searching for a Polish zapiekanka place forever, most places get so skimpy on ingredients, but not Euro Plate.  The zapiekanka is huge!  Its loaded up with ingredients and seriously can be a meal in itself.  I also tried the chicken kebab and its delish!  I love the kebabs in the Rynek in Krakow, and have to say these are a tie.  The chicken in the kebab is processed, would have rather seen cut meat like the gyro meat is shredded, but nevertheless its an awesome kebab with a great sauce.  What I like about this place, is that the food is not pre-made sitting in a warmer.  Its fresh, and made to order.  I rather wait the 15 min, and have a delicious fresh meal.  Next time I have to get the pierogi everyone is raving about.I have to mention, they are in a mini strip mall, next to a Chipotle...and I'm addicted to Chipotle.  They are good enough, that I can stray from the Chipotle and come here instead...and that says a lot!
<review# 489,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2013,7/20/2013,0,16,5,5,5>These guys are right down the street from me and boy am I glad. They take care of whatever issues arise with my CRV quickly and efficiently. I have been going to them for over 5 years and don't even consider taking my car anywhere else. The customer service is great. I trust them and really get the sense that they're looking out for me and keeping me safe. I have never felt ripped off or thought they were trying to take advantage of me. Sometimes they even do little jobs just for free. That's how they are. Matt Dillon, one of the guys there is very friendly and the owner Steve is great too. I highly recommend this place.
<review# 490,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2013,7/19/2013,229,200,2,3,2>This Italian restaurant made me and the bf super happy equipped with food coma. The restaurant is super cute!We did get lost because we were looking for a red sign, but they changed it to green. They vamped up the sign to green and their menu to reflect the change of season.I was very sad at first because I didn't get to experience tasting the short rib, but when all our food came out we were very satisfied.Everything was literally cooked to perfection.We ordered:Diver scallopsRoasted beets with goat cheesePork chop specialThe first pasta on the menu - with veal and sausageI highly recommend the diver scallops. I really enjoyed the roasted beets. Pork chop special was grilled and flavored to perfection. I'm not really a pasta lover, but this dish was just lovely.oh oh dun dun dun... d e s s e r t ! - we got the apple crisp with almonds and vanilla gelato ---- super fabulous! I didn't realize the difference a dessert dish would be by just adding toasted almonds!!!!The waitress recommended the bread pudding - we'll most probably be back for that.Dishes are a bit pricey here but I must say it is worth it.
<review# 491,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/6/2012,7/18/2013,1333,170,1,3,3>Okay, I needed a haircut and had gone to Creative Cuts on main street.Since creative cuts service both men and women, I  had to wait in line for 2 female customers and only one staff member working on site with another female customer.I grew impatient because I had to go to work and had  gone to the barber next door called "Tony's Barber shop" which had no customers at the time. I WAS IMPRESSED !!!!!! I will tell you the guy KNOWS HOW TO CUT HAIR. HE IS A PROFESSIONAL and I WAS SURPRISED. He cut my hair in perfect proportion. Not many people can cut hair like this guy. You don't get haircuts like this from places like the Hair Cuttery or Bo Rics. Why did I never had gone to him in the past if he is so good? I felt the business facade didn't reflect his professionalism as a barbar.  The business facade was old, run-down looking next to a pizza joint that also service some mexican food. Anyways, the facade of barber shop really didn't give me good impressions to walk into his business. He charges 15.00. THE PRICE IS WORTH THE VALUE!You will see a map of Siciliy on the wall in his shop along with singing parakeets.He was a nice guy and very hospitable.Furthermore, he was a good genuine Italian barber and you could see some of the old fotos from the 1950s in his shop of him working his craft as a barber.You WILL NOT FIND MANY OLD WORLD EUROPEAN BARBERS LIKE THIS GUY.PLEASE GO AND GET A HAIRCUT FROM HIM...way better than Bo Rics or HairCuttery.He will definitely make you look sharp and professional . Next week I got job interviews and Thanks Tony!
<review# 492,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/4/2013,7/17/2013,3,20,2,4,2>I'm odd-girl-out when I go in this place with my teenage son who doesn't buy his own clothes/gear YET. However, this suburban mom is never made to feel awkward at Shred Shop. I sort of linger and they sort of know what I'm doing - giving my kid some space.  They have good selection and often have shoes on sale.  Otherwise items are a little pricey. Staff talks to my skater boy like a friend which is nice as he is no longer a little kid but closer to being their contemporary.
<review# 493,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2012,7/16/2013,39,33,1,2,3>As a foodie, I love exploring every area for new places to eat at. And sometimes, you forget about all the great places that are a block away from you. Case in point for Dave's Italian Kitchen, a staple of Evanston for both college students and families for over 30 years. Interestingly enough, this is the one place serving Italian food doing it right, at least that I've found so far since returning from Italy. Simple, easy ingredients. Quality over quantity. Homey atmosphere. Everything that is essentially Italian, is at Dave's without a doubt. As a kid, I used to come to Dave's with my parents when we went to visit my grandmother on Sundays, and take her out to dinner. So it's safe to say, Dave's Italian Kitchen has been a staple for my family as well. I can recommend the Lasagna without a second thought, or the Spaghetti, two obvious Italian classics.On tonight's visit, I went with my dad. We ordered some garlic bread to start, and then we got to the good stuff! My dad ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, which is no surprise at all, because he orders it every time.Lucky for you guys, I've had the Spaghetti Bolognese and it is delicious! The sauce is satisfactorily meaty, and the flavor is rich and super tasty. Yes, this is a dish I recommend. You cannot go wrong with Spaghetti.I ordered the Fettuccine Rosé, which is this perfect mix of Alfredo sauce and marinara, blended together and topped with Fettuccine. I added Spinach to mine, which made it even better, at least in my opinion. The best thing about a Rosé sauce is the balance of creaminess. As a foodie, it is seriously unfortunate that I'm lactose intolerant. It sucks the most when I go to an Italian restaurant and want to order my favorite, Fettuccine Alfredo. So, ordering the Rosé is a great compromise to me. Not to mention, my pasta was absolutely delectable. I have plenty of leftovers to eat for lunch tomorrow!Finally, we had some dessert. Cannoli, anyone? Delicious but too much to eat in one sitting. I mean look at it. It's pretty appetizing!Overall, if you like Italian food, and I mean real Italian, come to Dave's Italian Kitchen on Chicago Avenue. I guarantee, whether it's risotto, pasta, lasagna, salmon, or a calzone, you will find something that you will enjoy!
<review# 494,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/14/2012,7/15/2013,53,173,2,3,2>Don't let the look of this place throw you... they make some good food!  Also, there's a patio in the back where you can sit when it's nice weather.  I recommend their soups, their sandwiches (I had the grilled tuna and it was amazing, so was the veggie!)I get the feeling like everything here is made to order, so time is a flexible concept.  Don't come here if you need to be in and out immediately.Otherwise, really good food.
<review# 495,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/5/2013,7/14/2013,32,156,6,3,2>Par King is a great place to go if you are any of these people: young, old, kids (who are at least 4 feet tall), people on a date, people married, people who are kind of bored with each other and need a real distraction for approximately 39 minutes. Basically, anyone.This is mini-golf (or putt putt as we call it where I'm from) extraordinaire. It's not hard, per se, but it's AMAZING, and that more than makes up for it. I don't want to give away some of the best surprises found on the links, but as long as you can avoid the water traps and aim even just a little, you can excel at Par King. I could not do either of those things, but I still had a great time, so basically the only thing you need to have fun there is a good attitude. Or a really hard putt putt swing, if you want your ball to go on the roller coaster. WHAT THERES A GOLF BALL ROLLER COASTER? yes, yes there is. And you probably can't get your ball to go on it, but it's amazing nonetheless.Also, hole 18 is a roulette game where you play for a free game of golf (and spoiler alert, I think it's rigged to let people win.) Gosh I love this place. I've only played the black course, but I can't wait to take my free game I won in roulette and play the red. And also the music is amazing, it sounded like my ipod from college in 2002.
<review# 496,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2013,7/13/2013,21,16,2,2,2>I did a groupon for this place & had almost a year of Dharma Yoga with Luna once a week.  It really helped me physically and emotionally in terms of continuing healing for old injuries and de-stressing.  I can do head stands again as Luna always approaches the practice with being safe & still challenging what you think are limitations in the body.  Love, love this place!! I wish I could get another groupon to go back, but she said its good to try out other modalities.  I think if I had the budget for it, I'd continue practicing with her.  Enjoy ... its so worth it! =)
<review# 497,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2013,7/12/2013,14,122,2,2,2>I've been here twice.The first time was getting home late from a west-coast trip and looked for a restaurant open late during the week.  How crazy am I to think such a place exists?  We lucked out and tried Tap House.  Good choice.Had a burger and double stout.  Partner had a kabob--me and Miss Finicky (no she does not read these reviews that I know of) both enjoyed our meals.  The double stout was great.  The server knew the beer menu which is good.The second trip was to take visiting entrepreneur son for lunch and get his reaction to the beer list.  No snob he (but definitely an expert)--he noted the solid beer list.Son had the burger--his fair comment was that it was a 4 star, but not the out of the world ones that you find some places.  I had the 'pizza'--chicken and mushroom with a drizzle of some mushroom sauce (good for some, not for me).This place is solid as solid can be.  A good place for upscale bar food and the hours are near urbanesque!
<review# 498,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2013,7/11/2013,6,7,,6,6>I visited Red 7 after my stylist of 15 years skipped town without warning. I was a little apprehensive having someone else cut my hair, but Kara did a fantastic job. She was considerate and sincerely listened to my perspective/vision and made some excellent suggestions. She was also very sweet and helped make my overall experience worth every star in this rating. The rest of the staff at the salon was incredibly welcoming and customer-focused from the time I entered (what would I like to drink?), during my service (would I like a hand massage?), and at the conclusion (here's a coupon for discounts on future services). It was very obvious that they value their clients and try hard to earn repeat business. Oh, and I almost forgot -- they offer complimentary haircuts for kids under the age of 5, as long as I'm a client. WHAT?! Overall, I felt like I got a great haircut for an excellent value and had an enjoyable experience.Needless to say, I'll be back -- with my daughter.
<review# 499,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2013,7/10/2013,23,203,1,5,4>All the "quiet buzz" about this place is true- from the genuinely friendly service to the rich Latin favors of the food.  The place is small yet cozy; I personally think some deep colors on the wall might be what it needs to complete the ambience.  The food is unbelievable! We were greeted by a lovely bowl full of ribbons of plantains that were light and perfectl with the chimichurri sauce.  We then moved on to a sampler trio of ceviche - the fresh and delicate flavors of tuna, shrimp and mahi-mahi will transport you to a seaside paradise.  For our main entrees, I ordered the pulled pork served on a generous serving of rice and beans with a side of yuca and plantains.  My husband ordered the churrasco- grilled skirt steak and chicken also served with rice, beans, yuca and plantains.  Although your food would never be lonely as it's always accompanied by chimichurri, you wouldn't need any sauce as the dishes were flavorful without being too fussy.  My only regret is knowing that this place will soon be discovered by more people who, like me, can appreciate the authentically prepared food that will surely make you want to come back over and over again.
<review# 500,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2013,7/9/2013,278,13,3,5,2>Definitely my favorite place in town to get a drink.  Tommy is the best bartender/owner.  He knows everyone and makes you feel at home.  It's affordable, the decor is perfect for an unassuming neighborhood pub and there is even an outdoor area.  I can watch the news or a game show of choice if it's not busy. My absolute favorite thing about The Toadstool is the wifi and the plugs in front of the bar seats.  I love I can bring my computer and have a beer and get some work done.  I feel a little more productive!
<review# 501,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2013,7/8/2013,206,413,3,4,3>Awesome. I had to try this place. Considering we had a yelp event that they catered previously, my expectations were high.So, let me first give praise to the fact that the food here is delish. Great price, as well. I must note - don't underestimate those sauces they have at the tables, as they are great! the green is kind of a lime-cilantro sauce and I don't know what the red is but impressive. Vegetarian options are a major plus and quinoa is pretty awesome as well. I got a veggie burrito with everything minus sour cream + guac, and it was excellent. I can't emphasize enough that I like the unique take they have on mexican food, with good seasonings and choices abound. Verdict? Been here once, probably going here a second time today, I'm hooked.  This place is great, even if it's easily misunderstood due to the name + chicago, as we all know of another El we think of.All in all though, I must say that they kind of need to figure out a better system to serve customers - they seem a bit disorganized and flustered when it gets busy.  Maybe a 2nd register, or separating orders - to register - to pickup in some way? I also wish they delivered. Location is small, clean, and shows signs of a true mom & pop business - which there is nothing wrong with that.  They are easily overlooked, and should not be.
<review# 502,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2013,7/7/2013,13,103,2,3,4>A nice place to get some classic breakfast fare.  Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, no exotic flavors...  Just a reasonable variety of breakfast favorites, prepared quickly, competently, and at an affordable price.  They have a few healthier options, which I usually get.  I'd get them even if they weren't healthy, because I like the ingredients.  Nothing is over seasoned or too salty, which is how I prefer my breakfast.  Servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes for our order to come out, piping hot and tasty.  It almost makes me wish I weren't nocturnal most of the week, I'd love to come here for breakfast more often.
<review# 503,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2013,7/6/2013,4,21,,2,2>As far as authentically good Italian food and cuisine, it does not get better than this restaurant.  I have lived in the area since 1981 and have been frequenting this eatery the entire time.  As a foodie surrounded by Italian heritage cooking and spoiled by it, if this restaurant has our approval, it is good!  Add to that the reasonable price for what you are getting and the consistently good service.  Don't expect to go here and have a fast meal, that will probably not happen unless you are at a downtime, it is more European and the pace is more relaxed.  I also have to say that as far as a local establishment being supportive of its community, this place has consistently donated their fare without thought of reward.Go here and you will not be disappointed if high quality, good Italian food is your goal, with excellent service and a reasonable price!  It is great from the lasagna to the pizza, and don't miss the Chicken Limon!

I got to help design a gold band ring with my birth stone in it, flash forward 20 years later and I am still coming to Katy and "designing" more jewelry.  This is a great gem in Glenview. I love the simple and modern design of Katy's pieces, everything is stunning and reasonably priced!  My new addiction are their hoop earrings that they can create in any size, they are so light weight and comfortable, just love them!!!!
<review# 505,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2013,7/4/2013,18,123,3,4,3>The cafeteria style dining room didn't stun me but the food was very good.  Pancakes were fluffy and cakey; my meat lover's breakfast skillet was hefty with cheese melted perfectly, egg fried well, and potatoes and meat blended nicely.  The wait staff was very fast and friendly, quick with refills of water and coffee.  And the bus boys were on their feet the whole time.
<review# 506,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/5/2013,7/3/2013,40,126,3,3,3>Cozy little place, flavorful tacos, and great horchatas..what more could you ask for?  I was intrigued by the line I'd always see during lunch hours, so I decided to pop in around 6:30.  Ordered my food at the counter (al pastor and taco of the week) and although I was about to take it go, I was told it would probably take about 20 minutes, so I sat at a table and wrote student evaluations (oh joy) while I waited. There were a few families there and a table of junior high schoolers happily enjoying their food. When mine arrived, I was not disappointed. The taco of the week had grilled pineapple and fried jalepenos..yum, and the al pastor was delicious as well.  It was a nice portion..if you're a big eater, I would order at least 4-5 tacos, but for me, the two was just fine. Definitely will be stopping by again
<review# 507,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2013,7/2/2013,57,93,3,7,3>I never thought I would give a korean place 5 stars ( No offense to my fellow koreans but customer service is not really on the top list for any business owned by Korean people) but this place really impressed me.  From the moment I walked in I was greeted by the entire staff and the host took my jacket and hung it up for me. My hair dresser was a man who recently came from Korea but he was very knowledgeable about hair and what he thought would look good.  With the help of a translator (almost all of the staff spoke English, aside from my hairdresser guy), I was able to dictate what I wanted and what he recommended.  Even in my broken korean, he tried to create small-talk which I appreciated bc I always feel it awkward when it's dead silent. The desk guy(he also cuts hair.. I have no idea who he is or if he owns the place) is the nicest man I've ever encountered.  THere are mini t.vs at every seat and he made sure I was able to see the t.v.  He even gave me some headphones to listen to the t.v while I was getting my hair cut.  The man and the staff came up several times to see if I wanted any coffee or water. Talk about customer service! They were fairly busy and they took the time to tend to me.  After the cut, he put my jacket on for me and again, the entire staff greeted me out the door. Impressive! Highly recommende!!
<review# 508,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2013,7/1/2013,2,7,1,3,4>We have had so much fun getting into comics since Aw Yeah moved to the neighborhood a little over a year ago. Marc, one of the owners has so much knowledge it's amazing. He has helped pick out comics for my husband and my 6 year old which they have loved. The store is warm and friendly and very comfortable even for someone that doesn't know a whole lot about comics or graphic novels. They have many, many special events such as the BBQ they just held this past Sunday. I strongly encourage anyone who loves comic books, graphic novels and toys to visit and see what I'm talking about. The website is also very informative and has all the upcoming events including writers and illustrators that visit the store often to sign and sketch their various works.

The guys that work there know so much about their plants and it's a joy talking to them. Very clean, beautiful nursery with gorgeous bug-free and disease-free plants.
<review# 510,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/15/2013,6/29/2013,34,79,3,7,3>This is a MUST go place for my two girlfriends and I.  We literally only meet here. Summer or winter, we love coming here for meat and veggies!Depending on the servers, the service can be great! There are super attentive ones and those who forget.  We are very needy with the pickled radishes, kimchi, and our broth.Between the 3 of us, we have tried everything Shabu style, and LOVE everything.  Usually its beef or pork meat, with cabbage veggie plate, and noodles or rice porridge at the end.  Seaweed or Beef broth. Dumplings. YUM.Tip? Add some bay leaves to your broth before all the meat and veggies come out! makes the broth more yummy!!

My car had been suffering through various snow and salt stains for weeks, and today I decided that I should just go ahead and get it cleaned. I found these guys and overall they did a fantastic job. Two small complaints: My back windshield is more smeared than it had been before, and I had asked to only have them wash the outside (the inside wasn't too bad), which was quoted at $10, and they went ahead and cleaned the inside too and I ended up having to pay $14. I drove two blocks back to my own place, and I realized that there were some sticky stains on the front and hood of the car. I called them and asked if I could come back, and when I got there the guy said that some tree sap probably fell on my car while I was driving it back (?), and offered to clean it off for free. He also threw in a complimentary tire dressing. Great service! Will definitely be coming back.
<review# 512,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2013,6/27/2013,283,562,2,4,4>A year and a half and about 3 dozen trips later, Coffee Lab has re-established itself as a top coffee purveyor in Evanston. I actually dig it a lot more than Brothers K as of late since there's actually room to sit/work here.The only thing I order is the Diablo Dark, which is bold, smokey, and a hint of maltiness. It's great if you prefer darker roasts. Also, the quality of the Diablo Dark is surprisingly consistent considering they use a pour over method for serving their coffees. Anyway, I highly recommend getting your favorite coffee drink at Coffee Lab. I'm most likely moving into the city this summer, so I'm making the most out of my time here while I'm still living in Evanston.
<review# 513,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2012,6/26/2013,30,120,2,2,2>I just recently found out about this place located in Skokie. My mouth waters every time I hear their name. I drive out of my way just to get their chicken ceasur spinach. The wrap is juicy and filled with the best dressing I have ever tasted. The price is reasonable too, for $5.00 you receive a huge wrap. I haven't tried anything else there but I can only imagine that its just as good.The place is very small, the seating is limited. Word of advice don't eat there on your lunch break, it will take forever to get your food and find a seat because it is usually so packed.
<review# 514,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2012,6/25/2013,24,32,1,3,3>Good's of Evanston has been around for a long, long time, and has a great reputation.  I don't think you gain that kind of credibility and longevity by delivering schlock.  When we first received our Ketubah we visited Good's to have it matted for display. They kindly held it longer for us (so we couldn't destroy it before the big day).  The framing process was a little intense because they have so much to choose from and it's very difficult to envision the final product if you don't have framing experience.  The associate who worked with us understood the concern, and applied his experience and color theory to help us narrow down choices.  He also waited very patient while we struggled to make our decision.  You can imagine the nachas we felt when the completed piece was unveiled.  Yeah, the price tag stings a little because you can't believe what it costs, but when you see the final piece and realize what it means to your family, you can't deny that you're thankful and impressed.  We're extremely happy with the work they did for us, and I would drive up to an hour to have work done here again.
<review# 515,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/7/2013,6/24/2013,10,26,2,6,4>Dengeos?  More like Deliceos!Never had anything here that wasn't tasty.  The portions are enormous, and a pretty good deal for your money.  Husband and I usually split a gyros plate with an extra pita and side dish and are stuffed by the time we are done for around $13 total.  Their Greek potatoes are my favorite-- chickeny, lemony, moist and delicious!  Husband loves their rice.  We also love their tzatziki, which is just the right consistency-- not too runny, not too thick.The interior is always super clean, and there are staff constantly rotating through to wipe down tables and remove trays and plates.  Yum!
<review# 516,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2012,6/23/2013,1,6,2,4,2>What town doesn't need a restaurant like Merlo's?  Welcoming atmosphere, excellent service, and fabulous food!  The two of us shared a huge plate of perfectly cooked calamari.  I then feasted on orechiette with sausage and rapini. Sooo good!  I am not usually a fan of pot roast but I tried my friend's "Nanna's Gravy" dish (pot roast with penne & tomato sauce).  I am now a convert!  If only my Nanna had made this...  Kid friendly place but good for date night, too.  Friendly bar area where you can feast on delicious food (including pizza) and watch the Bears play on a cold afternoon. I'm going back soon!
<review# 517,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/18/2012,6/22/2013,6,26,,6,4>Very good falafel sandwich. Large, inexpensive, not greasy, and freshly made pita (more like a wrap). Highly recommend (4.5 stars). They include a turnip in the sandwich which is very crunchy. I always ask them to leave it out which they are happy to do. Tahini sauce is very good too. Unlike Pita Inn, this is a sit down restaurant.
<review# 518,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/13/2013,6/21/2013,32,301,2,4,2>Say what you will about the horrors of the DMV but for the last 11 years i have only been caught in a crippling long wait about 4 times. I have even forgotten items and they let me know that i can just go get it and instead of waiting in line just come back up to the counter. Fairly nice people working here, at least some of them and very regular faces here. Just wish you could take the M license test here
<review# 519,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2013,6/20/2013,122,140,3,7,3>On the outside, Aguas Tortas doesn't really strike me as an appetizing restaurant. I declined to go in until a few minutes ago because I was reminded of the joint that existed before the tortas arrived....the idea of a fast casual restaurant. Upon recommendation from a friend of mine, I decided to give it a shot. I ordered an al pastor torta at the recommendation of someone who seemed like the owner. I really loved when he told me that if I didn't like it, he would give my money back. The guy was confident about the quality of what he had for which is a plus in any circumstance. I came back to my apartment and took a bite and yes...what a torta I was eating! I was expecting perhaps the taste of tortas I ate from Frontera but I was delighted when I was greeted with an expected taste of spiciness and well-seasoned. The beef really reminded me of a type of stir-fried pork from Korea that I especially enjoy. My only observation is the set of untouched containers of sauces that remain on my table. There was no feasible way I was able to use the sauce to add flavor (if I wanted) to the torta (bite a little off and dip the remaining part into what was too small of a container). Pouring it over my torta wasn't a great idea either. Maybe they could work on this as well as perhaps improving their sit-down dinner experience in some ways. But in terms of the food, top quality.
<review# 520,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2013,6/19/2013,82,219,4,4,4>This Chinese restaurant might just be another good find.  I was in the area on a Saturday night & I had the taste for some good Chinese food.  I pulled out my phone, opened up Yelp & found this restaurant.  This restaurant is located in a small shopping center.  When I walked in at first I was a little unsure because the place wasn't the most eye catching.  Sure the walls might have had a few spots on them but the food ended up being more than worth it.  I started off with a Hot & Sour Soup for an appetizer which is always my soup of choice when it comes to Chinese food.  Next for an entree I ordered the Mongolian Beef another one of my favorites.  The portion size for the Hot & Sour Soup was pretty good especially for the price.  The Hot & Sour Soup had flavor & was warm.  It didn't taste like it had been sitting in the back for an hour.  Some Hot & Sour Soups at Chinese restaurants are either cold or taste too watery.  Next my entree arrived & right away I was surprised at how big of a portion there was.  I was surprised because this restaurant was one of the better priced Chinese restaurants I have been to in a while.  Overall the staff was nice & the food came pretty quick.  The portion sizes were bigger than most Chinese restaurants & the prices were some of the best I have seen in a while.  I would eat here again if I was in the area.

<review# 522,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2013,6/17/2013,130,318,3,4,5>Walked over to Al's from Evanston hospital after my wife delivered our first child last week. She was craving a salami sandwich, and I decided I needed to seek out the best of the best for a woman who waited 9 months to once again consume lunch meat :)I looked no further than the Yelp reviews about Al's. When I got there the line was long, so I knew it was going to be good. The sandwiches were awesome, loved the fresh crunchy baguettes!!! The macaroni and potato salads tasted all homeade, which I love b/c it lets you know that they are taking the extra step with everything and not cutting any corners. Cute place that fits perfectly into the Evanston college/hipster type atmosphere. If they could speed up service a bit more I would come here a lot more often! Other than that, a true gem of a little deli!!
<review# 523,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2013,6/16/2013,48,257,2,3,2>Decided to go out for Greek Easter instead of cooking at home.  Boy are we glad we came here.  The place was PACKED but the service and food did not indicate this.  Our server was amazing and as attentive as he could be considering he had about 20 tables of ten or more people.  We had 13 people and a child and decided to do the $21.95 per person family style option.  HOLY abundance of food.  SO much.  Saganaki, fried zuchinni, garlic mash, taramasalata, and more to start!  They were out of the gyro we were supposed to get, but understandable on Easter Sunday and they more than made up for that with extras.  Then we had the Avgolemeno, wow!  A beautiful and crisp Greek salad followed.  Then the entree...Holy Moly again!  Pasticio Perfection, Lamb Decadence, Chicken Kebob juicy and spiced just right, Rice, Potatoes, Dolamades.  The dolmades were the only thing I didn't love.  A little dry, but again, it was busy so they may have had to sit all day. Beautiful desserts, good coffee.  Either way this place is five stars all the way from the food, service, decor, bar, drinks, everything.  The place was filled with happy , loud, fun Greek families, it was a great place to be on a holiday!  We will be back for sure! Also for all of this , 13 people , drinks too, $365.00  Couldn't believe the bill was so low.  Charge more, people will pay!  Also free valet.
<review# 524,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2013,6/15/2013,2,9,,9,1>The food here is fantastic.  I was initially hesitant to try this place due to all the negative reviews.  But last week I decided to give it a try since it is very close to my office.  I tried the buffet on a weekday with a colleague.  The buffet had 16 items and 1 dessert.  They also had a small salad/fruit bar.  Out of the 16 items, 10 were vegetarian and 6 were non-vegetarian.  On my second visit, there were 9 veg and 7 non-veg items.  I was told that the buffet items keep changing every day (it's not a standard menu).  The Naan was served to the table and it tasted really fresh.  The food items tasted authentic (nothing powdery).  They seem to follow the real recipe.  The buffet had both south-indian and north-indian style dishes (on both my visits).--------------------------------------------------­-------------------------Service:----------The restaurant was amply staffed. The plates were removed promptly.  We never had to ask out for anything.  Waiters were too good and did their job very well.  There was always someone standing near the buffet place to help out people who wanted to know about a specific dish.--------------------------------------------------­-------------------------Cost:----------The weekday buffet is 9.99 dollars and it is worth every penny (and more!!).  I had a look at their full menu and found many items to be very less priced (may be because they are a new establishment).  The weekend buffet costs 3 dollars more but I didn't get a chance to try it.--------------------------------------------------­-------------------------Location:--------------They are located right behind Glenview Metra station (next to Egg Harbor Cafe).  The parking lot was full at both times but we were able to find a spot on the road (2 hr parallel park).  --------------------------------------------------­-------------------------Cons:---------The tables were spaced too tightly and it caused a bit of inconvenience to navigate from my table to the buffet place every time.  They should consider removing the last row (2-chair tables) and increase the navigational space.They can also consider 'Delivery' option to nearby places. Currently, they provide only 'Eat-In' and 'Pickup' option.
<review# 525,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2012,6/14/2013,42,197,1,3,3>I never was a mall rat, not even in my preteen years, but I can appreciate a good shopping establishment when I have to go to one. Northbrook Court is one of the nice ones. I have so many good things to say about this mall. Its Clean. Its Safe. It has a nice variety of mid level to high end stores. Its INDOORS (seriously who thought an outdoor mall was a good idea in Chicagoland? HELLO, its WINTER here half the year, even at Old Orchard!)Add to that an AMC theater, ample parking and a decent food court , a couple popular stand alone restaurants like California Pizza Kitchen and Stir Crazy, then make it close to my house. Perfect. Its my first choice in malls. Old Orchard second, but only in the Summer. Woodfield if I have to.
<review# 526,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/28/2013,6/13/2013,213,113,5,7,5>I'm conflicted.  I was already sold on this place because of the the Oak Park location.  Now that this one has opened up in Evanston (which is way closer to me than Oak Park), I have the option of coming here more often.  Therein lies the problem.  It's so good, but so bad for you, that having this option will make my heart explode. I came here on a Thursday at around 4PM.  Nobody here!!!  I came in, sat down, ordered, and my food came out just as fast  I ordered the Nicole Marie (2 pieces of dark chicken, smothered & waffles w/ whipped cream).  The guy went a little overboard with the whipped cream, but that's all right with me.  I recommend getting your chicken smothered, or getting a side of gravy because it is just that good!
<review# 527,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2012,6/12/2013,0,18,4,8,4>Update: I've used this store several times for service or repair since writing my original review, and they never disappoint. They are absolutely my go to guys for all my family's cycle needs. Original review; After reading some of the negative reviews, I felt compelled to write a review on my experience at Al's Cycle Shop.I have a Trek bicycle that has been hanging from hooks in my garage untouched for 7 years. Recently, I've been telling my 5 year old son that when he learns to ride without training wheels, I would get my bicycle service so that I could ride with him. On Tuesday, the day after taking the training wheels off his bike, he mastered the skill. He was so excited and so proud and he wanted me to get my bike cleaned and working right away. On Wednesday morning, my son and I packed my bike into the minivan and we went to Al's. I found them online but after reading some Yelp reviews, I was hesitant to try them. I can comfortably say that I am glad that I did. I was served by Danny and he told me that it would be a few days before they could get the bike back to me. My son, in his naive 5 year old manner, told Danny that he wanted daddy's bike back today! At first Danny responded that they wouldn't be able to get it back to me for a few days, but then he said that he would do the best that he could and he would call me back. While in the store, we also looked at a toddler trailer and a bike for my son. We weren't ready to make either purchase. At 3pm the same day, Danny called me to say that my bike was ready. My son was so happy that the bike was ready, and we went to go and pick it up right away. I paid $65 for the service plus some costs for additional add-ons that I requested (a bike stand, a lock bracket, etc). I thought that the fee was reasonable (I haven't shopped elsewhere so I have no basis of comparison). I was just so appreciative the quick turn around time that they were able to do to make a 5 year old happy.I did have two brief encounters with an older gentleman whom I presume is the owner of the business. He was polite enough, but to be clear he is not a conversationalist. Some of the other reviews have criticized this. For me, I went to the store to get a good service at a reasonable price with a fast turn around time. I did not go there looking for personality or conversation.I love supporting local businesses and, in this case, I'm very pleased that I did.  I am awarding this review a 4 star rating as I felt that they did everything that they should have done and I concluded my transaction feeling that they did not disappoint me or let me down in any way.  I reserve 5 stars for the truly exceptional.
<review# 528,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2013,6/11/2013,38,121,6,5,5>2 words--taco plate!At 3 tacos for $11.89, that's a bargain, and I was surprised by how full I got from the meal. And this is coming from a vegetarian, who ordered:- 1 potato taco: I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but the chipotle salsa and arugula added the perfect kick. - 2 vegetable tacos: The queso fresco made the dish with its trademark salty-sour kick. While it's creamy by nature, it's not rich or buttery tasting.The nachos and guacamole combo is another must-try! Note that Taco Diablo doesn't take reservations, so come on weekdays to maximize chances of getting seated quickly.[Update 1/4/14]: I'm saddened that Taco Diablo was burned down by the Pine Yard fire back on Sat. Dec. 29th, but I hope they will rebuild.
<review# 529,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2013,6/10/2013,11,24,3,4,4>My family loves this place. It looks like any other Mexican fast-food restaurant tucked away in a little strip mall in Niles, but the food quality far exceeds your expectations. The restaurant clearly caters to a Mexican population as they have stuff like "lengua" tacos on their menu.  By the way, I highly recommend anything "lengua" related.  It's a tender meat that almost tastes like a very tender roast beef. It's become a favorite for both myself and my kids. I recommend experimenting with new things here when you order. You won't be sorry.  My kids and I have tried almost everything on the menu and we've never been dissatisfied.The food is inexpensive and better than most Mexican food you'd eat at fancier restaurants. The service has always been great as well - pleasant, friendly, and prompt.
<review# 530,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2013,6/9/2013,0,29,3,3,5>I just had a great service experience at Performance Bicycles in Northbrook. The periodic nightmare that is putting on my Saris bike rack with the 6 straps and the buckles and the knobs and you kind of forget how you did it last year? WELL, I went in for some advice, which I got. It would have been 4 stars, very professional and knowledgable. But Rob, the manager took pity on me and we went outside and he helped me put the rack on the car. AND close the trunk, which is worth an extra 1/2 a star, believe me. A big store with great selection and great prices, everybody knows that. But service like a little store that's been in the same spot for 50 years. Excellent. Now get biking.
<review# 531,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2013,6/8/2013,4,20,4,5,4>We are still getting used to our new home, and figured that we'd better get the HVAC system tuned up for the summer. So, after researching some of the local options on Angie's/Yelp we decided on Shavitz based upon the reviews.When Glen H. and James C. showed up, they were friendly, courteous and ready to get right to work. I really appreciated their consistent use of their booties as they moved throughout the house, helping to protect our floors and carpets. They were professional and efficient, as they tuned up our multi-zone AC system. As they worked they were kind enough to explain the system to me, as the new home owner.They were even really kind to our active yellow lab, who insisted upon supervising their work, and ultimately conned them into throwing his tennis ball while their tests were running.The end result was a noticeably improved AC system, cleaned filters (that I didn't even know existed!), and a detailed recommendation plan for maintaining and updating our aging HVAC system. Based on their performance, detail and professionalism, I decided to enroll in their year-round maintenance plan, because I felt that we would be well taken care of.Glen H. and James C. did nice work at a fair price and left our home better than they found it... I can't ask for too much more.
<review# 532,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2013,6/7/2013,67,185,6,6,5>I love Barnaby's...their thin crust pizza is so good.  It's very different than Pizano's and Pat's down in Lincoln Park, but delicious on its own.  The only thing I don't like is some of the parents here are clueless as to manners and common courtesy.  The place was packed and these idiot moms are walking around like they are the only people in there.  For example, I'm walking to the table with our pizza and salad, and this woman literally cuts right in front of me and I almost spill everything.  No "Oh, I'm sorry!"  or "excuse me!" or anything...just rude...but what do you expect from Northbrook.  I won't hold it against Barnaby's though...I'll just probably stick to the Arlington Heights location from now on!
<review# 533,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2012,6/6/2013,52,196,5,5,5>Pita Inn is the standard by which I compare all other Mediterranean Food.  I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place sooner!The best deal here is the business lunch special (M-F, 11am-3pm).  $4.95 gets you a little shish kabob, kifta kabob, some shawarma, a piece of chicken and Falafel served with rice pilaf, salad, and pita bread.  $3.95 will get you the same thing just without the chicken tender.  [Insert shocked face here].  Yes it is that cheap for that much food.Not only are their portions generous the food is excellent!  The pita bread is baked fresh next door at the Pita Inn Market & Bakery next door where you can actually see them making the pita bread.  The hummus is addicting, the shawarma is delicious, the falafel is great, the rice pilaf is so good I have to get it on the side with whatever I order, and the sauces complement everything perfectly.A warning, this place definitely gets packed during lunch & dinner hours as there's not a whole lot of seating; be ready to wait to sit or have someone camp out while another person orders.  Service here is fast (they have to be), the staff is very nice, and the place is always clean.  One of my favorite restaurants in Skokie!

<review# 535,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2013,6/4/2013,32,212,3,5,4>Delicious food, nice ambiance, excellent service, and free street parking after 6p? I'll be back!The meal started off with the complementary chips and salsa, the latter which was spicy and tasty -- no mild pico de gallo here. We ordered the Mole Negro and Pechuga de Pollo Moctezuma ($16 each), both of which were delectable. In particular, they boast 32 ingredients in the mole, and the depth of flavor in it lived up to my expectations. The chicken underneath the mole was tender and moist. The slice of flan we shared at the end of the meal was a perfect way to sooth the spiciness of the meal.I was impressed by how reasonable the portion sizes were: imagine a 10" dinner plate, 1/4 of the area is given to carbs (1/2 cup of rice in this case), 1/3 to the side (beans or vegetables), and the remaining portion to the main course (meat or vegetables). It felt just like how I make food at home.
<review# 536,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2012,6/3/2013,8,15,2,3,3>After receiving pricey estimates from several tree removal and landscaping companies, I was referred to Canopy Tree Specialists by a neighbor to remove six trees from around our house.  Bud Clark, the owner, came out to provide an estimate, was punctual and very friendly, and provided a great quote that beat the others by a significant amount.  He also knew all the village codes and permit processes for tree removal in Lake Bluff, and what to expect.  Bud and his crew are professional, and VERY detail oriented.  They worked quickly, safely, and cleaned everything up, and managed to remove all six trees with minimal impact to flower beds and surrounding shrubs.  VERY IMPRESSED.  My highest recommendation for tree removal and stump grinding.

Hope you are a fan of tuna because that's what majority of their rolls contain.Fresh fish and I'm happy to see that they don't skimp on the good stuff aka "seafood"Fish:rice ratio is of utmost importance. Most sushi joints will try to fluff out the customers by playing hide-and-seek with the itty bitty pieces of sashimi wedged in between the sushi rice. No unpleasant surprises here.Few appetizers could be better.Huge huge fan of poke, but theirs was disappointing.Small bits of poke on top of a tortilla chip?   Confusing.
<review# 538,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/16/2013,6/1/2013,180,1540,3,4,3>The concept is such a great idea - grilled cheese on a college campus.  The perfect thing for a cold rainy/snowy day!  Especially since the Classic grilled cheese has cheddar, American with tomatoes, ham and bacon all on Texas toast with a side of tomato soup to dip and slurp it up in.  My only qualm is that the grilled cheese is $8 and we first came here because we had a Groupon for it.  However, we have returned other times and take advantage of their other specials and still enjoy ourselves.  I noted that they now have these arcade games made into tables towards the front of the restaurant which is a fantastic touch.I also noted that you can close this place down to throw adult birthday parties which is a nice concept - some college kid was throwing a 21st birthday party for her boyfriend here for that very night.Great concept, pricey but you do get what you pay for since it's a richer version of grilled cheese than what Mom would make.  My kids do love it and having an arcade game table is a dream come true for the kid in my husband and our kids.

Many other area restaurants are charging as much or more for crap they buy from Sysco or poured out of a can.  At In The Raw you can enjoy great, delicious food that is good for you at competitive prices, as far as north 'burb dining goes.I also tried the banana/cinnamon tasty juice concoction my chica grabbed to go, and it was really yummy.  Saw lots of folks coming in to get juices to go while I was there.I would absolutely return to In The Raw, I want to come back and try the organic tequilas and rums!!!
<review# 542,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2013,5/28/2013,206,154,,3,3>Best Burgers in town is correct! I am still thinking about my burger and the best ever artichoke dip! Their homemade chips are excellent when they haven't been sitting. I have gotten them obviously fresh and when they may have been made for someone else before me and I can tell the difference. They have Chicago sports, trivia night on Saturdays at 8PM and a jukebox that I have yet to hear. The crowd has its locals and they are pretty friendly. I have looked over the dinner menu and I must say, the prices are very good, especially for the area. I will be back for dinner and drinks soon!
<review# 543,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2012,5/27/2013,29,219,1,3,3>Great little spot. I had passed by this bakery hundreds of times but had never stopped in. A friend recently when gluten free and they had a living social deal so I decided to finally try it. THe customer service is great. A man, I presume to be the owner, was very friendly and so knowledgeable about gluten free and dairy free diets and gave me some excellent advice about alternative eating to deal with my daughter's asthma and for my friend's nut allergy. The bread smelled delicious and was just coming out of the oven as I arrived. I had no idea that gluten free could be so tasty. Even though I am not gluten free and probably never will be, I will definitely come back to this bakery and try the cafe next time.
<review# 544,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2013,5/26/2013,3,26,,4,2>Love love love! After having a few bad & mediocre experiences at nail salons around the area (see my reviews), my friend and I decided to give Bong Nails & Spa a shot. And we are so happy that we did! We both got Shellac French manicures and we were very pleased with how detail oriented our nail technician was. Our nails turned out perfectly and the complimentary back massage that we received at the end of our service was AMAZING. We will be back for sure. I highly recommend - just be sure to make an appointment in advance!
<review# 545,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2013,5/25/2013,137,206,1,4,3>I've only been here a couple of times, but Dawes Park beats any other parks out of the water! It's in a great location in Evanston right off of Sheridan Road. I was just here this past weekend, and there was plenty of side street parking, however, it gets much busier during hot summer days. I love to come to Evanston as often as possible, so what I usually end up doing is parking in the public parking in downtown Evanston and walking a few minutes down the street until I reach the park/Lake Michigan. Both times I've parked there, it ended up being free.It seems that Dawes Park is connected to a couple things such as a wonderful dog beach. The park itself has a beautiful lagoon with a fountain and LOTS of room to have a picnic. There are trails to run or bike, or just walk along Lake Michigan and take in the scenery. It's also a great spot to people watch and take wonderful pictures. On the other side of Sheridan Road, there are old Victorian houses that are breathtaking, but kind of creepy at the same time!One of the best perks is that it's free and it's never too crowded, which makes it great for any occasion. Since it's so close to Downtown Evanston, there are plenty of dining options. Next visit, I am bringing my dog... :)
<review# 546,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/22/2012,5/24/2013,6,14,,2,2>Thai Sookdee is definitely one of my thai favorites.  The food always comes out very fast, and the service is very efficient.  Four of us went in for a quick meal and came out in 30 minutes!Their curries are especially good--and also their thai iced teaIt's a bit of a walk from where I live, so their delivery is great too.
<review# 547,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2013,5/23/2013,3,25,2,5,3>Roy did solid work, is honest, and was priced competitively compared to some of the other quotes I received.  He was responsive to my calls, cleaned up his mess, and didn't break anything.  He had good suggestions for colors that would go with our granite and with our furniture.  What more could I ask for?
<review# 548,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2013,5/22/2013,27,35,1,4,4>This is a great neighborhood restaurant for a quick weeknight bite, cocktail with a friend, or a celebration dinner. My favorite place to sit is around the bar in a high top; the crowd is a bit younger and the cocktail server, Ruth provides superb service with a smile. Service is always professional, prompt, and on point no matter where you sit.The food never fails at the Happ. You cannot go wrong with their juicy burgers or broasted chicken. My favorite thing on the menu is a little outside the North Shore "box", the chicken enchiladas. The green sauce they are served with is absolutely divine ( I could probably drink a cup!). The beverage program is clearly well thought out. The beer list is extensive and highlights local craft brews, as well as hard to find novelties. The wine and cocktail lists  are excellent and pair well with the food menu. The Happ Inn is great destination for lunch, dinner or a drink in the suburbs.
<review# 549,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2013,5/21/2013,54,205,1,2,1>Decided it was time to bite the bullet!  New car time. For most, this is exciting and a really fun thing, for me....not so much. I hate it, in fact.  This place rocked!  I went into to test drive a Mercury Mariner that Mike found online...I wasn't too impressed but thought what the heck?!  I didn't like it one bit.  It felt very plastic and I think Monico, our wonderful salesman, knew that I wasn't feeling it.  I thought we would check out a few other places, but then out of the corner of my eye, I saw a beautiful, black Passat.  I asked about it, he pulled up all of the information and before I knew it, I had a new car!  The staff there was amazing! They were so nice, and not your typical car salesman.  I LOVE my car and they have been so great since I bought the car.  Monico called me to see if I'd be interested in winning hockey tickets, OF COURSE! He also called to check up on me and the car, which was really nice.  Mike wrote a review and Monico was very appreciative.  I have to give props to their service department as well.  The tire pressure light was on when I purchased the vehicle, so they told me bring it in if it continues to light up and we'll take care of it.  I'm thinking.....great I'm going to have to put new tires on.....NOPE.Took it on a Saturday, they fixed the leak in the valve at no cost to me and I got a nice hot cup of coffee on the house as well.  I'm telling you, I have found my long term car dealer!  Thanks everyone at the Exchange, you're awesome!
<review# 550,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2013,5/20/2013,56,185,4,5,4>Each and every day, I would drive by this store, not knowing of its existence. Then one day, my friend told me there was actually something worth stopping by the plaza for.When you walk in, you might be confused as to whether or not its a deli or a market, and the answer is that its both! They have tons of Italian pasta, snacks, sauces, wines, and much more that you won't find in a regular grocery store. But the best part is the food made in the store.I've tried many paninis and sandwiches and you cannot go wrong no matter what you choose. The caprese's generous serving of fresh mozzarella with some juicy tomato slices and a drizzle of balsamic makes a great choice for a vegetarian. If eating animals isn't something that bothers you, just pick your favorite meat and be prepared to be amazed. The freshness of the ingredients will knock you off your feet and make your taste buds come alive.However, the MOST IMPORTANT THING to order: chicken salad. They use real chunks of delicious chicken, they don't lather the whole thing in mayo, they mix a nice selection of vegetables, and it's perfectly seasoned with S&P.If you're ever near the intersections of Milwaukee and Half Day, be sure to stop by. Don't make the same mistake I made for years and years of my life.Personal Recommendation: Turkey panini with a side of chicken salad.
<review# 551,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/16/2012,5/19/2013,58,347,2,4,3>I'm not super well versed on sushi fish quality, so I can't really describe in words why I really like the food here. I just know compared to ones I've had in my life, this registered an extra pleasant sensation. Something about it melting more in my mouth, maybe? or the pronounced freshness of fishI can't describe? Who knows. Also got a bento box to split. It was good, but nothing super extraordinary.  Miso soup was very salty, like it sat in a warmer for a while and reduced quite a bit. Based on my first visit, I'd mainly go here for the sashimi.I don't quite know what else is out there in terms of quality sushi, but as far as I'm concerned, the location and prices and the chill environment is definitely going to make me a regular.
<review# 552,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/18/2013,5/18/2013,9,8,,4,3>Walking around downtown and came across this little gem. The decor was very chic and the service was awesome. My husband got the duck confit crêpes and I got the braised pork ribs one. Both were awesome, but you absolutely have to try the beef tallow French fries with garlic aioli...they are to die for!!! We were completely stuffed after our crêpes but couldn't leave a single fry to go to waste. Absolutely recommend trying this place, and we will be going back for sure...I need to try their dessert crêpes!
<review# 553,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/26/2012,5/17/2013,94,254,2,4,3>I have been coming here for years and really like this family owned ice cream shoppe. They have some unusual and yet tasty flavors that you wouldn't think could carry itself in ice cream, like cheese ice cream and they use real Kraft american cheese in it. One of my favorites is ube ice cream and ube is a starch or potato. Lychee, watermelon, cantaloupe, and mango are favorites in our household. Avocado is really rich creamy and sweet tasting...I like it! Corn ice cream is unusual, but I finally gave it a try and it was good! They serve this ice cream in one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Skokie not more than 5 miles away called Tub Tim Thai. Give this shoppe a try and you're sure to walk away a happy camper!
<review# 554,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/9/2013,5/16/2013,225,1291,5,6,4>I've had Afghan food before, from their old location in Queens, made from some Afghan friends and well, there a few more times. Bib Gourmand or not, Afghan food is very close to comfort food to me. Mantoo, not only reminds me of my grandma's dumplings, but it also was like a small bit of home plus tomato sauce! Kabul house has some pretty good dishes but it's got 4 different kinds of kabob which are, good, but it's a part of Persian, Levantine and Turkish and Greek cuisine, nothing super Afghan about it. Shrimp kabob? If I showed a shrimp to an Afghan in Mehtar Lam I don't think any of them would know what the hell it was. Definitely not something I would have eaten there.However, the Palau is pretty good it's pretty authentic, if fancy. I like the food, I guess I'm just wistful for some Biryani or Haft Mae'wa and it's not something I can find here.
<review# 555,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2013,5/13/2013,10,153,,2,3>Played the course in early May and it was in very good shape. I like this course because fairways are tight on numerous holes and for the most part the greens are very firm. The very sandy greens don't allow balls to hit and stick a lot. Bunkers were in good shape which is always a good sign.If I have a gripe about the course design its that even from the blue tees there are a number of par four holes that are in the 325-340 range which is fairly short. Would like to see some longer par fours but nothing you can really do about that.Price wise - played twilight for $32 which is reasonable if you get all 18 in. $49 seems a little high but it is a nice course in a nice area - right next to the Chicago Botanic Gardens. I would play this course again.
<review# 556,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2013,5/12/2013,26,17,,2,2>I know there are bigger stores than fish planet, but I couldn't be happier with Steve and all the staff at Fish Planet. The personalized service I receive there, I don't think is available at a bigger store, at least none that I have ever been to. Steve really understands reefs and I have never received anything but sound recommendations and advice about how to maintain my live reef tank. I unhesitatingly recommend Fish Planet to new and experienced aquarists alike.
<review# 557,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2012,5/11/2013,22,299,,3,2>My first time getting a pie here. I have been drooling over their local add picture for months. My wife told me dinner was my responsibility on this particular night so my time had arrived. I ordered a deep dish sausage and spinach for pick up. It was ready when I got there, the location was simple setup, nothing fancy. A couple of table and chairs to grab a quick bite but mostly geared for pickup or delivery, similar to other places.I have to say that this is a very tasty pie and I did enjoy it. If I had to compare, I would say it was slightly better than Giordanos because the spinach had a garlicy taste to it that G's does not. I have only had one Malnati's pie but prefer Giordanos, or now Pieros. People rave about the Malnati crust but I do not eat this type of pizza for the crust. I will definitely patronize again. Thx Pieros!
<review# 558,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2012,5/10/2013,18,149,,4,2>I've lived in Florence, Italy, and I've eaten a lot of gelato; I'm here to tell you that LInz and Veil is the real deal. They have all the classics, like stracciatella, pistacchio and nocciola, and much more, like salted caramel, ginger, and pumpkin.  They serve Intelligentsia coffee and the baristas know what they're doing. I asked one to make me something not on the coffee menu (a mocha-cappuccino), and it was perfect.  I've also found everyone who works there to be friendly and outgoing, which I appreciate.Another thing going for L&V is their delicious sandwiches. I've had the grilled cheese (not your typical Kraft slice nonsense) and the grilled tomato/basil/mozzarella and loved both. Another thing to love about L&V is that they feature local artists' artwork on the wall and don't take a commission, and they're very involved in the community.  They recently had an event where customers could choose to which charity to donate proceeds.And hey, what about the free wi-fi?Skip the chains - support a fantastic, local business instead.
<review# 559,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2012,5/9/2013,48,15,,2,2>This place is awesome for brunch.  It has a cozy classy feel and the staff is great.  They remember you after a few visits and they treat you like VIPs.  It's not hard to feel like one with the outstanding mimosas and delicious food.  Everything is choice, such as Intelligentsia coffee and farm-to-table cuisine.  The breakfast sausage is always better than I remembered it.  YUM.  Try it.  You won't regret it.Costs a bit more than the diner but worth every penny!!
<review# 560,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/6/2013,5/8/2013,35,115,3,8,5>First reviewer!!  I surprised my daughter by picking her up after school and brought her here so we could both get blow outs-I had to laugh because it reminded me of my Grandma Bernadine going in to the "Beauty Shop" to get her hair washed and "set"...but do not be mistaken!  This is not Grandma's Beauty Shop-it's so much better!  The vibe inside is fresh and clean from the bright lights and the fun music pumping through out.  Your hair is washed and then blown dry to your specifications-big and poufy or flat and chic...all up to you.  One of the owner's used to work with Oprah and there are pictures all over the wall of her with many different stars...fun to walk around and see everyone.  Sneak a peek at the bathroom in the back-the silver painted diamonds on the wall are a fun addition.  The ONLY reason I am giving them a 4 instead of 5 is that there were so many people interested in an appointment that they seemed to have overbooked.  My daughter and I both had appointments for the same time with different stylists.  Unfortunately, they sent her back for a wash and took me for a wash 10 minutes later.  I was dried immediately after my wash while my daughter sat and waited.  When I was done, my stylist dried her hair.  Not a big deal as we were not pressed for time, but it was not carried out as we had scheduled it.  I feel like it was just kinks to work out as it is obviously a popular place!!  I will definitely be back!
<review# 561,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/8/2013,5/7/2013,50,82,3,4,3>The more times I eat here, the more I like it.  My daughter and I went last week and really enjoyed a mother-daughter bonding time over some sushi and sake!  Started out with Miso Soup, yum...We did get a bit adventurous...  The RED DRAGON ROLL, this was a spicy dragon and it was beautifully presented!  The roll itself was very large and there was plenty for us to share.  We also had an Alaska and Spicy Tuna.  Everything was delicious!I sometimes forget that this place is even here, tucked away in this little strip mall which isn't the most convenient place to get in and out of!!  But it is worth the hassle.I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.
<review# 562,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/16/2013,5/6/2013,143,199,3,3,3>We've been to the Skokie location at least 5 times and the fish and chips is definitely our favorite meal. The fish planks are huge, crunchy on the outside while nice and hot and flaky on the inside. The place is cozy and the bar area is very prominent. They also have an outdoor area with outdoor heating. There's always available street parking and this pub is quite popular with the lunch time crowd.  Now they could use a few framed pics of U2 and the place would be complete.

<review# 564,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/28/2013,5/4/2013,168,637,,4,4>One of the most beautiful places in Chicago. They also do a great job having special events throughout the entire year. We go here a 2-3 times per year for special events. Yesterday the event we were supposed to go to was cancelled by the company planning it and the CBG staff improvised and did the best job they could to make sure they salvaged as much as they could. A great staff and a great place to spend the day, especially in nice weather. If you are going to go in the summer, I would advise bringing a lunch as their cafeteria can get expensive.
<review# 565,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2013,5/3/2013,35,244,5,5,4>If you LOVE Dunkin Donuts, you'll probably hate this place. With their huge selection of FRESH baked goods and artisan techniques, the loss of the preservative taste you get from commercial-offsite baking is really lost in the small batch, family run business.Oh, and if you sit down in "that" chair... they'll start calling you Leondard, because it's his chair, and if you're still half asleep, you may not understand the joke! :)I can't even name all the different items they have, but it's way beyond donuts, stop in and be reminded that grocery store chains are not the place for great baked goods... but, I'll tell you the coffee cakes are to die for!
<review# 566,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2013,5/2/2013,26,129,3,4,2>I had seen good reviews, and finally got the opportunity to take my ladies to the North Branch for dinner.   What a treat.  I will be back.   There were some items on the menu i want to try.   Everything was made fresh.   You could tell.  The onion rings were hand dipped.  Yummy.2 of the ladies ordered burgers.  They will probably split them next time as the burger portion is generous.   Both were pleased with their selections.   One got chicken ceaser sales.  Another good portion and another happy camper.   Last was my princess.  She ordered the kids chicken fingers.   She wasn't' as pleased.  It's hard for a 7 year old to enjoy FRESH chicken fingers.  It was great, but the pallet of the little one is too McDonaldized.   They were fresh and fantastic in my eyes and yes...I did eat one.I ordered the fish and chips.   Another winner.  Hand battered.  Super.  But next time I want to try the french dip.....We kids had the warm cookie ala mode.  Nice topper to the meal.   The atmosphere was really nice.  Very warm restaurant.   The reason for the lost star was in the service.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but could have been better.   Get the adults water right away.   Make sure all the proper condiments come with the dinner.   (tarter sauce with fisn chips).  I hate the 8-10 min wait for he busboys to start clearing the table.    It is the little details that make the experience outstanding.   North Branch was close.   I will go back.   I missed the key lime pie other yelpers' mentioned.
<review# 567,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/17/2012,5/1/2013,42,62,,4,4>This place is a cute little romantic restaurant.  If you're into sake, definitely check it out here, they have a beautiful presentation for it (see picture, hard to explain).  Had an appetizer of scallops with "egg sauce" - it was delicious.  To explain the egg sauce, it was similar to the egg sauce you'd find at hibachi, except it seems they put both the egg yolk and egg white in there, making it more like a fancy, delicate omelette.Their sushi is great - went for the dynamite, salmon avocado, AAC (asparagus, avocado, cucumber) rolls, and the super white tuna and squid nigiris.  Everything was super fresh.  This is kind of weird, but their sushi rice is probably the best I've ever had; there was something different about it that I couldn't exactly pin down.   Even when they're busy, this place busts out rolls at lightning speed!I'm impressed and will definitely be back :)
<review# 568,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/5/2013,4/30/2013,41,171,,6,1>This place is a great addition to Noyes St.  The Chicken Caprese panini was truly amazing especially after the aerial arts class at Actors Gymnasium.  The place has a great cozy and eclectic vibe and the owners are really friendly.  The free wifi is a nice bonus.  IDOS is a great place for food, studying and just hanging out.  I can't wait to try the sweets offerings.

I have found things like rare vegetables, actual rosemary trees (as in 5' tall), and other awesome things. This is hands down the best place to go in the summer. There are so many businesses and things happening it is absolutely awesome. Come by, get food, get vegetables, meet people, see the awesome hipster evanston fun stuff. There are too many different things to even try to sum it up with a review. There are about 10 different food stalls highlighting local good, but really the wealth of how amazing this place is can be more accurately summed up by looking at the wealth of photos. You have every option from flowers to vegetables to baked goods to goat cheeses to organic meats to organic fruits and vegetables to plants. This is the one stop shop for anything food in the summer.Oh, and they validate parking and sharpen knives, too.
<review# 570,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2013,4/28/2013,18,123,2,8,4>After moving to Chicago three months ago, my wife and I were looking for somewhere unique and local for our anniversary, and we were incredibly happy we went to Wilmette Chop House.  The dining room is very small (we counted 10 tables) and the location does not immediately catch the eye inside the small downtown block.  But the service, food, decor, ambiance, and staff were incredible.  Our anniversary was on a Tuesday, so we ended up having the whole place to our selves most of our night.  Sometimes when a small place is slow I get afraid that the staff will hover since you're the only one there, but that did not happened in this case.  The Chop House staff gave us just the right amount of pleasant attention and never over did anything.  We loved the Roy Lichtenstein-inspired modern art with the romantic lighting, and jazz and standard music.  Our only real negative was no two chair tables in the small location, and the four chair table they gave us was so wide across that we felt very far from each other on our anniversary evening.  But the big tables made a little bit more sense when we saw the huge portions.My wife's lobster bisque and my wedge salad were huge.  I had a wedge salad the next week at a major steakhouse chain and was disappointed because of the standard Wilmette Chop House set for me.  Our steaks (an NY Strip and Filet Mignon) were cooked perfectly, incredibly tender and with a substantial layer of spices crushed around the edges.  For our anniversary they gave us an outstanding bite size peanut butter torte and two cannolis, as well as two chocolate martinis.  My wife said she has never felt so pleasantly full.  I left them the biggest tip I ever have (percentage-wise).  We ended up recommending this place to my wife's parents for their anniversary and we will definitely be back.
<review# 571,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2013,4/27/2013,60,245,2,2,2>Wow! Shame on me for not reviewing until now. I'm actually snacking on my fantastic leftover au gratin potatoes as I write this! I have been here so many times, and whether I get take out or eat in it's always super good.  I love the bone in char chops, you have a choice of one or two, and IMO they have one of the best burgers around plus it's going on my best burger list. The ribs are a little chewy, not the fall off the bone as some might like but they're great. The coleslaw is one of the few I'll eat anywhere, Hackneys is the other that comes to mind right now. I like sitting in the bar area. Get yourself some chopped liver, cheese, onions and little the rye bread slices when you walk in the door from the serve your self bar and sit at the  big bar, or where ever and get ready for some really good food, not to mention a cold beer or cocktail. No matter what you order ( burger, steak, ribs, etc.) you have a choice of a side. The choices are the earlier mentioned fantastic cheesy au gratin potatoes, equally as good Mediterranean potatoes, fries, baked potato, sauteed or grilled broccoli and green beans. They have a great lunch menu too. Great value epically at lunch..and a burger with those sides... is a super value!

The fish tasted so fresh. I actually preferred eating the ceviche with the tortilla chips than with the saltine crackers that came with the dish.  Tamales: PUMPKIN,CHICKEN,MUSHROOM-the pumpkin was a little too sweet for me but I would get this again-the chicken was good but I wish it had a bit more flavor-the mushroom was good as well but nothing amazing to reportI got the tamales with rice and beans and the tamales were smothered with different sauces.  I didn't care too much for the sauces and I actually thought they were a little overwhelming and salty but the rice and beans were great!Portions are huge and our waiter was really nice.  I would come here again when I'm craving tamales (still looking for a place with amazing tamales.. any suggestions?) or if I want that amazing ceviche again

<review# 575,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2012,4/22/2013,39,33,3,4,1>Today I finally had the pleasure of visiting Dowize in Downtown Wilmette, which is the sister restaurant of Dozika, which is located in downtown Evanston. Dowize recently opened, at the end of June, and I have been meaning to go in and try it. Although Dowize and Dozika have similar menus, they are not the same place. Dowize definitely has more of a focus on the Thai food aspect, while Dozika has lots of great deals that highlight their sushi choices. Dowize is also more intimate, and the spacing is very open. Walking in, I could tell that I was going to love it.Although it's a little tricky to find, it is well worth the hunt in the end. They have a great lunch special, which goes from 11:30 AM-3:30 PM. For 7 dollars, you get: an appetizer, entree, bowl of miso soup, and a salad. Of course everything is in lunch size portions, but it is an absolute steal to order, because of the sheer quantity of food they bring you.As a poor college student, I decided to try out the lunch special, ordering the crab rangoon as my appetizer and the Red Curry with Beef as my entree. No complaints here. The crab rangoon was incredible, with that perfect proportion of cream cheese to crab, and not too heavily fried. I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it now (this seems to be a common trend in these reviews for me). My Red Curry was very hot, but I love spicy foods so it was right up my alley. Best part is it wasn't so spicy that I couldn't taste the individual flavors, like the sweetness of the Red and Green Bell Peppers, or the crispness of the Bamboo shoots. My friend L ordered the Curry Noodles (see my review on Dozika for more of what is on their menu, as they are owned by the same family). She knew that they would be delicious, and said that they were practically identical to Dozika's as well. We came to the conclusion that they must share recipes.Overall, for a new place just starting up, I was extremely impressed. The atmosphere is welcoming, our waitress was attentive but not pushy, food was great, and the prices are pretty reasonable for the amount that you are getting. Anyone who is already a fan of Dozika needs to check out Dowize, as well as any fans of Thai or Asian food in general. A great place, and I can't wait to go back soon!
<review# 576,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/28/2013,4/21/2013,8,5,,7,1>I had never heard of this museum until I saw it on Groupon. This museum was really amazing! Very well coordinated in chronological order and the information was easy to digest. They had a lot of artifacts, photos, and footage. I learned so much. Warning: some of the footage and photos are very graphic and can be difficult to watch, but they have signs warning you. One of the coolest things is that they had a real train car where victims were transported on to the concentration camps. It was very emotional walking inside of it. Great experience - expect to take 2.5 hrs to go through it all.

For a Chicago-style carryouts joint they've got a lot of tasty options including (gasp!) healthy salads. If you're in the area, Michael's is great spot for lunch.
<review# 578,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/20/2012,4/19/2013,31,109,4,5,4>Alright.  Last review on this place I SWEAR.Visited this lovely spot with Mama Lee today to indulge in some soft serve on a hot May day, and I decided to go for something other than my usual--a soft serve dip!  I was a little weary with my decision because a lot of places that have chocolate dips tend to be more candy-like than chocolate-y, but good God was I wrong.  The chocolate dip is so ridiculously chocolate-y..total mouth-gasm.  Sure, it's ridiculously sweet and you feel like you need a big glass of milk afterwards, but paired with the awesome soft serve, it was the icing on the cake...or should I say, the dipping on the ice cream!
<review# 579,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2012,4/18/2013,62,30,2,3,3>I love this place.The atmosphere is classy and warm (fireplace, pristine silverware, service). The servers are great and love their attention to the courses - removing the appetizer forks and knives, coming to serve bread and refill glasses.The scallion and nut rolls are flavorful.The butter comes in oil and salt+pepper.I had a grand prix fixe meal a couple times and I don't think I'll get sick of it. I'd recommend everything but the one things that still lingers in my mind even after a year are the scallops (wow, I didn't know they could be so good...this is what I think of now whenever I think of scallops. It's my new standard...until something else takes the throne).Something to note is that the portions are small (beautiful plate presentation) but it *can* be a shock for your bf that orders the steak.This place is pricey, but you can use some restaurant.com coupons for this place, just be sure to read all the terms.I think my next trip will take advantage of a chef tasting menu!
<review# 580,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2012,4/17/2013,13,15,,2,2>Union has tasty pizza and a good beer and wine selection. Definitely try one of their salads and small plates. They change their menu seasonally and use local ingredients. I love the lamb sausage pizza and really any of their salads. And definitely try the polenta pound cake if they have it.
<review# 581,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2013,4/16/2013,122,140,3,4,3>How long I have waited for a cafe like this to open in Evanston so that I could have an artsy, chic, place to study in Evanston besides the NU lib (:( ), Kaffein ( :( ), Frat, Lisa's (:( ), or Tech (: ( ). Oh yeah, I forgot my own apartment. The thing is, my bed imposes this strong temptation for me to just drop everything and snuggle under my covers. So...not the best option. Perhaps somewhere like Next Door or the Perfect Cup but preferably closer. Coffee Lab is just that. The folks here seem to understand the important things that determine good ambiance for a cafe. They know how important it is for a space to incorporate simplicity, art, and color. In all honesty, I don't really care much about paying for Diablo Dark or Single Source since I know and enjoy studying marketing/branding. The ritual of pouring coffee into a system of lab beaker/filter/funnel is indeed entertaining and deserves to be mentioned. I've never seen any other cafe do this before.I do want to come here and study. I hesitate to give one more star because I know I might not come because they might have run our of seats or tables when I open the door after I walk up all the way north. Perhaps if they found a way to expand their space a bit....
<review# 582,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2012,4/15/2013,82,219,2,5,2>I originally drove to another sushi place down the road.  I pulled up, parked my car on the street, got out & walked up to the door but when I reached the door there was a sign that looked like it was made with finger paint.  The sign said "Please Use Side Entrance" after I saw that, the Christmas lights in the window & the paint chipping away that looked like it was made out of led I took a step back & said back to downtown Highland Park I go.  I have ate at so many restaurants in Highland Park & I said to myself it's time to try this one, especially because I am a sushi connoisseur.  I have ate at some of the best sushi restaurants in Chicago & many other suburbs.  Right away when I walked into the place it stood out to me.  Most sushi places look like someone took a paintball gun & shot paint all over the wall but the decor of the restaurant was phenomenal & when I was sitting down I realized even the lighting was excellent.  The restaurant was not too dark & while it was lit up the lights were not too bright.  Sometimes when the lighting in a restaurant is too bright it gets annoying & will bother me the entire meal.   I ordered the Shrimp Tempura & a Spicy Tuna roll.  The food came out & the presentation was excellent.  The Shrimp Tempura roll had a presentation that I have never seen before & it looked excellent.  The sushi was honestly the freshest I have ever had.  I have never had sushi where everything blended in so perfectly & tasted so great.  This was the sushi place I have been looking for.  The first 2 pieces of each roll I tried fell apart so I was worried that every piece on the roll would be like that but that was not the case.  The were all rolled excellent.  When I dipped the rest of them I'm wasabi & soy sauce they stayed intact.  I proceeded to order 2 more rolls of the same thing & they looked & tasted just as delicious.  This made me happy because with the second order as good as the first I know that their entire selection is just as fresh & well prepared.    The service here was good as well.  The lady up front came up to me & was asking me about my car & being very friendly.  The waitress was nice as well but never asked me if I wanted a refill on my iced tea.  I'm not a demanding person but it wasn't that busy so I would have liked the waitress to check on my table a few more times & see if I needed anything.  I also placed my second order of food with another waiter because he was the only one around.  However she was still nice & the hospitality was great.  The one thing I can't stand just as much as bad food is a dirty restaurant.  Some restaurants you walk into have tables cover with crumbs with crumbs from the slob who sat there before & spilled sauce all over their shirt.  That was not the case here, the place was spotless.  Every table was clean & shiny.  I like how they take the extra time to present the table nice than most sushi places with the way they place the napkins & other table items.  This was by far one of the best sushi restaurants I have ever been to.  The experience was awesome.  Even though it is pricier than most, you are getting the freshest & best prepared sushi around.  I not only look forward to eating here again but I look forward to coming here in the summer because they have a really nice outdoor patio area.  The location of the restaurant in downtown Highland Park is phenomenal.
<review# 583,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/28/2012,4/14/2013,19,132,,4,3>This is one of my favorite parks in Chicagoland. It offers nice walks, pretty trees and beautiful views of Lake Michigan any time of year. Don't miss the somewhat hidden garden in the middle with a tiny little bridge and several benches to take a break. The amphitheater is also an interesting sight. It's impressive how many different elements manage to thrive in this relatively small park. It's definitely worth a visit!
<review# 584,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2012,4/13/2013,14,7,2,4,3>When I needed to buy dance shoes for my 3 year old daughter for her first ballet class, I looked to this adorable little boutique in Evanston. Everything about this shop oozes dance and professionalism.  They have staff trained to help fit dance shoes to children and I was really impressed by the staff's demeanor with my daughter as we tried on a few pairs for the perfect fit.  She was adamant about her distaste in the pink shoes and was about to recoil into a tight-lipped unhappy preschooler until she was presented with the option of a pretty black pair that got her agreement on the spot (shhhh....don't tell my daughter they were actually the exact same shoe, just different color). They know about the attire requirements of all the local classes and all levels from the experimental to the hard core pointe dancers, and even have some discounts available with local schools including the park district where my daughter was enrolled.  They don't charge an arm and a leg for the shoes, which is a relief knowing that they'll only last my daughter one season before she grows out of them. They sell quality respected brands and have plenty of lovely apparel in stock for both young & more mature dancers.  If I hadn't already found leotards for my daughter you can believe I would've walked out of there with some super cute dancewear as well! The shop is well laid out and it's easy to find things you need. They have a little wing of the store devoted to the little ones right there at the front.  Parking is on or across the street in the busy area of Evanston near the university, but it's still accessible.  If you are a dancer or know a dance enthusiast this is a great place to check out.
<review# 585,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/1/2013,4/12/2013,15,54,,5,2>Went to Eclissi on New Years eve!  I really loved the entire staff, they were warm and friendly.  The wine selection was really nice, and the chef came to our table a few times which was sweet.  He really cares about his food.They brought fresh hot bread to the table with parmesan.  The olive oil on the table tasted very fresh, it was a nice start on a cold nightWe started with the olive plate after that, which was good, but not outstanding - but I've been totally spoiled on olives by a friend of mine who brines his own.  It came with thin fried sliced bread with garlic on it and shaved parmesan.Then we shared the organic greens, which comes with roasted pear.  That was delicious.Then I got the lamb chops, which was cooked to PERFECTION and was absolutely delicious, and my husband got the cheese ravioli - also good, but again, not outstanding.For dessert he got the cannolis and I got the tiramisu.  Both were good.The meal was reasonably priced and good.  We enjoyed the atmosphere and we'll probably eat there again.

I wouldn't say the cards and memorabilia is the cheapest but most of it is high end and of greater values.The whole store is covered from wall to wall with signed pictures/ signed Jersey's.

The setting is so serene and peaceful, you are in heaven when you walk in there.  All of the ladies have such great energy.The owner is a really nice lady too.  She took over about a year ago and I think she is doing a great job.  She makes you feel like family.
<review# 588,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2012,4/9/2013,23,10,2,4,5>This bike shop is excellent. I went into the shop for bike shoes. The sales associate took the time to explain the differences of each shoe, and pedal options. He then asked about my budget and how I use my bike (for commuting, racing, etc.) so we could determine the best selection for me. The pedals were installed quickly, and he gave me a quick tutorial. I'm very pleased with the service I received.

($4.95) which was excellent.  The food came out just as quickly as I ordered it.  The pita bread that came with it is thick, crunchy on the outside, soft & fluffy on the inside. Rice pilaf was really tasty, as was the hummus.  I just wish they had falafels.
<review# 590,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/15/2013,4/7/2013,20,23,,3,4>So this is my first time here but not my last. If you like Portillo's cheese fries you will love the fries at this place. It could actually be better than Portillo's. No joke. The cheese sauce comes out nice and hot and the fries are the crinkled kind that go fabulous with the cheese! They give you a lot too. Easily good for two.Since I'm a fat kid at heart, I ordered myself a char double dog with cheese,  ketchup, extra tomatoes, grilled onions, sport peppers, celery salt and pickles on the side. The dog was one of the yummiest I have ever had. I'm a Chicago girl so that says a lot. Quite surprising how one of the best dogs I've ever had is here in the North Shore and not in the city. Props to these guys for that. It was charred to perfection, not burned like some places do. Sorry I had to deduct a star only because I was looking forward to the grilled onions the most but when I got home there was no grilled onions anywhere in sight. I was bummed at first but the fact that the cheese fries and the dog were so good I got over it quick.I live walking distance to the popular Micheal's and Stasha's in Highland Park but I will totally make the drive out to this place next time I want some yummy fast food.Gotta also mention that this place is super clean and well kept. It has hole in the wall food without being your typical hole in the wall.Friendly service too. Keith rounds down too :")
<review# 591,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2012,4/6/2013,98,320,3,19,8>Without question, Terra has the highest quality, freshest ingredients and most delicious food, bar none that we've tasted in the northern suburbs.  And we've tried just about everything in the area more than once or twice.  We work in the city and travel often to areas with amazing restaurants.  Terra was truly the first place we encountered near our home that simply blew our minds with a menu stocked with so many tantalizing options, we had a very difficult time trying to decide what to order.  We settled on a few items and agreed that if it was good, we'd come back to try other items.  The problem is, every single thing we ordered was outstandingly delicious.  It would be hard to go back and not want to order it again, but we definitely will.Terra is a place that is cleverly hidden just off of Green Bay Road, tucked into a quiet little corridor just north of Livingston.  You have to pay attention, or you're likely to almost miss it as you're driving by.  Look for the folding sign on the street and turn in there for valet service (or simply walk, like we did).For the rundown of our entire experience, we began with the fried goat cheese croquettes, which were served on a huckleberry jam and agave nectar sauce with quince jelly and apple wedges.  OMFG, you will feel like you've died and gone to heaven and wonder if it would be odd to order 2 more servings.  Wow!  Mad props to the chef for coming up with this concoction of awesomeness!  We also ordered the pommes frites with black truffle butter.  I guarantee you will not have better fries within the next year, maybe two.  Again, wow!  So far, this place is really stacking up to be a pleasant surprise so close to home.  Next came the beet salad.  This was served with arugula and an apricot vinaigrette, macadamia nuts, gorgonzola and apple slices.  I can't remember the last time I wolfed down a salad so quickly.For the entrees, we ordered the bi-color gnocchi in a cream sauce with peas and bacon.  Holy mind-bending pasta experience!  This was my wife's order, but I kept trying to steel bites as the gnocchi pieces melted in my mouth like butter, with the perfect texture, flavor and the extra kick of bacon.  So amazing, I'm not sure I'd be able to not order it next time.  I ordered the maple pecan crusted pork tenderloin in a sweet potato puree with micro greens.  Again, with my first bite, I closed my eyes and tried to remember the last time I had tasted pork so incredible.  The puree was sweet but with an unexpected, hint of spicy heat to it that lingered ever so slightly on the palate.  I made my wife try the puree with a small bite of the pork tenderloin and pork belly.  I watched with a smirk on my face as she took a bite and her eyes closed, savoring the flavor.  For dessert, we had the pecan pie, made from scratch, with the Homer's ice cream.  We cleaned the plate.  We'll definitely be back very soon and hope to make this a regular place for us.  Service was top-notch, friendly, personable and highly informative about what was on the menu.  Steve took incredibly good care of us all night and knew everything there was to know about each and every item on the menu.  PS: They have a kids' menu for the little ones and high chairs, if you need it.
<review# 592,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/20/2013,4/5/2013,55,17,,2,2>Top notch, hole-in-the-wall taco joint!I came here with a couple of friends after hearing great things about their shrimp tacos. It was about 9pm when we got there. Ample parking - so that was a good thing. First impression after walking in was that it was a bit small and looked even smaller with all the people waiting for a table. But that visual made me hopeful. We waited at the bar and were offered chips and the usual red and green sauces. Nice snack to have while sipping on an agave wheat beer that was very light and refreshing.A little bit long of a wait, but I didn't mind. I decided that starting off with 3 tacos would be good, and I'd order more if I was still hungry. Those things were ready within minutes of ordering. I had one shrimp taco, one with duck tenders, and the last with pork and egg (and duck? and chorizo?) I should check the menu. ALL. WERE. DELICIOUS. The slaw dressing in the shrimp taco and duck tender taco was a perfect compliment to the two very different tacos. I fell in love and had my usual "omg. wow. this is soooo good" comment. 3 was enough, but I definitely could have had more. I resisted. [Still January, guys. Gotta stick with those New Year's resolutions for at least 1 more week.]What I loved most - second to the Shrimp tacos - was the great service. We finished the night by having really tasty rumchata drinks with the awesome bartenders, all while belting out to Hey Ya! I'd like to go back and try the rest of the taco selection...and sing with the bartenders.
<review# 593,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2013,4/4/2013,23,203,,5,2>If there's a restaurant one must try when in Highwood, it should definitely be a Mexican restaurant for the significant contribution of this culture to this area.  While so many places in the area tries to be pretentious with its nouveau menu and fancy decor, this place lets the good food do all the talking.  Aside from the typical fare that one might expect to get at a Mexican restaurant, the menu is balanced with traditional as well as inventive offerings.  For instance, I ordered the molcajete - a lava bowl that comes sizzling with chorizo, chicken, cactus leaves, onions, and black beans.  My husband ordered a variation of stuffed pepper, which came split open with a generous serving of steak on top.  Both dishes came with warm corn tortillas as well as rice on the side.  The guacamole as well as the margaritas were just ok- nothing to write about but the entrees were solid and worthy of a return visit!

And Fred's fits the bill. I can generally get an appointment the day of. It's centrally located downtown so we can get some quick stuff done and then get those long locks of theirs shortened. Plus, the train is nearby which always provides entertainment afterward. The shop is old but has an authentic barbershop feel. It's been around for quite some time. Fred originally owned it but has moved on. If you're looking for the neighborhood barbershop, look no further.
<review# 597,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2013,3/30/2013,52,196,4,7,5>Nerd that I am, the library is one of my favorite places.  This library in particular is where I learned to love the library.  I've been to a few of the other suburban libraries and I have to say the Skokie Public Library is still my favorite (alright, I may be a bit biased coming from Skokie, but really, it is great).They have free weekly movie showings, free concerts and performances in the auditorium, they usually have art displayed throughout sections of the library, and I love how they have a little room tucked away where they have used books, DVDs, and CDs for sale.  They also have some free basic computer classes from time to time.You can find DVDs, Blu-Rays, CDs, video games, comic books, eBooks, magazines, newspapers and of course your regular old books.  They also have free wifi and computers to use if you need them.  This is one of my favorite places to go in Skokie!
<review# 598,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/19/2012,3/29/2013,15,115,2,5,3>Don't just believe the Libertad hype, buy it! And this is coming from someone who especially dislikes the "small plate" concept. It's not that I don't like sharing, but when I go out to eat, I order something because that's what I want to eat. If i wanted what you ordered, I would have also ordered it myself. If the food is good I will return to try more, I just don't need to do it all in one meal. And the fact of the matter is, the menus at many small plate restaurants aren't completely stacked with worthwhile dishes. Having said all that, Libertad is done absolutely right and I shared a bunch of really great dishes. The hummus was delicious, but the fresh chappati tortilla put it way over the top. I could have used a basket of it to soak up all the delicious sauces from everything else. The salmon crudo was a really bright and fresh dish, a really great palate jumpstarter. It may be heretical to say this, but I thought the pork belly was the most ho-hum thing I ate. That statement doesn't even make sense, but the calabaza risotto was so much richer with all that umami. All I know is that Libertad has made me do things that defy logic.
<review# 599,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/9/2013,3/28/2013,29,98,4,4,3>Ah, Tortas. I've been waiting for this place to open and after we came out of the library looking for dinner there was the open sign staring us in the face. This place occupies the space formerly belonging to Über Burger and Neü Über Burger. This new restaurant takes two umlauts away and adds MMMM lots instead.We had the horchata, which was actually a little more cinnamon-y than I'm used to. Not a bad thing. My wife ordered the chorizo quesadilla which although small looking was pretty tough to pack down due to the density of the thing. I ordered a chicken tinga torta, because whenever I see chicken tinga there's no thinking twice. The torta was awesome. It had tomatoes, onions, avocado, and a chipotle sauce. For $5.50 it was a total steal. For our little kid we ordered beans and rice. The rice is ultra-bland -- it's white, it has no vegetables, and it really shows no signs of being mexican rice. On the other hand, I was relieved to see that not only were the beans not refried bean paste, but were very flavorful. We also ordered a guacamole and chips to start which went away very fast. The guacamole was excellent but I couldn't get over the feeling that it was over-salted. My wife agreed but loved her quesadilla.I need to go back a few more times before I decide if this place goes in the regular rotation but I was extremely impressed. The flavors were a cut above That Little Mexican Cafe, which is a little on the bland side of good mexican food if you ask me. The service was also attentive -- we got a lot of recommendations and notes on the menu and our food from a server who was genuinely interested in making sure we enjoyed our visit.
<review# 600,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2013,3/27/2013,180,1540,2,5,3>We hosted our son's 4th birthday party here and it was such a fun experience.  For the price, we had two hours for the party with a variety of times and dates.  We had a back room up on the second floor for the party where we left our coats and mittens and boots while we headed downstairs and played for an hour.Our party had kids ranging in age from 6 months old to 5 years old and there was something for everyone.  The kids were sad to leave but were promised cake pops upstairs.  The best way that I could describe the Exploritorium is that it's like the Kohl's Children Museum but contained in a smaller space and when you rent it out, it's all for you and you're not competing with the public.Overall, staff was very helpful and friendly and we had such a great experience here.  Thank you again!!
<review# 601,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2013,3/26/2013,0,15,,5,2>Bought a used Toyota Corolla here December 12 2012 ,  that was on their lot.  The car is in  in very good condition as they said it was. They presented me with the cars service records going back to 2000 when it was new.  They were  nice and easy to deal with and the car has had no problems so far.. i've  put 1600 miles on it and it's running well- I reccomend hem  as honest  very nice to deal with.
<review# 602,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2012,3/25/2013,0,13,,3,3>Of all the bars/resturants in the Evanston, P Moon is always my back up plan. Consistently good food and booze. We'll even have lunch meetings here! The BBQ chicken salad with dressing on the side is great. And those fries... always order something with fries. Desert is pretty awesome too. However, I was prompted to write a review because of my last visit. So, as we were ordering we mentioned to our waiter (a nice southern gentlemen - excellent service) that our lunch mate was picky and would send back his burger if it wasn't cooked correctly -- in fact, he had done just that on his last visit. When it arrived it was cooked perfect - medium, perfectly pink. BUT THEN, the chef came out to check on it AND apologized for the burger being less then perfect last time. I thought it was a nice touch! Way to be P Moon.
<review# 603,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2013,3/24/2013,11,73,2,2,2>This is truly the nicest Goodwill store I have ever seen. After my recent move to the area, I found I had a LOT of things to donate, and this is the closest donation center to my house. You park in specially designated spots and someone comes out with a big rolly bin and takes your stuff and hands you a receipt. Easy peasy. So, the donation part is as good or better than any place I have been. Now for the store itself: Wow. It is super clean and for a thrift store, very well organized. The people who work there are very nice and professional. I have been several times now and have to force myself to leave before I create a whole new pile of stuff I need to donate. There is good stuff there! And, did I mention CLEAN. So very important to me. Good job, Goodwill!

<review# 606,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2012,3/21/2013,60,6,,3,2>Hecky's is by far the best BBQ on the North and South side.  I LOVE his BBQ sauce!  It's a perfect compliment to the delicious smoked tender meat.  The rib tips and ribs are tender as a mothers love.  The smoked chicken is divine, try the smoked wings!  I also love the cole slaw and mac and cheese!  My mother is a fan of the baby back ribs.  Surprisingly, they have excellent fried cat fish and wings.  I get my wings fried hard.  Hecky's  is my favorite Go To joints in Evanston.  My south side Chicago friends and family always ask me to bring them something from Hecky's as well.

I have been DYING for an authentic Mexican place to open up around here so I dont have to drive all the way out to Wheeling or Mt. Prospect. Like everyone else mentioned, the family who owns the place is so nice. They gave us taste tests before we ordered and were so friendly. The food is AMAZING!!!

Somebody pinch me!What's not to love about a speakeasy lounge? Inconspicious.. No sign per se. Just a black tinted door that says BEER:FOODIntimate and non-pretentious..Better for small parties..2 booths, 2 couch/lounging areas, & about 3 small tables Nom-Nomeries: -Savory pork sandwich on a panini with kettle chips & sweet pickle on the side-Meat & Cheese platter: great array of different meats and cheese & stone ground mustard-Honey Fizz cocktail : a little toooo sweet for my taste, but it was good.Next time, will go for my usual Moscow Mule.

<review# 610,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/16/2012,3/17/2013,17,22,,2,2>Love's has some of the best frozen yogurt you'll ever eat.  I may be biased because last summer I frequently worked double shifts, so I'd drive over to Love's for a large peanut butter frozen yogurt in between shifts.  I would then try to eat my yogurt as quickly as possible before my next shift started.  This yogurt is delicious: not too sweet, perfectly creamy, and inexpensive.  They also sell sandwiches and salads, but I've never tried those.  If they're anything like the yogurt, then they must be good!
<review# 611,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2012,3/16/2013,1333,170,4,4,4>I had gone to this italian deli and find it amazing. Its a genuine european deli/grocery/ restaurant. The food is homecooked and fresh. You will find soups and sandwiches. They have a good selection of wines.  I remember years ago an austrian deli closed down in Oak Mill Mall. This place replaces it. I am glad it opened and the owners are friendly and courteaous. There are not many european places around the city and this place is one of the few that you can find real quality food.
<review# 612,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2012,3/15/2013,0,9,5,11,6>This review is for Matt's morning boot camp.  This class is so unique that I couldn't decide how to approach the review.  So, I think I'll just point out some of the things that make it so different from other fitness classes.  First and foremost is that it's five days a week for four weeks.  This kind of time really allows the instructor to get to know you, your individual needs, and give you the tips and advice that are specific to you.Comprehensive.  This course hits every part of working out.  Weight training, body weight training, cardiovascular training, endurance, jumping, stretching, power, muscle toning, on and on.  This class was designed from the ground up to be a progressive system that grows in complexity as you grow in fitness.Custom-made Fitness Journal and Fitness Workbook.  At the beginning of the course you get a fitness journal to track your workouts and diet.  At the end of the course you get an exercise workbook which gives you the structure to create your own fitness routine from what you've learned in class.  Both are custom-made for the class by the instructor.Teaching and Doing.  You learn both HOW and WHY you're doing an exercise.  Learning technique is fantastic, learning technique AND learning how all of your techniques fit together is even better.  I learned more in four weeks than I learned from my years at gyms.Unique Workouts and Custom-Built Equipment.  The workouts are fantastic.  I've never been a more creative program.  He pulls out exercises and class formats that I've never heard of.  In addition to using practically all of the equipment in the gym, the instructor made some of his own equipment just for the class! It can be done by anyone.  My main concern is that I thought I was in decent shape and worried it wouldn't be challenging enough for me.  But, everything we did could be scaled and varied so that complete novices could work out next to hard-core athletes.  One day I had a 20-something college athlete on one side of me and a woman who was dropping weight from her fourth child on the other side.  We were all equally whipped at the end of the day.Athletic Training.  On the very first day Matt tells the class, "I train athletes.  I don't train fitness people.  Athletes are fit.  Fitness people are seldom athletic.  I want you to leave here being able to DO things." I didn't know what that meant until I started doing the workouts and, wow, there is a world of difference between working out at a gym and training like an athlete.  Stamina, speed, strength, muscle tone, weight loss all I'm improved much faster than I thought it would.Effective.  During my first camp I started chatting with people and discovered who the repeaters were.  I was so surprised to find that these people who seem to be in such great shape had lost 30, 40, sometimes 60 pounds while coming to the class.  Some hadn't worked out since high school and were now talking about the sports they play in their spare time.  What was truly surprising was their complete lack of ego and how supportive they were.  Also, I can say without qualification, that I've never been in better shape.In the end, I hope the length of this review gives you an idea of just how much of a difference this class made in my life.  Do not be intimidated.  This class is for everyone.  Beginners are trained to become athletes.  And athletes are trained to become better athletes.  What you hear most from the instructor I think sums up the class best: "There is no such thing as tough.  There is only trained and untrained.  There is no such thing as athletic.  There is only coached and un-coached.  This class is about training you and coaching you."
<review# 613,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2012,3/14/2013,81,15,2,2,2>I purchased a Living Social deal for the On Ramp class, which is a great way to get introduced to Crossfit.  The facility at Crossfit e-town is excellent, the coaches are skilled, knowledgeable, motivational and caring.  I felt challenged, but safe in their hands.  I am notorious for avoiding discomfort, but I go back for the challenge and push myself to better myself.   Since my On Ramp class, I've become a member.  I get up and go and there is no more avoiding.  I have seen a difference in my strength, endurance and attitude!  Coaches PC, Kevin, Kara, Carrie and Bo are invested in my improvement as much as they are in everyone there.  The community is supportive, fun and encouraging. The WODs are challenging but doable for anyone who is questioning if they can do it.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  If I can do it, (and I'm 50) you can too!  I do it and repeat as often as I can.  It's the best place to be and for my money it's worth it.
<review# 614,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2013,3/13/2013,48,257,2,3,2>Lately I have been trying places off the beaten path.  Getting bored with reviewers on here that review the same old, same old hip and trendy places.   YES yelpers, we know all the places on Randolph Street are all great (I myself am guilty of this).  So tonight I decided to try one of the restaurants I have been wanting to try in my hood.  Boy am I glad I did.  I cannot even explain each and every dish to you, but truly encourage you to just go and try it.  Delicious tender meats, amazing herb infused rice with different yet familiar seasoning.  Amazing appetizers and best yet it is BYOB.  The service was also great.  It has been a long time that I have been to a restaurant where they were not trying to hard except to deliver delicious and thoughtful food cooked from the heart.  Two things to warn you,  this place is small and crowded at times, so even if you make a reservation be prepared to wait (believe me, wait, it is worth it).  Also, you will leave her with your clothes smelling like the food, which is only a bad thing if you are going somewhere after.  I also wouldn't recommend the dill rice if you are on a date as mine had it all in the teeth LOL.  What I ate was:AppetizerMantoo and Bulanee, both were outstandingSaladChopped Apple, Fresh, perfect balance of flavor, great dressingMain CoursesMurgh and the lambone with Afghan rice the other with dill, I know the chicken is rated best in the city and it was great but the lamb was unreal!  So great.DessertFirnee and the Afghan Ice Cream.  I did not personally love the firnee but it was as I imagine, perfectly prepared.  The ice cream was amazing with a hint of rosewater and I enjoyed the crunch of the pistachio.All in all it was a great experience.  Topped off by having great service from a lovely hostess.  Run here quick before it is on the news or Check Please and you can't get in.

I have been thrilled with the service!I've got fine straight hair that my previous hair dressed kept insisting needed the ends trimmed more & more to keep it healthy & looking good til I had lost nearly 6" of length in 18 months. I was mortified! It was such a slow progression that I didn't realize it right away. Roula has been a life saver! She has helped me grow my hair longer & healthier than it has been in years! She's not only knowledgable but a really kind person as well! I really enjoy going in there!
<review# 616,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2012,3/11/2013,58,347,3,3,3>I love froyo since it's tart and refreshing, I HATE ice cream because it tastes so fatty... buuut I like custard? Ice cream makes me really thirsty as many things high in fat and sugar do, but I really don't feel that way about Andy's. The texture is great and doesn't feel fatty in my mouth despite being so very creamy, which is amazing!Their concretes are pretty inventive, and I'm especially a fan of the jitterbug, since it helps me combat food comaing from eating it with caffeine! Yay! It's not always on the menu, but they always just make it anyway if you ask. I'm sure that's the case with many of their other "seasonal" promotional items.I can barely finish a small by myself, though it has literally never occurred to me before now to ask for kid sized concretes... That would really solve a lot of my problem with Andy's... hm.EDIT: sooo you can't get kid sized concretes, but the lady at the counter suggested freezing my leftovers for another day.  i must say, about five days later it has kept pretty well, returning surprisingly close to the original soft serve texture, though a bit of inevitable water condensation. I will be doing this more often!
<review# 617,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2012,3/10/2013,10,18,,3,2>We moved to Northbrook over the summer and Wags on Willow is my new favorite store!  Mary is so welcoming and helpful.  She has a wonderful selection of food and treats, along with very unique accessories and gift items.  She gave me some great advice regarding grain free dog food when my previous food had been recalled and was unavailable.Last weekend we went to the first Halloween party and both of my dogs had a great time.  There was a pet photographer, treats for pets and people, and a costume parade.  It is really so nice to have a great shop like this in the neighborhood and I am always excited to go in!
<review# 618,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2012,3/9/2013,0,18,1,3,2>This place is amazing, every time we get in, it takes 4-5 hours to get out. My son just loves it...Unlimited painting on paper, boxes, toys. Kids make wonderful castles, houses, trains, cars. There are various stations, like kitchen, experimental station, plants growing...Drums room is such a fun for them. Last time I was there, I could not curb my impulse and went in as well. I think it was the best 5 minutes of my week :) The regular price is $22 for entrance (all-included) but I always buy it on Groupon for $11. Wooden toys for painting are sold separately.

I had a watch that needed to be sized quickly and they did it in less than 45 minutes as a special effort because I was getting ready to go out of town and needed it quickly. If I'm going to buy graduation gifts, jewelry or keepsakes, this is my first stop from now on!
<review# 620,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2013,3/7/2013,56,185,2,6,5>On the corner of Green Bay Road and Central Road near downtown Wilmette lies a hidden gem that won't even show up on Google maps.As soon as you walk in, you'll see the cupcakes available for the day. They bake in small batches so depending on what time you come in, they may run out of your favorite. However, the cupcakes have this homemade feel that you won't be able to get at Molly's, Crumbs, or the like. Another added benefit is that they don't overload the cupcakes with sugar like most other cupcake shops. It results in a  birthday cake like texture and taste, all in a cupcake.But the real star of Lawrence Deans is the cookies. Their chocolate chip cookies have this saltiness to them which gives it the coveted one-two punch of sweet+salty which is hard to find. The perfect crisp on the outside of the cookie and the moist chewy center all come together to host a party in your mouth, with an invitation sent out for milk.Next time you're driving down Green Bay Road, don't miss it.

One time my daughter's hedgehog was sick, and even though they don't usually treat small animals, Dr. Roberts made an exception and was glad treat him for me .Yep, I agree it's stinky and dated and could be cleaner. You can go in without an appointment as a walk-in, and I've never had to wait that long. The other two vets are good too, I just prefer Dr. Roberts because he is so compassionate and usually figures out the problem quickly.
<review# 623,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2013,3/4/2013,10,12,1,2,1>I found Beauty & Balance on Yelp, and decided to try it, based on its reviews. I love my stylist in the city, whom I've been going to for years. But I live in the 'burbs now. Since 2005 I've been driving into Chicago to get my hair cut, but trying to arrange my schedule to get a cut is hard enough without having to devote half the day to the endeavor. I've made a couple of failed attempts to find a stylist in the suburbs ... which sent me running back to the city, but I think my suburban search is over.I called to see if they had any appointments available that very day, knowing I was risking getting one of their least in-demand stylists. The woman on the phone combed the schedule and found a spot for me with Risa that evening.My hair is not so complicated. Straight. Long. Lots of layers. Your basic Reese-Witherspoon-at-the-Golden-Globes-circa-2007 kind of style. The biggest issue for me is my bangs. I have had bangs since I've had hair. I have a weird forehead and even weirder hairline. It must be covered and my bangs are pretty "heavy" by necessity. Trying to explain my forehead and bangs to each new stylist more often than not leads to a stylist wanting to make changes. Risa listened to  me and fully understood the need for my bangs to be full ... and also understood that I wanted the bangs to be integrated into the overall do, rather than looking like an afterthought. My hair looks great. I waited until I'd washed and dried my hair myself to see if the cut was genuinely great. (We all know we look good when we leave the salon and have undergone the full round brush treatment. The true test is how it looks after we've had our own amateurish go at it.)Risa was adorable, btw. We chatted and gabbed the whole time. She's really sweet and funny and self-deprecating. And the owner (Kelly? Ugh. I can't remember) came over and introduced herself during the hair cut, which is a nice gesture. Good business, too. Smart. I will be back. Though I feel like I've unfairly broken up with my previous stylist. But I'm just not a long distance relationship kind of gal.
<review# 624,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2013,3/3/2013,35,115,2,3,2>Norton's is our Cheers.  We get no arguing from anyone about coming here, they either know us or pretend to know us well, the food is consistent, and my daughter and I would be lost without our split Wedge Salad and split Ruben sandwich-which they kindly split and put on separate plates EVERY time without us asking.  I have never had anything I don't like-and just really like the down home atmosphere.
<review# 625,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2012,3/2/2013,29,219,,7,3>This place deserves 6 stars-it is an amazing play space.

It is also meticulously clean.We had my twins one year birthday party here and I intend to have every party here from now on. All of our guests had a great time and there is so much for the kids to do. it was easy for me--no set up or clean up, VERY reasonably priced and Ellen came up with a fabulous art project for the kids.Love love love.

Desserts are to die for especially the bread pudding. Staff and ambiance are great. Last visit Wild Mushrooms on puff pastry, beef wellington, Dover Sole, Foie gras Apple Tart and Bread pudding. All were great with the exception of the Dover Sole which my wife felt could have been fresher.. Anyway we will be back.

Perfectly hand-swirled and delicious frosting atop moist, fluffy cupcakes? The brothers here at baker boys know how to maintain integrity and set themselves apart from other bakeries. Being a smaller shop you're not going to find every baked dessert under the sun, but they know how to put their own unique and satisfying spin on the desserts everyone loves.Nothing is made one day but sold the next; everything is from scratch and fresh, just like it should be. If you're lucky you might see the boys preparing a new batch behind the counter! They have been a successful business for over a year, so obviously they know something about running a business.Baker nut forever!

The people there are great too.. they definitely care and will hold a conversation with you. I will be a weekly visitor now! Also, the interior is super cute and they did a good job designing it. Very clean and modern. I ordered the Chicken Shwarma and small hummus on the side. It was delicious. This will be my new spot especially because they have healthy options. Also, I have tried the other mediterranean restaurants in Glenview and they are by far the best. Check it out!
<review# 632,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2013,2/23/2013,32,301,,7,6>Its location is perfect since there really isnt another decent shop until you get north into libertyville. Phil, one of the owners, is the man. his work speaks for itself so go check the website. Personally i feel that the other artists have both bad work and really outstanding work. i think that every tat artist has a specific style they are awesome at and im not sure who is best at what just yet but my friends and i have all been here and have walked out with great art for a fair price, not dirt cheap but not overly expensive. If you are an all around art fan, do yourself a favor and check out Beth's, phil's wife and part owner, paintings she is quite talented.
<review# 633,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/19/2012,2/22/2013,38,121,,7,2>If you're looking for a nail boutique that (a) is clean and sleek, (b) carries a wide nail color selection, (c) is conveniently located in downtown Evanston, (d) has super comfortable massage chairs, and (e) provides a professionally-executed mani-pedi in under 80 mins, then this is the place for you. However, if you're looking to converse with one of the Mongolian girls working there, and you're not Mongolian, then try another nail boutique. If you want your quiet time, then that shouldn't be a big deal. The other perk is that if you forget to bring cash for tip, don't worry; they'll take tip in the form of credit. If it weren't for Groupon, I wouldn't have discovered this gem in Evanston! My "blackberry evening" nails are still holding up after a week. This may be my new favorite nail boutique, so I'll definitely be returning!

It's like what Clarke's could/should be, and far less expensive, which is great. All day breakfast, sandwiches, salads, soups, pizzas..you name it, J.T.'s has it, and serves it up with a friendly smile. I loved that they gave us a sample of the soup of the day and a small glass of freshly squeezed OJ.
<review# 635,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/18/2012,2/20/2013,60,245,,5,3>5 stars for the sub sandwiches and the 'Bomber'. The bomber is a hot Italian beef with Swiss cheese, pickle, onion and their special sauce on a great piece of French bread. It comes in two sizes. It may sound a little funky but it's so good.The subs (they call them Poor Boys) are equally as good IMO with the same excellent crunchy bread with sesame seeds. They also have hot dogs, hamburgers, salads, steak sandwiches, deli sandwiches, grilled chicken breast on a pita and several daily specials that gets you fries and a drink. Also a catering menu and up to a 6 foot party sub.Friendly service. In fact I got there soon after they opened and the beef wasn't quite ready but they warmed up enough for my sandwich.I noticed a breakfast item called the scrambled mess that's basically a western omelet on toasted french bread. I'll let you know as I'll be trying that too.There are about 8 tables to eat inside.I should have taken a picture of the sandwiches but I was so excited to eat that I forgot :)I haven't been here in some time and now I'm asking myself why?
<review# 636,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/20/2013,2/19/2013,33,194,8,5,4>Sweet! A good crepe place in the area! We love crepes. I specifically will order a savory crepe if it's on a brunch menu. We decided to check this place out after driving by if a few times. When you walk in here, they won't take your order unless they see a table available. Makes a lot of sense. We had about a five minute wait on a Sunday. Not bad at all. While we ordered, a turdy family came in and tried to take the table assigned to us. Thankfully, the waitress taking our order let them know it was for us. Unfortunately, they were seated right behind us during the meal and may have been some of the crappiest people we've eaten by in a long time. The father kept getting up and bumping our stroller and just being kind of a jerk. He should realize that the unkempt hair, think black frames, huge gut,  and facial hair/sideburns do not make him look like a hipster, but more like a hotdog away from being bedridden and washing himself with a rag on a stick. I look forward to seeing him cut out of his home to be airlifted for hospital visits on the Discovery channel. But I digress. We had the Lavazza coffee, breakfast crepe, and metropolis crepe. All were really tasty and we'll come back again. This is a great neighborhood spot with good food in a casual atmosphere.
<review# 637,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/3/2012,2/18/2013,57,93,,2,1>Dempster FIsh Market is a great place to order trays for big parties as it is on the cheaper end and the quality of the sushi is fresh! It's mostly a take-out place although there are a few tables for those who are grabbing a quick lunch. I highly recommend ordering HOURS in advanced as I did order at least 3 hours in advanced and I was still waiting for them to finish up the order.  It didn't seem to busy but maybe I just expected to just kind of pick it up since I showed up 15 minutes late anyway.
<review# 638,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2011,2/17/2013,75,5,2,5,2>For my first time here, I got the beef plate. With the cooking skills of a 3 month old, I was able to whip up the healthiest meal I think I've ever had. Seriously. I've never had that many vegetables at a time. The quality of the food is amazing and the staff is very attentive. Would eat again. A+++
<review# 639,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2012,2/16/2013,23,74,1,4,2>Who knew a pizza place on what seems to be a side street could rock.  It does! Glad I read other reviews who convinced me to try this place.  It's tucked in a small strip mall off of Lincoln. I love the sauce, its a little tangy, but not the "I'll give you heartburn" type of sauce. The ingredients seem fresh, and not too much, not too little.  I've grown a little sick of Pequods up the road, so this new place hit the spot.It's a good carryout pizza place, not one I'd sit and dine in.  Hmm, writing this review makes me want to get their pizza for lunch today.
<review# 640,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2013,2/15/2013,159,194,,4,2>Top notch, period. Probably one of the best tailors that have ever altered my clothes. I've been coming back to this place for quite some time now and the level of service has exceeded itself with every visit.They are patient with your alteration needs and offer suggestions when needed. Although, I'm only speaking in terms of hemming pants, jeans and suit alterations so I'm not exactly sure how well they do with the alteration needs/wants of the female customer.As far as prices go, it depends on what you need done. Plus, I don't remember what I've paid. LOL. All I remember is that the quality of work was definitely worth the price.Oh one more thing. CASH or CHECK only folks.
<review# 641,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2012,2/14/2013,17,71,,5,4>just stumbled upon this shop by happenstance. met the owners, Cecelia and Alex. Had a nice chat and let my boys enjoy the aquarium at the front.  The shop is simple, but the service and attention are top notch.I've been to shops far and wide, and rarely is my enthusiasm met with reciprocity at the prospect of a new customer. As long as I live in Evanston, I will go to Bucephalus.  I've tried other shops that change their name (you know who you are) who honestly don't give a rats about you.When I came back three days later, Alex remembered my name. Small thing, but it makes you want to come back.Don't waste your time with any other shop for your bike-maintenance needs. Honestly.*UPDATE* - sent me pictures of my damaged part, on their own accord. I don't know about you, but for bike  nerds/enthusiasts... honestly it's a dream come true. I love having different communication channels available. Thanks a million.
<review# 642,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/6/2013,2/13/2013,2,37,,5,1>Ever since we brought our Volvo SUV here for service, we have not gone anywhere else. First of all, the customer service is top notch. The first time we went, we received a box of cookies in the mail to thank us/welcome us. Now, can anyone top this? I was won over!Most importantly, we never felt that they are out to get us. We go in, they take care of our car and we never ever felt pushed or get scared the heck out of us to get more service done in our car. We believe they are honest.Excellent customer service, quality workmanship, reasonable price point - shouldn't be a surprise they have been in business for as long as they have been!Finally, an auto shop I can trust!
<review# 643,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/28/2012,2/12/2013,20,82,3,3,3>This place is an institution in Wilmette.  The gyros are awesome.  Want fries, hot dogs, burgers or other classic Chicago hot dog stand style food head here to satisfy your cravings.  The environment is like a diner in a little shoe box.  In summer they have tables outside but it's just a counter inside so if it's busy you'll be cramped.   Service is friendly and fast - watch your food prepared right in front of you.
<review# 644,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2012,2/11/2013,206,413,1,4,3>Awesome! I owe it to Candice to remind me that this place was worth trying. In coming here, I had one significant focus: eating healthy. Having good food out of the deal was definitely a plus.  I thought it was a cafe, but it turns out to be a bit of a trendy restaurant. They serve you really fast, and service was fine overall. Oh and if you're allergic to nuts, this is probably not the place to go, for the most part.  I know they can cook to compensate for nut allergies but you would have to ask them for everything you order, most likely. I started with the beet "ravioli", if you can even call it a ravioli. It was more like a beet-made fruit roll-up with macadamia nut cheese, basil pesto and balsamic dressing. They looked really unique, and were honestly quite good. Even my picture doesn't show how they were so thin they were glowing red in the light. The flavor profile was unique and good, more along the lines of something I'd expect at a high class restaurant or somewhere like green zebra than a place that nearly brands itself a cafe.  For a drink, we ordered the Vitality - Tomato, Carrot, Beet, Bell Pepper, Celery, Kale, Parsley, Lemon, Jalapeno. I couldn't taste the Jalapeno, personally - but it was a decent juice. I think it's more a question of if you like healthy juices, and not at all like the kind of things I would regard as horrible which would basically consist of most Jamba Juice drinks. That was followed up with the Mexican Quinoa Bowl, while my partner in crime had the Eggplant Parmesan. The Mexican Quinoa Bowl was not as big as I had hoped (hey, I'm a big eater), but I would imagine it'd be fine for the average person.  It was an awesome combination, though. It had pico de gallo, guacamole, quinoa and greens with a chipotle dressing. I wouldn't say the dressing actually tasted chipotle but it was great, and mixed well with the other ingredients. The partner in crime had the Eggplant "parmesan" with Almond Parmesan and Walnut breaded eggplant. I thought the eggplant was so hard it felt like something that had been in the microwave a little too long, but maybe that was just me. The sauce was good, and they also julienned some zucchini to go with it. I liked it, but the texture of the eggplant was again notable.Lastly, some Tiramisu - which was only somewhat tasting like normal Tiramisu and basically having a very similar texture to a vegan key lime pie I have made with almond meal and walnuts. That's not a bad thing, but it was definitely good.Did I mention this place was pretty pricey? I will now. It is definitely pricey. However, it's definitely unique, and of a better quality for seriously healthy food than most places north of Chicago, so I shall be coming again.
<review# 645,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/27/2012,2/10/2013,122,140,6,7,6>Picture me smiling in content as I reminisce about my two experiences at this wonder of a place.I have simply NOTHING to criticize. I guess part of the joy is in the fact that this place is literally across the street from where I live in Evanston :DBut to talk about my experience there...I really liked how this place blended really well elements of a restaurant, a bar, and a lounge ALL together. If you didn't want to sit at a round table, you could sit at a low coffee table on couches and savor the unique european/american tapas style bites while sipping on some one-of-a-kind cocktails...all at a reasonable price. Class is reflected in the brick wall covered with artwork. Care and a desire to be different & classy is reflected in the menu which consists of only a page of bite size portion dishes not likely found elsewhere. The simplicity of the menu exerts confidence which is not bravado but genuine pride in the awesomeness presented by every single dish on it.The staff (the hostess, the waitresses, the bartenders) are VERY well trained and amiable when it comes to questions and comments about their establishment. Hopefully that won't change. My greatest admiration for the owner who has been able to have FOUND packed every single night with people of different cultures and ages. I am apt to say that the success of this lounge has even potentially raised the value of the city of Evanston itself. May I even say that Found rivals or trumps a sizable number of bars and lounges I have been to in Chicago thus far. A word of advice: Get there before 6:30 to guarantee yourself a spot in thisSTARof Evanston.
<review# 646,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2012,2/9/2013,11,12,,4,1>Booby's is great fixture on Milwaukee Ave. In Niles.  They have a large varied menu as any good Greek hot dog stand would have.  They have a bountiful Greek salad. Their gyros are among the best in the neighborhood.  The ribs are tender and tasty but the best is their house Cheeseburger that come with coleslaw and barbecue sauce on it.  It's like a party in your mouth with all those wonderful flavor going off.  Great tasting burger for the quality you would get from s gourmet burger at Red Robin but half the price!  Check our Booby's next time you're driving down Milwaukee and are starving. They will not disappoint!
<review# 647,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/29/2012,2/8/2013,2,14,,5,5>I came across this place on yelp, and after reading the reviews decided to try this place out. Plus it's the closest tanning salon by my house. Now, I wont tan anywhere else! I've been here only twice and I've gotten the best tans than anywhere else such as LA, and Exotic. My friend I usually come here with also raves about this place. The bulbs are strong and the beds are nice and clean. Plus the customer service here is fantastic. Guy behind the counter is super friendly and nice. My first time there he offered a deal where I think it's just $5 more for the next tan within the next week. Unfortunately, I got a stye, (an eyelid infection) later that week (not related from tanning) and I called in to see if they could extend my deal since I was on antibiotics. Guy on the phone was understanding and said he could give me another week extension just like that!! But just my luck after that week I got bronchitis -____- Just my luck, eh? So I figured oh well. But I went in a month after my first time which was just yesterday and the same guy gave me a discount for that day. Basically this place rocks. I don't even feel bad about losing money for that deal, since I'm in love with this place.GO HERE FOR AN AMAZING TANNING EXPERIENCE! You won't regret it!!!
<review# 648,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/10/2012,2/7/2013,20,9,2,4,2>We had our annual Hanukkah family bash last night. At the final hour, I'd realized I'd had enough on my plate and they weren't potato latkes! I enjoy all the accolades and truly love doing the whole thing myself. This time, I acquiesced and handed it over to David Borris at Hel's Kitchen. David assured me that he was going to send me a "lovely, and very talented guy."  I told David that my kitchen is so antiquated, when you turn on the micro wave oven, and the toaster at the same time, the electricity goes off! This gem of a guy, Eduardo, was indeed talented and lovely beyond words. He made and saved the day. He assured me that frequently, they run into altercations on location and are trained to "make do." Never mind what happened...The food? Sorry Grandma. The matzoh ball soup was better than yours. The salmon was cooked to perfection, not dry or too flaky, the flavor delicious! We had Chicken basil, grilled veggies, and a wonderful salad t'boot! Not to mention, the potato latkes were kick "a!" I'd insisted on making my own apple sauce, and at the last minute, Eduardo pulled off that caper too! All the minutia aside, this is your go to caterer. We all need our carefully planned gatherings of friends, family, et al, to be special. When you need a company that's reliable, with food that is positively delicious, and staff who is capable of handling what ever arises, keeping you looking like a star, call a pro. Call David Borris at Hel's Kitchen.

<review# 651,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2012,2/4/2013,18,29,2,2,2>We discovered Basha a few years ago and have been regulars ever since. The food can take long if you eat in, but that's because it's made to order, which is a good thing. We mostly call ahead and do carry out. If you eat in the service isn't that great, because it's family owned and has no designated servers. The dining room is very basic and is hardly ever croweded, but the owner and his family are always very nice and accommodating, so I never expect 5-star. My whole family loves the filet mignon kabobs but the chicken shawarma is good too. The sandwich especially is delicious. Good falafel, salads, and my daughter loves their rice.  The garlic sauce is addicting, although I try to limit my intake. The food is good quality and always fresh. It's much better than Pita Inn!! (We went back to Pita Inn once just to compare and it just wasn't as good. The next time we wanted Mediterranean we were right back to Basha.)
<review# 652,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2010,2/3/2013,213,113,3,3,3>This place is like going to a vintage clothing store without the ridiculous prices.  Remember, however, you get what you pay for, so many of the items they have displayed are not perfect and/or may be outdated.  Although, you may find a diamond in the rough like I did.I came here a few days ago hoping to find a white vest or pants when I found a suede fedora just hanging in the aisle.  It looked brand new and fit perfectly.  Its an 'Adam Premier' fedora made by The Miller Bro Hat Company.  I'm assuming that its rare b/c I did a search online, and the only thing I can find on them are some auction sites selling this brand of hats for at least $40.  I got it for under $4!!!

Sorry, I don't have the names of the dishes but i'll describe them.1) "Cuban French Fries". I believe these are actually yuka, not potato. They are lightly crisped and have some sort of vinegar dressing them. My favorite thing!2) What seemed like deep fried vienna sausages. Sounds gross, I know, but extremely tasty!3) Flank steak. Not actually what you'd expect a steak to look like. It was slow cooked and pulled. Aaaaah!Highly HIGHLY recommend!
<review# 654,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2013,2/1/2013,51,66,2,6,4>On the advice of a good buddy, we decided to check out TK's Smoke Pit tonight. It definitely delivered. Outstanding BBQ. In fact, it's so good that they should be "get a reservation" busy. But not this Sunday night. The strip mall was ghosty. And TK's was scary slow--which was amplified by the strange way the restaurant is set up. You walk all the way to the back to order at the counter -- which on a slow night makes you wonder if the place is even open. It's a peculiar arrangement. However, once they get more butts in seats, I could see them moving to a sit-down and order format. The food is great. We had a wide sample of the menu: brisket, pulled pork shoulder, burnt end smokey joe (like sloppy joes but with pork shoulder), and St. Louis ribs. With sides of burnt ends baked beans, vinegar cole slaw, Texas (beanless) chili, and mac & cheese. The only misses on the menu were the lack of sweet potatoes, greens and corn muffins. They really need to put some vegetables in the rotation.The ribs were done to championship level -- perfect color in the meat, well smoked, the right pull and texture and so much delicious flavor in the rub that sauce is completely optional. Yum!Pork shoulder had a great depth of smoke and had the right amount of moisture (not squishy, but not dried out). The level of barky chunks mixed in with the non-bark strands was well balanced. Again, sauce optional. The brisket was also very, very good--among the best I've had. It gives Smoque and Real Urban BBQ a run. I'd gladly volunteer to judge a head to head against those (and any other) competitors. Though they serve it with their Memphis sauce, no sauce is needed. Never having had burnt end smokey joe, I only have the usual sloppy joe to compare. It was freakin' delicious. In fact, my sloppy-joe-hating kids devoured it. Though all of the meat is delicious enough on it's own, the wife is a bit of a freak about sauces. The (North) Carolina style was dead-on with a great vinegary zip. The Memphis style was also very good. The owner came out and offered us some of the Snakebite sauce--which has a great fiery kick without getting painfully hot. But to our chagrin, the sauce that needed more work was the signature TK sauce. Its way too heavy with tomato paste and not sweet enough. Additionally, I'd love to see a South Carolina mustard sauce as well as a sauce with a molasses base.  As others have said, the joint could use some ambiance. Its got good bones, but could use some decoration (a few paintings or even posters) would go really far in giving the place a shot of character. It wouldn't take much. Though its a longish drive for us, we will definitely be back. TK's is remarkable. Hopefully they get enough people through the doors to keep them open. They deserve it. The food is that good.

<review# 656,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/19/2012,1/30/2013,23,203,3,4,2>This is where I would eat before I die.  I am normally annoyed by places that don't take reservations especially if you're going to shell out $150 for dinner for two but I don't mind it here because the bartender keeps me happy with his awesome drinks.   Submit to his creativity and let him pick something for you from their small but great drink menu or try one of his own creations.  For dinner, the cheddar biscuits alone should tell you that this place is heaven.  Try whatever their special of the day is especially if it involves pork belly or soft shell crab.  The menu is small but I believe quality is better than an overwhelming book of a menu is better.  For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding is worth every calorie and guilt you may foolishly feel after indulging in this heavenly dessert.  Service is always great and yes - the diners around you may be some North Shore heavy hitters but who cares?  You all share the same good taste in picking this dining destination.

I was told that I would not have to chew the Lamb Osso Bucco.  I was told correctly.  It was awesome, and came with a fattoush salad that was heavily seasoned, but in a good way.  My wife had Beef Shwarma which she thoroughly enjoyed.We have lived in this town for 3 years and have never been here.... I have a feeling we will be coming back soon.  Lots of things on the menu that sounded good, and the prices are quite low for Highland Park.... especially for white linen outdoor dining.

When I moved from the city, my snobby ways were convinced I would never find a good breakfast place. Boy did the burbs school me on that one.The place does a mean skillet (veggie is my personal fave), pancakes, bacon, potatoes you name it. But on top of the typical fares, they have coma-inducing delish such as pumpkin spice French bread. It changes so be sure to check the specials board! If you want to give in to the calories, this is the place to do it!The kiddos LOVE coming here. Breakfast of champions is they're favorite -- mini MnMs pancakes. Scrambled eggs. Bacon. They're stuffed to the gills and happier for it. One thing -- I know that it's called Egg Harbor and the chicken decor is supposed to be cute but it just freaks me out. Like I've walked into an 80s version of a country kitchen. Apparently, I'm the only one in my family who thinks this, so it must be my issue.Prices are right on target here. You're not pillaging the place but you walk away with a great breakfast at a reasonable price. Be sure to ask for a to-go cup for your coffee. Yep. You get to take your unfinished coffee with you. Hubby almost did a happy dance when he found that out.

This new taco slinger occupies the space that previously held Portofino's pizzeria, which fortunately remains immortalized in McProbCause's "Evanston Song" (look for it on Youtube) and will not be forgotten.This joint has all the usual menu items. Aside from cheese fries, the menu sticks strictly to Mexican food. I went there almost daily for about a week straight because it's two blocks from my house. I'm over my fever now, though, thank god.The horchata is middle of the road. Of those i've tried, my favorite meats list is chorizo, chicken, pork, ground beef, steak. They seem to do business all day long, whenever I'm running an errand and happen to be passing by. So far I've only had the tacos and burritos, but intend to venture toward enchiladas and other more interesting items -- it seems a lot of people order the chile rellenos, so they must be doing something right with them. The one thing you should watch out for is that 'everything' includes sour cream, which I personally like to have to ask for as an add-on, when I'm feeling wild.The last time I was there they were having a nightmarish time getting orders right. They had a young girl working the register and had to ask us what we ordered again. While we ate our food in the restaurant person after person came in to complain that their order wasn't right and get something made or remade. Since I've already been there, uh, several times, I can safely say that this was probably a quirky day.
<review# 665,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2012,1/21/2013,77,182,1,5,3>Since moving to Skokie about a year ago, I have to admit that I still look to Chicago for the fine dining scene. However, since Libertad has opened up, I'm glad that I have somewhere close to home to go when I'm feelin' fancy! The decor was nice and reflected the food well: rustic but refined.First of all, do yourself a favor and get the Hummingbird Mojito! The glass is jam-packed with blueberries, raspberries, and barely tasted of alcohol at all. This drink is perfect -- if you are like me -- if you are a lightweight lover of fruits!In terms of entrees, I very much enjoyed the crab cakes. The texture was light and fluffy, but at the same time crunchy with the apples, onions, and cucumbers. I thought that the jalapeno mayonnaise was done very well and, in addition to the avocados, added a creamy texture to the dish too. I also liked the roasted beet salad (but I am admittedly a bit biased because I am a fiend for beets!). I liked the use of watercress and I also liked the truffle vinaigrette; however, I would have preferred a more finely-shaven cheese, or perhaps a type of cheese that had a stronger flavor to match the dressing.The skate wing was frankly a bit disappointing. While the skate itself was done perfectly, I thought that the rice and vegetables were too sweet. The acorn squash risotto seemed a bit on the underseasoned side.The best part of the meal was definitely the yuzu butter cake. Simple and unpretentious, and yet unique and very much refreshing.

When I found it was cash or check only and realized that I didn't have the $14 on hand, he just told me to come back tomorrow to pay if I needed to (I found an ATM right down the street). Great service and high-quality results.

We return for service, had some extra keys made etc. The people are nice and they have flavored coffee, tvs and a play area for the kids. This is definitely a plus for me. We will definitely work with Muller in the future.

As a comparison, Paciugo comes as my close 2nd. So if you LOVE it there, you'll love it here. I first heard about Frost from my cousin in ARIZONA. Yes, that's where the man from Italy decided to open his first location. And  now..it's Highland Park of all places..  I feel he's missing out not being in the city, but maybe it's a smart move?? I have loved every flavor i've had there. It's got the all natural real ingredients. I love seeing the little specks of coconut and mango in my gelato. I love the sweet touch of a wafer cookie they add on top as a little free sweet treat. :) Sea salt caramel..mint chocolate chip...FEED ME MORE! It's a little bummer that they only let you put one flavor in a small, two in a medium, or three in a large, but HEY!..it gives me more reasons to go back and try some new future favs! :)Definitely go the gelato route next time you're in Highland Park. You will LOVE LOVE LOVE it. Thank me by filling your tummies!

There is high turnover of produce here, so you know that what you're getting is fresh.  Seafood and cold cuts are fresh too. Everything is organized and they have a huge selection of ethnic groceries. This is a much nicer version of Jerry's  (much easier to navigate inside), and parking is better here too. Oh, and the in-store made breads, guacamole and desserts are pretty good too. All around winner here!

I didn't get a chance to eat there but the restaurant looked pretty nice for a hotel bar & grill.The most important thing for me is that the place is clean.  This hotel was one of the cleanest I have stayed at.  The rooms were nice, the only thing that could have been better was a bigger tv.  Overall this was a very clean establishment with a very nice staff & I look forward to staying here again.

Maybe you can find instruments that cost less somewhere else. But you won't find the service, advice and relationship anywhere else. If you want the right instrument, right equipment, right repair, this is the place. We've been sending our kids to their summer camp for some years and it's a great experience. I'd recommend them to anyone.

<review# 679,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2012,1/7/2013,6,20,,2,2>Fantastic, that's all I can say. I've been meaning to give Kabul House a go for a while now and finally got around to it. The experience was beyond exceptional. The atmosphere was wonderful. The decor is great, it gives you a sincerely ethnic feel. The music was a perfect fit. It's comfortable and (more importantly) clean. The service was on point! Everyone was friendly, and very attentive to customers' needs. They were also very informative and patient, and were regularly checking in. The food was great! Everything was tasty and fresh, cooked to perfection. I fell in love with the dumplings (manto, I believe?) and the vegetable-noodle soup. Phenomenal. The pumpkin appetizer was worth a try, and the chicken was superb. Definitely head over to Kabul House. You won't be disappointed.
<review# 680,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2011,1/6/2013,259,46,4,9,3>I found this place today totally by chance! Happened to notice a cute sign that said MEI MEI BBQ, glanced back and saw whole roasted ducks in the window...... My bbq detecter went off the needle!Made my gorilla stop on the way back, took $20 in and hoped for the best...... Can I just say, this was the best bbq pork, chicken and duck I've had since the original sun wah on argyle. The Mother daughter team behind the steam table were very friendly and appreciative. Food was clean and tasty, lunch special over rice with baby bok choy was $5.50. Also felt I could ask questions or get a sample of that delicious looking black bean beef stew, UNLIKE sun wah. (YOU know what I'm talkin' about....sun wah is the equivalent to seinfelds' soup nazi) My money gave me a half of duck which I tasted ;-p and froze for later use in gumbo or stock. Two large pork tenderloins and a  boneless chicken over rice meal.  Now.... for the market. Small and chock full 'o' goodies! Veggies fresh and affordable, fresh noodles, duck eggs, lobster and fish in clean bubbling water with NO ODOR! I have seen many an asian market and have studied products intently for years and found items I have never seen before. Really fun..... Lastly the cherry on top.... the teenaged gal at the register had no problem taking me to the fermented black beans.....They had me at bbq

The meat case is truly mouthwatering; you simply cannot get meat this fresh at any grocery stores in the area. The cheese selection is out of this world: i mean bacon cheddar cheese, yes please. The front part of the shop has local products you cannot find anywhere else. The staff are all extremely welcoming. You can tell they really know what they are talking about and love what they do. They are always full of easy dinner ideas and tips. During the nice summer months you can also grab a quick brat or dog outside. You are absolutely missing out if you live in the area and have not made your way into Zier's.
<review# 682,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/15/2012,1/4/2013,58,347,4,5,6>Coffee Lab taught me how to love coffee. I have always been a coffee drinker - regular bitter coffee to shock my system awake when I need it, or whatever flavored latte or mocha if I actually wanted to enjoy my caffeine. So I'm pretty sure I've never enjoyed a proper cup of actual, delicious coffee until I first visited coffee lab almost a year ago. Now they have ruined me for regular sour, stale coffee from the campus cafes that I'm forced to drink out of convenience. I very willingly go significantly out of my way just to get a cup of diablo dark. It's aromatic and has a deep intense flavor that practically shocks me awake on my first sip, and nothing bitter and sour like other dark roast I've had before. I feel more awake just writing about it. My bf usually gets whatever espresso/milk-based drink he's in the mood for, and they're always rich and creamy, but nothing I'd crave and go out of my way to grab a cup of.The staff is very friendly and considerate and offer great suggestions if you're indecisive for the day.After their remodeling this summer, they now have big tables in their other room (as well as a row of stools along the front window and a few other seats) to do work on with plenty of natural light coming through the huge windows. But seating is still very limited and fill up quickly in the early afternoon, which is when I've been going the most. It's a shame it weren't bigger and open later :'[ I'd practically live here.

<review# 684,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2012,1/2/2013,19,8,5,6,4>I honestly can not say enough good things about Melissa and her team. Not only are they kind and wonderful people, Melissa is a saint when it comes to caring after your beloved furry guys and gals. I've been following her from store front to store front and I'm glad to see she's finally got a place of her own to call home. If i'm to ever take my two corgis to get groomed, i drive past all the chains and thirty minutes out to make an appointment with The Laundrymutt.Once Melissa and her team are done with my little monsters, they are softer than I've ever felt them before, and whatever shampoos and such they use, smells of utter heaven. I've found myself sticking my face into Kit and Cleo's fur and just breathing them for a few minutes... kinda like when you would smell those dry erase board markers for days on end as a little kid... you know... right?Again, I can not say enough good things about the place. And if you really wanna get your money's worth, make an appointment and then take your dogs out to the dog park for an hour or two before, let them run around, roll in the mud, poop, dead animals, whatever have it. Just enjoy the fresh air and out doors and tire out your pups. When they're all muddy and stinky, take them to The Laundrymutt and wipe your hands clean. A couple of hours later, you'll get back a squeaky clean dog. And, the most important part of doing all that, your dog actually had a less anxious time of being away from you and being at the groomer because it tired it self out, and was able to have a more relaxed time. A tired pup is a happy and care free pup.They've won me over, and the quality of service is unmatched.Think about it in a human example, do you think you'll get a better hair cut in a chain barber shop or salon, or do you think you'll get a better style and hair do at a stand alone salon? Super cuts versus [insert foreign sounding word or name] Salon.

She does a great job).I look forward to the couple of hours i get to spend with these ladies every few weeks. The price is more than reasonable, salon is clean and warm and the staff is a more than talented group. I know when I go in that I will get the best color and cut...always exactly what I want. Lamia takes her time and works with you to ensure that you are getting the right look for you. Over the years she has gotten to know and what my lifestyle entails so when asking for advice she gives it openly and honestly.My husband has been seeing Elda for about as many years and had been more than pleased with the level of service and attention he gets. His hair always looks great, Elda also takes her time and her attention to detail is unparalleled. As a man, I think he was hesitant at first to go to a "salon" but has become very comfortable there and would not change.I highly recommend Salon Lamia to anyone looking for a new stylist or new to town. You will not be disappointed. Both Lamia and Elda are willing to sit and talk with you about what you are looking for and help you achieve it .

<review# 690,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2009,12/27/2012,9,82,5,4,4>So it was the holidays, my dad was in town, babygirl was 3 months old, and I was having my two families plus my husband's family over for dinner for Christmas Eve. We decided that we were going to make a lamb dish because I think that lamb is festive, and Christmasy. Dad lives in California, so he was going to spend most of his vacation with me and baby...On a very snowy day in December, the kid of day that no one in their right mind goes out unless they completely have to, we decided to be brave and run errands. We went to Sam's Wine, the AT&T store, and Elegance In Meats last. Dad was a bit freaked out because of the snow, and I was still getting used to going places with a little baby. I told dad that Elegance In Meats was just a butcher shop and really nothing more, that he should stay in the car with baby while I went in and picked up the lamb that I had ordered.I went in to find a specialty old-fashioned butcher shop. It is a very cool place, with a good selection of frozen pre-prepared foods, a deli counter, a meat counter, and a salad bar. I felt like I'd walked back into the 1950's...When they rung up my lamb, it came to $130, which I thought was really expensive...I paid and went back to the car...Dad: So how was it in there?Me: It was incredible! Truly an old-fashioned butcher shop from long ago....Dad: And you had me sit in the car with the baby the whole time? I want to see the shop!Me: Next time, dad, we can all go in, now let's get home!--So we cooked the meat, simply with salt, pepper, rosemary, and a couple other spices. It was the best lamb I've ever made. I'll be back, but not very often, as it left a big dent in my wallet, but for special-occasion meats, this is the place to go!

<review# 693,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2012,12/24/2012,2,73,4,5,3>My favorite classic Italian restaurant in Chicagoland. When I say classic, I mean hearty food, no fancy gimicky dishes. It's where you go when you want something home cooked, but made by a better chef. The calamari are awesome, the pasta dishes are fantastic (all except, surprisingly, the lobster ravioli), and I've never had room for dessert so I can't review those. Although they look tempting every time. The downsides: It's a bit cramped, a bit noisy, long waits. But it's all worth it for the great food and staff. And, well, the first two are part of the atmosphere of a classic Italian restaurant, right?

However, it get's extremely busy on the weekends so make sure you make a reservation.  Also some of the tables in the restaurant are closely joined with the next table.  In some parts of the restaurant it makes you feel like your breathing down someones neck.
<review# 695,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/4/2012,12/22/2012,95,34,3,4,3>I have a minor obsession with Matzo Ball soup. Even before I started dating my Jewish boyfriend I was obsessed with it. Since moving to Evanston we have been on the lookout for a good Jewish deli. When we heard Kaufman's was re-opening I was pumped! We went the 2nd night after they reopened so I'm sure they were still working out some kinks but they had already run out of matzo ball soup!! I was soo sad. I did end up buying two things of frozen soup which was delicious when I got home and heated it up. I'm looking forward to going back to Kaufman's and hopefully this time they'll still have matzo ball soup by the time I get there! Also, the layout of the place is semi-confusing. There are multiple places where you can order and some confusion of where the line begins and ends. They had a "pull a number" system going but they kept skipping over numbers. Again, it was only the 2nd night they were open so hopefully they've got that sorted out by now!
<review# 696,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2012,12/21/2012,22,299,3,4,3>This place is wild. Spied it from the road and stopped in first time. It seemed to be doing good business. It's the product that is wild. All kinds of different things featured. Very international. Some ice cream flavors I noticed - avocado, lychee, there was ice cream that had beans in it, I have not seen these type of offerings anywhere else. They have giant chocolate covered marshmallows, chocolate covered bananas in the freezer ready to go. Everything is made fresh there daily. You like bubble tea, they have you covered. I noticed a blurb about how their ice cream is compressed and contains less air, so it is creamier and sweeter, and I swear I could taste what they meant. It's a little pricey at $3 for one scoop (4 oz), so I found the better deal to be getting the small container they offer, can't remember the size, but it's more ounces for a dollar or two more. I tried the italian expresso and whiskey caramel. Both were good. My wife got a turtle sundae and loved it. We'll be back. Can't wait to bring the kids and see their reaction to all the wild flavors - tee hee heeFyi - If you are using a credit card, there is a minimum purchase of $10, but that should not be hard to hit here.

<review# 698,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2012,12/19/2012,17,10,2,6,3>I went to Anthony's based on the reviews from Yelp.My daughter has her 1st communion coming up and decided to wear the dress that I wore (back in the day).  She is much smaller than I was at 8 years old.Anthony and his wife, Irene, at first I think, were in shock to see us come in.  But I explained why we were there and they were a delight to work with.  My daughter loved Anthony and his sense of humor.  She suggested that I write this review.Without any explanations, other than why we were there, they took on the task, like experts.  They gave comments on things to add, like a satin ribbon around the waist to keep it up to date.  Making both my daughter and I feel very well and confident.  When we went back to pick it up.  I noticed that they did not cut the dress, only hemmed it with keeping the material underneath.  I was excited to notice this.  I forgot to mention to Anthony that I have another daughter to follow.  Now she has the choice to use the dress, if she desires.Such a great guy and a good sense of humor made our experience there excellent.  When I asked how much I owe, he said that it is a gift for my daughter's 1st communion.  So sweet, it left both myself and my daughter smiling all day.
<review# 699,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2012,12/18/2012,60,245,2,3,3>Five stars for the pizza.We stopped here because we were at the Highwood Farmers Market on a Wednesday late afternoon. It's worth going to but that's another story. We had family in tow from out of town and my brother mentions Scornavacco's as one of his "stops" from the old days, so we had to go there even though the name on the door had changed to Washington Gardens. We all had pizza and this review is just for the pizza and the sassy server who we loved. Some may not like her attitude but we were going back and forth with her the whole time and it was fun. The pizza is a super thin crust, crispy, flavorful and reasonably priced. My wife had a spinach and mushroom and it was great and I'm not a spinach pizza guy unless it's the spinach souffle at Edwardo's. My bro had a sausage pizza and thought it was too salty but I loved it. It's going on my Best Thin list. If the rest of the menu is as good as the pizza it would explain the crowd on a week night because it was packed. We hit it just right in getting a table because a few minutes after we sat down a line started to form. Did I mention the very cold bottles of beer?
<review# 700,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2012,12/17/2012,13,13,4,5,4>One of the best sub places I've ever eaten at. The bread is so tasty, the ingredients are all fresh and the Captains Special Sauce just makes every sandwich. I always go with either the Northern Italian, which has great italian toppings, or the turkey club which i could literally never stop eating. I've only gotten the split pea soup when they offer a sample(which I love about the place) and its just like mama made it. Thick and soooo flavorful. Definitely Legendary with Epic sandwiches!!!!!!!!!!
<review# 701,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/17/2012,12/16/2012,45,34,3,3,3>I love coming here because it's one of the closest places to get tapas on the North Shore without having to schlep to the city. I've paid 3 visits here and each one of them has been thoroughly enjoyable. Beware though that if you don't make reservations on a busy weekend night, be prepared to wait a good 40-45 minutes if you want it bad enough. But during the week it usually isn't a problem. We've always eaten inside rather than on the patio because it's always either been too hot or raining. Plus the ambiance is a little nicer inside. Plastic chairs and table tops don't do it for me when you're shelling out $30+ for a meal. Yaknowwhaimsayin'?The service is ALWAYS outstanding, I've never had a bad experience with waiter/waitress here, they're all fantastic and very knowledgeable about the dishes. I'm extremely indecisive and they're always very helpful. The Queso de Cabra al Horno is my go to dish. Every time. I order at least two of them because one just isn't enough and I don't really like to share (yes, I realize that defeats the whole purpose of tapas, but just hear me out). The combination of the melted goat cheese and tomato basil sauce is just heaven. I do wish the portions were a *skosh* bigger, but the idea is to order a little bit of everything so you get a nice variety. And the sangrias are ALWAYS awesome. Order a pitcher, even if it's just two of you. It's worth it.And if you're not "busting at the gut" from dinner, try the Flor De Plátano. You won't regret it. Es muy delicioso.
<review# 702,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2012,12/15/2012,163,595,4,11,7>Thank you Groupon.  This is by far the best restaurant I ate at due to you guys.  I picked up a 5 course tasting menu and was blown away.Upon arriving into this place, I looked around and it just looked and felt like 'old money'.  Later on in the evening, when the place looked like I just crashed a country club, it made sense.  So the ambiance (including average clients) was very conservative.  But the food, holy jeebus the food was amazing.We were welcomed with cheese puffs.  They were made with gruyere and parmesan.  They were rich and just the perfect texture.Course 1: Pumpkin soup.  It was served in the smallest soup bowl ever.... along with the smallest spoon.  However, it had big flavor.  The spices were warming and the cream on top made for a smooth finish.Course 2: Celery and fennel salad with truffle oil and a goat cheese crouton.  Well I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but I was of this one.  It was smooth and  had scallions mixed into it. The shaved fennel and celery mixed will together and stayed in the background enough for the truffle oil to come through.Course 3: Mussels in a curry sauce.  This was a mild curry sauce, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this.  The curry was full of herbs, and the mussels were nicely presented in a ring around the sauce.Course 4: Some pork loin and guinea hen.  The hen was perfectly crispy on the outside with juicy meat inside.  I believe there was some goat cheese stuffed into the chicken.  The pork, possibly the most juicy pork I ever are.  I really do not know how to describe this any other way.  Oh, it was served with some creamy mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, and green beans.Course 5: one mini chocolate souffle, some melted frangellico chocolate, few biscotti, and butterscotch gelato.  Rich, creamy, chocolate heaven. I was happy with the meal from start to finish.  The service and food were both excellent
<review# 703,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/24/2011,12/14/2012,25,4,3,7,4>I'm fairly new to Evanston, but had only heard great things about this place from locals. So needless to say I was excited to get in with a last minute, same day appointment (the shop is appointment only). Plus, I remembered that it's right next door to Rollin' to Go--an awesome sandwich shop. Perfect afternoon outing.As others have mentioned, walking into the Noyes Street Barber Shop is like going back in time. From the neon lighting, old school barber chairs (Chicago built!) and Elvis playing on the 50s XM music channel, you definitely feel like Eisenhower is still President. But where in other places this would just be retro kitsch, here for some reason it feels authentic; it really works. The haircut itself was efficient, professional and seemed high quality. I was somewhat hoping to get one of the original proprietors, but the younger woman who cut my hair was great as well (if stoically silent). I will say that you should be sure to specify the length you want cut. I have a bad habit of not being detailed with my requirements and the cut ended up a little short. But otherwise it was very clean, and the hot lather shave at the end was a classy touch.On top of all that, you end up with a quality hair cut for 16 bucks (cash only). That's Great Clips territory for a much higher standard of quality. I can definitely see why this shop has so many regulars! I, for one, will be back.
<review# 704,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2012,12/13/2012,41,171,4,9,5>I decided to take Aerial Arts classes ever since Susan from S Factor would tell us how she would modify silk tricks to the pole.  Well, I can just say that S Factor definitely helped strength-wise for this class.  It's really fun and we did Spanish web and trapeze our first class.  The class consists of a 30 min warmup and then 30 min of aerial work.  We rotated among the 3 webs and high trapeze while waiting for our turn on the lower trapeze with the instructor.  For us true beginners, they taught us the spanish web climb.  Then on the trapeze, we learned the bird's nest, front angel, back angel.  It was a great strength workout.  I came out with a true appreciation for aerial artists. My upper back/upper calves are sore, and I think I'm in pretty decent shape.  If you want a way to work out your muscles and not realize it b/c you are having fun, try this class.  I would definitely recommend it.  There are men and women of all shapes, sizes, and ages in my class.  Come on in and embrace your inner aerialist!
<review# 705,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/7/2011,12/12/2012,8,15,3,5,3>Always busy at lunch time, Bluffington's Cafe is a great local place for food and sandwiches.  The reuben is absolutely one of my favorites - you won't be disappointed.  Make sure you ask for the potato salad instead of a bag of chips - it's homemade and I haven't had potato salad that good in years.  Very much a neighborhood place with an English decor, you can't help but feel you're having lunch at a friends house.  Outdoor seating in the summer too.  Love it!
<review# 706,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2012,12/11/2012,33,194,1,3,3>I was pleasantly surprised at our lunch experience here. After seeing all the free coffee coupons for every time we buys something at ABT, we finally decided to stop in for lunch. The first thing I noticed was how much bigger it was than I imagined. They sat us immediately and found us a spot where we could sit with our stroller. They had a pretty varied menu. We opted for the ham and brie crepes and the pulled brisket flatbread panini. The flatbread panini was softer than I expected. Not crispy at all, but tasty and huge. The portion sizes were gigantic. Very surprised. This would be a great wintertime lunch. As it was, we ended up eating half and taking the rest home. I preferred the ham and brie crepe. I was happy to see that they were the triangular crepes and not the rolled kind. I describing the taste, I'm going to complement it in a way that may not actually sound too appetizing. It was like the best ham and cheese hot pocket you ever had. Seriously. If you ever liked ham and cheese hot pockets. Try this crepe and tell me I'm wrong. Also quite large. My only real criticism is that the coffee was a little skank. Not my cup of tea, or coffee in this case. Overall, I'd definitely come back to try the turkey burger or quiche next time.
<review# 707,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/29/2012,12/10/2012,220,174,6,6,5>Who wants to bring party trays to a gathering that does not hold the usual crudités?  Sashimi platters for parties are a find from this place.  The restaurant offers a variety of trays for a single customer up to party size trays feeding a hungry group.  Maki, sashimi, and hand rolls line the pictures above the order counter and sushi chef station. The store front sits on the north side of busy Dempster street. The store itself has 3-4 tables for diners but this is mostly an order and pick up place.  Each time I have ordered I have been asked if I need my platter with ice to keep my order cool.  This request is very helpful on hot summer days.The sashimi tray had a variety of fresh white fish, red snapper, a type of clam, salmon, and a fattier version of salmon.  Accompanying chop sticks, wasabi, ginger, and soy sauce made the whole tray a party hit.  Each and every time the sashimi tray arrives to the party it is one of the first things to be finished.  Parking sits on the street of Marmora and also behind the store front.  I believe you can also walk through the store from the back.  I have never done this, but see some patrons accessing the store from the back.  Like some reviews, if you blink, you may miss the place. There are other Korean stores and acupuncture, manicure businesses next door.  Place an order, have your eyebrows threaded at Maria's and your tray will be ready for pick up.
<review# 708,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/31/2012,12/9/2012,2,62,5,4,3>This is a really great public library.  A few people have asked me if I'm a Northwestern student.  It's hilarious because I actually went to the "rival school" where people in the area will only approach you if they have a gun and need a few more quarters to buy chapstick.  It's tempting to lie to the Evanstonians just so I can pretend to be a Northwestern student, but that might be taking a step backwards.  I'll give up my obsession with being a secret agent and move on to the review...The library reminds me of the Harvard campus buildings I'd see in 2005.  Parts of downtown Evanston actually remind me of Cambridge.  There weren't too many hardcore bikers running behind me to get to the door or 60-and-still-single chain smokers puffing at my face as I climbed the steps.  The inside of the library was clean.  It's pretty organized, the staff is always willing to help you out, and there is almost always space for you to park yourself and focus.  If there isn't a title/item at the library, you have access to a nifty inter-library system.  For being a suburban library, I'm surprised that this is rarely an issue.  There are lots of Cd's at this branch as well. The only slight negative would be the annoying soccer moms who feel that they own the library.  Stop talking on your cell phones and discipline your annoying little brats.  I don't blame the library for hesitating to confront these egomaniacs.  Some of them are quite scary...
<review# 709,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2012,12/8/2012,49,74,2,5,4>My wife and I are now frequent diners of Mrs. D's and if we could, we'd probably eat here every weekend... Actually, there's nothing really keeping us from eating here every weekend, so I'm not really sure why we don't. We've only been here for breakfast so I can't comment on anything outside of that, but all of the breakfast food is delicious. Everything from corned beef hash, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, toast.... whatever, you name it, it's delicious. The staff is friendly and prompt, and Mrs. D herself can be found behind the bar on most days as well. There are only 2 very, very small complaints that I have, and one of them is absolutely ridiculous, I feel like an idiot even mentioning it... but here goes (please don't hurt me Mrs. D)... The larger plates spin too much, ha! Whenever I order pancakes and eggs, it comes on a larger plate, but every time you go to cut into the food, the plates spins around. Like I said, it's a trivial complaint and has absolutely no bearing on whether or not I (or you) would eat here, I just thought I'd mention it and take away any credibility I may have gained on Yelp, ha!. My other complaint is slightly bigger and, based on other reviews, I'm not the only one who doesn't like this... the syrup comes in disposable packages. It's single serve, packaged syrup... Why would you do this to such amazing pancakes? So other than those 2 minor complaints, all of the food is great here, the staff is awesome and it's so close to our home that we could theoretically come here every weekend if we wanted... I just have to convince the wife that the eggs in the fridge have gone bad and we have no choice...
<review# 710,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2012,12/7/2012,206,413,3,5,4>Jets pizza is very very interesting. It was quite surprising to me when I looked at their menu and saw like 10 different options for crusts. Personally I love me a spicy veggie pizza. I love giardiniera and saw a cajun crust option. So I thought this crust would have a cajun flavor and be spicy. Instead it turned out to be spicy and salty. Not just a little salty but enough to turn my mouth into a desert. However the crust does not make up all of the pizza experience at jets.They do have a deep dish option and it is pretty cheap. To get a medium or a large pizza is additionally not very expensive at all, given the size they indicated. What I did find a little bit funky about this is that the pizzas are rectangular. Not those "family sized" tiny slices but significantly bigger.  I don't think that the average person would probably have more than 2 or 3 squares.So basically avoid the cajun crust and go with the deep dish for stuffed or whatever they call it and I think you will be able to get a decent pizza for the money. It was a little bit greasy but the cover they put under the pizza take care of any worries about grease.
<review# 711,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2012,12/6/2012,20,82,3,6,6>I've been driving by this place since I moved here a couple years ago and can't believe I didn't stop in until today.  Rock House Coffee Bar and Roaster rocks!   I saw the live music signs for Live music and then realized this was a coffee shop, I just had to drop in to check the place out and grab a drink to go.  I was impressed by the range of teas that they offered and that they roast their own coffee beans.    The Chai Latte I ordered was not made with a premade mix - it was steeped while I waited and then frothing hot milk was added.  One of the best Chai's I've ever had!  Above the Coffee Bar is a music school.  The Coffee bar definitely follows that theme with guitars, mandolins and ukuleles hanging throughout hte space for sale.  They also have live music - typically on Friday and Saturday night.   Only complaint would be the tables/chair setup didn't look very accommodating or well arranged.  But I shouldn't complain since I haven't sat down for table service yet.Great place - I'll be stopping in to hangout and have a coffee or chai!
<review# 712,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/17/2012,12/5/2012,33,145,3,4,2>Just what Evanston needs!  Great addition to downtown Evanston. I had the chance to go during the second weekend.  Keep in mind if you are venturing up from the city, that Evanston is an early dining town. We walked in at 6:30 and the joint was packed. So we were able to snag two seats at the bar. Three bartenders on duty and they were all swamped. Took a while to get a drink order. I even asked what bourbons they had on hand and it was like I had just thrown a curve ball at the bar keep. If a bar is going to stock only the artsy/small distillery products then they need to be knowledgeable on what they serve. Just my two cents. After 30 minutes we were seated. The food is mainly featured as a sharing type of dish. There are a few (like 3) entrees on the menu that are intended for one, but for the most part you order and share the plates. We ordered: frites, arugula/parm flat bread, fried oyster tacos, lamb meatballs, and brussel sprouts. The sprouts and lamb balls were the two best that we tried. Great spice on the sprouts. All in all, great new spot with cool decor and vibe. They still need to work on a few kinks, but 10 days in and they were running pretty good. I personally prefer The Cellar in Evanston as the beer selection and food are a tad better. It's great to welcome Found to the E-town hood. Hopefully, this will lead to more restaurants of this caliber opening in Evanston!

Justin was more than helpful with us as we debated what type of tank to get, discussed rocks, and aquarium decorations. He truly have us a good 20 minutes of his time and was very patient. It was obvious that he is passionate about his job and enjoys what he does. He made reasonable recommendations and did not try to oversell us on anything. He listened to our needs and made suggestions accordingly. Needless to say, the kids are getting an awesome aquarium for Xmas. I look forward to going back as the size of our fish family grows.
<review# 716,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2012,12/1/2012,419,399,3,5,3>One of my favorite gelato places around, love the adorable location in the Glen, love the cuteness of the place that reminds me of one of the little gelato shops we went to in Florence. I love the little adorable colored cups they give you to put the gelato in and I love the nice staff that always lets us try several flavors before settling on my favorite one...And the winner, yesterday and for always will be the Ferrero Rocher chocolately hazelnut goodness that is OH EM GEE uhh-mayy-zzingg! I'm getting hungry just thinking about that flavor..It's got my two favorite things in one, gelato mixed with that golden wrapped, incredible chocolate candy. Whoever thought of it, and I'm assuming the owner is a genius. I do think the place is a little pricey but at the same time, it's worth the money, and I also like the fact that in a small they give you two flavors to try in one cup and my husband always gets like coffee mixed in with fruti de bosca (which is like a berry sorbet, also very refreshing and delicious). I can't vouch for the sandwiches or salads but if they are as good as the gelato, I may have to bump up this place to 5 stars!! A summer staple of ours :)
<review# 717,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2012,11/30/2012,42,32,2,8,4>I am absolutely in love with milk tea, but was never able to locate a great milk tea place until I visited Liquid Fusion. I am not a connoisseur by any means, but ever since drinking milk tea from Taiwan and New York, my taste buds have been unhappy with the milk tea available from Joy Yee's.My visit to Liquid Fusion was amazing. I've visited several times since (admittedly, even driven quite a distance to fulfill my bubble tea craving), and the trips are worth it. I have never tried anything aside from their milk teas; I've had a sip of the strawberry dream, and while it was good, in my opinion, one of the unique things about this place is their milk tea.People who enjoy something sweet, but not too over-the-top may try the "House" Milk Tea, which is milk tea without any added flavoring. My go to is the Jasmine Milk Tea, which has a unique and sweeter taste and is an option which I've found to be rarer in the Chicagoland suburbs. For those who have found their drink to be unsatisfactory, remember stir your drink (or flip it up and down) when you receive your order to ensure that everything is properly mixed :)I'm surprised that people complain about their boba. I found the texture and firmness of the boba to be one of the pluses of this place.In short, if this is your first time trying Liquid Fusion and you are a fan of milk tea, I highly recommend trying theirs. For a location in the suburbs, their options are definitely unique and will offer a taste of something not available in many locations.

They were also generous with almonds!  I love downtown Evanson, so with the warm Summer days here, Andy's is just another reason to make a trek out here.
<review# 721,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2012,11/26/2012,5,14,6,6,3>Doesn't get better than this. Real neighborhood "diner" feel. Place has hardcore following in Deerfield, some meet as part of daily routine. Kids...can be loud - who cares? Food is made well (with a nod to healthier choices), and is fabulously delicious. Even better, the owner Kevin Quigly (involved in theater when younger) swoops down on your table as though you were old friends or family. He's clever, savvy, makes recommendations, and is bound to make you smile. There are times you want to stop in not simply for the food, but also a dose of Kevin's warmth and class, a smile, a sincere greeting and kill a bit of time "schmoozing" with Kevin. Hard to describe the experience, and that's what it is, a dining experience, one that will likely make you a regular - unless you've no sense of humour, dislike delicious food, and are wired so tightly, a few kids screaming will ruin your morning. Highly recommended by my wife and I, including our 20 year-old daughter Carly and son, Zach, currently a senior at HPHS. Hip as it gets.Ron & Belle Kolman

I agree with people in saying that this place does have a hip and unique vibe to it. I am very glad to know that I have a place to study now other than the starbucks in the surrounding area. The Staff are friendly and amiable. I really love the design of their website too: brotherskcoffee.com/BROS. It also looks like they're doing a lot more than just serving coffee and tea. They're thinking about the question: "What is the brothers K experience?" This will serve as my pleasure reading and studies spot for the remainder of my year in Evanston

<review# 725,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2012,11/21/2012,18,256,1,4,5>A fun eclectic shop, with real local owners!  They have a great selection of beads, jewelry, and all sorts of unique items from around the world.       I have fond memories of this store, it was one of the first stores I went to when I arrived in the Chicago area.  Still think it's a lot of fun to come here.  If you need a unique gift for someone, this is good place to check out, they have stuff in every price range.
<review# 726,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/29/2012,11/20/2012,180,1540,2,3,4>After finding a great deal for a set of classes here from Groupon ($20 for 5 classes but I had a $5 credit), I was psyched to try it out at Revolution Spin and I have to say that I'm hooked!I started off with the Level 1 class with Adam and 10 minutes in, my thighs were already burning and I kept thinking if this was a smart decision.  However, Adam's sense of humor and great music selection kept me going.  Before I realized it, we had finished 60 minutes and all my muscles were past the point of burning and I had really pushed myself to my limits.  What a fabulous experience and I'm registered for the next class already!They have cubbies for you to put your stuff in, bottled water that you can buy for $1 or bring your own water bottle and fill up at their cooler.
<review# 727,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/23/2012,11/19/2012,52,196,2,6,4>I had been anticipating this place opening for a while now, and it's definitely delivered.  You can't really go wrong when it comes to Oberweis Ice Cream.  Had to wait a little to get someone at the counter to take my order, I think the service staff is still trying to get into their groove.  I had the butter pecan ice cream with the seasonal pumpkin ice cream.  So creamy & delicious.Besides the ice cream they also have refrigerators of their dairy products for sale as well.  The Oberweis store itself is located in the same building as That Burger Joint.  It was a little strange coming in just for ice cream and then smelling meat being cooked as I was waiting for the ice cream, but thankfully I was able to eat my ice cream far away from the beef smell.Great ice cream, plenty of flavors, glad to have this place in the neighborhood!
<review# 728,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2012,11/18/2012,90,300,3,5,4>There is a surprising lack of small, independent bookstores in Evanston, and while i do shop at B&N, sometimes i want to go an a treasure hunt. Market Fresh is great for picking up deals and interesting reads. I got 2 Stephen King books for .99 each, and a few other titles, all for less than $10. It's a good compliment to the big chain down the street, coupled with the library.
<review# 729,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2012,11/17/2012,57,93,2,5,4>Amazing food! I've read yelp reviews before heading over to the restaurant and was a little bit nervous about having it be over-hyped.  The food here is no joke. I was very surprised at how delicious each and every dish we ordered was and how quickly the orders came out.  We only ordered 3 dishes (for 3 people).  Previous reviews said the portion sizes are small but they were sufficient enough for us.  Here's what we ordered:Calabaza: acorn squash, wild mushroom risotto, chile de árbol, truffle oil - DEEEELICIOUS and highly recommend you don't leave without trying thisAsada:skirt steak, tomatoes, chipotle-goat cheese, yuca frites, chimichurri-also very tasty.  we ordered medium-rare and it was little bit on the tougher side but still enjoyed every last bite of it.  It comes with crispy yuca frites on top of the asada which were also fun to eat.Pastel de Cangrejo:jumbo lump crab cake, jalapeño-cucumber-avocado relish,jalapeño aioli-yummy...although it was my least favorite of the 3. still very delicious! The downside to the restaurant is their prices.  I don't know how often I can treat myself to Libertad with the prices.  However, the food is amazing and a great spot for a date or celebration.  I was very pleased with the quality of the food, the speed of the service and would definitely go back there again!
<review# 730,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/22/2012,11/16/2012,29,98,1,6,4>This place took over the space that Rollin' to Go had its catering business in, which leaves a part of me sad, because RTG moving out caused the demise of their delicious, spicy house chips.That aside, I really liked this place. The owner/operators are friendly and they usually have 3-4 different types available. They warm your slice in the oven which is a necessary but often neglected step at by-the-slice joints. I asked about the italian ice flavors and they offered to let me try all of them first! I ended up with the lemon. Their watermelon tastes just like watermelon, not artificial garbage. The ices happily take up the place of the Gelato that went missing when Linz and Vail vacated the Coffee Lab spot a few years ago.I'd definitely go again -- I'm a sucker for by the slice. The pizza I got (vegetarian) had garlic and spinach in it and was really hearty between the crust and the sauce and the rest of the toppings. I wish they would do away with the styro-containers because it seems like overkill. I'd just take it on a paper plate! There is no indoor seating, but a few chairs outside and of course the park across the street.On the menu they have a few options, especially in the fried appetizers area, like poppers and mozz sticks and cheese fries. They also deliver. Will be back!
<review# 731,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2012,11/15/2012,23,203,3,3,3>My absolute favorite spot for tapas.  Classic, unpretentious and as authentic as you can get.  You know how they have swanky sushi places but you wonder why you keep on going to that one who doesn't try to charge you $20 for a fancy roll because after all, what you want is fresh sushi? Ok I'm babbling but my point is this place takes me back to España because it's simple yet romantic.  Classic dishes to try include tortilla española, queso de cabra, datiles con tocino, fritura de mariscos, and for dessert- plátano con helado! Try their specials and if you're an avocado fan, the avocados con cangrejo will teach you that avocados have more to offer than just bring smashed for guacamole!
<review# 732,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2012,11/14/2012,65,108,2,4,3>You take the gold medal BluFish! Hooray! I'm in Olympic mode & definitely think BluFish would take the lead in being the best Japanese in the suburbs. This is the sister restaurant of Sushi Ai in Palatine, but even though it came second in it's opening, it definitely comes first in quality. They have very similar menus, but for some reason, BluFish just tastes better.I can't believe I haven't written a review! Sorry BluFish! Because you really have done Japanese, fresh fish, and delicious options well. The decor is super chic for being in Northbrook & that's just the beginning. Whether you're there for lunch or dinner, you will love everything.The lunch specials just take the GOLD yet again for being the best out there. For $10-12 you can get yourself a over indulgent bento with your choice of chicken, beef, salmon, or ahi tuna (must-have!) which comes with sweet-n-sour chicken, a choice of spicy tuna or california roll, fried rice, and soup or salad. You heard it right...all of that for $10! And it's super well made with fresh fish! Who can beat that deal?? It's ssweeeeettt! They also have some sashimi or sushi roll specials for $12-15.For dinner, it only gets better. All their rolls are super tasty and you'll love them. You can get them half sized or full sized. A great option if you want to try a bunch! I'm especially a fan of the Spicy Tataki. Soft Shell crab and spicy tuna..yum!  I love super white tuna, but after finding out it's actually not tuna, but escolar (bottom feeder fish & bad for you!) I avoid it all. :T sad! But back to BluFish, all their appetizers are fab, but their Spicy tuna seaweed salad is the best. It's a bit pricey, but you're basicially getting perfectly spiced poke (hawaiian for tuna sashimi) and a really fresh tasting seaweed salad. GET IT! For my main entree, I always go for sashimi whether as a Chirashi bowl (assorted sashimi with sushi rice) or BluFish Don (your choice of fish with sushi rice). If you're not feeling the raw fish, definitely try out Bento #1 that comes with grilled salmon, shrimp & veggie tempura, spicy tuna roll, and fried rice. So those are my FAVS and I know you'll LOVE BluFish. :) Happy Eating!!
<review# 733,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2012,11/13/2012,43,121,5,4,3>The Silo is, surprisingly, a great place to eat American food. It is surprising though because there are many caveats to its dining experience.  First, Silo's curbside appeal is lacking: its parking lot looks like a mess of gravel and haphazardly-placed cars and the building is a freakin' barn and silo. I don't want to use the phrase "eye sore," but it's appropriate.Further exacerbating the situation is the restaurant's interior.  It looks like a barn.  The only really cool thing about the inside is the two-track miniature train encircling the middle of the restaurant.  My inner 5-year-old went nuts when I saw the trains.  My inner college-business-student went nuts when I saw real advertisements on said trains.  The last bad part of the dining experience is the drinking water: it tastes like run-off well water from Russell Brand's latrine.  Do yourself a favor and order a beer or soda.But once you get past all of those things, you'll find that the Silo has excellent food.  Their pan pizza is top-notch.  They actually have a lot of specialty pizzas; all the ones I've tried were excellent.  Their ribs are tender, although not incredibly tasty.  Their burgers really hit the spot.  And from what I've seen, their fold-over sandwiches are humongous.I really enjoy going to the Silo, especially for pizza -- just don't drink their water and have very low expectations of their wait service.
<review# 734,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/21/2012,11/12/2012,229,200,4,6,3>I always shop here for my fish.Hands down the freshest market to get your fish, hence the name "FRESH farms".When there is a good deal, salmon can be as cheap as $5.99/lb.Fruits and vegetables are definitely cheap here! Love rainier cherries when they are in season.Their homemade guac used to be $4.99 but it keeps rising... but i guess it beats whole food's homemade guac for $6.99.The family usually gets the three horse jasmin rice here when its on sale for $17.99.Even their eggs go on sale for $1/dozen!Those are my faves to get here.A couple of suggestions are to come early because no matter what day this place is always poppin, unless you already know the layout and just grab and go like me!
<review# 735,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2012,11/11/2012,168,197,4,6,2>I came here the other afternoon for a quick bite and found myself in a predicament deciding between Real Urban BBQ, Roti, and Tom & Eddie's.  I was leaning towards a burger at T & E's with a little reluctance to try Mediterranean food.  Well, I'm a fan after losing my Mediterranean food virginity...The place is extremely clean and the staff was super helpful.  While there isn't a huge menu, the stuff on it is intriguing.  I went for the Chicken Roti sandwich with tomato & cucumber salad, Sumac onions, cous cous, Spanish eggplant, Feta cheese, and Kalamata olives.What a great combination!  I'd definitely order it again but probably with the S'hug spicy sauce.  I'm a huge spice fan and should have gone that way but it was lunch after all and I couldn't drink with it!I'll definitely be back to try the pizzas or steak rotis.
<review# 736,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/25/2012,11/10/2012,82,219,3,5,4>This is becoming one of my favorite Chinese restaurants & by far the best I have ate at in Highland Park.  Even when I am not in the area I have driven 20 minutes with my friends just to eat here.  For being in Highland Park you would think the prices would be a little bit more expensive but their lunch specials are amazing.  You can get an entree that comes with a soup, eggroll & crab rangoon for under $10.  The food is absolutely delicious.  The Mongolian Beef is probably my favorite & their fried rice was awesome.  The staff was very friendly & they remember repeat customers.  The restaurant is nice & big & there is plenty of seating for their lunch & dinner crowds & you don't have to worry about waiting for a table.  The place is very clean as well.    Overall the service is good, the establishment is clean & the food is delicious.
<review# 737,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2012,11/9/2012,66,210,3,3,3>My fave lil ice cream joint!! Huge selection of toppings. Light, fresh tasting and airy ice cream... just eating the ice cream alone is yum. My fave is definitely the strawberry flavor burst- it's soft serve in a cone with ribbons of strawberry (or other flavors including blue raspberry, lemon or mango or like 10 other flavors) on the outside of the ice cream.  They have sundaes, shakes, splits- you name it, they probably have it.  They also have a low-cal version of their ice cream called "Glace" if you feel like you've splurged enough just by coming here... Beware, in the summer lines can get long and there will be people parked all jacked up on Harlem trying to get some of these cool sweet treats! Good thing we live within biking distance, so parking is not an issue!!
