<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/20/2014,11/24/2014,1,7,1,2,2>Delicious! I just had lunch there today with my mother. I had the chipotle brisket on sourdough with pasta salad as my side and my mom had the taco salad. There was a 20 minute wait for food so I'd suggest calling ahead if you can but since I didn't, I sipped on an orange passion sweet tea which was super refreshing. This little place gets busy and now I know why! My sandwich was delicious and cheesy. Melt in your mouth kind of good. The brisket was expertly cooked with fantastic flavor. The chipotle flare was a perfect touch. I don't think that I came up for air the entire time. The pasta salad was delicious and simple, very creamy. I probably could have eaten a whole bowl of just that. The taco salad was comforting. The vegetables were fresh and then there was a "sloppy" component as a taco salad should be. Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone that has a big lunch appetite!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2014,11/23/2014,6,16,1,3,3>So close to my house which is great. Probably visit this place at least once a month. Service is friendly. Small and cute place. Never been disappointed with the sushi I order
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,11/22/2014,59,9,3,4,3>My husband wanted some pizza for dinner and we had our neighbors over. They suggested Roma's. We've never had their pizza before, so we decided to give it a try. We ordered a large half meat lovers/Hawaiian, and a medium cheese (for the kids). They said it would take about 20 mins. They don't have a delivery service, so we picked it up. Which was fine since it's not far from us. They have a new location, off of Old Perkins Rd (side street from Prairieville Walmart) same parking lot as Tommy's Fish House. They have a large opened eating area. My friend said it was way bigger then their last location. When we got there our pizzas weren't done yet so we waited a few short minutes, which was fine since the smell is delightful. The pizzas were huge! I'm not a fan of thin crust, but surprisingly it was very tasty. I had the Hawaiian and it was yummy! My husband said the meat lovers was pretty good too, not too much meat but just enough. Their prices seem right for the amount and quality you get. They also had specials but I didn't get a chance to take a picture. We will order from them again.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/16/2014,11/21/2014,1,19,1,3,3>Love this Place! I can only give 4 stars because I hate the lighting in this place :( and I was disappointed a Mexican restaurant did not serve Mexican coffee's. Really, I laughed myself to death when I had to tell the bartender how to make it; but we had a fun. :) The food is AWESOME and the plating was gorgeous. I had the Diablo Shrimp, outstanding! Stick to the Denham restaurant, we went to the Watson Papi's and it just did not compare. Service was not as friendly, food was not as good, drinks were terrible, the wait for food was horrendous, and the overall atmosphere was cramped. We will keep going to Denham Papi's; you have fans with us!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2014,11/20/2014,5,5,4,5,5>I have so much to say ab this place, so bare w me...I've heard a lot about this place from friends and thought it was too good to be true. I mean, all you can eat sushi for $25 is unheard of. Especially after years of going to places like ichiban and paying a crapload of money, and still being hungry. But when I went the other night w a few friends, I was blown away by the entire experience! So I'm giving this place 5 stars just bc I've never experienced anything as awesome as this. First of all, if you haven't gone yet.. Then GO!!! Second of all, there's this all you can eat sushi deal for ab $25. (The catch here is you have to finish everything or pay for each individual item that you do not finish.)Anyways, if u have a big appetite, it shouldn't be a problem. They have everything from sashimi to sushi to specialty rolls to soups (if that's what you're in the mood for). Also, dessert and drinks are all you can eat and drink as well! Of all we ordered (and we ordered a lot!) My favorites were the eel, the mango salmon rolls, and pretty much all the specialty rolls. For dessert my friends got chocolate and green tea ice cream! I got the strawberry w a couple rounds of deep fried Cheesecake!!! (Btw.. Who does that!? .. Who deep fries cheesecake!?!)Also I've got to give a major round of applause to the service here! The Service was amazing! They let me on their wifi for a fantasy football draft, and even took my friends phone to the back and charged it for her! Also more importantly they checked in w us often and pleasantly answered any questions I had. In conclusion, this place is #AmazeBalls!!! Please go check it out if you haven't already. I'll def be back soon!
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2014,11/19/2014,111,195,5,5,3>Credentials first.... Lived in Dallas, TX for 25 years, the capital of BBQ in the state of TX and have eaten at well over 30 BBQ places in TX and other states. I've also  written the first ever Jewish-Cajun cookbook and was raised in the deli business in NY.I am shocked at all of the bad reviews for this place. Maybe it's inconsistent, I don't know. All I can say is that this joint served up BBQ about as fine as any I've had in Texas.- Ribs - superior - tender and flavorful.- Chicken - Moist and delicious- Brisket - really excellent. Tender, lots of smoke flavor. Exceptional.- Potato salad - not bad at all. Homemade.- Onion rings - homemade and crispy.I would not believe for a second all of the people slamming this place. Examples - Peter N calls it Pull Pork. It's PULLED pork dude, and calling it pull pork shows you don't know the first thing about it... and the idiot who said that he didn't smell BBQ when he walked in needs to get his sense of smell examined, as it's evident that he doesn't have one.I am giving 2Pauls the fiver. easy.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2014,11/18/2014,110,62,1,2,3>This is one of my favorite places in town.  I should have posted a review before now.  Perhaps I was just waiting for one more stellar visit.  My friend and I went today!  Excellent service and excellent food!  Let me start by saying that David, our waiter, and Angela, at the bar, helped make this a memorable lunch.  The grapefruit sparkler, $7, is Angela's special creation and it is terrific!  She was kind enough to show me how it is made.  Thank you!  We started with the above cocktail and ordered the Boursin (sp?) cheese and crab soup and a wedge salad, sans bacon.  The soup was outstanding and the salad fresh and crisp.  The home made blue cheese dressing was spot on.  David, our waiter,  accommodated my friend's special request for an oyster platter with their great fries, as this was currently not on the menu. Don't you love a waiter who makes recommendations and knows the nuance of when to visit and talk?  I ordered the Juban burger with Havarti cheese and it did not disappoint.  Perfectly cooked to medium well and seasoned lightly, it boasted fabulous caramelized onions which were soft and sweet.  The bun had a slightly sweet flavor which was the perfect balance.  Thank for another wonderful visit.  Who knows?  Maybe one day I'll save room for dessert as there are several appealing items on that menu! ILove the ambiance as well, great for a date night, casual lunch or that special occasion!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,11/17/2014,23,43,1,5,4>O. M. G. Go here. Make a reservation and go here NOW!Outstanding food and amazing service. My partner and I went here to celebrate completion of my doctorate. Getting a loaf of their bread was a fantastic idea, one I highly recommend to anyone else going here. I could have ordered an entire loaf for dinner (with extra spreads) and been totally content. In addition to the bread, I had the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer, the Eggplant Seafood Napoleon for the main course, and a creme brulee for dessert. To drink, I ordered a French 75. All of it was amazing.  Like, out of this world amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better place to eat. I just wish I could afford it more often! :PFinally, once the waiter figured out WHY we were eating out, he gave us free chocolate mouse as a way to say, "congrats." Sweet man, was totally on the ball for the whole night as far as refilling drinks, taking orders, and bringing out food.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2014,11/16/2014,19,27,1,3,5>Cupcake Allie is DELICIOUS! I've had their peanut butter cupcakes, Mounds coconut cupcakes and their pumpkin spice cupcakes. They're always moist and delectable. If you're looking for cupcakes, you're in for a treat because I highly recommend this place!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2014,11/15/2014,92,45,1,3,4>I've boarded my dog here a few times. The staff is friendly. My dog gets to socialize with other dogs and gets taken out a lot during the day. I love how this business uses social media to share with owners the fun time their pets are having. They take photos and post them to their Facebook page and reply if you ask how your pet is doing.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2014,11/14/2014,2,5,1,3,4>This was my first time here and I have fell in LOVE! The Blue Velvet cake was AWESOME, with so much flavor. The cheesecakes are sooooo good! And it was my first time ever having a Macaron and I must say those cookies are the BEST! I recommend this bakery to everyone!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2014,11/13/2014,14,22,2,6,4>The location is great unless you are trying to get there and also leave during lunch traffic. I had a caesar salad with grilled chicken, and it was great. My buddy had the red beans and rice with Italian sausage and surprisingly, it was delicious! The few people we went with said they have all been there multiple times and that all of their dishes they have ever tried were great and never tasted a bad thing from there.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2014,11/12/2014,3,8,2,3,3>Very nice. Stumbled in the other day as I was killing some time while waiting for an oil change. Impressed by the selection. Almost any size, shape and flavor of donut,  danish or pastry filled the glass display case and even more behind the counter.  The person behind the counter was friendly as could be. We had a great talk about the selection and the history of the place which looked awesome with it's 50's diner themed decor.  Today was the first time I sampled the wares though. I had an apple fritter and a cup of coffee. Both met my approval. I dined inside and had a pleasant experience.  It's a Saturday. Donut time, I take it. Lots of friendly faces and happy people. I will keep this place on my agenda and you should too!
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/31/2014,11/11/2014,30,85,1,4,2>And finally a place where they get what taco's are supposed to be! Nothing big and fancy, just enough of good, delicious combination of flavors inspired apparently by not just traditional Mexican ingredients and flavors, but food from all different places all over the globe. And none of that rice and re-fried beans everyone puts on your plate to fill up space, with a ton of lettuce and sour cream... (ugh! I shiver when I think of that...) Their salsa and their guacamole are great, but this is a taco place, and as they should, they are the stars of the menu. One of this days I'm going to sit down and have one of each, but so far I love the Argentinian, The Homeboy (I have to have one every single time), the Jamaican Surf, and the fish Baja tacos; but I haven't tried them all yet. And they promise to keep adding new tacos to the menu which only makes it more exciting!And for the cherry on top, they are one of the two places I know that carry Estrella Damm, a Spanish beer a love, (nothing really fancy, I just happen to like it). And there is almost nothing better than a few tacos and an ice cold beer!!.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2014,11/10/2014,179,366,4,4,3>Been wanting to try this place out but never was able to catch them because of my work schedule.. finally had the time to catch the hype.  And the hype is real.  Easily one of my favorite spots around Lafayette now.  Their menu is pretty exciting, since places around Lafayette normally doesn't have food like this.. dare I say, it reminds me of a Cochon Butcher in NOLA?  Nevertheless, place is awesome, we had the following:- Chicken Skins - the deliciousness, crispiness, and saltiness makes this treat so much better, I can't stop eating them!- PCP Home Fries - shredded pork cheek pastrami & melted swiss - the flavors were so bold and delicious, just wish the fries were a tad bit crispier - Chop Block Melt Sammie - pork cheek pastrami, corned beef & smoked beef tongue, slaw, swiss & celery salt mayo - this sandwich is compact with so many elevation of flavors, very delicious- Porchetta Sammie - herb & garlic roasted crispy pork belly, onion jam, fried garlic greens, apple & spicy beer mustard - delicious pork belly with a array of flavors on one sandwich, one complaint I do have was that my pork belly wasn't crispy, but yet its still deliciousI can't wait to come here again for lunch!
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,11/9/2014,134,34,1,4,4>The service is very attentive, as well as the food. I remember the first time I ever called Nino's to make a reservation, I was trying to decide between Nino's or French Market Bistro based solely upon the wine menu for a date. I called and the hostess answered, and was very welcoming and warming and answered my questions about eh wine selection... and I asked if the food menu was good as well, and she responded "We have a great EVERYTHING menu!" and it made me laugh, and I reserved right away. The owner & chef often come out to personally check on the guest's experiences and opinions and accommodate to their needs. Everything is *authentic* Italian (please do not mistake olive garden for Italian food, people), and very FRESH and tasty! I could eat at Ninos everyday. By far the best Italian food in the city, even better than the well established, popular Ginos. The oatmeal cookies for dessert are to die for as well... deliciously gooey and topped with a raspberry sauce & homemade whip cream! The gulf shrimp pasta is incredible, especially if you ask for fresh basil & cracked pepper in it as well. The ciopinno... my god. that's all i can say... WOW! The broth is rich and fabulous, with the perfect amount of balance. Gotta love the homeamade sourdough bread as well, especially with the olive oil & parm dipping oil. The bar itself is kind of small, but the restaurant very intimately cozy, and even when the restaurant is full, it's not overwhelmingly loud. I am SUPER impressed by the quality of food, and how both Ninos & Oscars Pizza (same owners) are supporting the Slow Food movement in Baton Rouge - it is a dear organization close to my heart, and all about fresh, local food.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2014,11/8/2014,14,26,2,4,2>This is our companies unofficial cafeteria. It's right across the street and it's 90 seconds from our front door. They have a great menu, they're fast even when they're busy. It's a deli so they'll have the usual suspects, salad, po'boys (they're called hoagies elsewhere), hamburgers, etc. They have GREAT French Fries. They also have great deli sandwiches primarily due to the different varieties of fresh cut bread they serve it on. I always go for the marble rye. I must admit, if you are not a foodie like me you may not appreciate this as much. I like to try different things, however I was raised in a German household and rye bread is something I ate everyday. It's nice to be able to get a sandwich the way mom used to make it for lunch and usually for only around $5 or $6 most times. Now they do have one thing that no one else has and maybe for me no one else ever orders (and one of the reasons I'm on a diet right now at the time I'm writing this), is they have Liverwurst sandwiches for $5. Big thick slices with spicy mustard and lettuce. Sounds gross? If you eat cracklings (that's worse IMHO). We each have our own downfall. Too bad we can't get scrapple here (Google it). Anyway, great place for lunch, quick, fast and they have an Italian market with boutique Italian sodas, spirits, cheeses, meats, olive oil, etc. They also have prepackaged frozen dinners ready to go. While you may not do it everyday, it's nice to know it's there. They also sell wine. Here's a tip for anyone in a real hurry, if you know they're going to be busy at lunch or you're in a super big hurry while racing down the road and don't want fast food. Call ahead! Order it so it's there when you arrive. You pick it up at the cash register when you walk in. I can't tell you how many times I have called ahead and walked in and got my order and left in just a few minutes only to leave people standing there asking, how did you get your food so fast? Another tip is that they always have a special on the wall on the chalkboard behind the lunch counter register. They are notorious for having out of this world burgers that they think up that morning or whenever (sometime as an experiment?) and they're awesome. I always look there first before looking at the menu in which case I'd end up with the Liverwurst sandwich and a plate of fries. Hope that helps.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2014,11/7/2014,3,14,1,5,4>Meet a few friends to celebrate an important birthday.  The Rum House has such a lively atmosphere, a perfect location to hang out with friends. Enjoyed the oyster & scallop tacos.  Just loved the way the Caribbean flavors popped in every bite.Second visit in 2 days.  It was good yesterday I had to bring my husband. Drew had the Crab sandwich  and all I can say is AMAZING!!

<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/21/2014,11/5/2014,100,239,1,4,3>Little Saigon is just like the other Vietnamese restaurants around Sherwood Forest and Florida Boulevard, except that they seem to give you a lot of meat. I'm giving them five stars because of this. It's clean and the service is quick. I wouldn't say it's better than any other Vietnamese place, but it seems like you get more for the same price.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2014,11/4/2014,21,35,1,3,4>This is a great bar that few people know about. It's hard to find because the sign is so small but that's part of the intent!  (Just find Azteca's and go downstairs). The bar has a great dive feel but an upscale drink selection. No beers on tap but lots of great bottles at reasonable prices. Expect to see the owner Gary in there at least half the time and he's always chatting with customers. Most of the patrons are regulars and know the bartenders but they are friendly to visitors who are just passing through.  There are tv's, a cool digital jukebox, and darts to keep you entertained.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,11/3/2014,18,10,1,4,4>Go there. Get kolaches. Eat them up. Repeat tomorrow. The only thing that would improve the fast, super-friendly service at this spot would be a front door delivery every morning at 7:15 am. I get a genuinely warm reception each and every time I walk through the door of this location. The staff is kind and altogether attentive to every customer, remembering their regulars well. The donuts are amazing and almost always hot, but the kolaches....oh, the jalapeño kolaches. This is a must-have. Get there before 9:00 am for a fresh croissant wrapped sausage with cheese and jalapeño goodness. Yeah, it's what's for breakfast! Bonus: they serve Community Coffee.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2014,11/2/2014,124,131,3,5,5>Best burger I have had in BR so far! Gotta admit, there are still a few spots on my burger "to do" list, but I absolutely loved my Fat Cow experience. I had the Smoke Stack with yummy cheddar, bacon, BBQ, and onion straws--and sampled the husband's 120 burger with  bacon, gruyere, arugula, and horseradish sauce. While I preferred mine to his, both were juicy and awesome, and I am definitely planning to head back and try the other specialty burgers. We also split the duck fat fries and onion straws, which did leave us wasting huge portions, but totally satisfied, as both were pure  perfection! Of course, our daughter loved her Cookies and Cream shake, too. Overall, nothing we didn't adore. A new fave!
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2014,11/1/2014,8,17,1,5,5>"Hands down the best and most authentic Lebanese food in Baton Rouge. Perhaps the best I have ever had.

<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2014,10/31/2014,2,17,2,3,3>I've been going to this dentistry ever since I was a little girl and it is one of the best we have in Louisiana. The staff are very friendly, helpful and lenient on if you are 15 -20 minutes late. Dr. Michael Rabel is an excellent dentist that is very thorough, precise and knowledgeable. Very quick cleaning check up as well. Typical routine consist of xray, checkup, and cleaning if you don't have any dental problems then you go home with a nice little bag of goodies (toothbrush, toothpaste and floss). It is very clean, the clinic is getting remodel and expanding so I can't wait to see it complete! Offers services to all ages too.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2014,10/30/2014,39,40,4,4,4>Love, love, love this cafe and cannot wait to return. I grew up in the surrounding area and am first of all super impressed with how this area of Baton Rouge has blossomed into a unique restaurant lover strip. First of all the appearance was very casual and cozy. Outdoor seating and plenty indoor with a coffee trip feel. Definitely appropriate with the close proximity to LSU. I would have adored this place in college before I moved to the other side of town.Service was friendly, and food made right in front of you, which is always exciting. I ordered the paleo special, which I had no idea what they event meant. They asked me if I ever tried it, then explained it very well. I decided to be adventurous and get it a whirl.  So glad I did!The paleo special of the day was an open faced sandwich with turkey, fig jam, pear, and arugula on a homemade paleo bread. I'm actually posting weeks after I ordered it, and my mouth is still salivating. I must go back there soon, and if they don't have that special, no worries because the menu had lots of delicious options.Definite 5 star review, and I can't wait to return with a friend :-)
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2014,10/29/2014,16,60,2,7,5>The owner of Zoroona messaged me on Yelp noting that I liked Mediterranean food and that I should check out his new spot.  When I walked in, I was surprised to see how nice the interior decor is.  They bring a rosemary bread to the table, which is awwwsome!  I ordered the Zoroona Chicken, lentil soup, and grape leaves.  All of it was very tasty, which means I will have to return and see what else they have to offer.  I have my eye on the lamb.If you want a change of routine from Albasha or Roman's, give this place a shot.  I'm glad I found a place to put in rotation with Zorba's, since my pocket book was getting upset with me.

Tabouli is good, but once I ordered moussaka as a side.  It was not good nor resembled the moussaka  I've had before.  Serope's is a great healthy alternative to much of Perkins Rowe.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/21/2014,10/26/2014,25,31,2,3,3>This is a truly local toy store that has been in business for 30 years!   It's in a victorian house in mid city.   They make the most of their small space, so yes, its filled from floor to ceiling with toys and games.  Nicely organized into boys, dress up, art, dolls, girls, bath/water, games/animals, baby etc... each has its own space.  The prices are high (hence not the 5 stars), but the experience makes up for it if you can afford it.  Everyone is so nice.  They carry unique things and common things, and they wrap !!!!  Even at Christmas and they make the prettiest easter baskets in town.  I'm always wowed at how they put it together.  I've seen so many local stores close, this is the only one left.  Or else you are left with the dreaded big box stores or online.   I do also shop online but I never price check.  If they help me pick something out, I buy from them.  They don't have everything but you are sure to have a great experience here.

My family loves the boudin balls and the boudin stuffed chickens. Everything looks and smells so good in this place!
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2014,10/23/2014,19,36,2,4,3>Although it's off the beaten path, this place is pretty sweet! As I searched for a new lunch spot near my office I came across this spot. It is small, quaint, and quiet. The quality of the food was just a bonus. The food was fresh and well seasoned. I could tell that it was made with great intentions! I will most definitely visit this spot several more times!
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2014,10/22/2014,1,5,2,2,2>This Plantation Home is absolutely Gorgeous!! The Bed & Breakfast Inn was very quiet & nice (you do not stay in the Plantation house, but a little Inn built just across the pond). Our Breakfast was very tasteful & loved our tour of the home, which was given by the daughter of the current owner, whom was raised in the home. She was very nice & and her passion for her home really showed, not a memorized tour speech at all. Loved our stay!!!**The only reason that I did not give it a 5, is because the Inn needs a little updating & maintenance. Our AC unit seemed to be struggling, some lamps did not work, and the room had a "musty" smell, similar to a log cabin, but overall a nice, roomy place.

Would love to come back on another night for a proper dinner!

Very clean establishment
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/15/2014,10/18/2014,66,126,1,4,3>Stroube's is, unfortunately, a place I don't always have top of mind, but when I do make it downtown I always wonder why I don't eat here more often.  Their steaks are cooked perfectly.  The last time I was here they had a cream of artichoke soup that was one of the best soups I've ever eaten.  The seasoning was slightly spicy but still had that great artichoke flavor too.  I've had the duck here and I would give it an 8.  The skin could have been rendered a little more but the meat was cooked to a very beautiful medium rare.  This restaurant is worth the drive downtown....now, if I could only get a ride home.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2014,10/17/2014,37,137,2,2,2>Nice neighborhood coffee shop with free wifi and plenty of seating spaces both indoors and outdoors. I usually get the medium sized coffee or the latte and I've never been disappointed. They have a bunch of baked goodies too but I've never tried those. Good location, and they have additional parking near Coyote Moon. I wish they'd start a small breakfast menu sometime...it looks like the kind of place that should serve breakfast too :)
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2014,10/16/2014,19,23,2,2,2>When I am home, I have to stop and get a  shrimp basket with homemade onion rings! Their fried chicken is the bomb! Actually anything off the menu is great! I don't eat liver and gizzards but I have heard they were the best thing here. If you are passing through Opelousas, you have to stop.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,10/15/2014,1,9,1,2,2>Everything was great.I came here on a first date a couple weekends ago and this place was a last minute pick. She really wanted pizza and being from up north, I know a good pie down here is rare. We gave it a shot and were rewarded with good food and service.The atmosphere was nice. It's a laid back sports themed restaurant with a nice little bar. We took the booth in the back with the little flat screen at the edge of the table so we could watch the baseball game.The caprese salad was Amazing! The mozzarella was some of the best I've ever had. We split a margherita pizza and a goat pizza with goat cheese and balsamic vinegar. Obviously we had to take some home. We topped it off with some strawberry shortcake ice cream, which was maybe the best decision of the night.We were enjoying ourselves so much and didn't realize that we had been sitting there an hour and a half past closing! The young staff was so courteous and kind that we had no idea. I tipped them well.The date was a big success thanks to the food and staff of Oscars so I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for good eats and chill vibes.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2014,10/14/2014,13,11,1,5,3>Don't be misjudged on the outside of the restaurant even though it does not look appealing. They have two different menus for Chinese and Japanese food. I HIGHLY recommend ordering the Chinese food only because it is the best Chinese food I had in Baton Rouge. The service was decent and the pricing is cheap and affordable. Will be back here again.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2014,10/13/2014,0,4,1,1,1>Fantastic atmosphere and food, I think it's best enjoyed in larger groups but no matter what the food is going to be great and our srver, I'm sorry I can't remember his name, was professional and attentive. I would highly recommend this place.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,10/12/2014,6,5,3,2,2>Best view in town! Fantastic place to take out of town guests. Beautiful spot!!! Sushi is great, especially after they expanded the menu recently. Start with the eggplant miso appetizer. The Lava Roll, the Cupcake Roll, and the Green Monster are MUST HAVES. The entrees look great, but I love sushi too much to not get sushi! Thank me later. For dessert, the chocolate tsunami or whatever it is called is also a must have. Be sure to get reservations and ask for a window table, or if the weather is nice, an outside table.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/7/2014,10/11/2014,1,16,2,3,3>Great little lunch spot. The service is friendly and efficient, and the food consistently delicious. It can get pretty busy, but the line moves quickly. I know Serop's tends to be the "go-to" for take out Greek food downtown, but I think this place is way better. Their prices are much better as well. Definitely try the Fatoush salad, which is topped with their cucumber salad. While I prefer the gyro, the chicken is always moist and good too.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2014,10/10/2014,2,38,1,2,2>I believe it is best, when ordering smoked or BBQ meats, to have it "Dry", i.e., no BBQ sauce. That way you can taste the meat and THEN you can say it was good bbq or not. Getting that out of the way, my wife, daughter and myself all had the Fulton Street ribs, AWESOME. The service, her name was Lele, was awesome.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,10/9/2014,19,43,1,3,4>I have semi-high standards for Italian food, and I love Monjuni's. The red sauce is delicious, and luckily, they sell it in jars! Portions are generous, but I always wish I had more leftovers. The restaurant has a nice ambiance, and I usually can't say no to their cheesecake.This review would be five stars if based entirely on the food, but I've had a couple inattentive servers at Monjuni's. Not even close to a dealbreaker, but something to consider if you're on a schedule.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2013,10/8/2014,2,3,2,6,3>Ethel's Snack Shack serves food that can only be described as sublime. It is the best southern cooking I have ever eaten.The meat falls off the bone. You don't need a knife, and they don't bring you one  The red beans and the rice are perfect. The cornbread muffin melts  in your mouth. The green beans are firm yet fully cooked the broccoli is the same It is all perfect. The place is small, very clean, informal, quiet, and very pleasant. It is a hidden  And very inexpensive A succulent large smothered pork chop with the two included sides which for me were red beans/rice and green beans was a mere $8.75. Incredible . Plus the waitress Carol was incredibly nice and efficient plus the service was fast Worth the 20 minute drive from downtown Baton Rouge. Run don't walk to Ethel's Snack Shack you will love it if you like great southern cooking . If you haven't had southern cooking, Ethel's will make you a devoted fan of it.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,10/7/2014,22,50,1,3,3>The sugar cookie was always safe around me or in my house because no one liked sugar cookies and they just aren't worth the calories...until now. These are not your typical dry, no flavor, gritty sugar cookie...no ma'am. This is the most delicious, flavorful, melt in your mouth cookie you're going to find. Oh my, I could eat my weight in these delicious morsels. And if you like king cake, try their king cake cookies..better than the real thing, no kidding. Their designs are adorable and they can also customize with your business logo. What a great way to promote yourself or your business.  And they seem to be the new "it" thing for wedding favors. They also have AMAZING pecan brittle, fudge, and salted caramel topping which is to die for. There is no storefront yet so you have to order online or by phone and/or they will ship. This is an absolute must try...seriously.
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,10/6/2014,5,50,1,3,3>Absolutely the best Greek food in town! The atmosphere is warm and intimate. The staff bends over to help you. Our favorite is the combination plate. The portions are so big it's great to split. Baba Ghanouj is addictive et good. Can't get enough of this place.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2014,10/5/2014,16,11,2,3,3>Nine Dragon serves excellent, fresh Chinese food.  They have a good variety of options to choose from.  You get your choice of rice or noodles and 3 other choices plus a drink for around $7.  My husband and I can eat there for less than $15.

<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2014,10/2/2014,8,33,,3,3>We tried out Hello Sushi for Restaurant Week and were not disappointed! You can't beat $20 for 3 courses. For appetizer, I got the crabcakes and my husband got the Vietnamese eggrolls. Both were good. The star of the meal was by far the 2nd course! I had the Who Dat roll and he had the Cajun roll. Wow! They were both so delicious. For dessert, my husband had the fried cheesecake and I had the cake balls. To be honest, I was already so full that I barely touched my dessert. What I did eat was rich and satisfying. My husband loved his. He's a cheesecake fanatic so he was very happy to get his fix.Overall, we had a great experience at Hello Sushi and we'll definitely be returning. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very attentive. I highly recommend taking advantage of the Restaurant Week menu soon!
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/11/2014,10/1/2014,5,39,3,4,3>Love the atmosphere, beer selection, and food.  I've been here several times and I've never left less than absolutely satisfied.  They have a great selection of beers on tap.  I've tried their burgers and fried gator poboy, all of which were good.  The atmosphere is great for the 20-30 something crowd.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,9/30/2014,19,9,2,3,3>As I sit here and eat this Carolina Red Slaw BBQ I am forcing myself to write this review between bites. This sammich is amazing. The meals are all fine and dandy but what gives this place a 5-Star rating is some of the best bread pudding around.
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2014,9/29/2014,0,6,2,3,3>Excellent selection and customer service! Only reason not 5 stars is the price. If you are looking for a hard to find spice, they will have it. I recommend the Pecan BBQ rub.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2014,9/28/2014,5,51,1,2,3>Another reviewer described Fleur de Lis as "dark and divey" and I'd say I agree. If you are looking for a well lit Chuckee Cheese then you're in the wrong place.  It's "divey" but it's clean, and the staff is well-mannered despite what I've read here. Been going there many years and no one's ever been rude; slow perhaps, but not rude. Again, it's the nature of the "beast" - if you want a different experience then go elsewhere.This place has been making award winning pizzas in the Baton Rouge area for longer than I've been alive. The "Around the World" with anchovies is my favourite and a large is just about enough for two people. This is thin crust "Sicilian" style pizza and NOT what you will get at Pizza Hut or Domino's. It's rectangular, not round... thin and somewhat crispy.There is only a single dining room and the space is PACKED with chairs and tables. Large groups (over 8 people) will OFTEN have to wait for enough tables to empty out and be put together if they all want to sit together. AGAIN, if that irks you in some way then get over it or go somewhere else. The service isn't the "lightning fast" expectation of modern America; not at rush times like lunch or dinner. Your pizza isn't constructed in advance, cooked and waiting in a warmer oven for you to walk in like Little Cesears, It's cooked once you order it and.even if NOBODY else has an order in before you it's going to take 15 to 20 minutes for it to be prepared and to properly cook. Again, if you're impatient then go somewhere else.As for me and my friends, we understand and appreciate that part of the experience that is Fleur de Lis is that it IS an experience, not just a meal. Maybe it's not the sort of thing some people appreciate, but that's to be expected - not everybody wants to wait or finds dark and old to be interesting. They sure must be doing something right though - just check 225 magazine etc. and you will find them "Best Pizza in Town" if not every year then quite often.  As far as "dirty," I suggest people who think that check with the city's restaurant inspection listings - I don't think you'll find any violations... so that's just not the case. If it were there'd be health code violations listed.So, all in all... don't diss mah favourite pizza place! Very BUSY place! Kick back and RELAX! Your server isn't ignoring you, she just has eight other tables of people just as hungry and demanding to deal with.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2013,9/27/2014,74,83,1,6,3>I have become a massage addict due to Vida Pura Spa. Rebecca does an amazing job with lots of little extra touches, like hot stones, essential oils, etc. She may be small, but she is seriously strong and can work out even the worst knots in my shoulders and back. The hour massage is definitely the way to go, but if you only have a time for 30 minutes, the shoulder and back massage is pretty awesome too. "Like" her on Facebook to keep up with her promotions -- her spa does facials, mud wraps, etc. as well, but really, the massage is KEY.Tip: Her spa is a *little* bit difficult to find -- the best way to go is down Siegen away from i10 and taking a right at its intersection with Airline Hwy onto the frontage road.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2013,9/26/2014,23,18,2,5,4>Expensive, but worth it.The food here is beyond heavenly and perfect. I didn't have ANY problem with ANYTHING I tasted.I had seafood ravioli and I could have eaten five more plates of it. It was superb.You can't go wrong with anything you get here.My only bad note is that the atmosphere was awkwardly dark and quiet. I didn't want to say anything because I knew that everyone could hear me. But the food made up for that. :)Highly recommended.

Its usually quiet, casual, and the cheesecake is also delicious! Wish they included less carbs and more greens in their plate servings though.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2014,9/24/2014,24,19,5,5,3>So like most people, my friends and I saw the show that this restaurant was on. So we thought, "How cool! A restaurant in our town! Yay Baton Rouge pride!" So we went during lunch one afternoon to see what the hype was about. I will say first that it was some of the best pizza I've ever had. However, the way my friends and I were treated makes me fearful to ever go back. We were greeted by a cashier and the man who owns the place. The owner started questioning us as to why we're were even there. The questioning slowly turned to interrogation. He seemed angry when we told him we saw the show. Then he went on a rant defending himself. All the while the cashier was asking what we wanted and giving suggestions. There was so much going on I had to leave the situation just so I could read the menu. I learned later that the owner had insulted one of my friends (who hadn't even seen the show) telling her she should stop trusting what she sees on tv and basically telling her she was stupid for reading into things! I don't know what was worse, the ranting owner or the cashier that kept interrupting him and rolling her eyes. It looked like no one respected this man, and he's the owner! Once I finally was able to read the menu and decide what I wanted I came to find out that they were out of most things. This started another rant about how they are so busy because of the show that they run out of things or they don't have time to make them fast enough. The cashier even told us that the owner was supposed to be making meatballs instead of lecturing us! Good grief I didn't care. I just wanted some damn food at this point. When we finally ordered and sat, the food came out fast. It was really good! It's so good I may go back. However, it will definitely be a while before I recover from such service. I am giving this restaurant 4 stars based on food because it was really good. However, if you go DO NOT MENTION YOU SAW THE SHOW!
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2014,9/23/2014,1,10,1,3,4>Great place with delicious yogurt! Very clean place and very nice owner. Tuesday is kids day! Local bakery has sweets that look delicious!  We will definitely be back! Also coffee and cappuccinos!
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2014,9/22/2014,16,12,1,2,3>The beignets here are absolutely delicious! I brought my mom here when she visited a few months ago, and I am so glad I picked this place! Being brand new to the beignet scene, I had only had them at Cafe du Monde while in the FQ. My mom had never had a beignet before, and I definitely thought it was worth the trip. We went on a weekday morning, and it was surprisingly busy which I knew was a good sign. We ordered fingerling beignets and cafe au laits. The fingerlings were hot and crispy when they came out, so definitely made to order. The price was very reasonable, as well. The atmosphere, while small and possibly a bit cramped when busy, is still very pleasant and quite clean! The service was very friendly and helpful when we told them we were first time customers. I would definitely recommend Rue Beignet if you are looking for well priced, made to order, authentic beignets.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2014,9/21/2014,95,166,2,3,5>I'm so glad this opened in my neighborhood. It's within walking distance from my house and I love going over there and getting a smoothie or a juice. It's always kinda quiet in there so I find it a little intimidating. The employees are nice and helpful. It just takes forever for them to whip up your drink. I have been wanting to do a juice cleanse but it's rather expensive. I mean a smoothie is $9!  You could drive down the street to Smoothie King and get one for $5 but it wouldn't be as good of quality or healthier. They have some sort of rewards method where you give them your cell number and you get points. I've yet to receive a discount so we shall see!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2013,9/20/2014,4,6,,3,2>This place really should have a lot more people there every day.  I love their catfish poboy.  It is so fluffly and full of food and definitely worth the money.  Delicious!
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,9/19/2014,0,7,3,5,1>The sign on the door is in Spanish, that tells you how authentic it is. Tried the chicken, pork, and beef tacos, each tasted a little different. Their prices are reasonable, they have salsas and pico/cilantro/onions out where you can help yourself. A little difficult to get into during lunch time traffic but worth a visit.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2013,9/18/2014,0,4,1,3,>Wonderful Flavors, Great Service.  This was a real treat for lunch today.  Started with the best salsa in Baton Rouge.  Good heat and fresh taste.  Had the tamales with chili for appetizer and we were all impressed.  When our entrees arrived, they were beautifully plated and once again we were impressed with the quality and quantity.  Seafood entrees were very tasty and traditional entrees were well seasoned.  By far the best Mexican food in Baton Rouge.  Can't wait to eat my way through the menu!  Can't end without mentioning the service.  Everything was timed perfectly and the server was very attentive.  The type of flawless service you expect in from higher end restaurants.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/18/2014,9/17/2014,50,194,,2,3>I recently visited TJ Ribs because I wanted a steak from somewhere close.  I'm not usually a big fan of TJ's, but they won me over on this occasion.  I started with the wings.  Delicious.  Wing/Flap combo that were really big.  "Smoked 12 hours".  I got the chipotle sauce on the side, which was a good call b/c I barely used it, the flavor of the unsauced wings was so good.  For the main course I had the special.  Pan seared redfish with a meunier sauce on top along with fried crawfish tails and sautéed shrimp and red and green and yellow peppers.  They called it the Mardi Gras and there was definitely a Carnival in my mouth.  I didn't expect such a good seafood plate at a BBQ joint.  And...only $17.99 (included 2 sides).  A steak worth eating will run you at least $25 at this locale, so the fish special was a pleasant surprise to both my taste buds and my wallet.

Couyon's is hands down the best BBQ I've ever had, including anything in Memphis. Try the brisket tacos. Loaded potato casserole is the bomb diggity.
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2014,9/15/2014,3,122,,2,3>Great sandwich shop at the North Gate of LSU campus. Everything is fresh and prepared when ordered and the menu selection covers a range to suit almost anyone -- from fresh salads, to cheese steak, to veggie burger, to Cuban, to chicken, to shrimp. It is all pretty basic, but definitely good food.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2014,9/14/2014,63,48,1,4,4>Get their newsletter! The oldest cigar shop in BR. This spot is definitely paying a visit to. You have friendly patriots who are willing to help you narrow down the choices & even help you if It is your first time. It may not be fancy inside but it is your neighborhood, locally owned shop to get expert advice. They have a lounge area where you can relax & take a load off, free magazines.Also, on Friday's the elderly crowd gather around to discuss the local issues, sports, politics & daily grind so for me this is where community starts-at the grassroots level. You can also find them on fb too. Their prices are reasonable and they carry a select quantity highly desired pieces, they also have great pipes for sale that range from $50 to $700, something I would like to invest in soon.*They offer law enforcement, firefighter & military discount as well.

I really love the Dude, Strawberry Fields 4-Ever, and the Chocolate Sunshine. The only downside to this place is its location.

<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2014,9/9/2014,14,22,5,3,4>If you like greasy delicious pizza, being fat and happy, or eating so much that you list the pros and cons of both driving home or just sleeping there in the booth, then this place is for you! If you care about your six pack abs, know what a carb is, or prefer to eat a salad and act like you're full, then don't bother coming here. Seriously, the pizza is awesome and it's a great atmosphere to go grab a beer or 7. Beware, it is fairly warm inside there with all the ovens and lack of a/c. Also, the draft beer sizes are 10oz and 34oz, quite a difference in sizes
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/16/2013,9/7/2014,19,141,1,6,4>I recently treated my parents out here for my dad's birthday and it was the first time going for all of us. We all loved the food, which is quite the compliment for this place coming from an Italian family that grew up cooking good Italian food. The appetizer bread is good, but I really wish they would cut down a bit on the butter - it was pretty much soaked through and through. I also ordered the Italian style char-grilled oysters and the fried green tomato appetizers. The oysters were delicious but possibly some of the smallest I've seen, so I probably wouldn't get them again because they just weren't worth the price. The fried green tomato appetizer was nothing short of incredible, and between the three of us we had that bowl cleaned in about a minute. The sauce over them is great, though a bit heavy and rich so keep that in mind. It also comes with fried shrimp which for me was just a bit too much breading on one dish. They would probably be willing to sub sauteed shrimp if asked, which I would rather recommend. My dad and I were thinking about getting some beers to go with dinner so we asked about a happy hour and the waitress told us "Only at the bar". This pretty much confused the hell out of us because I could glance over my shoulder and see I was seated about 10 feet from the bar. Did she expect me to get up and walk to the bar to get my drinks? We decided against getting beers so they missed out on a bit of $$ by confusing us with that one. Most of the entrees come with a side salad, and I got mine with the house dressing which was quite tasty. They do throw a bit of rotini on the salad, which I enjoyed but my dad claimed ruined it for him despite devouring every bite. That's old Italian men for you, I suppose. For my entree I had the Veal Picatta, and the flavor was great but the meat cutlet was maybe 2 ounces tops so next time I would get the chicken... just not enough meat for me. The sauce blended perfectly with the angel hair pasta and capers. In comparison, my dad ordered some sort of stuffed Chicken Parmesan which came out with an absolutely massive chicken breast. It was supposed to be stuffed with pancetta but he said he couldn't taste any, and to me none was visible while he was eating. That being said, he once again ate every bite of it. My mom had ordered a grilled Chicken Pesto dish, which appeared to be full of chunks of chicken and she said was very good. The portion sizes were all filling enough, though as I said before mine was maybe 5% meat and 95% pasta, while my dad's was about 50/50 and my mom's about 40/60. I have no idea why they would choose to skimp so much on meat in some dishes and load up others. I get that veal is expensive, but a serving on top of pasta shouldn't look like it was meant for a Carpaccio appetizer. In summation, I definitely recommend this restaurant, but there are a number of little things they could tweak here and there to take it from a 4-star experience to a 5-star one.

<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2014,9/5/2014,1,9,,1,2>This is Lafayette's best kept secret. To many of you, it looks like just another BBQ place at a gas station. Go inside and I promise you that the food will blow you away. The chicken falls off the bone. The ribs falls off the bone. I'm not a fan of their sides but that's ok because I can cook that on my own. The only bummer is that it's closed on Sundays and most of us Cajuns love to eat BBQ on a Sunday.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,9/4/2014,4,9,,1,2>I really enjoy the food here. The hibachi is great (although it's not displayed), sushi is fresh, and the staff is really friendly. We've tried all of the appetizers, several of the sushi rolls (not the raw ones), and all of the hibachi. I can't find anything bad to say about any of it. I recommend the steak hibachi!
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,9/3/2014,22,6,,1,2>When our vet told us that it was time to euthanize our beloved 14 year old Papillon,  we were devastated.  It was important to me that Tosca's last breath be taken in her bed, in her home, surrounded by those that loved her, and because of Dr. Carrie her passing was peaceful, most of all, devoid of fear.  Dr. Carrie is a kind and caring professional and she provided our family with a valuable service.   I will be forever grateful to her for providing us this very special moment and final memory.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2014,9/2/2014,3,14,,,1>My husband and I went here for a date night and really enjoyed the ambience and the food. It has a warm, modern decor and feels very inviting. I had the sweet fashion (a citrus infused take on an old fashion). It was strong and well balanced, always a great start to the evening. We split a few tapas-- the gnocchi, tacos, and egg rolls. All had interesting flavor combinations and tasted sophisticated and fresh. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because our first order of gnocchi came out cold and although they did refire the dish, no one from management came over to speak with us and no offers were made to go above and beyond to rectify the situation. That, to me, is a service that really sets a restaurant apart. But other than that, we were very pleased with the food and drinks, and would definitely come back!
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2014,9/1/2014,122,389,2,6,8>This place has only recently opened and is an indoor recreation area and is for kids from 2 yoa up to about 10 yoa... They have several separate areas for the various ages of children... they have a reading nook, an engineering/science section with tables with gears and other such stuff for active little minds...They have a cool fort with slides and climbing sections and rope bridges for the older kids to play on and in.... this thing is totally enclosed for the kids' safety and they also have a section with a couple of smaller slides for the kids not ready or able to handle the big fort.... plus there is an indoor bouncy castle...Refreshments are available for purchase but one really cool thing is you can bring in your own food and drinks...They also have a section with tables and seating for the parents and for the kids to eat, either the food the parent has brought in or purchased refreshments...Lastly they are available for birthday parties and have a nice sized room in which to hold such a gathering... also you can purchase memberships or pay by the visit....
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2014,8/31/2014,5,23,3,6,5>Best Chinese restaurant in Denham Springs, by far. And great customer service. This is somewhat embarrassing for me, but I get the general tso's chicken and sweet and sour shrimp to go about 3 times a month and the owner recognizes my voice on the phone. They give you tons of food!!! My husband and I could share an order of the general tso's chicken but I'm stingy so we get separate orders. I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, I prefer Japanese, but this place is great. It's very very fresh and not dried up and greasy like most Chinese food. My husband loves Chinese so I have to compromise sometimes and this is about the only place I've found that I actually truly enjoy the food.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2014,8/30/2014,11,30,1,2,3>The staff was very friendly, the muffuletta was good and didn't have the super thick bread. The Patin burger was spicer than i'd expected it should have been. Low key place that doesn't mind kids which is great. No kids menu though. Very interesting selection of food, can't wait to go back to try more!
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2013,8/29/2014,8,16,2,4,4>So my friend and I just ate here, trying to find a hole in the wall kind of place. At first glance you wouldn't expect this place to be good or friendly. We ordered the seafood gumbo and 6 fried shrimp. It was the best gumbo I have ever had. The fried shrimp was also something to dream about. The dinner was topped off by a story from the owner, Binh, about his life which let me tell you, is worth listening to. It's not wonder why the food is so damn good, it's made by a man and woman who have a lot of love. Cheesy I know, but true.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,8/28/2014,6,10,1,3,3>The Seigen store has a majority of sale items! I can always count of Bella Bella to have a cute pair of sale shoes for as low as $10!!! Plus they have a ton of regular priced merchandise. LOVE!!
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,8/27/2014,1,13,2,7,6>We have eaten here several times.  We had lunch here today.  For our appetizers we ordered the fried pickles,  they were a little too salty, but good and crisp and not soggy.  We also ordered a 5 pc. Boneless wings in hot sauce; they were great with the right amount of sauce & the fall apart tenderness was good.  For our entrées we ordered the Open Faced Roast beef poboy and the Chicken Sandwich.  My husband really enjoyed his chicken sandwich,  he ordered it fried and with hot sauce on it.  I didn't enjoy the roast beef as much.  I ordered the gravy on the side and it was like water, not really a gravy.  I suppose I am also more accustomed to a shredded roast beef on this type of poboy and not a sliced roast beef.  The flavor was just off to me (and it may be because I am pregnant & pregnancy taste buds are different and picky at times).But to make up for the lack in food taste of the roast beef... was the service.  TYLER was the most wonderful server I have ever had in a restaurant ever!!!  FANTASTIC service!!  He was always checking on us, made sure we had what we needed & wanted, made our dining experience a great one!! If you ever dine here, make sure to ask for him as your server, you will not be disappointed.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/6/2014,8/26/2014,30,85,2,2,2>So far so good... I've only been here once, so I can't be too specific, but I do like the concept. The plate lunch was pretty good, and the menu seems pretty exciting. I'll definitely have to go back and try a lot more, but I did manage to grab a box of their pretty tasty fried chicken skin!!. Just keep 911 on speed dial.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2014,8/25/2014,0,9,2,2,2>Man this place was great! I've been meaning to try it for awhile and finally did. It is local which is also cool! I has the fish tacos which were made with panko breaded fish and the flavor was SUPER!I highly recommend this place!
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/17/2013,8/24/2014,179,366,2,6,3>Heard so much about this place, so decided to give it a shot.  They have really nice decor and ambiance, a little small, but isn't all coffee spots?  The people here are nice and helpful, and doesn't mind answering questions.  We had the following:- NOLA Style Iced Coffee - which was pretty decent, I like my coffee a tad bit stronger.- Nutella Croissant - this was decent, they had to microwave it, so it was probably sitting out for a while.. so it probably lost it's flakiness, nevertheless, it was decent- Swamp Pop - I was so excited to hear that they carry swamp pop, I've been waiting on the release of these suckers since forever, I had got the Praline Cream Soda, and it was good!I can't wait to come back to try the other goodies they have here!
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2014,8/23/2014,1,13,,2,3>I've been to the Chimes several times since moving to Baton Rouge; tried it the first time and then went back because it was just good! (Duh?) It's a young atmosphere and it does get VERY crowded, but the food is good, the price is good and the servers are prompt to make up for all the hustle and bustle.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2014,8/22/2014,30,7,1,4,4>I have enjoyed every trip to Lock and Key whiskey bar. They have an informative, fun, and happening Women and Whiskey Wednesday I think the 3rd Wednesday of the month.  Most of the regulars are fun and friendly and intelligent. I love the abundance of sofas and cozy seating areas. Every bartender I interacted with including the owner was skillful, knowledgeable, informative and fun!  They have a whole page of some of the best unique craft cocktails in town. I would feel very comfortable coming here alone as a single woman and I'm sure id have a great time!  It's a great grown up bar without feeling pretentious and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I'll be back fo sho
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,8/21/2014,1,4,1,4,5>Delicious! I had the salmon pasta and the sauce wasn't too heavy or too thin it was perfect and had the right creaminess and garlic with tomato. The salmon was excellent! Our waiter was awesome and this place is one to come back too!
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2013,8/20/2014,19,6,2,11,7>This establishment is truly a gem in Baton Rouge and is one of my most happy-making places worldwide. The name is slightly misleading, though, as it doesn't do justice to their excellent selection of fresh and customizable hot tea options. Since they gather the leaves and create the tea bags by hand, you can request any combination of flavors and scents for a truly excellent tea experience.They also have delicious freshly-made soft granola bars, cakes, and stuffed croissants. No one cares if you're there for hours. Park your bike on the rack, say hi to the regulars, put some honey in your tea, and enjoy the free wi-fi.In late May, sit under the honeysuckle trellis. To maximize your pleasure, do this when it's just about to start raining. Don't be afraid of the humidity; the smell alone is worth it.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2014,8/19/2014,19,19,,2,1>I haven't tried any of the food items like the sandwiches or anything but I have had their yogurt, super tart, just add strawberries on top and I'm in heaven. Yum yum, just the way I like it. :3
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2013,8/18/2014,418,77,1,1,1>I am basing my rating mostly on service, although the food was quite good, I hardly ever have a server pay such close attention to detail without hovering or being overbearing. Honestly, the simple things like omitting tomatoes on my salad because I asked for them to be left off of my sandwich and simple suggestions are really hard to come by in standard dining. I was quite impressed. Being the roast beef nerd that I am, I got the poboy. My only complaints would be that there is not enough meat for my taste (order double next time) and the au jus that was served on the side, was very salty (didn't need it anyway.) My salad had their house garlic Parmesan dressing and this vinaigrette was really tasty, as long as you love a lot of garlic (glad Im taken.) I stole a fried shrimp off of my dining partner's plate and it has best batter I've had in a while. It was almost as light as tempura. I really can't wait to go back there to try more food, especially if Andrew is there to wait on me! (No I don't have a man crush, he was just that good!)
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2014,8/17/2014,33,23,,3,4>Coming from Illinois and (deep dish) I thought good pizza would be hard to find. However, this pizza is so good it even taste good for lunch the next day. I had the supreme which was packed with jumbo sized toppings. If you looking to spend a little extra for some good pizza this is the laid back casual place for you! The atmosphere is bar/pizzeria which I like.
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,8/16/2014,8,61,1,2,1>Consistently, reliably good bar & grill food and Louisiana seafood. Easily on par with Sammy's, without the long wait times and noisy crowds. The soups and gumbos here are especially good in the winter. The poboys are also  awesome. I like their French dip better than most in the BR area. Service is always friendly and attentive, although the food does not always come out super fast. It's never been long enough for me to complain; just sometimes feels a tad slower than similar establishments. (Definitely not a reason to skip going there. Even if you're starving, there are baskets of crackers on the tables). Dempsey's is definitely worth a visit.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,8/15/2014,62,129,2,5,4>The Cove is a connoisseur's dream with an elite collection of rare beer, world renowned Scotch and Bourbon, masterfully crafted cocktails to please every drinker's wildest desires,all served up by the best bartenders in Baton Rouge! The Cove is in my Top 5 Bars in the country! Yeah, its that good!Like Ahab, I'm always on the hunt for the white whales of the beer world. I've driven hundreds of miles and scheduled long layovers to make pilgrimages to score a bottle of the best the beer world has to offer. The cove saves me the expense of travels by keeping about 475 bottles in house and about 40 drafts in the tap room. This isn't just inflated numbers with most shelf space taken up by brands of the domestic giants, but a highly respectful and well researched collection of the best beers in the world. I would put their list up against anyone's in the country. The list is usually heavy on Belgians. The only thing about the bottle room is to make sure you have a backup. They may be out of a few beers. However the beers I did have were insane! The Scotch game is ridiculous and some rare and coveted bottles on the shelves. I've only had a few, but each was definitely worth the price of admission.Besides having a treasure trove of alcohol, The Cove boasts the best servers in the city that take care of the customer. These people are not here for a job, but booze is their passion and all are very knowledgeable. Chris who runs the tap room is a certified Cicerone. I thought I knew everything about beer and he routinely puts me in my place and makes me look like a child with his Wikipedia like knowledge of fermentia. Cocktail whiz Joey whips up some of the most perfectly made drinks I've ever had. Also, they know scotch and ask you about your preferences and help steer you to the right choice. They all have done things in the past to go the extra mile and make every Cove experience memorable.The decor is kind of sparse but I don't go there for the ambiance. The biggest things I dislike about the Cove is the smoke and location. Other than that, The Cove is almost perfect. Its one of the things I love most about living in Baton Rouge!
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2014,8/14/2014,19,19,1,1,2>$15 for all you can eat sushi? Yeah, this place is worth it. Also, you can order as much as you want at a time. Just make sure you eat everything you order or you can get charged, which makes sense
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2014,8/13/2014,31,68,2,4,3>Lovelovelove French Market Bistro.  The in-laws go every other Friday, sit at their table, and have the same waitress (Susan!).  We are invited every once in awhile and I have never had a bad meal.  Susan is so personable and on top of her game with the service.  The food is always great, fresh, and substitutions aren't an issue.  They have a good wine list but you can bring your own (which we normally do, I don't know the corkage fee, however).  We've had a large party there as well (12 maybe?) and they sat us up front, it's by the door but cut off from the main dining room so it feels a little more intimate.  The bar set up is a little strange (you walk past the back of the bar and around to the bar which has about 8 seats) but most people are coming for dinner, and I'm sure it would get super crowded if the seats were in the walkway. They have art on the walls that's for sale by local artists and it changes every so often, great stuff.I will always recommend the Crab Cakes, the Napa Salad, and the Warm Duck Salad, I know the linguine+clams are a favorite at our table, and the specials are always well-received!  Prices are moderate, a little on the high side but for a  small restaurant doing it right (and down the street from the country club), I have no problems paying for great service, great ambience, and great food!Edited to add:  We usually end the meal with a slice of cheesecake, but I've had almost everything else on the dessert menu and they are all great!
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2013,8/12/2014,1,7,2,4,3>Best dogs in town, hands down.   The service is quick and friendly.  You can watch them prepare your food in the kitchen behind the counter.  They keep the place extremely CLEAN, which is a rarity from my experience.  I enjoyed the Philly Cheese, and have tried the Dawg House as well, both very filling and delicious.  The thing that I have to mention that you MUST TRY however is their tater tots.  They are the best I've ever had, hands down.  Try them plain, or get the loaded tots and enjoy.Prices are solid too, this is a great place for lunch or even dinner on a weeknight.  If I lived closer, I would try to hit this place up for late night too.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,8/11/2014,5,55,2,3,2>This is my go to place for chicken pho soup!  It's the perfect meal when I am fighting off a cold or just not feeling well.I really enjoy the taste of the broth and the wonderful fresh vegetables that are served with the soup.Consistently good service and great pricing.
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2014,8/10/2014,20,5,2,3,2>Outstanding is my word for Stroubes. Though we have only eaten there a handful of times for a meal, we have visited the bar area and ordered appetizers more frequently. Can't go wrong at Stroubes!
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2014,8/9/2014,39,40,2,2,2>Large portions but heavy on the price. My family of 4 absolutely loved that we could get Yogurtland quality make your own yogurt in the same place as we got delicious Vietnamese cuisine! Nice, clean atmosphere with good service too. Only reason I gave it a 4 was because I expected lunch prices, but they only have the one menu so it seemed a little high. Would definitely return though!
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,8/8/2014,6,13,2,2,2>Exceptional sushi.  Best flavors.  Fresh and delicious.  Thank you God that I live nearby.  I'm coming back again & again.  Their specialty rolls average $9.95.  Baton Rouge roll probably the best.   And tonight is Saturday & this place is packed with large parties of 10+.
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2014,8/7/2014,4,17,1,4,2>This place is great for date night! If you're downtown for "Live after 5" on Friday nights, this is a great place to go afterwards! I've been to the downtown one and to the one off of Sherwood Forrest for live music night on Thursdays. Everything I've tried has been excellent!! My favorite, the grilled fish tacos!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,8/6/2014,5,12,1,4,3>The food was amazing! The bartenders were friendly and they even asked if we wasted to request a specific type of music! I loved it!  Even though its a short drive I'm going back!
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/24/2014,8/5/2014,5,7,2,2,2>Great food, great employees, great prices, good atmosphere. This is a place that could benefit from having a larger building. Parking limitations can be frustrating sometimes, especially when you are ordering to go for lunch, which is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. Wish there was a way to give it 4 and 1/2.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,8/4/2014,4,118,2,2,3>It took me 11 months to make my way to Zippy's and my only regret now is that I didn't come sooner.  This place doesn't have the best reputation, but I enjoyed it for many reasons.  Good food, nice service, great outdoor seating, nice beer selection, and good drink specials.  I look forward to coming back here often, especially during World Cup.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,8/3/2014,100,239,2,5,3>It's about time they built a Rum House in Baton Rouge! I've always loved the original location in New Orleans, but it's nice to have one here too.First off the food is every bit as amazing as it is at the NOLA location. The atmosphere is awesome, especially with the Captain's chairs lined up on the inside bar and the swings on the outside bar. It definitely different than the NOLA location, but it still has the same vibe.Personal favorites of mine here are the lamb vindaloo tacos, the jerk chicken tacos, the chopped shrimp, tacos, the damn good nachos, and the rasta veggies. Every now and then I'll have an item I find too sweet, but that doesn't mean someone else will.I don't have any actual complaints. The biggest gripe I had was that i had to park in the field by the shopping center, but that's so minor it almost seems petty to point out. If you like eclectic food you'll probably enjoy yourself here.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/17/2014,8/2/2014,22,45,1,3,2>I've eaten at Le Creole a handful of times. I've been impressed with the food, drinks and service each time. I've loved every item I've been able to try. I would highly recommend the Cajun lemonade from the bar, it tastes like an herbal tea. I can't say enough positive things about Le Creole.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2014,8/1/2014,1,5,,3,2>The thing I like about Sno's is the fact that anything goes as far as attire is concerned. It is a true 'Come As You Are' restaurant. Tonight was a great example of this with business suits at one table, a guy wearing a wife beater at another, at least one John Deere camouflage cap in the room and everything in between. Personally I enjoy the people watching potential here but the best part is that the management and wait staff treat everyone equally respectfully. The dining room does remind me of an old geriatric banquet hall a little but I can tell there have been some recent updates, including the restroom and parking lot area.I was very pleased with my dish of Chicken Florentine with a steamed vegetable medley. The vegetables were perfectly seasoned and cooked just the right amount. Not soggy, slightly crisp. The chicken was grilled through without being dry and I could easily make a meal out of the creamed spinach topping. There is a lighter/healthy version of this dish under the 'Ideal' menu and I appreciate that should I ever have the will to opt for it.We started with an appetizer of seafood stuffed mushrooms and they were excellent. The mushrooms were not overly juicy which tends to ruin them for me when fried but not here. Dessert was a slice of Charlie's Cheesecake to go. It is always phenomenal but I did feel a little slighted since I got home to see it was just a sliver and not even close to the picture shown on the menu. I hope that was an oversight due to it being a to-go order. I didn't need to eat a big hunk anyhow.I also noticed the parking lot is monitored with a nice security system that is consistently viewed from the hostess/manager station. I will be back soon.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2013,7/31/2014,1,18,2,3,2>We so glad to get to see a wine bar in downtown.  Blend has a great atmosphere and a staff that knows and appreciates wine.  What makes Blend truly special is the food...   The new chef is inventive and loves to experiment.   The menu focuses on local, updates every day and we love it all.   Standouts are the short ribs with peaches glacé  - heavenly, the  BBQ shrimp and the desserts.Great spot for after work of for an event (the upstairs space is really nice)With food this good, I wish they were open for lunch.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/3/2014,7/30/2014,110,62,2,5,3>Calandro's is great for stopping in when you need something quickly and do not want to wait in line. They have lots of specialty items and a good selection of in house prepared salads and dips. The beer selection is also vast.  I also like that they carry the Boar's Head line of meats and cheeses in the deli. Pricing is a little more than the big box stores but often worth it for the convenience. This store is always clean and the staff helpful.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2014,7/29/2014,0,14,2,2,1>Bin77 is my hands down favorite bar/restaurant in Baton Rouge. I make a point to go at least once a week.When I first started frequenting the establishment, I never had trouble getting a table. Recently, business seems to have picked up, and on several recent visits I've been forced to wait out a table at the bar or find another place to eat. They have several high top tables, multiple low tables with cushy seats and lots of outdoor seating. The outdoor area shares space with The Loft (which is right next door). I haven't explored the drink list much, but I am always satisfied with the wine selection. The pours are generous and I've sent back a glass I didn't particularly care for without any problems. I think they also do wine tastings on Thursdays but I haven't had the opportunity to make it yet.The food is delicious, but a bit pricey. By far the most tasty and best portion for your dollar (in my opinion) is the Bin Burger, substitute truffle fries and chive aioli. People, if you have anything to eat here, have the truffle fries. They are epic. Also recommended are the flatbreads - all very tasty. I love me some Bin77 and look forward to my next visit. Highly recommended.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2013,7/28/2014,3,3,2,3,3>My husband and I have been going here for 14 years.  We go at least once a week.  The food is AMAZING!  We love the atmosphere and the staff.  We have taken a lot of our friends with us on several occasions, who we have now turned into regulars as well.  I personally have not been in the kitchen of this restaurant, but I have always imagined an older, 4 foot tall Italian woman back there doing all the cooking.  If you have not been here, do not hesitate to try it.  You will become a regular too.
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,7/27/2014,3,10,1,4,3>Love this salon. Warm and friendly atmosphere. My stylist Jensen is amazing. He transformed my blonde straw to look like hair again. I walked out loving my new style.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/15/2014,7/26/2014,19,36,2,4,4>I've visited this joint more than 10 times. I've not been disappointed yet. The $4 bottomless champagne is worth the trip alone. People also rave about the bloody Mary's but I don't drink them so I've not ever tried it. So for the food, you must try the sweet potato pancakes. They are by far one of my favs from the menu. There is also this seafood sauce that randomly shows up on a few meals.... If you have something with seafood chances are you should add it. It's great over the seafood or steak omelette. The fries seafood is always a winner as well. And don't forget to add a cup of gumbo with your meal. Best way to start! But did I mention $4 unlimited champagne???

<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/1/2014,7/25/2014,20,57,2,4,3>This is my go to Chinese food stop.  Not the biggest, nicest, or best around, but they are consistently good.  I have not had a bad choice yet on the menu.  Seem to always order the Mei Fun, so that is a favorite.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,7/24/2014,7,5,2,3,2>A fairly new daiquiri shop in Baton Rouge and my favorite!!! It's a SMOKE-FREE shop with a variety of flavors. Their specials are AMAZING. I wish they would open up another location closer to LSU.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,7/23/2014,30,8,1,3,2>Fantastic arrangements and great value. I spoke with Ms. Matte who normally works in the Government St. location but was at the Staring Lane Heroman's. I explained to her what I was looking for and she assured me that she would make something special. A few hours later, I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Matte in person when she gave me the most beautiful arrangement. It was exactly what I had envisioned and she told me that she closed her eyes and let the flowers talk to her after speaking with me. I was beyond thrilled and so was she. My interaction with her completely made my day and my friend loved the arrangement to boot. I can honestly say that I don't think I have ever had a better customer service experience and Heroman's gained a customer for life.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,7/22/2014,98,6,1,4,3>Absolutely the best. Tuna Lover is my favorite but I also love the lobster roll and the salmon appetizer. They amaze me each and every time.
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2013,7/21/2014,18,4,1,4,2>I won't go anywhere else! I got a full set a couple of weeks ago and they still look great. The ladies there were super nice. For $20 my nails looked like a million bucks! Very clean, comfortable atmosphere. I would recommend this salon to everyone.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/21/2014,7/20/2014,11,8,1,3,2>The best crawfish I ever had...in my life....EVER! I cant wait to go back! Austin was a wonderful server too.
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,7/19/2014,23,43,,2,1>Best kolaches in town. The fruit based ones are my favorite. Cheap, but large servings. Great for college students strapped for cash.
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2014,7/18/2014,2,3,,2,1>Good atmosphere. Cheap eats. Chicken and waffles. There's also a very Canes-like sauce on the side. Get the willy wich.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2014,7/17/2014,26,4,,2,>Latte e Miele is a local gem. Inventive flavors, great staff, and a cool vibe. Try one of their homemade sodas. I'm not a soda drinker so I consider these a special treat. We've hosted events here for Creative Louisiana and always get great reviews from attendees about the great atmosphere.
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2014,7/16/2014,0,10,1,4,3>Tres tres magnifique!This place blew my mind.  I found Maison Lacour mostly by accident:  my family came to visit Baton Rouge and we wanted somewhere with great food that we hadn't tried yet.  Maison Lacour was listed on the pricier end, but had fantastic reviews.  And with good reason!Now we have been back a second time, and I can tell you it's just as good--if not better--when knowing exactly what to expect when you walk through the doors.  The service is impeccable, the atmosphere is both relaxed and comfortable as well as feeling high-class.  It really is like you stepped through a door into the real French roots of la Louisiane.  Those commenting on the slow service may not have known that this is how restaurants with several courses work.  It is supposed to be relaxed time to enjoy your friends or family--the waitress is far from inattentive:  Neither our wine glasses nor our waters were ever empty.  I have nothing but good to say about the service.The Food:  The Shrimp Ravioli was so fantastic that we ordered it as our appetizer on both trips.  The Escargot is as good as any you'll find in France.The house salad and vinaigrette is delicious.  It's got pickled red onions (don't knock them until you've tried them if you think you don't like onions in your salad, both my husband and I feel that way about raw onions in our salads, but not so with these!), walnuts.  Since we had four people dining each time, we got to taste many things on the menu.  Personally, I had Carré d'Agneau (lamb rack) the first time and Sweetbread the second time--the sweetbread is probably the best thing I've ever put into my mouth.  Other dishes our party got over the two trips included:  John's Favorite (it was awesome!), Steak au Poivre (it was very good, but the other more traditionally Southern France dishes still knocked it out of the park), Flounder En Papillote, Wild Boar Chops, Crevettes Baton Rouge (spicy shirmp over angel hair pasta), and Rock Dove. As you can see, we tried a wide variety on the menu, and it was all very very good.  Open your mind to possibilities, and try a little something from France!  FYI:  The Eva Special Chocolate Martini is absolutely to die for.  Try it and you won't be disappointed.  It somehow tastes like actual chocolate cake.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/26/2013,7/15/2014,32,17,1,6,4>Top notch.Perfect place for a great steak. Doe's is a genuine steak house. They're not pretentious, not overly sophisticated - they're simply a great, laid back spot for one of the best steaks in Baton Rouge.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,7/14/2014,9,6,1,4,3>My family & I love this place! Always good food, always good service! My favorite appetizer is the Coach's plate and the cheese fries. My favorite main course is the seafood au gratin and you've got to try the blueberry bread pudding for dessert!! Yum!
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2014,7/13/2014,22,50,1,3,2>If you're looking for south Louisiana style seafood, and don't mind paying for it,  then this might be the place for you.  The charbroiled oysters are some of the best around.  I always catch myself watching the grill chef's do their magic.  If you liked fried, they have you covered.  They also offer broiled seafood platter and a few other broiled dishes. If you like variety or not quite sure what to order, the 7 ways shrimp or crawfish dinner is a great way to try smaller portions of various dishes.   The shrimp and trout norman are topped with the crabmeat etouffee but the crawfish etouffee is far better tasting and seasoned.  I find the crabmeat etouffee to be bland and a smoother consistency like baby food.  If you want gumbo as meal, order the bowl.   The cup of gumbo is just that a cup.  I'm not a big fan of their gumbo so I would steer toward something else on the menu.  The small etouffee however is very tasty and perfectly seasoned and the perfect size for a meal. Crab fingers are favorites and if you like more filling, try the hushpuppies.  The onion rings are sliced thick and piled high.  The stuffed potatoes are great sides and the coleslaw is on the tangy side. They offer a low calorie selection, however it is limited to only 3 items so this is not the place if you are watching your figure.  They also offer steaks but they are quite large portions as well.  The smallest is an 8oz filet.  And if you choose a topping, it will add another 10-13 dollars to an already pricey meal.  The majority of their dishes are well into the 20 range.  The ambiance is very nice with large aquariums and fire place and brick archways.  They also have a bar area and you can eat in there as well as on outside patio.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2014,7/12/2014,3,14,,4,2>I truly love this place.  It all started last year when I bought a gift certificate for a friend who was expecting.  Then one afternoon I was having an awful day so I stopped in & they worked me in for a massage. It was an absolute blessing, I walked into church a few hours later & everyone noticed how relaxed I was.  Since then I have returned for other services.  Very caring and relaxed atmosphere.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,7/11/2014,16,60,,4,2>Well after seeing my Yelp bestie Rebecca W. talk so highly about this place in her review, I figured I'd have to give this place a shot.  As you may or may not know, Mestizo was one of only four restaurants this year participating in Dining Out for Life (diningoutforlife.com/Bat). This place was a lot different than my typical experience with Mexican restaurants.  Normally at your standard Mexican place, the servings are huge and the prices are cheap.  This place has appropriate portion sizes that are a tad on the expensive side.  But I'm a mere mortal with very little will-power for delicious food, so I'm happy to pay a premium to not over consume.I ate the Cancun whic was a Shrimp and crab enchilada, a crawfish and spinach enchilada, with guacamole and a crawfish taco.  It was all very good.  The only downside was the guacamole, which was bland.   Or as I like to say, it had a subtle flavor.  The service was slow, which seems to be mentioned in other reviews.  I'm normally pushing a server to their max, as I drink an absurd amount of water each meal.  The service was not terrible, but not great.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2013,7/10/2014,12,33,2,3,2>So happy to have found this place! Not only is the food incredible, but the employees are WONDERFUL and pleasant. The meatball sub is like no meatball sub you've had before. Hot pressed, gooey.. perfect.The place is hard to find if you don't know where it is, but after some searching, I found it. There already isn't much in the ways of Italian in Baton Rouge, and then a large % of those aren't very authentic.. but Anthony's is a win.
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/20/2014,7/9/2014,0,18,,2,1>So tasty! Walked in and loved the atmosphere. Tried the Carolina Red Slaw BBQ, and 8t was quite good. Looking forward to trying something else!
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/4/2014,7/8/2014,0,7,,2,1>Wait in line to order and seat yourself. Fairly busy for a holiday. Waited over 45 minutes for our food, but it was very good. Although the wait was long, the owner tried to make it right by offering free dessert which was nice. Strawberry shortcake beignets were the best!!
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,7/7/2014,1,3,,3,2>5 Stars yes absolutely . My wife and I were tying to figure out where to go for dinner last night and we had heard about Ninos from some other people. We arrived at 5:00  pm on Saturday night and we were the first to arrive. The hostess informed us that the restaurant had reservations for almost all the tables but we were fortunate that there were a few tables left.  I can see why the restaurant was almost sold out for Saturday night.The food was very very good. My wife had the Lasagna and I had the The Spicy Salsiccia (Homemade caseless Italian sausage made with locally sourced beef and pork cooked in a 17 creamy marinara, tossed with spaghetti and topped with Parmesan, fresh basil and shaved fennel). We had a great bottle of wine that was suggested by the very informed professional waiter who provided us a history of the restaurant . I love a good cappuccino and they did not disappoint -Just delicious. My wife and I were full after the meal but we wanted something sweet to top off the evening. You have to try their home made cookies yes I said home made cookies with their home made ice cream. They arrive hot  to your table with the fresh home made ice cream. We cant wait to go back. I would highly recommend that you call and get reservations especially for Friday or Saturday night.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2014,7/6/2014,48,279,,4,2>This store has a lot of stuff to choose from. They have everything from clothes to cooking.  They have veggies, spices, cheeses and a freezer section. I am always looking for paneer and this is the only place you can buy it. They have it fresh but i bought the lightly fried kind in the freezer section figuring it would be easier for me to cook since I'm a slouch in the kitchen. I guess we will see what happens.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2013,7/5/2014,3,9,,2,1>Great experience!  Requires appointments, but he fit me in as a walk-in.  I loved the salon and my haircut!!   Thrilled to find a salon I can keep coming back to in the Denham/Walker area.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2013,7/4/2014,2,38,,6,3>I had seen differing reviews; couldn't stand the food, the staff was rude, etc., however, when I went it was lunch time, the buffet was out, which I had. It had home stuff: fried chicken, jambalaya, mashed potatoes, greens, BBQ pork chops, etc. My wife had the chicken lejuene, which is two chicken breasts smothered with bell peppers, onions and mushrooms, topped with pepper Jack cheese. Everything was awesome. When I checked-in to Yelp I had a coupon for a free dessert pop up. It was for this restaurant and no one knew about it, but they looked at it on my phone and honored it. That was THE BEST Turtle Cheese cake I have ever had. :-)The staff was very nice and friendly. All thumbs up.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2013,7/3/2014,66,126,,3,1>This is a great lunch spot with an enormous amount of character.  The menu is fairly simple but everything is worth a try.  A few of my favs are the chicken salad (cranberries & apples), jalepeno chicken sandwich and the chicken caprese.  They usually offer a decent special too and if you're on the email list, you'll get notice of the week's specials on Monday.  OH....I can't believe I almost forgot about the cake!!  You NEED to try the lemon berry mascarpone cake...it's so good and big enough to share.  The last, but not least, point is that you can shop while you wait or after you've eaten.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,7/2/2014,2,5,,3,2>Great happy hour! $5 martinis from 3-6!!  Really excited about this new place to hang out for drinks and dinner.  Great atmosphere and super friendly staff. I'll definitely be back.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2014,7/1/2014,5,3,,3,2>Consistently good food that's fast! All of the staff are welcoming and very friendly here, the chips (light and crispy) and salsa are great and the margaritas are pretty potent. A great place for lunch or dinner.
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2014,6/30/2014,3,7,,2,2>Everything I've had from there is delicious. They have daily specials that are very reasonable. One of my favorite things is the crawfish pot pie! They also have the option of to go cups when you go to fill your drink, which I like
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/8/2014,6/29/2014,3,3,,2,1>Best pulled pork sandwiches that are made to order. The fries need a little work. My husband loves the philly cheesesteak poboy. Ethan provided us with the best customer service while waiting on our sandwiches to be fixed.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/6/2014,6/28/2014,37,34,,2,1>I hope this place stays in business!  My wife and I love healthy alternatives after a few too many rich meals.  If you are looking for a tasteful guiltless meal you can absolutely get it here!  I stopped in around 5 pm and the place was practically empty, but I was told by an employee that they do get busy at lunch.  The place is clean, and the customer service is good.
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2014,6/27/2014,3,122,1,3,2>OK... After the blackened catfish sensation salad I had today for lunch, this place deserves all the stars it can get. Absolutely sensational! And I fear that I will never be able to order anything different off the menu ever again. I'm going back tomorrow to eat another one.
