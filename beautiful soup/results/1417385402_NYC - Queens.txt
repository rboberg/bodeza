<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2013,12/23/2013,311,812,9,11,8>One star for our friendly waitress who was accommodating and sweet.One star for having a Yelp deal, allowing us to maintain the baller-on-a-budget lifestyle.One star for the entire list of "skinny" cocktails, esp. the peach margarita one--not sure how such a punch could be packed into 90 calories but I'm not questioning it either.One star for the extensive menu with almost too many options.One star for the outstanding sesame-teriyaki salmon that practically melted in my mouth and was perfectly medium-rare.After sampling the cuisine from Austin's Ale House at Queens Taste 2013, I was hoping to check the restaurant out sometime, but now that I've had a full dinner there, I can't wait to return.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2013,12/22/2013,142,211,4,12,6>Rajbhog is more than meets the eye. Sure it functions as a sweets shop, with its colorful array of Indian fudge-like barfis and funnel-cake-clone jalebis. For its sweets alone it merits 5 stars. (fair disclosure: Rajbhog provided the sweets for both my and my sister's Indian weddings; my bias here leans towards the positive side). But what most people don't realize is that it has a killer savory menu. The dosas hold their own to the Queens cult-hit Ganesh canteen in Flushing and Dosa Place around the corner in Jackson Heights. The chaat menu (sweet-sour Indian snacks) have won taste comparisons run by several notable blogs; highlighted selections being Rajbhog's version of dahi puri, a hollowed-out puffed cracker filled with delicious bits of black chickpeas, potato, tangy tamarind chutney and spicy cilantro chutney,  and samosa chaat, an open face fried samosa layered in rich sauces and crunchy add-ons. The super secret weapon, in my opinion, is Rajbhog's $4.99 lunch special. This meal gets the adventurous eater 2 vegetarian dishes of the day and rice or roti. The vegetarian dishes range from crowd pleasing classics, like slow cooked cauliflower (gobi) or spicy lentils (dal), to the more obscure and delicious regional dishes, such as fried rolls of taro leaves (patra) or lentil cakes soaked in yogurt (dahi vada). All of the dishes du jour are made on spot; super fresh and authentic.

I've come here twice with my parents (they loved it) and have come a few times since with my boyfriend for Thursday $10 pasta night.Their bruschetta appetizer is awesome, it's really different from where I've had it elsewhere, almost with a bit of a peppery kick. I've had numerous pasta dishes at this place and the portions are large. I usually go for the marinara dishes (and their sauce is definitely on point), but I like that they have a lot of "different" items on their menu, such as gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan options. Their penne alla vodka is particularly tasty. Whatever mozzarella they use on their dishes is delicious too. The owners obviously put a lot of care and time into this place as the menus are hand-written.They offer very reasonably priced carafes of their house wines (I believe 23 or 24 for a 1.5 liter carafe) so if you want to get your wine on you're all set. Save room for the ricotta cheesecake though...it's awesome!The waiters are always super friendly and give us heavy pours of wine. They also don't hover over your table either. Perfect service pretty much every time I've gone so far.Can't wait to go back!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/6/2013,12/19/2013,61,112,7,11,8>Being a resident of Bayside, Bell boulevard is always the spot to be so the fact that I hadn't tried Erawan before was baffling. My boyfriend and I decided to go on a date night here this weekend and I was excited since I really don't have Thai food all that often. We walked in and I immediately felt remorse for not making a reservation as I saw many tables with "reserved" signs on them. The girl was very friendly and asked if we had a reservation, I hesitantly said no expecting there to be a wait but thankfully, she pointed to two tables in the center of the restaurant with wicker dividers and told us we could sit at either. We chose a table and although we found it slightly uncomfortable that we were technically sitting at the same table as another couple with a see-through screen between us, it actually did help and we weren't phased by it after a little while. I ordered their seasonal wine from Spain (a red that was quite yummy) the bf got an imported beer which he enjoyed. Now on to the fun part--the food! For appetizers we ordered the Satay (chicken on a skewer with peanut sauce) which was delicious and the Thai spring rolls. I tried to savor every bite! The sweet sauce really added an amazing taste that just exploded with flavor. For the entree I got beef with pineapple, peppers, onions and cucumbers which was so savory and the pineapple added great taste. We also got a papya salad with chili pepper. Also very tasty.I wish we had some of the fried ice cream everyone talks about--but we'll just have to go back!My only complaints--the restaurant is very narrow with lots of tables crammed in so as people walked by we kept having to squish ourselves to the side--some re-arranging should really be done. Also, it's a tad bit pricey but manageable.

Candlelit tables (if you can get one) and a surprising amount of standing room.Eurotrash and Guidos (if that's your thing, ladies) do frequent this place in the summer quite often apparently.  More of a journal entry, my most recent foray into the establishment was as pleasant as ever on a service and value standpoint.  Be wary of the clientele that may frequent this joint however.While sitting at a table, my party and I were intruded on by some sun-burned meathead (and gang), who proceeded to sit at our table uninvited and began to hit on the girls I was with.  Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I thought it was completely out of form and just rude.A sour taste in my mouth for what was a fine night at a fine establishment.  Just wanted to give a word of warning to the good looking female yelpers out there.
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/3/2013,12/16/2013,87,122,11,20,16>In comparison to other gyms that I've been to, this one is alright.  A lot of cardio machines, some other weight machines (not many of those), and an ample weight training area (which I don't step into).  They have a small area between the weight machines and weight training area for like workouts, yeah gets a little too crowded for me to even want to work out there.  The studio they have is very small, but they offer numerous amount of classes.  One of them is bound to capture your interest.  Bathroom/locker room is pretty clean.  Everything is always in stock.  They could afford to get new towels though, I always end up getting some ripped up towels.  The steam room is always a delight after a workout.  Staff members are pretty cool. [Side note: Now what I DON'T appreciate: I was on a no commitment, month-to-month plan with the gym and I was paying by cash. After 2 months, I realized I had accumulated some school debts to pay off and decided to stop going to the gym.  Lord behold, I get a bill last week for the past 4 months that I have NOT been going...they said they've been calling me but hellooooo if I don't pick up the phone how about sending me a letter ASAP!? Ugh, anyways it was a reminder to READ the fine print, I had to pay off the past 4 months. Funny isn't it? I was trying to save money by leaving the gym and end up having to pay for it anyways.]Anyways now that I'm back for the month, I shall make usage of the cardio machines (as always) and that steam room!
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2013,12/15/2013,226,636,6,14,9>I've only gotten into raw bar/steamers/lobster rolls/stuffies only about 4 years ago via my girlfriend and her family who are from New England. So when Off The Hook showed up in my Yelp feed, I was stoked; finally a spot in the hood to get raw oysters, steamers, lobster roll, etc. 4-5 visits in, my feelings are a bit mixed about Off The Hook. Yes, brilliant idea to finally have a raw bar in Astoria, great location too, but I feel like they still have some rough edges they can smooth out. Lets start with the positives:-super fresh raw oysters, little necks and shrimp - definitely make sure to get an order with your meal-a nice vibe, pleasant servers-the grilled oysters are flat out off the chain - another must try as well as the pollock bltNow while OTH will continue to receive my business just on the above alone, I think they need to keep the menu simple, with typical New England style raw bar classics. This leads me to their lobster roll. No need for a fancy bun, weird dressing, and all these other fixins they use. Use some fat ole chunks of claw meat/tail meat, light on the mayo and spices, on a lightly buttered hot dog style roll. I get people like being creative when it comes to lobster rolls, but the simpler the better in my book. The lobster meat should be the star, not the roll, mayo, spices, etc. And for $17 bucks!? As they say on ESPN - "C'mon mannnnnnnn!" The drink menu could use a revamp (not a big fan of their beer selection) and maybe throw in some other classic dishes like stuffed quahogs, fried spearing, etc. and this place would be so money I'd come in twice a week guarenteed. All in all, a great addition to the hood and must visit for any seafood fan.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2013,12/14/2013,474,53,10,11,10>Il Bambino is one of my favorite spots in all of Astoria. The amazing food, friendly service, and outdoor back garden earned my five stars! To start, I always order the chickpea panzanella. In fact, I often want to stop in and just get this salad to go because I love it so much! The portion is perfect to share as an appetizer with two or three people. The salad has a lemon-taste and is loaded with arugula, tomatoes, and crunchy pieces of bread. The fingerling potato salad is also a delicious appetizer option. The portion size is slightly smaller than the panzanella salad, but the rich truffle oil aioli taste packs a big punch! Il Bambino is known for their paninis and I completely understand why- they are all awesome! I have been satisfied with every sandwich I have tried. The smoked bacon is my favorite of the ones I have sampled thus far. The fried eggplant with hot sweet peppers, the sweet sausage with rosemary aioli, and the porchetta are also all quite tasty. I have not eaten any of the brunch paninis yet (served Friday, Saturday, and Sunday), but they are all very tempting! Il Bambino, thanks for being such an amazing dining destination in Astoria!
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2013,5/4/2013,361,716,9,9,9>Albeit a little loud, a wonderful little wine bar with a fantastic selection of delicious wines and a snarky, but really fun, bartender that makes for a really cool low-key date spot.I found plenty of seating on a late Friday night and settled down with a wonderful glass of Cotes de Castillon. I hadn't heard of it before and asked the bartender what he thought of it.He looked at me and asked, "Do you like good wine?""Yes, of course.""Then you'll love this," he walked off muttering, "As if I would serve terrible wine."I loved his tongue-in-cheek act of being a snooty French bartender (he's really Romanian). I went to use the restroom and when I returned, I found a glass with a small pour of the mentioned wine in it. As I sipped it, he graciously asked what I thought of it. When I expressed my approval, he gave me a generous pour and explained the wine and its region to me. Come here if you have a sense of humor and want to get schooled (in wine).
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2012,5/3/2013,472,510,9,10,10>I've been here a handful of times, in fact, I paid a visit just yesterday afternoon to pick up some sweet treats with the bf.  I'm a bit confounded by the choice negative reviews of Sugar Rush.  I think we need to consider the proper context when thinking of the merits of this candy store.  First off, Forest Hills is a prime neighborhood and the retail stores in these neck of the woods certainly have a hefty rent to pay, I'm sure of this.  To claim that $10.99 per pound for their candy is exorbitant is probably a bit unfair.  Surely, it isn't the cheapest, but I don't know of any candy store within the area that is as charming and visually inviting as Sugar Rush.  If you want a Kit-Kat, go to Duane Reade and avoid this place, but if you want an experience and some well-curated candies, only then should you consider paying Sugar Rush a visit.  (The bottom line:  if one can afford to dine and/or live in Forest Hills, I think it's fair to say s/he has enough discretionary income to visit SR on an occasional basis.)What's great about this candy store, is the wide variety of sweets in their arsenal of goodies.  They have a ton of chocolate-covered treats (almonds, gummy bears, malt balls, etc)., along with popular hard candies and all the assortments you'd typically find in a movie theater.  The higher-end stuff can be found by the counter, and here you will discover chocolate truffles, chocolate-coated pretzels (the chocolate-peanut butter is delicious), and other such yummy bon-bons.  They also carry gourmet/artisanal chocolate candy bars that typically stock the shelves of boutique candy shops and higher end supermarkets.  There are even some vintage candies (think Sky Bar), and even some quirky candy items as well (my bf once gifted a candy-coated scorpion that he bought here).  From what I have experienced, Sugar Rush is a candy store that can please a wide array of sweet tooth palates.  As far as customer service goes, to-date, I've never once had a bad experience.  So, Sugar Rush, I'm still sweet on you.

I was planning on writing a review expressing how overpriced it is, what? $3 for a cupcake... why would i do that?It really is my fault, i should never have even tried it... i should have just drove a couple of blocks down... but i heard that these cupcakes were really good... oh please how good can they be? how much better than Martha's can they be? Yes... 2 designer cupcakes later Martha's was forever ruined for me. Light and fluffy, tasty creamy. It didn't even bother me that i felt a little effeminate ordering cupcakes with names of designers. Yes these cupcakes were unnecessarily pretty. I was just going to devour them anyway... I found myself marveling at how nice they looked before wiping the drool off my chin. yeah i'll be back... cash in hand, i'll be the reluctant regular but know this... somewhere deep down i'll still be regretting the day i walked through the doors of your pretty little shop. in the mean time give me another Hermes.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2013,5/1/2013,118,139,8,10,10>Mezze Place excels in a cuisine category in which it is exceedingly difficult to stand out. It's the kind of place that makes you realize that all those other times you thought you were having a great meal, you were so naive.It's a gorgeous space, communal, you can see everyone else and overhear conversation even if you'd rather not but it's still romantic. Dark wood tables, beautiful lights. The drink menu is nice.  We were inspired to start with beer which I rarely do anymore and it was good. After I finished the beer, I declared my intention to switch to wine and the server reccomended a truly amazing Syrah that went wonderfully with the food.  At first, I didn't understand though why the alcohol selection wasn't more Mediterranean but now I think with the drinks its all about choosing without regional prejudice what goes best with the food on the menu.  They also serve a house tea I had with dessert that's fantastic. My sweetheart was in charge iof ordering and wanted the mixed starter plate, which turned out to be wise.  Like all great meals, the delights started visually - gorgeous presentation of main ingredients (hummus, eggplant, haloummi) with spices and oliv oil - everything colorful and shimmering (and matching the color wheel of the restaurant itself!) and the crisp flavors delivered on the promise of the aesthetics . The biggest revelation was the tahini served not as a condiment but as a side, an incredibly delicious and nuanced side prepared with parsley mint and cilantro.   The chick pea stew seemed wonderful at the time but updating my draft 2 weeks later I can't remember why. I'll have to go order again and update. I loved that the eggplant in the Lamb Sania was lightly cooked, defying my usual preference for mushy and that the lamb was hardly spiced at all, just really great ground lamb.  My sweetheart said "it's kind of dry" which is her word for "I can't justify not loving this but I don't." Still overall, we were thrilled with this place.We were full - really full - caught by surprise by the expanding bread we used in the mixed starter plate. No regrets but we tried to turn down dessert.  The server brought us rice pudding anyway - it's a place with that kind of graciousness - she knew it was wrong to miss that rice pudding - and we did find room for it - I didn't eat again until 24 hours later - I was that full - and also that aesthetically sated. I still remember the thrill of discovering "mediterannean cusine" almost 30 years ago as a college kid in upstate NY.  I thought I could subsist on smashed chickpea, smokey eggplant and strained yogurt for the rest of my lide. For better or worse, I almost got my wish.  Between my extended flirtation with and years of actual commitment to vegetarianism and veganism, and from time to time budget issues, I ate so much of the mediterannean staples I lost my passion for them - still ate them, still even craved them, but never excited about them.    Then Mezze Place reminded me of that first time....
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/16/2013,4/30/2013,315,250,18,20,12>My wife told me one night lets go eat out. She said, "Henan" food. I said sure, "Hunan", NO, "Henan" with an "E". Never heard of this part of China before, so I said why not.The restaurant is located on the basement level. I must have walked right past this place several times, I never knew a  restaurant even existed here!Once you walk in you can visually see and smell that this is going to be something special! The staff here is friendly, but really don't speak a lick of English, even their "Ching-lish" Chinese and English combination was weak.Thank God I married my multilingual wife, she was able to explain all the dishes on the menu. They also posted a bulletin board with pictures of the various dishes they serve to help the non speaking Chinese patrons and the "ABC's" (American Born Chinese)After placing your order just find a seat and wait. When it's ready they will call you. After consuming your food , clean up after yourself and dump out the trash, stroll up to the counter and pay, sorry, no credit cards, CASH ONLY! Must try, Pork pancake! I don't know what "Henan magic" they do to this mince pork filling, but it is delicious!  The Big Tray of chicken is also a must have, swimming in a fiery concoction of spicy peppercorns and potatoes, hand pulled noodles are nestled nicely on top of this tray of chicken, can life get any better?We also tried the beef soup in vermicelli, delicate slices of beef in a light flavorful broth. I heard this place is famous for the lamb and dumplings. Too bad I only have one stomach, we'll save that for the next visit. Remember boys and girls, it's "Henan with and "E" not "U"
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2013,4/29/2013,287,270,9,12,10>I may or may not be biased because this little lover is located within walking distance of my apartment and is cheaper than any speakeasy-esque bar you will ever find in Manhattan. It may or may not also have something to do with the fact that this bar was chock-full of very good looking men (my boyfriend included, of course). But aside from those definite perks, Dutch Kills is just a real charmer. Owned by the same bloke who is responsible for Milk & Honey, Dutch Kills has the same attention to detail and variety, but is less expensive, less snooty (you can actually walk in and not be turned away for not having a reservation) and accepting of credit cards. The Don Lockwood was definitely my favorite cocktail; with bourbon, scotch, maple syrum and chocolate bitters it was both smooth and complex. I was also a huge fan of the menu itself, which showed the sources for all of their cocktail inspiration; much of the time the inspiration was a hundred-year old cocktail boook, which I obviously searched the heck out of on Ebay. The service was admittedly kind of slow, but given how packed they were I wasn't too upset about it. Our server was very attentive and knowledgable about the menu, providing suggestions based on our tastes. I will definitely be back for their $8 all-night specials on Mondays, and eventually might speak to them about moving a cot into their bar area.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/23/2012,4/28/2013,101,229,10,12,13>The bottom line: this is a nice little out of the way spot in LIC with tasty food and a wide selection of beers for a reasonable price.  Cool place.  Definitely worth a try.I went here for a going away party for a good friend and the lot of us got assigned to a central table in the middle of the bar.  The space is pretty big with one big open area around the bar.  There were maybe 20 - 30 people who cycled in and out of the place over the course of the evening and it never felt too crowded in there.  Although they were serving a limited menu in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, they still managed to have some choice items:1.  Garlic Fries - Just enough garlic so that you knew they were garlic-y, but not so garlic-y that dudes from the government came with a van to abduct you and send you to a "re-education facility" to destroy the intense breath demons that entered through your mouth and burrowed into your brain.2.  Chicken Wings - Tender, loaded with sauce, and not too spicy.  However, they were not super flavorful other than the mild spiciness of the sauce.  I still enjoyed them, though.3.  Mussels - I didn't personally eat these since I'm allergic to shellfish.  But, lots of people ordered them (and the same people re-ordered them, which can only be a good sign).It's also pretty close to the Vernon / Jackson 7 train stop so it's convenient for popping in for a party.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/11/2013,4/27/2013,65,193,5,8,7>This has become our new "go to" restaurant for Italian food. Personally my favorite Italian spot on Metropolitan Avenue and not the most expensive. They take great pride in their food and service, and I can really tell every time I dine here. One time we had to wait longer than usual for our entrees, so the owner apologized and gave us a free dessert. It happens, we weren't upset...but giving us dessert on the house really showed us that they know how to run a business and care about their customers. Our favorite appetizer on the menu is the polenta with cheese and imported speck. DELICIOUS. I have probably had about 3/4 of all the pastas on the menu (homemade) including having tried some of their wonderful specials. I was never disappointed. For dessert I highly recommend trying the panna cotta and apple tart. Cozy, comfortable and warm atmosphere with a friendly staff and wonderful food. Couldn't ask for more.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2012,4/26/2013,77,158,6,12,6>I was skeptical as I read the reviews here on how efficient it was to come here and get your social security business done but now I am a believer. They open at 7am and I got dropped off here right before 8am. You have to go through security and there was this guy who was making a big fuss about taking off his belt since he kept saying that he knew it wasn't going to set off the alarm. I went through security really quickly so I wouldn't have to deal with this agitated man on the elevator. One level up, down a few hallways, had my form filled out electronically and ready to go. Heard #37 called and looked down at my number (#38) and I was next. The whole process took at most 20 minutes or so. It was fast and easy as long as you had all your documentation with you. Of course the agitated man made another fuss about not accepting his birth certificate but there were enough guards around to feel safe. New card to come in the mail in 2 weeks. To make this as painless as possible, find the forms online, fill out electronically, print, bring all necessary documents with you and arrive early. All the guards and staff personnel were very friendly and helpful. It is not in the greatest neighborhood, a bit sketch, but once you're in the building, it's safe.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2012,4/25/2013,142,211,3,7,6>What do regional Chinese cuisine and Edison bulbs have in common? Not much, you may think, until you come to Biang!, Xian Famous Foods' new upscale dinette. The formula is quite simple. You take all of the authentic Chinese flavor of Xian Famous Foods and you serve it up in a slightly upscale modern setting (which these days means an ironic nod to the early 1900s - you know, the old timey flickering lightbulb, exposed brick, Williamsburg/LES tenement aesthetic). It sounds like it could be a sort of a half brained concept but Biang! does it really well. There are a few reasons you should give it a try. First, the majority of items on the menu are new to the Xian Famous Foods repertoire. Sure, you'll find the infamous liang pi cold skin noodles, which are mind blowing in their own right. But there is also a full-page section on chuan, or Chinese barbecue. How awesome is that! Put a bird on it - err I mean stick in it: lamb, beef stomach, tofu skin. The excitement just gets started there. Hot tofu in a bowl was one of my favorite dishes, due to its textural car-crash of pudding-like tofu, crisp cilantro, pickled vegetables and tangy soy-sauce and vinegar. Lamb dumplings taste like real lamb with a hint of cumin, while the grilled quail is served whole, with legs positioned in the air, covered in a simple salad of cilantro and vinegar. Regional nuances are played up big time at Biang! - much to the delight of the unaccustomed diner. I loved every bite. Second reason to go to Biang!: the place is nice - wooden seats, exposed brick, clean environs, high ceiling. You have to pinch yourself to remind you are not on Bedford Avenue but rather in Main Street Flushing. Third, the prices - my wife and I must have ordered 7 dishes (including desert) and couldn't have paid more than $20 a piece. Are these 1900s prices? Whatever, Biang! is an instant favorite.

<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/24/2012,8/2/2012,132,271,8,9,7>Oh Yelp and your deals!!! Bought the $5 for $10 deal and it was well worth it! (Dine-in only).Had a mid-morning snack here and was sure pleased at what I got. As you walk in, you get this feeling of peace and serenity that your local coffeehouses would definitely NOT give you. The place is quaint and stocked will homemade baked cakes... Red Velvet Latte. Like velvet in your mouth... what makes it even better is the raspberry factor that makes it red... (Did you really think they'd add red food coloring or beet juice to their coffee like they do the cake?) It's balance of raspberry, espresso and mocha puts Starbucks to shame... TO SHAME I TELL YOU! (And I'm a fan of Starbucks!) What made it even better was the variety of milk they had... from whole to skim to soy... Not many mom and pops serve different milk options, so I was glad about that.Was able to have a taste of the Panorama Latte. Caramel, chocolate, espresso, milk. I'll let that speak for itself. Again... shame on Starbucks.A medium will cost you about $4, quite comparable to Starbucks, but add in the care and attention they put into each drink here... it's actually priceless.Only sadness is that there's only one Panorama! So while on the go in different cities and boroughs, I'll have my Starbucks, but will be thinking of you the whole time Panorama.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2012,8/1/2012,361,716,5,15,11>A true hidden gem as I have lived in Astoria for over three years, walked past this establishment on 31st Ave  countless times without ever suspecting that a restaurant was ensconced within the impenetrable stone walls. Indeed I, along with other Astorians, had assumed that this was some sort of government building. I mean, Casa Galicia has been here for years and as of now (3/26/12), it still has fewer 10 reviews. Unheard of in a neighborhood full of yuppie foodies and Yelpers!A friend from Spain who happens to be from the Galicia area took me here. I felt a bit sheepish as he had only recently arrived from Spain a few months ago knew about this. When I met up with him, I wondered why we were meeting at JJ's (in Astoria, everyone knows JJ's Sushi -- it's like our Cheers) when he had clearly stated that we were going for tapas. He motioned me up the stairs of Casa Galicia (and at this point I thought he clearly lost it because it looked like we going into a govt building), when through the doors, I hear a flood of Spanish and swarthy dark-haired people mingling, laughing, and eating in a large and overly bright room.I had entered the inner sanctums of the Galician community. The building is actually a govt building owned by Spain and functions as a community center for the Spanish ex-pats. Casa Galicia is not technically a restaurant; it's a social club. While the looks of the place would not impress, nonetheless, the jovial nature, good fresh seafood that exceptionally well-priced, and the authentic nature of Casa Galicia makes this a rare and wonderful find in Astoria. The restaurant looks like a large community hall that you would find in a church and similarly decorated with harsh white lighting, haphazard white linen tablecloths, and tables and chairs dotting the room. It's very much a family friendly place as evidenced by the traces of crayon on the tablecloths and walls. While this is not a place for romance, it is a great place for casual dining with friends. We ordered Spanish tortilla (omelet with potatoes), fried fish (They were like large sardines, except not sardines. Very traditional from the Galicia region), Pulpo a la Gallego (octopus! My favorite), a bottle of Galician white wine Ribiero, and finished off with tarta de Santiago, a traditional Galician almond cake. The portions are large, filling, and very cheap. Our bill with tax and tip came around $60 for all this. I very much recommend the pulpo if you love octopus. It was cooked perfectly (for I hate rubbery octopus). If you have a sweet tooth, the almond cake is a real treat. Light and sweet, it was a great ending to the meal.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2012,7/31/2012,142,211,6,9,10>What makes Lemon Ice King so good? I'll give you three reasons. First, history: this place has been around for over 60 years. It screams old school New York, and beckons a bygone era of when Corona was a thriving, no-nonsense, middle-class Italian American community. Second, they keep it simple. Single-faceted menu of Italian ices in over three dozen varieties. No mixing, no toppings, no other items; just Italian ice. I like that. Third, the texture. Lemon Ice King understands that a truly amazing Italian ice requires a smooth consistency -- so smooth that it is molecularly barely on the verge of going from solid ice granules to liquified slush. It's that precarious in-between state, short lived as it may be, that is the beauty and craftsmanship of Lemon Ice King. Add to that the subtle textural contribution of the flavor varietal (e.g., lemon has lemon seeds, coconut has coconut flecks, mint chocolate has mini chocolate chips) and you have a party in your cup, which incidentally will only set you back $1.50.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2012,7/29/2012,472,510,13,14,14>After a handful of futile attempts to try Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, it was great to finally have the chance to visit an alternative location in Douglaston, Queens.  In comparison, there's no wait time (at least when we went on a Saturday afternoon), and there is  ample parking within a shopping lot that houses a Fairway, Macy's, Toys R Us, and a Modell's Sporting Goods.  The storefront to this G's doesn't look all that enticing with it's huge tarp signage pointing to the pizzeria's entrance.  But without it, I can see how folks would not be able to locate the restaurant since it's view is slightly obstructed being on the lower level and right under the connecting parking lot bridge.  Better safe than sorry, so the saying goes (ergo, long live the unattractive Grimaldi's sign)!  We ordered the Grimaldi's House Salad with chicken, and really enjoyed this simple yet, very refreshing and crisp starter before moving onto a small sized pie with garlic and capers.  The pizza was absolutely delicious.  The crust was surprisingly thin yet, had some measure of softness to it.  It was perfectly sauced and the cheese was not overwhelming either.  The capers and garlic really added a bold and salty touch to an already excellent pizza.  To cap off our meal, we went with the spumoni for dessert.  You could tell the ice cream was fresh as it was creamy and full of flavor with that nice layer of pistachio.  Clearly it comes as no surprise why G's has garnered so much renown.  Not only is the pizza well-executed and simplistic, but the service was above par.  The young guys manning this location are really affable and competent.  Everything about my Grimaldi's experience was tops for me.  (Sidebar:  I couldn't help but compare this experience with my first time at the institution that is Di Fara's.  That was a bit of a hot mess).I'm excited for my next trip to G's, especially when the calzones looks pretty fantastic!
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/24/2012,7/28/2012,65,127,8,11,9>I didn't realize when I moved to Astoria, how well placed my apartment was to great food shopping.  I am super grateful after talking to a friend of mine that lives on Astoria Blvd.  She has to trek over to 30th Ave every time she shops.  Elliniki Agora is so convenient because it is close to several other shops and is open at any hour so you can do all of your food shopping at once or you can stop by every day for the best deal of the day.  If you do not see what you are looking for, ask - because they may have it in the back.  There just is not enough room to put everything out but that doesn't mean that they don't have it.I buy all my nuts, fruits and vegetables here and I have found their product to be consistently fresh and their prices to be lower than the supermarkets and their neighbor - United Bros.  They have a deal of the day cart with substantially reduced pricing out in the front filled with products that are ripe but these are usually still fresh as long as you consume them on the same day.The cash register is in the back of the store and Elliniki Agora is popular so there can often be a line but it moves super quick.  They don't take Amex but they do take debit/credit cards.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2012,7/27/2012,90,616,6,7,7>We all know how much I love roti and my doubles.  These are some of the most delicious creations known to us humans.  I trekked an hour from Midwood to have a real Trinidadian meal in Richmond Hill.  After conducting research of amazing places, thanks Yelp Talk! and other current yelpers in the five boroughs, I came to the conclusion that this place was getting rave reviews.  Yes, it is at least a ten block walk from the A train and yes there are long lines.  Generally, lengthy queues bode for a demand for the food.  Fortunately, I was able to ask this nice gentleman behind me, who helped decide in what drink to order.  There are many different drinks on the menu and the man on the line told me that he enjoys their homemade coconut juice, but alas I was too late.  Arriving at a late hour of 9:30 pm, this coveted beverage that they brew there was depleted.  All that was left was either the pouch or the canned version.**Note to self: Must come earlier to try such talked about drink.  Eyeing the sea moss and mauby, I figured that I needed to save something delicious for next time.  For $7.50, I had the delight of getting an Apple J(apple flavored soda), a potato roti, two orders of doubles.  The potato roti was $3.50 and the doubles were $1 each, and that results in the sparkling apple drink equating to $2.  Well, at least that is what is remaining.  Either way, any meal under $8 makes me smile.  The roti was thick, heavy, and filled with lentils.  I was happy to see In my opinion, the service was laid back, and being that I was not in a major rush.  I was able to wait my turn.  Perhaps, others found it to be rude, since there was a line and they were voraciously hungry.  I was fine, since I already had dinner and a coffee.  Not sure what others felt about customer service, but I found that the man behind the counter was very kind.  He was patient in asking me if I wanted roti with or without lentils(with lentils, I said) and also what kind of sauce on the doubles(I said kachuela and the tamarind, not the spicy--yes, I'm wimpy, I know).  I was happy that he inquired about my needs and also took care of them. He wrapped my roti separately to not get it soggy and also got me a huge dollop of chickpeas and all the sauces that I requested.  I do not know about you, but I say that is just thoughtful!Right now, I am at home enjoying my doubles and my potato roti in glee!  I do not mean to brag, but I rather review while the savory and spicy goodness fills my tummy.  Oh my eyes are big as quarters right now, since I await to have some of this tomorrow for lunch.  So excited!
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2012,7/26/2012,237,200,4,6,5>YOU WON'T BE SORRY THAT YOU WENT TO PSARI!A friend of ours has been begging for us to check out Psari for several weeks and we finally gave in and went last night. We were promised that there would be fresh seafood and that's exactly what we got. We arrived for dinner at 7:30 pm and were brought to a lovely table outside. There was a cool breeze that cut the humidity that made dining alfresco so much more bearable. This is a big plus that the tree lined avenues of Astoria provide as an advantage over the smoggy sidewalks of Manhattan.BYOBs are always nice, but there is a lot to be said about a restaurants that offer a fully stocked bar and extensive, yet affordable wine list.We ordered a nice bottle of Pinot Grigio that did not break the bank and went well with the seafood bounty that would be our meal. For appetizers we started off with the Grilled Octopus and the Saganaki (Lightly Fried Kefalograviera Cheese). Unlike some of my former favorite places in the area, the Octopus was a generous portion while pleasantly priced at $15. Similarly, the Saganaki was a nice thick slice that had a thin layer of breading and could easily be cut by a fork and we broke it down further in smaller bite-size pieces. Both appetizers came pre-cut to make it easier for sharing among our dinner guests. Be careful not to fill up on their moist garlic bread! While it is indeed served hot, fresh, and flavorful, you want to be careful not to get too full as the best is yet to come.As we were eating our appetizers, the owner came by our table and asked how everything was thus far. We complimented him for serving such fresh and delicious food and told him that this was our first visit to his restaurant. He told us to enjoy our meal and then casually walked over to our waitress with special instructions. Our waitress darted into the kitchen and came back in a flash with a sample version of the Dip Combo with Pita. No Mediterranean meal is complete without meze and the owner wanted to be sure that we did not leave without tasting a little bit of each of the classic dips which he served daily.Tzatziki - Yogurt, Cucumber & Garlic DipTaramosalata - Caviar DipSkordalia - Potato & Garlic DipMelitzanosalata - Eggplant DipHands down, the Melitzanosalata was my favorite of the foursome. As I loaded up my pita point with yet another scoop, I noticed that there were several larger pieces of eggplant interspersed within the dip. It added a nice touch to the texture which would have otherwise become boring if it had been just a homogenous puree on a plate.Lucky for us that we did not go overboard in ordering our entrees as we could already feel ourselves getting full. For the main meal we had the Baby Lamb Chops and the Broiled Combo (Salmon, Flounder, Shrimp & Scallops prepared with garlic and butter). As our sides we had the lemon potatoes and greek potato chips. Normally I like my fish grilled which means that it is simply prepared with olive oil and fresh lemon juice. Having the broiled combo was a nice change of pace and had plenty of flavor from the garlic while the butter kept all the pieces moist without making them overly greasy. The lamb chops were cooked to my preference of medium rare while simultaneously charred to perfection and finished with squeezed fresh lemon. The lemon potatoes were soft to touch and melted in our mouths while the greek potato chips went well with whatever we had leftover from the dips. I'm glad that we paced ourselves with the provided pitas because the chips and dips were more pleasantly paired.We were absolutely stuffed and had no room for dessert, but knowing that I would be reviewing all parts of the meal I had intended on trying one of their greek selections. While it was nice to see after dinner drinks like Ouzo and Raki, it would have been nice to see traditional choices like baklava (a sweet pastry made of layers of filo pastry filled with chopped nuts and sweetened with syrup or honey) or galactoburico (semolina custard in a filo wrap with a honey drizzle). The choices that were listed seemed out of place and irrelevant as regular dessert choices for a greek restaurant.Overall our dining experience at Psari hit all the right notes. The food was among some of the best that we have had in Astoria or anywhere for that matter. Our waitress and the busser were available and attentive throughout our meal and never made us feel rushed while always clearing the table of our empty plates and refilling our water glasses without ever having to flag someone down. The owner was a gracious host and wanted to personally ensure that our first experience in his restaurant was memorable and that we would want to return in the near future. I can certainly say without reservation, that we will be making dinner reservations here again very soon.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2011,7/25/2012,10,24,5,6,4>5 stars means As Good as it Gets.  Believe me, this is difficult for me because I have somewhat of an attachment to Seva in Astoria.  As of today, Tawa Tandoor is on par with Seva for me.This is an Indian/Asian Fusion joint in Jackson Heights that opened up 7 months ago.  What differentiates this 'fusion' is that you won't get, let's say, a lamb vindaloo with thai chili paste or bamboo shoots in it.  The menu has several purely Indian dishes and apps and also several purely asion dishes and apps.  All I tried this time was Indian.They bravely chose to set up shop right across from Jackson Diner (which was my first taste of Indian--many moons ago).  The decor is sleek and minimal.  Crown Moldings hugging the roof.  Very clean inside.  Servers are extremely quick, dilligent and friendly.  Not unlike other Indian restaurants, they serve Buffet Lunch during certain early hours.  Nicole and I came for dinner.We had the Samosa (Of Course (Vegeterian.  Potato, Peas, Cashew Paste)) and the Aloo Tikki Chole (2 steamed then fried potato patties in a delicious tamarind yogurt chutney with chickpeas that was spicy and refreshing).We decided to split the Tandoor Mix Grill, which came out on a sizzling cast iron serving tray with the typical mix of fantastic red tandoor dark meat chicken, malai kabab, shrimp and seekh kabab.  The seekh kabab, which is spiced ground lamb, was seasoned so perfectly to my liking, that I have to say that it is better than Seva's.They are still awaiting their liquor license, but you can BYOB which is nice.  What gives this place 5 stars over the four I was going to give it (at least until going back for curry dishes, my true barometer) is the service.  During our dining experience, we were served by our waitress (Pema, who is great), two waiters for Water and Clearing our table settings, the floor manager who was interested in our feedback and asked if he can get anything fo us, and ultimately the Manager, Projwal Prahdan, who was authentically interested in our experience.  This place is clean and run well.  The food is priced fairly and the serving sizes are large.  The service is awesome.  Parking in Jackson Heights is a pain but it's worth the aggrivation to dine at Tawa Tandoor and then walk right past Jackson Diner to the Patel Brothers store to pick up some Garam Masala for your kitchen cabinet.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2012,7/24/2012,225,493,3,11,4>Not a true 5, but more of a 4.7.This is quite a small cozy place, that feels homey and romantic enhanced by the warm decor and dim lighting. Upbeat music is played at the perfect volume level.We arrived immediately following a table of 6 and behind us another party of 2 walked in.  We were seated immediately and started looking at our menus.  Our waiter came by with some water and some pita bread and olive tapenade (which was delish) and kindly let us know that he was the only one on tonight and that 3 tables just sat at the same time, so to forgive him if he was a little slow getting to us.  I thought that was a nice touch instead of just ignoring us.The reasons I think they fell just short of a full 5 stars:  My water glass had lipstick on it, which was replaced, once I pointed it out and one of our wine glasses was chipped.  The wine list itself is nothing special and doesn't compare to the level of the food, it was a bit disappointing.  Now enough with the not so good, let's move on the the great stuff!The menu is quite tantalizing, not overly large, but quite a nice variety to please anyone.Appetizers:  The Mussels, came out in a large bowl that was beyond capacity, it's a large portion.  They were excellent, tender and addictive. Swimming in a light tomato broth hinted with fennel was unbelievable, take the spoon they provide you with and use it to eat up the broth.  The Truffled Gnocchi were reminiscent of those I had in Bologna, Italy and were both light and decadent at the same time. They melted in your mouth and were topped with strips of prosciutto, mushrooms, peas and asparagus.  The veggies and prosciutto were slightly crisp and provided the perfect texture contrast to the gnocchi.  The meal was off to an excellent start.Entrees: Braised Short Rib served over a creamy polenta with caramelized brussel sprouts.  Incredibly tender, I never had to touch my knife.  The flavors went so well together and the brussel sprouts offered a tasty contrast to the richness of the meat and polenta.  What a wonderfully awesome dish.  The Chicken Under a Brick was cooked perfectly; moist chicken with a crispy skin.  Served with escarole and cannellini beans over a light sauce; the dish was well balanced and completely delicious.Dessert:  The espresso was bold and smooth and perfect.  I always love a good chocolate lava cake, but a Nutella lava cake, even better!  Served with a great  creamy vanilla ice cream and chopped hazelnuts it was completely decadent and amazing.  The chopped hazelnuts offered a nice textural element that you don't normally get with a lava cake.  Service:  Our waiter was very friendly and did an awesome job being the only guy there, no bus boy or any help at all.  Bravo to him!This is a true gem, that serves some extraordinary food.
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/21/2013,10/24/2013,36,186,5,5,7>This place is so cute! I'd heard some buzz that this place would be opening in Astoria soon, but wasn't sure where or when. Turns out its on the very street I live on! I passed it while walking to dinner on Broadway and was so impressed! At first I wasn't sure what it was...it kinda looks like someone's really awesome apartment on display. But then I saw the "Lockwood" sign and remembered hearing about a new store. The storefront is this huge open space that immediately draws you in. Its honestly just awesome to look at because its so bright and fun looking! But then its filled with the coolest stuff - furniture, clothes, gifts, bags, jewelry, home decor, toys, everything! And not your average run-of-the-mill stuff, either. They have one of the best selection of inventory I've ever seen! This place is absolutely perfect for furnishing your home or picking up a neat gift for someone special in your life. They also have items that pay homage to the New Yorker in you :)I believe they're still in the "soft opening" phase right now and will be fully open in September. Stop by! Its just a little ways around the corner off of Broadway - you will not be disappointed!

A friendly Latino restaurant, albeit a bit intimidating if you don't speak Spanish (yes, it's that local). Came in on a UYE by the lovely Maria, we ordered family style and the food was enough to last me through a hibernation. The Hilachas were unfortunately out, but we made do!- Chile Rellenos - stuffed peppers. As a pleasant surprise, it was not spicy, but deliciously savory.- Pupusas de Queso - Cheesy and yummy. Came with dipping sauce.- Tamales - good. I don't know why, but Latino tamales tastes better than the Chinese ones.- Yuca con Chicarron - Savory deep-fried pork fat with dried fried yuca. Delicious combo, though I worry about my cholesterol.- Caldo des Res - hands down the best Latino beef soup I've ever tasted. Perfectly salted, great with rice.- Mora - that's blackberry juice. Sooo good. Get it before they run out.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2013,10/22/2013,314,114,8,12,12>Despite my hatred for AYCE and buffet places, I LOVED River. Usually at an AYCE, I feel like I can never eat my money's worth and feel more miserable than satisfied after the meal. River has got the quality and price ratio down! Best sushi AYCE I've been to ever.My favorite part about this place is hands down the sashimi option. Most AYCE sushi places I've been to only offer nigiri and have stringent rules about eating all the rice, thus filling you up faster. River has a good variety of sashimi that you can eat as much as you want. Go crazy, put some double digits on that order form!I also loved the variety on the menu. When I got sick of eating raw fish, there were soo many delicious options of cooked appetizers to choose from. A lot of the dishes are good, but did not knock my socks off.For the price we paid (around $23 for dinner), this place is gold!

I consider Wafa's another gem in my neighborhood. The food tasted great and service was excellent.Appetizer - We ordered their appetizer special of the day which was some kind of rice, almost like risotto wrapped in a leaf. Very unique taste. At first, I didn't like it but after a few more, I was eating them as if I was popping pills. It has a really strange sour but yet a hint of bitter taste. It's difficult to describe. I don't think it's a dish for everyone but I certainly enjoyed it.2 orders of Spinach Pie (2 piece per order) - The pie was great. Good size and nicely made.Hummus - Awesome. Very smooth texture, love the garlic taste, and the pita bread was good too.Mousakaha - Another type of dip. Consist of eggplant, chickpeas and garlic sauteed in olive oil and pomegranate juice and also served with pita.SandwichesLamb Shawerma - Excellent. Perfect size, great ingredients, great taste.Kefta Kebab - This would be my choice next time. It's charcoal grilled ground beef and lamb, parsley, onions and spices. Served on pita with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles and tahini sauce. The meat was very tender and juicy. The Lamb Shawerma was good but I wasn't too crazy about the red wine, vinegar combination with the meat and pickle. I didn't hate it but after trying the Kefta Kebab, I prefer Kefta Kebab over the Lamb Shawerma, that's just my personal preference. Drink - They have a few decent beers. None of that beer pong lager stuff. But from my understanding, they use to have BYOB everyday, now it's only Wednesday. So I'm definitely coming here Wednesdays from now on. I ordered a Abita Light which came out to $6 bucks, I'd rather save money and get beer from the deli next door.Dessert - BAKLAVA! Sweet and Sticky!Service - Superb! Both waitress and waiter were extremely polite, they had great timing with the food, great recommendations, and they're just really sweet.Verdict - I'll be back! BYOB Wednesday, I'll see you in two more days!
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2013,10/20/2013,29,86,2,8,7>Soy Bean Flower Chen is a small, nondescript take-out window located at the front of a flower shop. It is most definitely worth a try as I think they have some of the best soy-based products you can get in downtown Flushing.  It is my go-to place for douhua which is a kind of silken tofu pudding.You might have tried douhua in a number of different ways depending on what region of China the dish is from. In the northern regions of China, douhua is typically served with soy sauce. The Sichuan version of the dish is prepared with a variety of spicy accompaniements like chili oil and Sichuan peppers. Cantonese cuisine serves douhua as a dessert dish and is often served during dim sum as well. The silky smooth tofu is scooped into a bowl and topped with a sweet, ginger-flavored syrup. This is my favorite preparation and I always get a large container to bring home since it keeps well in the fridge for a few days.Tip: If you are a fan of soy milk, order the unsweetened version and ask for a side of the ginger-flavored syrup. Sweeten to taste!
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/31/2013,10/19/2013,41,89,6,7,6>Came here with a few friends after running in kissena park. We weren't dressed in dinner wear which stopped us from going to the hibatchi restaurant a couple stores down. Some of us had to stop and use the ATM at the local bodega cause this place is CASH ONLY. I was very pleasantly surprised by the ambiance of the place. Wasn't expecting anything fancy cause of the low prices, but this place was clean, had high ceilings, and felt modern. Normally, I wouldn't order any starters, but since the prices were so low, $6 for entrees, I figured I'd have to try some. I went with the deep fried string beans, which sounds strange, but they're sort of a "healthier" asian version of french fries. They're seasoned in a peppery power and dipped into a spicy sauce that makes them  addicting; definitely great for sharing. My friends went with the chicken sliders, which were a big hit, while the vegetable dumplings were a bust. They use the same sauce in the sliders as they do for the dipping sauce; beware lactards, there's definitely some dairy in it. To the entrees: I ordered the chicken curry, which was made with coconut milk, which came with a disproportional amount of rice. By the end of my meal I had a pile of white rice left at the bottom of my bowl. The curry was relatively tasty, although it could have used a bit more pizazz. Same could be said about the sautéed broad noodles with beef. In hindsight, this probably could have been fixed by just asking for some hot sauce. We were all very full and satisfied by the end of the meal, props to the yelp reviews which pointed us to the right direction.
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2013,10/18/2013,30,160,3,6,4>For my birthday I wanted a quiet, intimate, low-key dinner. I yelped a lot of places and this place seemed to have amazing reviews. So I bit the bullet and bought the Yelp deal. It did not disappoint.  When we arrived there were only 2 tables of patrons. We were seated immediately (we had a reservation so make one!). Our waiter was very nice, explained the specials and let me know that it was ladies night and I would get a free glass of wine (Yah!). We started out with an appetizer that resembled an arepa with mozzarella cheese, arugula, and a lemon caper sauce. Oh my. It was delicious. The sauce really elevated the flavor of that dish. I had the chicken under a brick and hubby had the steak.  Amazing. I know your rolling your eyes over there, but seriously it was. Amazing. The flavor of my chicken was just right and the skin was so crispy and salty!! Argh, so good. The accompanying potatoes were just right.  Hubby's steak was steakhouse worthy. Super juicy, perfectly cooked and the right amount of sauce. He had spinach and potatoes on the side which were just as good.  I kept stealing little pieces of steak off his plate (hey it was my birthday). We tried to order grilled asparagus but they ran out.  When I checked in I got the free Lava cake as well. Because I had the Yelp deal, the ladies night freebie, and the free Yelp check-in the waiter let me know I had to use only one, which was fine with me. I used the Yelp deal and paid for the wine and cake. That cake was amazing and perfect ending to one of the most delicious meals I have ever had.  The service was fine, but there are only 2 waiters so they seem to go between all the tables. When we didn't get the asparagus one server went to check and then our original waiter let us know they ran out but he forgot to tell us.  No worries. Somehow we got a free glass of wine for all the little bit of wonky service which was okay with me. Overall it was a perfect birthday dinner and we plan on making this one of our go to spots.

I'm not 100% sure, but it seems the culinary battleground is the latest arms race going here, with the Belgians entering the fray from their mobile attack fortress.parked in a strategic position on 71st Ave (virtually) every Sunday, the Wafels and Dinges truck is a great snack at any time of the day. I haven't tried their more decadent topping options, like chili, pulled pork, or bacon, but the baseline stuff like spekuloos, Nutella, and fresh fruit are all solid choices.service is always friendly and with a smile, and you usually get your order pretty quick. I highly suggest grabbing a wafel then walking a block to eat in Station Square (the courtyard for the LIRR). or stand there and demolish it in 23 seconds, which I am more inclined to do.it's fairly cheap, and it's a refreshing change of pace from the other dessert options in the immediate area.it's great to see Forest Hills' Sunday scene is really picking up, with the W&D truck and the highly popular farmers' market adding to the Austin Street dining/shopping scene. long live the (Belgian) king!

Though I don't like getting off at 75th Ave., I make the effort to skip Chinese supermarkets and go to a Japanese market instead. Prices usually steeper but I like being surrounded by a maze of Japanese items--it feels like a mini Tokyo. I love this mini market...it's kind of like Family Mart in Astoria but a little bigger with a wider range of snacks and seafood and vegetables.Lots of beauty and skincare products as well, for those who want to be Japanese-beautified--you know who you are. They have a lot of fresh produce, which I don't really see much in Japanese marts and onigiri, which is a little expensive than normal but you won't find it anywhere else in Forest Hills! The crab salad and shrimp tempura rolls are amazing. They run out of them really quick so grab them before late-noon.

There are multiple long piers with plenty of benches and place to spread out (and binoculars for a great view).I really wish the Long Island sign wasn't there. Now, I know it's historic and all that. And yes, this is all technically Long Island. But Western Queens is Long Island only insofar as Africa is an island.If you want to jog/bike, take a date here after dinner at one of the many restaurants nearby, or simply enjoy the beauty of NYC, Gantry Plaza is a great choice.

<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2012,1/12/2013,53,16,6,9,6>I was wandering over to the new Subway shop on Bell Blvd and noticed that this place had opened. I was not enthusiastic after the huge "Bareburger" disappointment in the neighborhood, but friendly and eager staff coaxed me in and for that I am glad.In case you don't realize it, this place is a venture of the nearby family butcher shop that was there when I moved here almost 30 years ago, and it wasn't new then.  I've always liked the shop and had faith the new restaurant wouldn't disappoint.I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, initially disappointed that the bacon and cheese were mixed in with the meat not sitting on top.  But once I bit in I was hooked, the flavor was wonderful, definitely something you would serve to guests visiting your home.  On top of that (literally) was their house-made barbecue sauce, which was tangy and sweet like the famous Peter Luger sauce, but with more tomato and BBQ flavor.  I was hooked.The beer-battered onion rings were hands-down the best in town, they were crispy and loaded with flavor.  The homemade cole-slaw was also a total winner, neither sweet nor drowning in mayonnaise. A healthy and delicious complement to a great meal.On top of that my total bill was $14, quite a bit less than recent expeditions to Bareburger and Donovan's.  I was very pleased and can see myself becoming a regular here.  The icing on the cake was the staff - friendly and personable without being "in your face".  If you are looking at this I suggest you try it for yourself.  I welcome this restaurant to the neighborhood, especially since their family has been part of "the scene" here for generations.  I maintain that Bayside is one of the most habitable parts of NYC if not the world, and one of the great pleasures is the array of shops, bars and restaurants.  This newest one is a delight, a jewel, and I look forward to returning again soon.

The L sought out veggie places for morning eats and found this little gem not too far from JFK. Very low key and painted in a most placid shade of blue we took to our booth and gandered at their extensive menu. While the vegan choices were limited, with the guidance of one of the gentleman there, I quickly settled on a Tofini Pita crammed with the most colorful raw veggies, a treat for me after weeks of cooked food. Along with a very flavorful and equally bright carrot apple juice my innards were doing a happy dance at the fresh bounty set before me. I finished every bit! Smile ...

Simple idea, maybe not as revolutionary as the plane, car or our handy smart-phone, but it serves the purpose to provide a quick simple meal.King Souvlaki of Astoria does just that, with their version at $2.75 a stick. This cart has a tasty option that is fast, cheap and tasty. You may say that all carts are created equal, but like BBQ they are not. These guys seem to have more of the charcoal flavor (which I love) and more crisp to the outside of their meat (no jokes please). Seasoning has all the traditional standards salt, pepper, but these guys add oregano. Maybe it was a mystery seasoning from the overhead train, don't know.What I do know is that King Souvlaki of Astoria has a good product that just satisfy my hunger pains and a quick fix of meat on a stick. Best way to enjoy, hot sauce, lemon, pepper; Outstanding...........

And on this particular Saturday afternoon, with a group of 13 hungry drunkards in tow, I went hunting (on my cellular device) for a decent pizza place to satisfy our mutual pizza craving. Truthfully, Basil Brick Oven Pizza was the first and only place I called, for two reasons:1. First of all, the man who picked up had a beautiful Italian accent, and I decided right then that it is a natural law of the universe that if you have a freshly accented Italian answering the phone at your pizza place, then your pizza must be at the very LEAST quite decent.2. They automatically agreed to seat our party of 13 with less than 15 minutes notice. We headed over there immediately like a clumsy gaggle of pizza-hungry zombies, and were not only greeted by the same friendly Italian man that we had spoken to on the phone, but by a gorgeously-set window-side table near the entrance. He gave us some wonderful appetizer recommendations consisting of a lovely salad and antipasto, and we ended up sharing a few of their absolutely delicious pizza's. The crust was wonderfully flaky and thin, and the toppings were divine. The dessert pizza (nuttella and nuts), was astounding as well.This place would really rock for delivery, but I would make the trek for the wonderful ambience, fantastic service, and LOW price tag! Thirteen of us ate for under $100.

I came here for brunch with a friend recovering from a long night out one grey sunday afternoonThe interior is bright and cheerful, a perfect spot for brunch on a depressing day. The Cafe has a geniune french feel to it, complete with french waitstaff. I loved all of the newspaper and magazine options to peruse while waiting for a table or enjoying a cafe au lait. Similar to a restaurant in france the food takes forever to come, but it's worth the wait. This isn't the type of cafe where you rush through a meal, its a place to linger and chat. Unlike France the wait staff was attentive and friendly. The eggs benedict is perfected here. It's a must try if you stop here for brunch. There was a wait for brunch, but it wasen't too bad, about 20 minutes at the most. I will definitely return.

Add that to a short attention span for shoes and a penchant for shoe shopping and you can imagine the piles of shoes I have that need fixin'. Well that laziness bit me in the ass this weekend when I realized that *gasp* the shoes I was planning to wear with my Halloween costume that night were unwearable unless the heels were fixed. I did an emergency Yelp search and found Albert's. A phone call confirmed that they were open on a Saturday (most of the other shoe repair shops in Astoria are only open M-F) and I rushed over with my shoes.To fix both heels on a pair of ankle boots cost just $10, a total bargain considering all of the shoe repair shops near my office in Midtown charge $15+/pair. I was able to pick up my shoes just an hour after I dropped them off, and was happy to see that the heels were as good as new. Efficient good work, and inexpensive to boot (yay puns!)~ need I say more? Now I just need to gather up all of my broken babies and bring them to Albert's...*Cash only!

HOWEVER...THEY HAVE BACKYARD SEATING!The day before we ended up here, my friend and I have agreed that we dont like chicken unless its fried, but upon seeing the quite amazingly named Contraband Chicken - a chicken breast that is stuffed with pico de gallo and cheese, wrapped with bacon and doused with mole.But you know, we like contradicting ourselves. This is why we are friends.This Contraband Chicken is GINORMOUS, so dont be afraid to share and get something else that is small to fill you up. Im not sure if it is the dish we prepared or the kitchen itself but it took a while for the food to come and when we ordered a second round of mojitos, the second round wasnt as good as the first one.And that's why i docked off one star.

Their chicken is the best I've probably ever had. Never dry, really flavorful and juicy.  The green sauce is spicy and creamy and perfect on chicken and every single side dish they have.  Food comes out fast so I always like to stagger the order waiting till apps are finished to order the main course.  Best sides are the avocado salad and the rice and beans. My family is a big fan of the hot dogs and fries as well. For the desserts my old favorite was the tartufo, not sure if they still have that there but they also make a great flan, not too eggy or thick, perfect consistency. Don't forget the sangria-a little pricy but will do the trick and make for a very fun night!

There IS a name on there...it just doesn't jump out at you.The cocktails are old-timey and mixed precisely by suspender-clad gentlemen with properly trimmed facial hair. It's dark and sexy in this spot. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but once you enter, it's like stepping into a Tardis and coming out into some other time. Some cocktails will run about $8, but most are $11 each. They don't hold back on the good stuff here, and the patrons SIP their drinks, not guzzle. They have a couple of beers available, but if you come all the way out to Jackson Ave to drink, might I suggest you try one of their specialty cocktails so you can get a good measure of the place?Food? Why, yes! Yes, they do. They have a small menu with sandwiches, side items, and a killer mac n cheese all for under $10. The side items hover around the $6 price point. Everything we ordered was great.I was skeptical leaving the city to come out to drink on Jackson Ave, next to a taxi depot, but Dutch Kills absolutely KILLED it. Now, I can't wait to head back there and try out a couple of other drinks. It's obvious they spent a lot of time researching what kind of bar they wanted to be, and their customers couldn't be happier with the result.

Granted, I'd never tried this chickpea-ed godsend until 2 years ago, this has been the most unique and best tasting. They're like mozzarella sticks, but with chickpeas instead of cheese. They make and fry them right in front of you too! Also, if you wait in line for a while, they hand out a piece of falafel to you. The first time I went, I got the shawarma, which was just alright, it would have warranted 3 stars: was a bit dry and too salty for my taste. I recently discovered they are down the block from my gym, so things can get dangerous realllllly fast. For $4, that falafel sandwich is amazing! The rest of their prices are about $1 more than the rest of the halal trucks, but the portions are about equal, if not bigger, and the quality is top notch as far as halal trucks are concerned.

I know the some local(?) fishes from close to NY and from others is good as well.most important thing is the freshness but the taste of actual Japanese fish is true sushi for us.I also know that we can have a very very good sushi at the very very pricy restaurant in Manhattan but sushi isn't be only expensive food.I strongly believed the sushi should have a range and choices as a quality and price... than, I think they can serve great taste sushi as a price.and more surprised was the other menus are pretty amazing too!I really recommend to you to try "Tempura" and other fries.Oh, Maki sushi is good too!so I only wrote the good thing I experienced but I have to leave my note for my concerns as well...The wait person were all nice but I didn't think they know what they doing.survice was very slow and we've been seen one women walked in and left cuz she couldn't wait. it was very sad to see.but please don't get wrong! if you see them carefully, you can see they are trying!!I guess the system isn;t working well yet...

This was above and beyond because as far as I know, we didn't ask for them to set it up like this for us. The staff was fantastic. They came back to check on us often, and they let us all run our own separate tabs. They had a berry martini special running all night, and I'm sad to say that I didn't even try one. Everyone who did was raving about the cocktails. I stuck to beer. Thy list was small, but I found a couple of good ones. We've also been in here for brunch and for the happy hour.

This visit I had: (and ranked in order of deliciousness)1- Chicken Parmigiana - still my favorite - reminded me of a hot pocket but better2- Hawaiian (pineapple/ham/cheese) - the pineapple is very sweet and it tasted good. 3- Cuban (ham/pork/cheese)4- Chicken (which had potatoes and peas in it) - my least favorite of the four. The woman behind the counter was really friendly, the food was delicious, and the fact that these are on average $1.50 each makes Mama's a great place to truly find a "value meal".

That being said, brunch menus can become a bit redundant. For the most part, restaurants offer the same standard fare. Everybody expects pancakes, eggs benedict, french toast and assorted omelets. Banter offers all the old standbys we love with the addition of lots of items that are atypical. Depending on your mood, you can go the breakfast or lunch route: they offered a classic Irish breakfast, smoked salmon stuffed crepes, a crab cake entree and a shrimp and dill crossaint sandwich accompanied by sweet potato fries as well as many other deviations from a traditional brunch that were very much appreciated all with your typical brunch drinks for only $15.They accommodated my boyfriend's request for an eggs benedict substitution of lox over Canadian bacon. When it arrived, the portion was much more generous than what we've received in the area. The eggs were perfectly cooked, and runny and the home fries were well executed. These items are not fancy, but can often be done poorly, which was far from the case here.I opted for their house made corned beef hash, served over crispy fried potato skins and topped with two poached eggs. It was an Irish eggs benedict of sorts, especially when topped with the hollandaise sauce I requested on the side. And, it was phenomenal. Although I'm used to the canned variety of corned beef hash that my Mom used to serve up and is often offered at most places, it could not compare to the homemade variety and has now turned me into a corned beef snob. The side salad provided a nice contrast to the heaviness of the meal.Banter has solidified it's spot in my heart as both my neighborhood go-to bar, and brunch option of choice. I've never been disappointed, and am still being wow-ed with each new visit.

Malbec and fish is also just as marvelous. MmmHomegirl got duck breast. At the first bite, it unraveled me in regards to other finer establishments like Jean Georges which served an almond crusted duck breast and automatically, folks gon be like "oooooooooooo danggg" but it was so confusing in the mouth--too craycray of a fushion for me.

I am in heaven, what a way to wake up.  I would crave their coffee.  I am a coffee lover!!  Their iced coffee is amazingly delicious and strong.  Its better than any of the watered down coffee offered in Sunnyside's chain coffee places.  Their ice coffee is quite unique.  I always get their large ice coffee with 1/2 spoon of sugar and milk in the summer.  Their ice cubes are made of coffee, plus they pour cold coffee.  How much better can that be?  In the warmer weather I do buy their hot coffee.  They make a perfect cup of coffee every time.  They are always very consistent.  What really sucks is that they do not open early in the morning to accommodate morning commuters.  I can only get it after work.    If you want a coffee press or coffee pot go to Macy's or bed bath and beyond.  If you want great coffee come to Baruir's Coffee.  Their prices are very competitive which is reasonable to me.  I also buy their coffee beans from there and they grind it to the coffee machine that I am going to make it in.  I usually get their mixed blend. I have never had a bad batch.  Always on point.  They have the coffee beans pre-packaged ready to grind because they sell out pretty fast.  If you are a coffee lover this is the place to go.  Just the aroma when walking into their store is so deliciously inviting.

Simple but welcoming decor and warm and attentive staff.Tibetan side of the menu is somewhat limited but has everything you want most. I'd like to try the Indian side of the menu but not until a couple more visits for Tibetan.  It's nice to see the Himalayan/Nepalese scene spread out a little from Roosevelt Ave in the 70s even if it is just a couple of miles. We had the Chele Khatsa spicy fried beef tongue - cut really nice, spicey for sure but just enough restraint to let the tongue flavor shine.  The LaPhing (slippery mung bean noodles in a tangy spicy sauce with cilantro) was fantastic - I haven't been this excited about a side dish since discovering Liang Pi noodles at Xi'an famous. Tsak Sha La Kor Hot was a big hearty stew, rough cuts of beef and some fat floating around but it seemed appropriate, especially with the radish and "tibetan mountain herbs" to cut it. Thenthuk hand made noodle stew was even better, tons of fresh noodles, perfect consistency in a thick broth.  For some reason we also ordered beef in this one  - I guess we were in beefy moods but in retrospect it would be nice to know how they handle chicken  or veggie dishes.  We walked in at 6pm starving from a long day of outdoor work and a skipped lunch on my part and walked out a little more full than I meant to be with a huge breakfast and then some in leftovers for $18.75 plus tip.One of the owners came out to talk to us at the end of our meal - she really wanted to know how we liked it and we had a great conversation about Tibetan food and language.  Several staff joined in and it was a real privilege to get  a little acquainted with a crew so eager to create a positive dining experience. I am tempted to dole out 5 stars but my policy is to show a little restraint when it's a brand new place and I haven't really explored the menu.  After 2 or 3 visits I may well be upgrading to a 5 if they keep up the great work,

So basically, gastropubs are one of the types of places we frequent. I'm so glad Oliver's has come to Astoria, because it's fantastic.We headed there on a weeknight. The ambiance is great; we felt like we were back in England, possibly London, in a posh but also very cozy pub. It's beautiful in here, but it still has the feel of a neighborhood joint. It's a nice mix.For a starter, we got the popped corn, which comes with smoked bacon and cheddar on it. It was so freaking good! This may be the perfect bar food. I could see myself ordering several these over the course of a night. Try the popped corn. It's delicious. We also split the skirt steak, which comes with fries, and two sides of mac and cheese and sour cream smashed potatoes. The steak was incredible. It comes in a red wine-peppercorn jus with gorgonzola butter. It just melted in my my mouth. The steak was tender, and the sauce and butter were the perfect complements. So yummy. I loved the mac and cheese; it was creamy and topped with breadcrumbs...mmm. The smashed potatoes were a bit of a letdown. The portion was surprisingly tiny when compared with the mac and cheese, and the taste was just okay. The staff is awesome. Like seriously fantastic, top-notch. Our server made me a delicious girly martini after I told her I was in the mood for some kind of fruity martini. After we finished our meal and moved to the bar for more drinks, the bartender made me another amazing martini that was chocolatey and coffeelike. These girls invented some incredible drinks on the spot; they have really good instincts for what liquors will make a great drink. I have full trust in the bartenders at Oliver's. Of course, they also have a great selection of beers, ciders, and wines. So yeah, I pretty much love Oliver's. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more on their menu. It's a wonderful spot for a nice chill night out.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2013,1/22/2014,54,130,9,16,14>It's about time I reviewed La Boulangerie, considering the amount of time I've spent there in the last year, the number of their croissants (and other delicious sweet things) I've consumed, the coffee I've drank (in varying forms from cold brew to latte to espresso) , and the genius writing I've accomplished while ensconced at one of their little tables (or in a corner of the large community table in the front).  Ok, the genius thing is debatable I suppose, but the amount of delicious pastry products I've eaten and the hours I've spent there definitely are not.  I love this place. I really do; if there's one place I prefer to hunker down with a croissant, baguette, salad, or sandwich and cup of coffee, this is it.  It's warm, cozy, the quality of their food is out of the this world, and it has free wi-fi.  And it's tucked away on an assuming street in Forest Hills, seemingly protected from the bustle of Austin street.  Seriously, everything they make is delicious. Their croissants are consistently en-pointe, their baguette is ridiculously good; I could just buy one and slowly (or not) nibble on it throughout the day. I won't detail every single foot item I've purchased, but the croissants and baguette are a daily occurrence, so I've got to mention those. But honorable mention to the ham and cheese croissant, the croque moisseiur sandwich, the tuna sandwich, the nicoise salad, and their chocolate brioche.  Not to mention the jars of honey and apricot and raspberry preserves they have stationed throughout the cafe for use however you should see fit. The only thing I didn't like from here was their vegetable soup, but it was more of a puree, so I just don't think it was my style.  Their chicken noodle soup, on the other hand, has cured many an ailment (from head cold to hangover).Plus the owner is usually around greeting folks and always asks how I'm doing, which is an added sweet touch.  The staff is friendly and consistent, and never makes me feel like I'm overstaying my welcome.Just a great, friendly, delicious bakery cafe - I hope it's around for many many years to come. When I finally finish my play and win a Tony, I'll be sure to give it props.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/17/2013,1/21/2014,395,204,20,18,15>The name sounds like a racial epithet. I can't help but feel slightly uncomfortable every time I see their sign when walking by. I had to use their bathroom one time and I ended up buying two of their "Chinese burgers." This was after I already had a full meal. It's not really burgers the way you know burgers, not like Five Guys, not like Burger King, not like McDonalds, etc. I feel like a Chinese burger would be a hamburger bun with some General Tso Chicken in it or something. These are more like something else altogether, something that only bears a slight resemblance to a burger the way a sandwich is like a burger, with the bread and the meat, but isn't really a burger cause it's a sandwich. It uses a pita bread type bread, only slightly smaller, with meat that has a lot of cumin spice on it. Cumin on anything is just so delicious! They've got a lamb version of this Chinese burger, which was the one I ordered. It had lamb that's similar in quality (maybe worse) than the lamb they sell at those Chinese street carts with the meat skewers. Health-wise, it's probably the best. Price-wise, it's pretty cheap (IMHO). Taste-wise, it's pretty good. I would definitely go back for another, but it's only good if you buy one. Don't get two at a time, the way I did.
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2013,1/20/2014,383,301,4,9,7>Saturday dinnertime review:Per tip that I received from the receptionist: it gets really busy at around 8:00 p.m. on Saturday evenings. I arrived at 7:30 p.m. and by 8 p.m., there was a huge crowd.Food: exceptional barbecue! Beef brisket, short rib (which was anything but short), leg of lamb, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, and baked beans were all very tasty. Alcoholic beverages - stick with the beers; I wouldn't recommend the cocktails.The culture of buying your food near the bar by the pound and sitting at a communal table takes some getting used to. So, do you tip the guys selling you food at the station at a 20% rate or not?Service: the food salespeople were friendly and recognized me as the guy who bought quite a bit of food (I bought for four people when most buy for themselves).There's live music and it's wonderful, but it's so loud that I could hardly hear myself think. This fact itself had to make it lose one star. Tip: if you're into more meat for the buck, it may make more sense to buy the brisket instead of the short rib because the bone weighs quite a bit.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2013,1/19/2014,522,450,7,10,7>I walked in two days ago without an appointment, with a dreadful non-salon haircut that I had been trying to fix with my own pair of scissors for weeks. Mazel said she'd take me right then, and got to work fixing the terrible, overgrown mess on my head.Mazel was extremely professional and nice, even when instructing me to never cut my hair again. (And I promise I won't). She listened to everything I wanted, and took her time shaping my hair and taking some of the bulk out.When she was finished, my hair looked awesome. It was exactly the cut I was looking for. In addition, it was much cheaper than I expected it to be. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here, and am bummed that I will be moving out of the area.Cash only!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2013,1/18/2014,114,164,5,8,7>There are tons of Korean fried chicken establishments all over the city, but I figured any in Flushing are held to a higher standard.  Having said that, nothing really draws me to come here over any other, and being so far from public transpo, that makes it even less.  However, one night especially proved to be extra entertaining.Obviously you come for the chicken, which is cooked well and tastes very good.  Double fried with a touch of some sauce and flavor, each wing is succulent and leaves you craving for more.  The chicken apparently takes "time" to make, so orders of chicken should be placed first so they come out at the appropriate time.  There's nothing super special about the food that doesn't stand out on its own from other chicken places, so there is no need to explain in detail.The night started off with catching up with a friend who had been MIA due to kids and living in the boondocks of Flushing.  Upon ordering, we got the customary "the chicken takes a long time to cook" routine and went ahead and ordered 20, along with other side dishes for the 4 of us.  The place looked fairly busy for a week night.  The table next to us, a girl was on the phone, not visibly upset in the least.  Suddenly, she slams her mobile on the table, splitting the cover into large pieces and exhales "Oh my god."  I previously said the food isn't anything different, and I definitely wouldn't label it as orgasmic, so that was ruled out immediately.  Now looking upset, her friends pick up the pieces and begin the process of ushering her out.  Our group had paused momentarily because of the sudden noise next to us, but didn't pay too much attention as she had already drawn more than she wanted.  Her friend then told us "She's just upset, it's not you guys."  Who would even think anyone other than whoever was on the other side of that phone conversation were to blame for this situation?  That was just odd in and of itself.  We shrugged it off as our chicken had finally arrived.  For a second show, the waiter somehow spilled 2-3 chicken wings onto my friends lap and then onto the floor!  Profusely apologetic as my friend assured him it was ok.  Continuing to apologize, he then said he would replace the wings immediately.  5 minutes later, a small plate of 2 wings had arrived at our table.  But wait...I thought it would take "a long time" to cook the wings?  How could the process be so fast for these two?  Or could these two be the same two that were on the floor just 5 minutes ago?  So many plot twists even for M. Night.  Needless to say, no one touched them.As the night wore on, crowds and parties came and went.  The beer flowed, stories were told, and people were made fun of.  If only Mad for Chicken were mad for being closer to the subway.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/9/2013,1/17/2014,90,616,7,15,8>After passing by numerous times while under construction, we knew we had to try this vegetarian Indian restaurant.  Right when you enter, there is a natural wooden theme with soft lighting and a friendly waitress to greet you.  We walked in to find an ambience that would fall into the category of a cross between first date and small family gathering type of vibe.  As we sat there, we saw couples, friends ordering delivery-to-go, and also some random pedestrians standing outside to see what the menu had to offer.  For an appetizer, we started off with the samosa which came with cilantro chutney and a sweet sauce(not sure what it was, but it was red and good.  :(  sorry!) After reading the entire menu, I decided on the Misal Pav which the restaurant did not have at the moment.  So then I ended up getting the Mumbai Pav Bhaji, and my hubby ordered the spinach dosa. Now, for those who are interested, yet are not sure what I'm referring to...Mumbai pav bhaji is a mix of vegetables cooked in tomato gravy and served with an Indian-style burger bun buttered and toasted to yumminess.   I would say that it was full of veggies and tasted really good.  This pav was accompanied by sides of fresh cilantro, cross sectionally cut green chilies, and red onion slices.  I really liked the presentation of the meal as well.  In perusing the menu, my husband saw that the upma, which is Cream of Wheat cooked with onions and Indian herbs, which sounded kind of awesome.  We shared his dosa which came with sides of sambar(tomato spicy soup), coconut chutney, and two other ones.  The consistency of the dosa was light and fluffy and absolutely delicious.  With minimal oil, it was just perfect.  Not burnt, not overdone.  It was made just right.  It also came with spinach that had some potatoes in it.  Before ordering, he asked us if we wanted it Masala style which included this potato filling.  I was pretty happy with our visit.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2013,1/16/2014,472,510,9,21,14>Tamashii Ramen, now open for less than one month has truly made a very impressive debut in Astoria.  We walked by one night and there weren't any seats available, so we bookmarked this place for another day.  I don't even live in the area, but en route to Costco, I noticed this very promising ramen house on the brink of opening and I had to check it out as a commitment to my love of ramen.The bf was nice enough to bring me here the other night after that initial failed attempt.  My first impression was excitement at the setup of the restaurant.  Plenty of tables and stools, and a ramen bar flanking the open kitchen where you can see the ramen-making process behind the plexiglass. The dark wood furniture, and sparse decor make for a very clean, and welcoming space.  Although you will find some posters of various menu items plastered on the wall.We started with an appetizer of "chicken karaage" (deep fried cubes of chicken), which was pretty tasty.  The chicken was not oily, which was a good thing, and the flavors were typical of a karaage preparation.  Though, I think it could have been maybe just a touch crispier.  This was accompanied by a side salad of mixed greens and ginger dressing.  We also ordered a side of "menma" (bamboo shoots), which adds a nice texture and soft crunch to any ramen dish.  There are many options for hot ramen, and two cold ramen dishes, which is what we went with.  Additionally, there are a number of donburi options, and a delightful surprise, various Tsuke-men (noodles in dipping sauce) options as well.  Our cold ramen dishes were refreshing and lite, perfect for summer weather.  It comes with 'chashu' (pork), and various topping such as seaweed, egg, and tomato.   Though I enjoyed the meal, I wasn't completely blown away as I think the flavors missed the potential to develop just a bit more in depth and richness.  (Though, I recognize I would possibly have had a different outcome if I went with a hot bowl of ramen rather than a cold ramen dish.)Prices are decent, and they do accept credit card.  Service is very attentive and friendly, our waiter was as nice as pie and checked in on us a handful of times during the meal.  Overall, for lack of any other ramen houses in the area, I'd say this is still a great addition to the Astoria food scene regardless, and I'd definitely come back again.  3.5 stars.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2013,1/15/2014,325,275,9,15,12>We're big fans of Saigon and come here pretty often for sit down and takeout.  Most nights, we'll be seated fairly quickly, but some Fridays & Saturdays, the place is packed!  Pho is the word!  On a cold day, there's nothing like a steaming bowl of the #1 Extra Large Beef Noodle, which is my go-to order.  Somebody explain why the translated name means "Special Train Locomotive" for whatever reason.  Guess it means this is the top, best or most ordered, which I can see because everybody gets it.  It comes with slices of beef round, brisket, omosa (tripe) & tendon.  Toss in some jalapeno slices, cilantro & bean sprouts and the flavors POP!A close second to the #1 would be the grilled pork chop noodle or over rice.  The marinated pork chop is sweet/savory and has the smokiness just off the grill, Yum!  Appetizers like Viet spring rolls & satay chicken skewers are mighty tasty.  Wrap then up in lettuce, dip them in the fish sauce or make your own hot pepper/hoisin sauce combinations.Once in a while, when we're not in the mood for hot soup like during the summer, we'll order dinner family style, like last night.  Many of the dishes are hybrid/fusion Vietnamese/Cantonese styles and flavors.  We ordered the grilled pork chops (a la carte), seafood & tofu casserole pot, flounder fillet with mixed vegetables, salt & pepper fried squid, stir fried baby chinese broccoli and the waiter recommended the ginger & scallion sauced yellow chicken. Most everything was good except that the chinese broccoli this time was too stringy.  Most times we get it, it's really good and not a lot of restaurants carry it as a regular menu item nor do it up right.Prices are really reasonable and you will get stuffed.  Parking in the rear makes it convenient, but lately has been getting crowded and harder to find a space because of the new businesses opening up.
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/6/2013,1/14/2014,665,302,11,17,14>Long Island City is definitely full of surprises. Heading out to Jackson Ave from where I live, you get a great view of the city with the Empire State Building on the horizon. It makes me want to rethink my long term goal of leaving NYC and settling somewhere outside the city limits. So I try not to fall in love over and over again.Manetta's is a small Italian place on Jackson Ave. As you come in, it will immediately give you that homey feeling. The waitstaff are friendly and courteous, always smiling and asking if there's anything else you may need. On point to refill your glass of water or ask if you need another glass of wine. Vongole Arreganato (Baked clams), Pizza Margherita and Salmone Al Forno. The clams came in with about 7 or 8 pieces. Baked with bread crumbs and cheese. Not too briny or salty. The tomato fresh mozzarella and basil in the Pizza was just right. $10 for 6 slices, not bad. I can easily slip into a food coma if I finished this pie all by myself lol. Salmon was brick oven roasted with herbs served over polenta, diced eggplant, zucchini and onions, $21. Huge portion, can definitely serve 2. Fish was seasoned well and was cooked perfectly. Polenta seemed lacking as the fish sits on it covering all of it. If you weren't aware that its served with polenta, you can finish the fish and the vegetables around it before realizing that it's there. And u do miss it, it wouldn't be a loss. It was bland and doesn't really compliment the fish or the vegetables.Ended my meal with their Molten Chocolate cake and Cappucino. For those who knows me, getting the chocolate cake dessert will not come as a surprise. The surprise would be if I do not get it for dessert. Warm chocolate cake with warm chocolate filling oozing out of it served with Cappucino with chocolate chip ice cream, whipped cream and strawberries. Heavenly. I'm not a big fan if strawberries and yet we finished the whole plate clean :). Will I come back again to this place? Most likely after I tried all the other restaurants LIC has to offer.
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/10/2013,9/14/2013,361,716,6,11,9>Beer and cheese on a Sunday afternoon.What else would you want? After a race, we relaxed with some well-deserved beer and a large cheese platter. We sat by the window, people-watched, and drank beer while eating cheese. I couldn't have asked for a better day.I ordered a passion fruit wheat beer (Bayou Teche Passionnee), which was a delicious light summery beer. I liked the selection of cheeses that they gave us (except for the smoked Stilton, which was too strong for us). They even sell bottled beer and cider that you can drink at the store for an addition $2 corking fee.The best part of Astoria Bier and Cheese was the wonderful selection of cheeses that you could buy by weight and all of the fantastic accoutrements, such as marcona almonds, ginger and clove syrup for cocktails, cheddar coins, various crisps, jams, fancy honey, etc. I was in love with the store.I walked passed this place for the past year without walking in. I should have walked in, rather than walk by. It's a fantastic date place. We'll definitely be back again soon.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2013,9/13/2013,472,510,9,12,9>What do you know about "SPAETZLE" aka German Pasta?  (yelp.com/biz_photos/mano)  It is freaking delicious!  Ah, a slice of Deutschland exists in Fo' Hills.  And, at Manor Oktoberfest, this is where I discovered SPAETZLE for the first time in my life.  (Now, why on earth did I not have any of this pasta goodness when I was actually in Germany?!! SMH).  Good thing this place exists for me to get my fix any time I sense a SPAETZLE withdrawal on the horizon.The food seems to be authentic and typical German cuisine.  I'm no aficionado but on the menu I did see a garden assortment of German sausages - bratwurst, knackwurst, and even Polish-style kielbasa.  The menu is not limited to sausage links, there are burgers, steaks, ribs, salads, of course German staples such as kassler, and everyone's favorite, wiener-schnitzel.  For appetizers, we had the "Reuben" Pierogies which was another awesome and ultimately delicious revelation, and beer-battered (I think) onion rings that were excellent as well.  Highly recommend both!  And my knackwurst meal was enjoyable, but not so memorable, nor as good as the appetizers or even the SPAETZLE (which was shockingly amazing).This is a great, casual restaurant-bar for groups and families.  The service is wonderful, and being tucked into a mostly residential area of Forest Hills, it's a local gem and certainly a place worthy of your time and tummy.Oh, and for the drinkers out there, they have a full bar, and tons of beers on tap, in bottle form, etc.  Can you get a DAS BOOT?  Yes, you can!
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2013,9/12/2013,241,315,13,15,15>Banh Mi is a fusion of French baguette and condiments with Vietnamese spices and vegetables. Dump some protein on that piece then you have yourself a functional Banh Mi. Joju takes it a step further and fusion it again with other Asian influences like bulgogi beef and kakuni pork. I went for the kakuni pork belly. When two huge 6 inch monstrosities were placed in front of me I sheepishly asked "so which one is the pork belly?" "Both of them. We cut it in half." I knew then that running the three miles to get here would not prepare me for the heavy consumption ahead. The banh mi was as good as it sounded on paper. With a Yelp check in you can also add a free egg to your already stacked sandwich. I'll challenge Sally's review and say if anything, there was too much protein on my banh mi. Perhaps it was my extremely heavy kakuni pork belly (which was really, really, fat) doing all the magic in my stomach.In addition, a traditional banh mi actually doesn't have much protein at all. You want the crunch of the baguette and the vegetables to balance out the soft mayo rubbings and protein. JoJu could have been over-generous with my portion of kakuni. But of course, this stray-away was what made JoJu so interesting. Why would anyone preach traditionalism on a food that was founded on fusion principles? Not me :PPeople have raved about the banh mi fries and kimchi fries. What to get? Hmmm... porque no los dos? We had 2 servings of banh mi and a serving of kimchi. All three servings of fries were emptied out by 5 skinny and full Yelpers. Fries tasted double-fried and possibly over-fried as well. Just the way I like it. Serving size wasn't exactly big for the 4 dollar price tag, but it tasted good and unique enough to easily recommend to anyone. What really had me sold for the 5 star rating was the black sesame bubble tea. Shutup. Stop being a wussy and getting taro all the time. Yeah I know you. Get the black sesame and be a better person in life.The service was friendly and warm... and good looking. Stop judging me okay?But really. The contagious smiles were as generous as the kakuni porkThe atmosphere and seating were casually comfortable. Clean bathroom. Overall a very clean look. If you have not tried a banh mi before, JoJu can serve as a very legitimate introduction to this special fusion snack. If banh mi is your thing, I bet you haven't had it with bulgogi before (nono that thing in Baoguette was not bulgogi you silly). Bottom line is just come :)
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/22/2013,9/11/2013,628,678,16,17,17>First off, let me just say: Korean fried chicken + pitcher of Killian's + baseball on the flatscreen + good company = awesome afternoon.The chicken here is great! Mostly as good as the KFC served at their extremely popular sister location, Kyedong (yelp.com/biz/kyedong-fri) - still hot and juicy, with a few differences: at Kono, the crust is thicker, and the spicy is much spicier. Essentially, it's like BonChon when BonChon doesn't screw up.Too bad Kono is wedged a few blocks south of busy Northern Blvd, by the LIRR station, next to also-extremely-popular Korean BBQ joint Hahm Ji Bak. Someone came to us after a few minutes of our looking at the menu and asked if we hadn't gone into the wrong restaurant:"Huh? No..""Oh, okay, because Hahm Ji Bak is next door and a lot of people are looking for that."Way to have confidence in your business! To be sure, we were the only ones there... and that's always a little weird. Kono's space is prettier than Kyedong's, but still not flashy. This apparently was formerly Korean BBQ space, as evidenced by the dormant tabletop grills and plastic-wrapped hoods overhead.The chicken menu is identical to Kyedong's, and brief. All chicken includes a plate of fries plus an overdressed slaw salad which they seemed eager to refill. Pickled daikon comes standard. Just like at Kyedong, they've given us kimchi upon request, on the house. The pork feet are actually really tasty and not oversalted at all. The "medium" is a huuuuge portion - but it had better be, for $23.When I ordered to-go once, our fries had been inexplicably replaced with a can of soda. :(  Kono is a great alternative to the dedicated (and crowded) KFC places nearby. When Kyedong is too cool to feed you, Kono happily acts as the Kyedong annex. Besides, the extra few blocks of walking will do your fried-chicken-addled body good.(By the way, Yankees snuck in 3 runs at the top of the 9th but still lost 3-8 to Tampa Bay. Laaaaaame)

<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/2/2013,9/9/2013,315,250,8,15,12>I was quite a regular at this restaurant a few years ago. The food is delicious and quite reasonable in price, just make sure you bring "CASH" since credit cards have not evolved here yet.These are some of the must haves when you dine here:1. Roti Canai - Malaysian crispy pancake, flaky and served with a curry chicken dipping sauce2. Hainanese Chicken -  Steamed chicken served with cucumbers and bathed in a special soy sauce and served with a garlic/ginger red dipping sauce. I usually order a bowl of the coconut rice when having this chicken.3.  Satay chicken or beef skewers - served with a delicious peanut sauce and red onions and cucumbers on the side.4. Prawn noodle soup - The noodles are delicious in this flavorful shrimp broth.5. Tom yum soup noodle - Delicious Thai and Malaysian inspired flavors6. Seafood scramble egg chow fun - I usually get this ying/yang style, Half chow fun and the other half Mei fun. Delicious seafood/vegetables mixed in a light brown sauce.7. Black/White cold drink - Refreshing grass jelly mixed with soy bean milk and ice8. Fried fish in Belachan sauce - I order the skate fish with this preparation. The belachan sauce is awesome!They have many other vegetarian style type dishes that are delicious!The place is small and could get crowded pretty quickly. In the past they used to open the basement for seating, but on my last visit they don't have basement seating anymore.The wait staff is fluent in Chinese and English and are very friendly. Once you place your orders the food comes out pretty quick.  Parking is limited in front of the restaurant, so street parking is your only option. Parking spaces can be a premium since the restaurant is located off to the side of "Gold City supermarket" and the former "East Manor restaurant" If you're in the mood for some good old fashion Malaysian comfort food, "Satay"  definitely will not disappoint.
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2013,9/8/2013,406,1092,5,6,6>Looking for a new brunch spot? Then LIC Market's a perfect choice. Although it's located in an area without a lot of commercial, nestled away is a black awning leading down to a narrow restaurant. It would go unnoticed to many, except for the crowds that come as soon as it opens. We got here at 10:30 AM on a Sunday, 30 minutes after opening, and there were already people waiting for a table. Luckily, there was a high-chair table available near the front.As soon as we were seated, our waiter had come over with menus and asked what we'd like to drink. We both said coffee, and the waiter proceeded to walk away. Almost immediately, another staff member had dropped off the mugs and sugar over, and then then our original waiter had come with the carafe to pour the coffee. Wow, was I amazed at the prompt and attentive service. It sort of felt like my own personal waitstaff. He then took our orders, which I chose the Slow Roasted Duck Hash ($12.00) from the waiter's recommendation after much deliberation between that and the "Dirty Rice" Frittata ($11.00).We were then provided with a small plate of complimentary bread: 2 pieces of a carrot bread, a chocolate croissant, and 2 very thin slices of 7 grain bread. I was surprised at how good the bread was, a definite step up from your generic Italian-like restaurant bread.What was no more than 10 minutes later, my dish of Slow Roasted Duck Hash was served. Portions looked scant at first, but I was pleasantly surprised that it was a very filling dish. It's not hungry man proportions, but you'll leave mostly satisfied. Mixed along with the shredded-like roasted duck were crisp potato squares, red onions, peppers, dried cherries, pine nuts, all topped with two fried eggs. I immediately cracked the egg yolk in the middle to let all that yellow goodness coat the food. Texturally, it was outstanding, from tender and moist duck (with a few semi-crunchy pieces), to crispy yet soft potatoes, to the pine nuts. Flavors were on point, from the red onions giving it some bite, to the dried cherries that gave it a very subtle sweetness. There was nothing to dislike about this dish, but everything to like.I also had the chance to try the Sausage & Onions Sandwich ($9.00) which included two fried eggs, breakfast sausage, caramelized onions, cheddar on a brioche bun, and served with home fries on the side. It was a fairly average sandwich, but still very enjoyable. I'd definitely spend the few extra bucks to get the Slow Roasted Duck Hash.Overall, LIC Market was a winner in my book. From attentive service that made me feel like a reguler, to a cute laid back and cozy ambiance, to good eats. It made out for a very good experience that I'd love to come back again and try their other offerings.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/25/2013,9/7/2013,223,77,8,13,9>Is it possible to have a meaningful relationship with a restaurant? Whether I am celebrating an occasion, bummed over a bad date, tired after a long day at work, or too lazy to put pants on and leave the apartment, Antika has been there through the most celebratory and trying of times. I couldn't have asked for a better BFF! Sure, we fight sometimes (she got back at me one day vis-a-vis an all-night trip to the bathroom after eating a whole bunch of dairy), but our friendship is strong enough to get through that kind of nonsense!I'm not talented enough to develop this analogy any further so here's an earnest review of some of my favorite dishes:-  THE FOCACCIA BREAD. Holy cow if you just gave me a pile of their bread to eat as my main meal, I would oblige without any complaints. I haven't gone so far as to go through Antika's leftover trash to find scraps of this complimentary bread but I seriously wouldn't be surprised if my focaccia addiction led me to that.- WARM RICOTTA. Their warm ricotta appetizer is served with stewed grapes and it's DELICIOUS. I never would've thought the flavors would work well together but the combination is absolutely orgasmic. Of course, they serve it with their focaccia bread to dip.- PENNE A LA VODKA. Always a slam dunk. Always with the most crispy pancetta. And always with the bread to dip in the leftover sauce.- VEAL BRUSCHETTA MILANESE. Delicious, breaded and fried veal served with bruschetta over a pile of arugula. DECADENT!I believe there's another  location uptown, but I'm glad that this place is helping define the restaurant scene in Astoria.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2013,9/6/2013,286,298,13,18,18>I've always been a little jealous of my friends who live in the LIC waterfront high rises. Not only do they live in brand spanking new buildings with washer/dryers on each floor (and some even in unit!), but they also have a stunning view of the Manhattan skyline. And now they have their very own Sweetleaf just steps away from home. Did I say "a little jealous"? Let's make that "very jealous."Those familiar with the Sweetleaf chain love it for their Stumptown coffee and fresh baked goods. This Sweetleaf has all that plus an extra trick up their sleeve. They've teamed up with Richard Boccato of Dutch Kills so that around 4pm Sweetleaf begins to morph into a mixology den. While the original Sweetleaf is boho hipster and Dutch Kills is speakeasy saloon, the feel of this new Sweetleaf is the perfect marriage of the two and the ambience translates seamlessly from coffee extraordinaire by day to cocktail superhero by night. Love it.Sweetleaf's cocktail menu includes a range of classics and specialty cocktails including some new coffee-based cocktails that Boccato created for Sweetleaf. But if you're not feeling any of the drinks on the menu, you'll be relieved to know that the mixologists at Sweetleaf are fully equipped to make anything you'd be able to order at Dutch Kills so don't be afraid to order off menu. (Hello Gold Rush!) Keep in mind the same drinks will cost you a couple dollars more at Sweetleaf, but for those who live in the neighborhood the convenient location really can't be beat.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/9/2013,9/5/2013,168,160,7,13,11>In a recent survey of best Korean BBQ in Queens Mapo came out on top!Ok fine someone on Facebook asked what restaurant in Queens had the best korean BBQ and most of the people who responded said Mapo for their Kalbi. I would agree. Mapo doesn't serve galbi the way most other Korean restaurants do. You would find a roll of meat usually still attached to the rib. But in Mapo you get a big thick cut slab of meat. To be totally honest i was kinda taken aback at how small the portion looked but once we started eating it became clear that it wasn't small at all. We left feeling very full and very satisfied. Everything was really great and you get all of the side dishes (banchan) that one is accustom to when ordering korean BBQ.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2012,3/19/2012,593,1089,22,13,14>1) one of my best friends lost his knish virginity here on Halloween weekend. I don't want to say there's a photo on Facebook of him eating his first knish...but yeah. bro hasn't been the same since; he's got swagger, the honeys flock to him, and his voice dropped a few octaves since then. ALL CAUSE OF A KNISH, I TELL YA.2) their corned beef knish wrap is one of the greatest things ever invented. you take a knish, and add finely shredded pieces of corned beef into it, and stretch it to a more cylindrical shape (like a spring roll, but on a much larger scale). oh, yeah, this beast is only five bucks.3) the soups are costly ($5 for a small container - you know, the ones you get wonton soup in from Random Chinese Takeout Place) but the matzoh ball soup here is perfect on so many levels, I don't mind getting one every now and then. matzohs are great consistency, the noodles are fine, and the broth totally hits the goddamn spot.if you swing by Forest Hills and don't go to Knish Nosh, you probably hate freedom. and I will NOT abide by that.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/3/2011,3/18/2012,68,125,8,3,6>I came here a while back with a friend. I had easily passed this place dozens of times on my bike, and never really noticed it, despite being right under my nose. I went there again recently and tried a rum and coke. It was delicious and well made, it reminded me of being back in Cuba in 1944. During that time, I was privy to having some of the best drinks in my small fishing village. Back then, I would set out in the morning and bring back the biggest fish for the markets, and then relax in the cabana and listen to the radio while the waves crashed on the shore. The Yankees were who I liked to listen to, especially when Joe DiMaggio was playing. But eventually my luck ran out that fateful summer as I went 84 days without a bite! I decided I was going to go out as far into the waters as I could, determined to end my cold streak. I finally managed to relax with thoughts of my youth in Africa when I was jolted by the biggest Marlin you'd ever seen. It must have been twenty feet long, I kid you not! After the first day of struggling with the monster, I began to think about the pain the the Great DiMaggio must have endured while playing with a heel spur. I channeled this thought into the ability to fight through the pain. I finally mastered the giant beast on the third day when he circled around the boat. I saw my chance, so I stabbed him with the last energy I had! Though he was a great opponent, I was not to be denied. It was only when I tried to bring the creature of strength and beauty back to my village did I realize the perils of the master hunter of the sea, the shark. I fought them off one by one as they tried to sully my triumph. I rose to the challenge like a phoenix from the ashes of Arabia, but eventually, I could not fend them off any longer. As I pulled the carcass of the great beast back to my village, I sobbed because he died in vain. The other fisherman gathered around my boat could not understand my struggle and my triumph. Before I set down for the deepest of slumbers, I poured myself a coke from the only machine in town, lowered the bottle of pure can rum from the valleys of the island into my drink, and sat thinking about my eternal battle. Just like at this bar. Oh, they have beer too if that's your thing.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2012,3/17/2012,122,316,,7,7>First and foremost, Astoria is the best hood. Just when you didn't think things could get better, a winebar opens up down the street. Yes this is my third time here, I love it here and I will continue to visit the gang at Mosaic, they are the best. This go around, when we arrived to catch the second half of the Patriots game, the place was jammin ... per usual. With that being said there wasn't a table for three people. I then spotted the love seat and two chair configuration, but there was a reserved sign on the table. Then a gentleman came over and said that my friends and I were more than welcome to sit there ... for now and if a bigger party comes along then we'd be bumped. I had never seen this guy before and knew all the staff at Mosaic so I had to introduce myself. He ended up being the owner, Tom, what a great guy!! We quickly ordered booze and I just had to order food. I tried two new menu items the salsa and the guac. The food was brought out rather quickly which was a thing of beauty because I was a hungry girl. Both items were brought out on a square platter decorated with colored tortilla chips with the salsa and guac as the centerpiece of the dish. The salsa was refreshing, cool and chunky. The guac was also very good. It was super smooth not a chunk of avocado and I'm usually a fan of chunky guac but this worked. The guac was topped off with pine nuts and dusting of paprika, making this dish more than eye appealing. If you haven't been to Mosaic, what are you waiting for? No seriously, regardless of what day it is this place is always busy. It's a cozy atmosphere offering up a number of different wines and beers. The staff is friendly, accommodating and fun!! So next time you need a spot to meet friends or just to have a glass of wine I highly recommend you get to Mosaic!
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2011,3/16/2012,280,224,4,8,4>Hop your butt on the 7 and head to Woodside for the best affordable sushi ever!  A couple of college chums and I decided we wanted to grab some sushi in the area, but were a little hesitant because my Queens native said sushi in the area was the pits.  Thank goodness for Yelp as I definitely scored some points for finding an amazing sushi spot in Queens.Started off the night with the shrimp gyoza--so light, tender, and succulent.  Don't be nice like me by sharing this dish, just order your own. I wanted and should have ordered more.  I kid you not, this is the best sushi I've had in my life --Ever!  True, I ordered pretty standard rolls (salmon avocado, spicy tuna)...but if this is what their basic rolls taste like, then I must have been eating spam wrapped in rice all along.  My friends ordered more creative rolls (Dragon roll and some roll with peppered tuna) which were both down right delicious.  We also lushed it up and had two large carafes of sake and Sapporos.The service was phenomenal...as they seem to have a team approach for taking orders and checking on tables.  You need something?  Ask any of the pleasant waiters/waitresses.  As one funny waiter would always say "You have questions, we got some answers".  Well I got a question now:  Do you deliver to Philly?!?!You can also tell that this restaurant pays attention to detail, as I noticed how they kept the raw fish individually wrapped in a vacuum sealed plastic wrap to perserve the freshness.  The restaurant was also very clean.TJ Asian Bistro....you did me good, definitely had a foodgasm as I passed out on the train ride home and craved a ciggy (even though I don't smoke)
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2011,3/15/2012,65,193,8,10,5>For an Indian restaurant on Queens Blvd that does not come with the fear of food poisoning or roaches cooked into your saag paneer, than this is definitely as good as is gets. As you open the door you are always greeted with the amazing aroma of Indian spices and two televisions playing Indian music videos or the occasional Indian soap opera. The staff is super sweet and always refilling your water glasses...you will probably want them refilled once or twice... when they say spicy they mean spicy! I am a regular diner here and what surprises me the most is that they never seem to have an off night. Everytime I have eaten there it is always delicious. The prices are unbeatable. An order of samosas (which i highly recommend by the way) are only like $3-$4! And there are two of them! I never eat there without ordering one of their refreshing mango lassi's, I will even take one to go if I am taking out. A mango lassi is basically a mango smoothie, Indian style. Their saag paneer, aloo gobi, chicken tika massala, lamb biryani, raita, and fluffy naan are always regular favorites my family and I order. If you have room for dessert, try the malai ice cream with a chai tea. All I can say about the malai ice cream is that it is magical. Baskin Robbins will never be the same after trying this special flavor. For someone who loves Indian food, Sajni 026 is the perfect place to go to get a Manhattan quality meal without the Manhattan prices.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/14/2011,3/14/2012,159,257,4,10,9>The Astor Room isn't trying to reinvent anything; rather it's there to remind us why the classics are so great. It is a classy, classy joint. There's a piano player playing softly as you enter.  The bartender (who wears a vest!) will make you a perfectly executed classic cocktail from a short list. It will be nicely balanced, garnished correctly, and served with a smile. If you are lucky, like I was, he will offer to make you and your companions shots, and you can watch him prepare them, in awe at how deft he is. He will offer you a tray of crostini to whet your appetite. The food is actually strangely the weak spot, but as I went for cocktails and just happened to stay for dinner, I was ok with it. Hits:Short Ribs Stroganoff - meaty and succulent, hearty and served over well done noodles. The chef said it's his favorite and I can see why.The truffled fries: Like elevated McDonald's fries. And yes, that is a compliment.Butterscotch Icebox pudding- fair warning, I didn't read the description very carefully, and this is a CHOCOLATE pudding with butterscotch caramel. But it was delicious, smooth and creamy and rich. Good:The salt baked branzino - cooked perfectly, tender, moist, flaky- but weoirdly some salty patches, and one patch that was unbearably so. The potatoes it came with were roasted nicely and the oranges and golden raisins were a good match. Without the salty patches this would have been a hit.Striped Bass with Bacon Clam vinagerette: Very simple, but very good. Smokey and well executed. Unmemorable:Warm spinach salad - not bad, but nothing specialWould not get again:Oysters Rockefeller - not enough oyster.Roasted cauliflower with truffles aioli:  These GIANT heads of cauliflower came out. They were brown, but still raw inside. And it was cold. The truffle aioli was meek. This was a waste of stomach room and of money.The service was very, very attentive, and super kind,  so that, coupled with the excellent cocktails pushes my 3.5 stars to 4.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2011,3/13/2012,153,290,4,9,5>Been craving meat ever since being spoiled in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Most "argentine" steakhouses I've been to since just don't cut it.  I've been meaning to come here in my search for real argentine meat and I am so glad we finally came to test it out.  This restaurant is in no mans land Horace Harding in the flushing area of queens.  When entering the place was packed with what looked to me like native argentines and locals alike. When I was in Argentina the churrascos focused on the meat, the grill, and you would get offered a salad or vegetables on the side. And immediately looking over this menu I had a feeling it would be authentic because it was meat focused! Some other places offer rice and beans etc, I did not eat rice or beans once in BA. We ordered the mixed grill and sangria. The sangria was strong and perfect it tasted like wine and liquor with a splash of club. Exactly what sangria is supposed to taste like. Empanadas to start were delicious and baked just like in BA. Now comes the meat. Holy poop! It was amazing, cooked perfectly rare and not seasoned at all, just had the perfect grill smoky meaty flavors of the south. I don't like blood sausage so I didn't eat that. The service here was great and the restaurant was busy. We had dessert it was nothing special, flan, I've had better. I wish they had alfajores* but that's asking too much.All in all an authentic argentine steak house with excellent prices I might add. Bill was $70 with appetizers, glass of wine, glass of sangria, MEAT and dessert.* argentine cookie with dulce de leche ( caramel) filling
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2011,3/12/2012,245,505,4,9,8>One of my favorite things about my neighborhood!  Even though my end of 30th Avenue is far quieter than "West of Steinway", it is full of charm, and Gian Piero's is definitely a big part of that.From the fresh ciabatta and Italian loaves to the delicious cookies, there is no way to go wrong here.  They have my favorite pignoli cookies (have a maximum of two at one sitting), delectable cream puffs and pastries I don't even know the name of (I just point to them) but love and their cakes are divine.  If you need a dessert to take to a dinner party, this is your place.If you have a moody stepfather visiting and you know he is soothed by taking a walk to the bakery to get fresh bread, this is the spot to send him.  I'm just saying.Coffee here is also great.If you can, grab a spot outside with all the old school Italian men.  Definitely an experience.

Gives you the idea, no?Bohemian Beer garden - sweet mother of Mercury, why aren't there more of these places around?A group of us headed over here for a birthday and were not sure if it was going to go off due to some downpour action earlier in the evening- but the weather cleared and we had a picnic table out back with a couple of pitchers of some awesome beer.We ordered a variety of appetizers to help wash down the beer - the kielbasa was just outstanding as were some of the other things.  the knockwurst was meh, but the pickled cabbage (I think it was cabbage) was addicting.  Cold bacon with pickles- I could pick at that all night. The beers:  a boat load of variety.  I started off with a mug of an IPA and as we got down to business, we ordered pitchers of something- not sure what it was and the waiter wasn't that great with little things like information or the English language.  My best guess was that it was Kruovice svtlé - I double dare you to pronounce that...There was karaoke going on the night I was there and the highlight was a few tourists from China singing Bohemian Rhapsody... Parking totally blows - took me 15 minutes, but I scored a spot almost on the corner, under a tree that apparently houses 458.5 birds; all of which had a bowel movement at approximately the same moment, but I digress... Take the train, drink and be merry.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2011,3/10/2012,102,494,12,14,13>Usually a place like a laundromat can't really warrant a 5 star review, but I invite you to consider this not a Michelin-type 5 star rating; this is more of a 5 star in the laundromat category type of rating.Right before I moved into my building the washing machine apparently broke down, and according to the landlord it actually needs to be replaced. In the meantime, my building is without a washer and as it does in other areas of life, dirty clothes tend to pile up and pile up.Enter Tenchodo. Weird name, but awesome facility. TONS of *working* washers and dryers as far as the eye can see. Folding spaces galore. This place is super clean AND it has the cheapest machines I've seen in some time (even the laundromat I used to frequent in Brooklyn was more expensive, and it certainly wasn't this nice). Washes in the smallest machines are $1.75 (I've seen this at $2 for most places and even up to $2.25!). $0.25 will buy you 8 minutes in the dryers whereas normally it'll buy you 7. That extra minute adds up quickly!As far as I can tell in the two times I've been (once on a weekday evening and once during the weekend), there is also a distinct lack of cracked out hobos frequenting this place compared to other laundromats in the city. Love. It. I'll be around until my landlord gets around to replacing the washer in my building.P.S. Apparently there's free Wi-Fi and there seems to be an old school arcade in the back plus several TV's playing different channels.EDIT: I forgot to add that they have "normal people" hours, e.g. they're open late enough that those of us with jobs during the day don't have to rush home and rush to the laundromat in order to beat the last wash deadline; I believe the last wash on weekdays is 10:30 p.m.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/26/2012,7/5/2013,83,197,7,11,8>You can barely see and touch in this dark restaurant and with the loud music, you can barely hear the friend next to you. But the only 2 senses you really need here are your taste and smell and Debasaki wouldn't want it any other way. Let's start this review of by saying everything tastes great. We had the:Gyoza Wings (15 for $17.95) - Chicken wings with a filling inside. You get to pick from cheese/corn, shrimp, veggie, kimchi, or pepper. Choose all of the same or mix it up. The majority of my group said the cheese corn was the best filling. Unfortunately that's the one I didn't get to try, Curse Odd Numbers! I would say shrimp comes in at a close second then. yelp.com/biz_photos/debaBoneless BBQ with Small Octopus - Awesome sweet, spicy, sticky mixture of tender chicken and seafood. About 70% of it is chicken and the other 30% is mussels, shrimp, and shrunken octopus. yelp.com/biz_photos/debaThe stuffed chicken wings are definitely the must try at Debasaki. This unique twist of the fried chicken would leave you wanting to try out every filling. Also Debasaki's other wing choices are not half bad. My tip is to stick to the chicken though because the rice and noodle dishes here are not as great.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2013,7/4/2013,8,31,7,11,9>Let me just say that I had been fitted for bras before and by far the BEST service I've received was here at Magic Corset and I am a very picky person to please!I went there looking to buy bras and just a heads up, don't be surprised if the sales lady gets into the dressing room with you. It's a full service thing lol, I got help to put the bras on, off and even to situate my breasts.  These two women definitely have a gift and I can't express how happy I was when I left...I actually wore one of the new bras out the store lolAlso I was never pressured to buy anything which is a big PLUS. I'd recommend this place to any of my friends!

Yummy!Everything is fresh.  It always takes them a little bit of time to cook the food, but I am glad to wait because that means it's being made when we order (not sitting in containers waiting to be reheated).  I definitely recommend starting with the sampler platter (veggie samosa, chicken samosa, pakora, and lamb spring roll) because it's difficult to choose between the four items.  As for entrees, I LOVE the Lamb Vindaloo!  It's spicy and delicious. The Chicken Tikka Masala is my second runner up.  Grab a side of garlic naan and you're all set.  Just make sure you have a friend or two to share it with because you get a TON of food.  If you're going solo, no problem!  You'll be enjoying the leftovers for a few days.This is by far the best Indian food I've eaten in New York.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2013,7/2/2013,280,538,13,14,14>***DISCLAIMER*** Beware that the receptionists can't speak English. When I ask for a hair consultation and to recommend a stylist, they stared at me blankly and said, "Haircut?" After explaining my situation for a minute or 2, they stared at me blankly again and said, "So, haircut?" And when I asked what was the name of my stylist and should I tip him directly or put it in an envelope, they really didn't understand.Oh my goodness, Inforé is so chic! I was a bit upset that Hair JJ was gone because it was a lot closer to me than Inforé is now, but I think it was probably for the best for them. The new facility comes with:- An expanded waiting area- Recliners in the shampooing area- The same lockers that we've grown to love at the previous location- Limited parking in the frontI like it. I like it a lot. And all their hairstyle books? Rasysa!I came here as a walk-in on Saturday after an unsatisfied cut from Sub-Image, so I wandered on Northern until I hit Inforé. It was exactly the same price as the previous salon I went to, but this place was so much nicer.When I finally talk to my assigned stylist (I forgot his name, but remember his face), he realized that it wasn't a regular cut, but more of a fixing cut, he dried my hair and try to analyze my issue. We talked, I showed him pics of my previous haircuts, he consulted, told me what was feasible, what he can do. When the cut was finally done, my sense of panic was gone, and felt a little bit better. I've only went to Hair JJ/Inforé in the past for hair treatment, but I think I'm going to go back for haircuts now.
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2013,7/1/2013,93,365,6,10,9>Dining at Portalia is truly an impeccable experience. I believe that the owners have succeeded in their mission to bring a Manhattan experience and level of quality to Queens. And, of the many restaurants I've visited in the area, I believe Portalia to be the best of the bunch. In an area as heavily saturated with eateries as Astoria, that says a lot.The dining area and atmosphere at Portalia is refined, chic and intimate. Service was of the highest quality. We were greeted and treated as though we were long time regulars. And though the overall vibe could easily be misconstrued by outsiders as intimidating, we were met without an ounce of pretentiousness.The focaccia with goat cheese mixed with tomato sauce dipping accompaniment was a welcome change from the standard butter or EVOO, balsamic, salt and pepper combination that is usually presented at Italian restaurants. We ordered the crab cake appetizer, as well as the grilled octopus with fingerling potatoes and bitter greens to start. Both were perfect. My boyfriend proclaimed the crab cakes to be among the best rendition that he's ever had. And, the combination of contrasting textures and flavors regarding the octopus were unique and extremely well balanced.I ordered the grilled lamb chops, and would have licked my plate clean if it were socially acceptable. They were well seasoned and cooked exactly to my requests. The spinach provided a lean counterbalance to the fatty deliciousness of the lamb. While browsing other reviews, I noticed that the lamb largely goes unordered by many in favor of the maiale or steak offerings, but I believe it to be a hidden gem on their menu. My boyfriend's salmon was accompanied by a mustard cream sauce that he enjoyed thoroughly. He commented that he found it to be a bit overcooked, but to Portalia's defense, we did not specify any cooking preference at the time we ordered so it could be perceived by some as an oversight of our own part.We were too full to enjoy dessert, but if any of their offerings taste as good as they looked, I can safely say that you won't be disappointed. Their wine selection was well varied as deserves mention as well. The owner, who greeted and seated us, clearly takes pride in his restaurant, and his attention to detail shine through when dining here. There wasn't a single aspect of the entire experience that didn't meet or exceed my expectations.

Net net, it's a quality brunch option on the lowbudget with pretty good basic omelettes, solid quantities of food, and unlimited cheap booze.  You know what to do.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2013,6/29/2013,36,97,7,7,7>This is one of my new favorite places.  It used to be Tofu which was terrible, so its nice to see something clean, fresh and new open up in its spot.  The decor is trendy and sleek.  In the middle of the room there is this water sculputure-ish thing that off-sets the mood.  The first time I came here I got one of their hot dishes which was delicious.  The food here is great, but very pricey so be aware that your meal may add up quick.  They have some great appetizer options, but relatively small portions which is sad because gurlll likes to eat.The reason I am writing this review though is not to talk about a salad or some dumplings, it is to talk about the southeast asia roll.  Hands down, one of the best rolls of sushi I ever had, and its not even fish!  This roll incorapates some indian-esque seasoned chicken, with peanut drizzle sauce - my mouth is literally watering writing this it was that good.  Nothing can compare ever since the fateful day I tried this roll lol.  The other rolls were great too but they paled in comparison.
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/6/2013,6/28/2013,51,149,4,6,5>So I definitely really want to come back here as soon as possible!!First of all let me say I had absolutely no idea this place even existed and still wouldn't if my friend didn't point it out to me. The front of this place looks super out-dated and basically blends in with the building, but the interior is really cozy, modern and nice. I really like the concept of this place!My friend and I split the chicken with caramel dip for appetizer. Really delicious. Then we both had the mac and cheese which was AMAZING. It was so hearty and creamy and delicious and definitely not good for you. But DELICIOUS. For dessert I had the pumpkin whoopie pie which was really good also. I will for sure be back!! Their menu is exciting and unique.
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2013,6/27/2013,30,93,4,10,5>I put 4.5 stars!This restaurant is one of my favorite place in my neighborhood and I haven't review this place before but it was my 5th time of visit.I always have the burger at this place and thought they're burger got better then before!(*as my memory, they got a grade C under? by health department about a year ago and had to close a bit. I was so busy and couldn't be there in the while so I really don't remember how long they've been closed and when they reopened. but I thought they improved after the closed at this time.)The burger is cooked perfect and so juicy and the side of fried potato is tasty. (it has a potato skin!)and price and portion is great too.I love to try the different burger shop in Manhattan and I have a favorite burgers in there but this place makes me comeback every little while.It's definitely one of my 5 best burgers in NY:)The place itself has a good numbers of seats and good old bar area at the front.You'll see a lots of neighbors hangout to have a beers and food.My favorite point of the restaurant is the decor. old, antique looking furnitures including small fireplace and wine storage room.I may recommend for everyone who willing to try this restaurant to be expect that this old school neighbor's favorite place has "the old school service" by experienced waitresses.It might make you smile!
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2013,6/26/2013,222,114,8,10,8>Here is what went down:2 weeks ago: NYTimes' Hungry City blog blows the cover on Lao Dong Bei.  Crispy fried fish with cumin is mentioned.  1.9 weeks ago: Lao Dong Bei is overrun with mixed-race couples ordering the said review's Orange Pork and/or cumin fish.  ('Ordering' in Mandarin, or 'ordering' by pointing and gesticulating (me))The review does not lie; the dishes are delicious.  Skip the review's dessert, though: the sticky caramelized taro (or sweet potato, etc.) cubes that are to be dipped in a bowl of cold water are actually tasteless ...and there is only so much fried sugar that one should eat anyway.  Otherwise, this place is a great find.  That fried cumin fish haunts my dreams now.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/29/2012,2/23/2013,472,510,14,18,16>I am truly excited about this place, what a great, new discovery in Fresh Meadows.  I have a friend who lives in the area and whenever I visit her, I'm a bit exasperated at the lack of new, and interesting food options, as I am tired of eating at the Q'doba, Applebees, and the former Hooters (now, Ale House).  I love that Mian is not exactly on the main drag, but still close enough to all the stores and shops.  Btw, don't be confused by the huge "Delicatessen" signage on the building, I was told they will be removing that very soon!  This is not a Chinese, kosher deli, ha.The contemporary space is very open and the atmosphere is inviting.  There is seating and accompanying benches that line the wall, but there are also small table and stools that can sit three in each setting.  The vintage, Chinese-style furniture lends a very traditional sensibility to the decor.  Overall, this place is a visually, well-balanced mix of new and old.  Food-wise, Mian is pretty much a great option around the clock.  You can enjoy a great brunch, lunch and dinner at really affordable prices (all entrees under $10).  The food is surprisingly very good, the portions are generous, and the flavors, authentic.  I really enjoyed my Ginger Scallion Cold Noodles with shredded chicken (though it just needed an extra touch of ginger flavor).  I tasted my sister's roast pork noddle soup, and the meat was tender and there was no pesky fat globs on the roast pork.  Her Cantonese fiance had congee and was impressed at how authentic it tasted.  Dessert was an excellent, thick-chunk of almond toast, generously lathered in condensed milk (creamy, sweet and buttery).  The best part of our experience at Mian was talking with our waitress, Liz.  She was so delightful and full of energy and really made the experience that much more memorable.  She stayed past her shift just to take care of us, and chatted us up, giving us helpful information about the restaurant.  Though they have only been open for 2 months, it looks like the business is seamlessly rolling forward with a tentative liquor license in the works, and a credit card tendering system also on its way.  For the lucky ducks who live nearby, Mian delivers!  I was happy to find them on grubhub (grubhub.com/nyc/fresh-me), and will adamantly propose ordering from here the next time we get takeout with our Fresh Meadows friends.  I can definitely envision, successful Queens Yelp events occurring at this cozy, cool, little place.  In fact, I'm going to email Jando (our amazing CM) right now and propose this idea!
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/19/2012,2/22/2013,168,160,7,9,6>You ever hear the term you can't judge a book by it's cover? of course you have you live in America for goodness sake! well that term perfectly fits this restaurant. When I walked in i got goosebumps, not because i was scared by the mediocre setting (really drab decor), but because of the strong draft that basically let the lightest wind in. Great, this is going to be a horrible eating experience,  i thought. well thankfully i was wrong. Once we got in they pumped up the heat and it was nice and warm. But better than that is the warm service. Other's have mentioned that the service is great, and it really is, the servers are always very nice and accomodating, talk about serice with a smile, they were so friendly. Very nice. They start you off with a pumpkin porridge that was nice and then give you this onion tea, it's not as bad as it sounds when you drink it hot. apparently it's good for the cholesterol. anyway. what's amazing is what you can get for a few bucks off of their lunch menu. I've had a few things here and the food is always pretty consistant. it all tastes great. Their side dishes are not great but i assume they give you a lot more if you are getting the bbq.but even if you don't get the bbq, come have some lunch.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2013,2/21/2013,45,115,7,14,11>Was going to go for seafood but at the last minute decided to come here after multiple friends, yelpers and the community leader of Queens, Jando, asked me if I've ever tried this place.  I went to OpenTable.com and saw there were still available tables, made my res and went.  Am I glad I went.We get there and the hostess states there is a 25 minute wait to the couple before us and I said I have the res and were seated in 5 minutes (got there early).  The waiter, Johnny, came by and took our drink orders and immediately apologized that due to two parties on the deck and the manager needing to help in the kitchen, that they were running behind.  We looked at the menu and decided on the Feta Cheese Tater Tots and the Sizzling Saganaki (cheese... I forgot what cheese he said it was, but it wasn't feta).  The Tater Tots were tasty and served with a spicy feta dipping sauce that was sublime.  The Saganaki was also very tasty and came in with lemon that complemented the dish well.For dinner I had the Mediterranean Branzino and my girlfriend ordered the Greek Souvalakia Trio.  Johnny bought us a round of drinks because of the wait (AWESOME!).  The Banzino was butterflied and deboned (I was promised that I would find no more than a few bones around where the spine was) and was served with a choice of two sides... I asked for the red lemon potatoes and roasted cauliflower, to which the waiter remarked was the perfect choices for fish.  The Branzino was light and succulent.  There was a nice seared tasted to it and there were only 2 bones!  The cauliflower was to die for: roasted perfectly in a lemon butter sauce with some garlic and salt.  The red lemon potatoes should be renamed red roasted potatoes as they were roasted perfectly without any lemon flavor to them (the only disappointment of the night).  The Souvakalia Trio is steak, chicken and pork souvakalia over some greens served with pita and tsatziki.  The steak was PHENOMENAL, cooked perfectly and extremely juicy.  The chicken and pork were also amazing.I judge Greek restaurants by their tsatziki... eXo is one of the best.  It's very hearty with flavors that smack your tongue with cucumber and garlic.  It's not as creamy as others I've tried... so this is a different class of tsatziki.  I sat there spooning it into my mouth after my girlfriend tapped out from her meal.For dessert, Johnny bought another round of drinks (again... AWESOME) because of the kitchen delays and we had a dessert that I cannot recall the name of... It was three thick slices vanilla ice cream wrapped in shredded phyllo dough and what tasted like granola served with whipped cream and a scope of vanilla ice cream on top.  That too was out of this world.I will be going back there no only for the taste and quality of the food but because of the friendliness of the staff.  The only downside... red lemon potatoes and the place was a bit on the loud side, but I can live with that if the food and the service remains 5 star quality.
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2012,2/20/2013,241,315,9,10,10>Oh Golden Palace.Why do you name yourself Golden Palace. Golden Palace is the name of crappy Chinese hole-in-the-wall takeouts. You are the authentic gem in the heart of Flushing. Just get rid of your English name. Or name it Kickass Foods.Liao Ning Fan Dian, (Liao Ning Restaurant) is freaking awesome... if you're a traditional Chinese dude like me. It's for Chinese foodies and people who really love Chinese food. Sure, the place doesn't look high class and I bet its kitchens are not as clean as my other 5 star restaurants. But I rate dumplings. I simply have to say this is the best place to have steamed dumplings. Come here if you want to have authentic northern handmade steamed dumplings.The skin is perfect, the xier (filling) is perfect. If you do not like these dumplings, that simply means you don't really like authentic real dumplings, because this is what its supposed to taste like. Oh yes, as with any proper dumpling meal, you have your dumplings with vinegar and soysauce. Hell yes.I've had many dishes. Another good one is 'xiao ji dun muo gu,' which is chicken and mushroom. This classic northern dish is so commonplace and homey that it's a sin not for northern restaurants to not have it on the menu, just like how beef and broccoli is for fake Chinese food holes. Anddddd its delicious. Did I mention its cheap too?Did I mention its one of the best steamed dumplings "dumpling predator" has eaten (and I have eaten many in China too.)
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2012,2/19/2013,289,416,11,14,15>"Into each life, some alcohol must fall." When some Yelp friends proposed to have pre-dinner drinks at Dutch Kills on a Friday, I decided to let some alcohol fall.  Although I am close to abhorring the term "speakeasy" due to the plethora of pretentious places I have seen all over, Dutch Kills not only redeemed the term but honors it by elevating  the art of cocktail to a new level.  I walked into Dutch Kills after finding that elusive necessity called "parking".  The booths were in front as you enter the door while the bar is at the back.  My friends have already ordered their drinks and everyone seemed pleased with their respective choices.  I went for bourbon and got the Gold Rush.  It was smooth, had a hint of orange and easy, in fact, way too easy to drink. My friends offered me a taste of their drinks and I enjoyed the fact that none of the drinks were sweet.  I can't wait to be back for more!
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2012,2/18/2013,188,199,6,10,10>Damn, I miss Paris. Coming back to New York after 12 days of eating the best food I have, and probably will ever have, was disappointing to say the least. What I miss most about Paris are the BAKERIES. My lovely aunt suggested we grab dessert at "La Boulangerie" and it was the Best suggestion she ever made!From the moment we walked in, I felt like I was back in Paris. The baguettes, the croissants, the buttery sweets..... pure heaven. We ordered a little bit of everything.....literally... everything. My favorite dessert was the Gateau Breton,  (I hope I'm getting the name right). You have to try this!!! It looks like a cupcake, they must make each one with 50 sticks of butter. Just give me a cup of coffee and 10 of those things and I'm a happy camper. Croissants are flaky, buttery, almost as good as the one's I had in Paris. We racked up a $53.00 bill.....yes, in a bakery! Everything I tried, I liked. You can't go wrong with this place. Plus, the decor is some rustic and French country. The tables are raw woods, and there is a window, where you can see the pastry chefs and bakers hard at work. The counter staff is super pleasant and sweet, and the iced coffee is rich and divine. Friendly, cozy, and warm, you'll find a little slice of Paris in Queens.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2012,2/17/2013,30,5,4,10,3>I only joined this gym a couple of weeks ago so I can only speak to my first few experiences at this gym, which was pretty good, to say the least.Joining: If you use the promo code: "1enroll" on their website, the $99 enrollment fee gets waived. This code still works as of Tuesday, November 13, 2012. The price you pay for your first month comes out to $41.92. Subsequent months are $20.89. I read somewhere in the terms that they also charge a $29+tax annual membership fee billed on either August 1 or December 1, which isn't a big deal, but I do wish that they would state that a little more boldly as opposed to hiding it in fine print in the terms and conditions that you have to accept before you register.The Facility: It's a brand new gym. While I don't have any personal experience with any of the machines, they all seem to be in working order. The gym itself is rather spacious and comes equipped with dumbbells up to 120 lbs in 5-lb increments, along with all your standard flat/incline/decline benches. They also have the assisted dip machine, several treadmills and ellipticals, ropes, and a plethora of other machines that I did not mention.Other Amenities: I haven't actually been in, but I believe there's also a mini-theater in the gym that plays a movie-of-the-day on repeat where members can go in and relax. I recall Safe House being one of the movies that was being played.I think they also have a juice bar with your typical overpriced gym drinks.The men's locker room is well-maintained.Complaints: 1) Members have a tendency to not place equipment back where they got it (e.g. dumbbells are in the wrong places).2) The last time I was there using one of the machines, one of the "personal trainers" came up to me and practically kicked me off of it because he wanted to use it with his trainee. Literally, he said, "how many more sets you have because we're coming here right now." That was rather rude.Overall, I'm satisfied with my decision to join Retro Fitness. Hopefully the upcoming months won't bring disappointment.

<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2012,2/15/2013,545,1338,13,20,20>Fancy brunch in Queens. This is where you should take all your out of town guests or the parents.The Astor Room was the "it" restaurant of 2011. Now it's just a reliable classy place to go. I have been to The Astor Room on three separate occasions for different reasons and had a different experience for each meal.I have experienced The Astor Room for a large party in the party room for big groups, sitting at the bar because getting a table was impossible for a weekend lunch, and for Saturday brunch without the jazz.The Astor Room is excellent for large parties. Even if you share the room with other groups there is still a sense of privacy and The Astor Room gives you all the attention you need. Service is excellent! I'd recommend The Astor Room for special occasions such as birthdays, bridal showers, and baby showers.When The Astor Room is busy, they are busy! Expect an hour wait or so. My group of three decided to not wait it out and just sat at the bar. We were sort of forgotten and it took a very long time to get our food to the point where the wait made us yawn. It's a good thing the manager and bar staff humored us by talking hockey.My most recent meal at The Astor Room was for Saturday brunch. We arrived in the first hour and there was no one there. I hope The Astor Room isn't losing their mojo. I'll chalk up the lack of customers to post hurricane and snow storm woes. After an hour had passed, more people arrived but it was a snoozer compared to the fuss going on for Sunday jazz brunches.Nonetheless, the food has always been excellent no matter when. I love that you get a complimentary Bela Lugosi (bloody Mary) or Guilded Lady (mimosa). It makes brunch the best deal. In reality, even if they didn't give a free drink it'd still be a good deal at approximately $10 per person.I recommend the fried chicken, eggs benedict, donuts, granola and Greek yogurt, and Astor Burger. You will really get the most bang for your buck with the chicken or burger. Amazing. I'm still thinking back on my meals. I wouldn't recommend the Astor Disaster. While I don't know anyone who has actually complained about it (everyone I know actually liked it) I just think it looks kind of sad on the plate. Disastrous presentation.Everything else about The Astor Room is precious and has charm from another era. They even take your coat.
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/25/2012,2/14/2013,20,69,11,11,14>As a decedent of Chilean parents, I take pride in two particular things, Chile has the best wine in South America, and no one makes better sandwich style foods than we do. Enter New York Pão de Queijo. I would gladly lick a sidewalk in Bronx, or worse Brooklyn, to get a free sandwich here. I have come to realize from eavesdropping and talking to people in Brooklyn, that they have no idea how good the food is in Queens (take your pick from the numerous neighborhoods) and my first recommendation to the ignorant is Pão de Queijo.I first explored this utopia of burger sandwiches with my girlfriend, it met three criteria... cute for a date, it was something new, and they had sandwiches/burgers. The staff is scary friendly, like why are you being so nice to me friendly. They're willing to answer questions and explain what exactly the weird things on the menu are. The menu is my worst nightmare, in a good way, everywhere I looked there was sausage, jamons, fried eggs, and bacons. If you're not prepared you can have a panic attack, consider yourselves advised. My first ever sandwich burger from Pão de Queijo was the Minas burger. The view is spectacular... layers of brazilian sausage, cheese, a burger patty, tomato, potato sticks, and lettuce, embraced by mayo slathered buns. The first bite was a life changing moment, I no longer hated Brazilian soccer and even more so I loved this damn sandwich. Add a little bit of the magic aioli sauce and life just seems too perfect. Add their fries and it just doesn't seem possible that the experience could get better, but it does. I encourage playing around with the pattern of your bites, take some fries then bite your sandwich, bite the sandwich take some fries. The perfect accompaniment to this meal is the a can of Guarana Antarctica, for whatever reason it just works. I also recommend the pineapple mint smoothie.Since my first visit I have also returned to try the Calabresa, Pao com Linguica, and the Guloso. Anyone of these and I am sure that any of their sandwiches will satisfy you to delight. These are serious sandwiches, prepare to hibernate. All I can honestly say is that I truly love this place. Nowhere else can my, admitted, "obession" of  sandwiches satisfy the fantasies, the combo of meats is only enhanced by the veggies wedge between the glorious bun. From someone who severely misses the Italian Deli, in Granada Hills California, this place is home for me, making sure that your only other destination requires you to sit and contemplate why it took you so long to visit in the first place. New York Pão de Queijo? Yes, please.a million times.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2013,12/3/2013,116,655,10,10,11>Taverna Kyclades was my next stop on the official tour before leaving Astoria. Astoundingly, I had never crossed the threshold at what many believe to be the paramount of Greek cuisine in our humble little hood. It was definitely worth the visit.I wouldn't say the ambiance is super special or luxe - if anything, its just very friendly and neighborhoody. Its approachable, affordable, and easy to please almost anyone. Definitely fits the bill for a neighborhood staple.Qian and I decided to order: Grilled octopusSteakGreek shrimpSide of swiss chardWe were served the tasty warm bread with olive oil (and polished off almost the whole loaf!). The grilled octopus had a nice char to it and was tender. It wasn't the best octopus I had, but it was above average. The steak was stellar, especially for the price point. And the shrimp were large and well seasoned. I nearly cleaned the dish with the bread, it was so delectable. The meal may feel a bit heavy however, as portions are diner-like in size and appearance. The meal also came with a complimentary dessert, which was a custard cake with a phyllo top crust. Tasty and affordable! Hooray!

The smell of Foldgers in the morning?, an earthquake maybe?, the second coming of Noah's Ark perhaps? Nope!, reality is, not even a really young and springy booty call can get me up that early in the morning.I got up, maneuvered my limbs one-behind-the-other over to Paris Baguette, and I ate one of their croissants. Now if this were an ordinary croissant this review would end here...What happened was this...My hair erected up to attention, my stomach muscles relaxed, my taste buds woke up, and my tongue hit the gym, literally.I wasn't just eating a croissant at that point, I was enjoying it, partly ingesting, partly molesting...When I lifted my head up to catch my breadth I noticed stares!! They weren't friendly smiles either, people were covering up their children's eyes. Apparently, when I eat croissants, it appears as if I'm french-kissing a whore.When my friends ask me why I don't travel the world with all the bags of gold that I have, I tell them I have Paris Baguette right here in my town. That's practically like Paris all in one place, almost. Mind you this one in Flushing is predominantly Asian, about 99.8% to be mathematically correct.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2013,11/30/2013,77,112,4,5,4>MP Taverna is CRISP.Questionable move opening next to what seems to be the most popular Greek restaurant in the entire country (Kyclades, overrated much?, still always commanding 3 hour waits). Having lived across the street for over a year now, I was skeptical about what this place was going to be. Construction was going on for a real long time, and it seemed like there was never any progress. At best I thought it was going to be a huge Greek catering hall. But it turned out to be an amazing classy restaurant that has really made this strip of Ditmars Blvd.the place to be. First off the bar is beautiful, going out on a limb and saying that is the nicest bar in all of Astoria. It really does attract beautiful people, dare I say "Manhattanites"?The food is fresh and clean, a more Americanized version of the all the other Greek restaurants in the area.MP is definitely here to stay.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2013,11/29/2013,19,95,5,8,3>We're all aware of the lack of good coffee shops in this neighborhood. And worse, the most convenient ones are chains. If I don't brew my own on days that I am most lazy and anything more that 8 blocks away is just out of question.. I go to Dunkin Donuts. It's a sad life. This is Astoria, we are food spoiled. But not coffee spoiled? It just makes no sense. That was then now Salon de Coffee is a short couple of blocks away.I walked past Salon de Coffee a few times while it was in construction, it already looked promising then. So when it was finally open we were so excited! They brew a pretty solid brew. Definitely one of the better brews in Astoria. The owners are very attentive and are ready to give this neighborhood the best. Mention a brew you like and discuss it with them. Maybe they'll get it. The guy seems to be a passionate foodie. I know I went in and made it clear that I want Dough doughnuts. And I don't mean any pressure but I was told Salon de Coffee will get those amazing goodies.The decor is pretty cute. They have mismatched chairs and marble table tops. Nice touches that should be standard. A few people have commented on the music which I find really ridiculous. Honestly, just ask one of the staff members to change to music to suit your preference and they will do it. Good music is relative but in this coffee shop the customer is the boss. Salon de Coffee is like a gift to the rapidly changing neighborhood that is Astoria. Take your computer, get coffee and a pastry and chat with their friendly staff. Free Wifi and good coffee = win.

Since moving to this area of LIC, I have been bemoaning the lack of restaurants and bars nearby.  I noticed that Dutch Kills Centraal opened up a few weeks ago and I kept meaning to stop in. Since their grand opening, every time I've walked by the place has been packed. It seems like there are a lot of families with small children. My husband and I finally had a chance to stop in last night. While we didn't try any of the beers, we did order the burger, fries with sriracha mayo sauce, and mac 'n cheese. Everything was good, but especially the mac 'n cheese. The cavatappi noodles were topped with a perfect blend of cheeses and breadcrumbs. Did I mention the mac 'n cheese was amazing? Our server was friendly and attentive, though it did seem like in general the workers are still ironing out a few kinks in their processes. My husband and I will definitely be frequenting this place if they continue to maintain such high levels of food quality and customer service.But yes...I am too curious about what happened to the Windmill Tap & Grill.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2013,11/27/2013,757,559,11,13,11>When I was asked to shop with a friend at a new food store, obviously I became excited. Anytime I get to walk the aisles of a food (retail or distribution) shop I have never visited, I do look forward to it, is that odd?Parking was very easy for a Friday late morning shopping excursion and the store was to my inexperienced eyes, rather empty inside. My friend had a list and a timeline, I had neither so off I went to explore the aisles and space caps that lye ahead for my amusement. (IE: poking, reading, smelling and overall examining) Buying in bulk has only been something I have experienced insuch stores as Costco, and BJ's Wholesale which consist mainly of items typically used in the home. As the name of the business outlines, this is the restaurants version of where to purchase in bulk, but on a much grander scale. As I began my journey I kept thinking that from the outside, you can not tell the monolithic size of Restaurant Depot's inside. Without a good memory, it would take some time to recall the location of the items and not to mention the items not on eye level, but atop the erected steel beams that display many goods.The seafood area was my first stop where I stood dead center of, as it is oval in shape and spun like a top. I was astounded and impressed by the prices on such items as top neck clams, Blue Point oysters, lobster and mussels. It really goes to show the markup of the menu price as it relates to the actual procurement cost. As I continued into the meat section I was really taken back by how much meat was in their display racks, staring back at me, or so it felt as some of the cuts had the very identifiable portions of the animal in tact. The smallest amount of pork ribs was 13 Lbs, basically three 12-16 inch slabs which ran under $20.00. While I was perusing the pork shoulders, as I had a split pea soup on my mind due to the subarctic conditions, a young employee asked if I was in need of any help. It struck me as interestingly pleasing as every time I shopped at the Costoc's and B's, I had never been approached for assistance, in fact quite the opposite. And the offers of help did not end there. As busy as these employees were, they were engaging and outwardly looking to go the extra step to ensure customers satisfaction. At one point there were a group of firemen with a three pack of Kingsford charcoal which I could not locate. A stock person came off his forklift and with a forward hand gesture stated "Just follow me" and walked me a half of the way across the store to point out their location. I had to stop the floor manager and express my gratitude for the extra effort put forth and to express how impressive my shopping experience has been thus far.  Although I did not make it to the produce department as I was saturated with visual snapshots and what I hope to come back to purchase, I may need a full day to cover that section.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2013,11/26/2013,171,248,17,8,7>Am I the only one excited about this place?Look, this is where the old Entenmann's foods go to die. The last chance for someone to take a box of doughnuts home before they really go into the garbage. FOR FIFTY CENTS!!!You can literally buy nearly expired foods for 50 cents here. They have a pretty large selection of really great deals on just over due or almost due highly processed foods. I'm not saying you should just buy all your groceries here, but I did pick up some fantastic red, white, and blue doughnut holes for a buck. Happy Independence Day!You can also get a 2 liter soda for $1.79 all the time. So if you really feel shitty about yourself you can come get a pack of doughnuts, a cake, cookies, soda and some english muffin for the next morning all for under $5. High Five!
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2013,11/25/2013,115,200,14,15,16>Winter is coming. You can feel it by the chill in the air, the shortness of the days and the creaking of your bones. Okay, maybe that last part is just me but... Winter is coming. That means that more days than not you will find me walking into a dingy entrance on the left hand side of a mall where its golden days are the days long past as its exterior has not been cleaned in ages. Walking down a bustling hallway and up a short flight of stairs where there are vendors selling dumplings and scallion pancakes. As if you were transported to another place and you were just another character in a Wong Kar Wai movie. You saunter slowly past them because you know that winter is coming. That means the only sure cure to arm yourself against those seemingly endless cold nights is a bowl of warm soup. Not just any bowl. But lamb noodle soup. Balls of dough lay on the counter oiled, resting and glistening as if they has just been expertly massaged by magic fingers they are soon to be given a dizzying dance of stretching and pulling and whirling and rolled into a pot of hot boiling water suddenly tranformed into the perfect chewy hand pulled noodle as long as the days of summer. With a swirl in the salty bath they are then seized and plopped into a bowl awaiting your pleasure with a friendly cast of characters of wood ear mushrooms, black cloud ear fungus, jewel red goji berries, translucent vermicelli noodles, strands of thin long noodles, a handful of chopped emerald green cilantro and flavorful chunks of lamb. This bowl holds a lot of personality. These flimsy white plastic bowls are full to the brim with a flavorful broth that carries the warmth of spring and hearty enough to give you the strength of a lion and the confidence that you will get through another bitter winter night with a clear head and full gut and cure sluggishness and whatever may ail you. Before seating yourself on a plastic table paired with mismatched stools and diving in and immersing yourself in the comforts of your bowl take note of the hot chili oil that is offered. It is as hot as dragon fire and one little sniff a little too close and it will send a shockwave to your brain. They say that a good bowl of soup is like a warm hug and there is a warmth that pervades your being as you drink down the last spoonfuls of the soup. Maybe if the Lannisters and the Starks hugged it out over a bowl of lamb noodle soup then there would be less bloodshed and tears. If you like mead with your lamb meat this place is also BYOB. There's nothing like pulling a cold Sapporo tallboy out of your jacket pocket to complement your warm soup but other cans of popular sodas and soy milk can be had in the freezer next to the garbage. In case you need to whet your appetite they have trays of crunchy, chilled, pickled dishes like the pickled potato and pickled seaweed that you can order as an appetizer. In case there is some miracle that you do not finish your soup pour it into the strainer next to the garbage can and chuck your bowl into the other garbage. It would help if you spoke the language, mandarin that is, which I do not, but a few hand gestures and pointing at the sign above the counter, they pretty much know why you are here anyways. For the lamb noodle. Just let them know if you want to go big or go small.I believe this tiny shop in such a squalid, unremarkable place is what started the popularity and demand of lamb noodle due to their tv fame which has prompted a price hike but it is still very inexpensive and any person who saves a few coppers will be able to get a bowl. What draws people like Anthony Bourdain to places like this is that there can be good authentic regional food to be found in even the grittiest of settings and has me wandering in here for more each winter, spring and fall. No idea where these flocks of lambs are being raised to supply meat for this new demand but I am glad that I can come here to this unpretentious place for a good solid bowl of soup noodles. Come in here for a bowl of lamb noodle soup because.. Winter is coming and you need to shield yourself from the cold.

Here's the skinny:-A wide range of teas / coffee-Gloriously decadent sweets in a large display case. I highly recommend the pear brioche. -Books on display are take one/ give one. Cool concept.- Seating is usually available though I do wish the chairs were comfier for longer stays.Tips:They have bagels early in the morning (they actually get them from Brooklyn Bagel and sell them at their storefront -- we asked!) but tend to run out in the early morning rush. So, if you want a bagel, get there before 9am.Credit cards are accepted, but they have a minimum so if you only want to stop in for a cup of joe be sure to have some cash on hand.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/24/2012,1/3/2013,108,1039,5,10,9>I've only been here once but would easily come back in a heart beat. Bonus points for being in Astoria.It's big draw is the fact that their classes are $5 a pop and it's in a very convenient location just a few blocks from the train.  The instructor was nice and like many people who've reviewed previously, it is a very non-judgmental atmosphere.It was my first time doing yoga in a class setting in over 10 years so I wasn't sure what to expect. This is a place I felt a beginner, intermediate or advanced person could come without issue.The class does get rather full, but they cut off the entry so you're not packed beyond capacity.  That does mean you're probably better off getting here early to make sure you can grab a spot.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/28/2012,1/2/2013,422,494,11,9,7>Only two things should ever be under a bridge :  Alligators and trolls.  But this stone bridge (more like a miniature tunnel) that covers AA Plaza has some of the cheapest eats in Flushing.Pros : Pork buns (4 for $1.25)Scallion Pancakes (It is crack especially if you get it with that tangy, sweet soy sauce...OMFG.  Don't know if they offer it but don't try without it.)Some other soup varietiesConvenience (it is right next to the LIRR Flushing Station).Cons : Location (it is a very narrow sidewalk and heavy foot traffic area = random elbow jabs from strangers).Smokers alley way (I don't know why smokers congregated in this narrow space but they do.  I don't dislike smokers I just dislike when you smoke and I'm choking on second handed smoke.  Not cool.  It is like drinking someone else's drink with backwash...)Other food options (if you are picking up a quick bite this is the place for you.  If you are expecting a wonderful experience you are sadly mistaken)No Parking ANYWHERE (This isn't like you can stand your car for a brief second, hop out and order to go.  You will get a ticket and your meal will end up being 40-50 bucks more.  Not worth the risk.  If you are a pedestrian then go for it.)
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/20/2012,1/1/2013,783,346,7,9,5>How good can a bagel be??This was the sort of question pre-Brooklyn Bagel me would have asked.  Now I pity the fool who asks such a question in NYC.   Because really, there are a number of bagel spots that tickle folks' fancy here.   I am not here to say Brooklyn Bagel is superior to Murray's, or Ess-a-Bagel, or David's Bagels, or your local deli.  All I can say is, Brooklyn Bagel does it for me.  Had me at hello.  Completes the soon-to-be-not-so-hidden fat kid in me.   My poison:  Toasted, scooped-out, whole wheat everything bagel with tofu veggie cream cheese.YEAH BUDDY.   Try saying that five times fast.  That's my version of a high maintenance Starbucks drink.  Since I go to Starbucks and order a soy latte, or just plain black coffee, making it WAY too easy on the highly trained barista, this is where I get my customization fix.   And why tofu spread when I am not lactose intolerant?  It's just as thick and creamy  as cream cheese, without being sickeningly thick and filling, and actually tastes nothing like tofu.  Believe.  I didn't even know they would do such a thing like scoop out the inside of their gigantic bagels for you until my roommate texted me her order once -- toasted, scooped out spelt bagel with pumpkin cream cheese.   Also an excellent choice.  Their pumpkin cream cheese tastes like the filling of pumpkin pie.  Or more accurate, fluffy pumpkin cheesecake.  Pumpkin fluff.  The stuff of post-Thanksgiving dinner dreams.  But for breakfast.  Some people scoop out to lower their carb & calorie count.  I do it to increase the  cream cheese to bagel ratio.  Any place that takes a simple food item like a bagel, and inspires me to write bad prose, is worthy of 5 stars.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/28/2012,12/31/2012,76,131,7,11,10>Drool-worthy brunch...  I have yet to enjoy The Strand in the evening for its smoked meats, whiskey from wooden bourbon barrels, and honkey-tonk stage, but brunch certainly proves this joint as a legitimate Hill Country-style smokehouse.The biscuits and gravy over a bed of grits were the most delicious I've had in years... maybe ever.   The duck leg confit was exquisite, over braised greens, smoked tomatoes and a potato hash, crowned with a gorgeous easy egg.Our brunch cocktails warmed us like liquid flannel--the hot spiced cider with caramel whiskey and star anise, and a bloody steve (Beam black with bloody mix, smoked broccoli, and sea salt).Only open one week, service was excellent... the food exceptional.Can't wait to build a long-term relationship with this place!
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/13/2012,12/30/2012,343,884,6,12,7>I suppose that I should preface this review by saying that I fully intend on returning to Danny Brown Wine Bar & Kitchen for a full meal, especially because it is Queens' only Michelin-rated restaurant.On a Friday night, when I don't feel like trekking into the city for a libation, Danny Brown will now become my go-to wine bar.  The prices are actually really reasonable, with many of their wines by the glass under the $10 price point.  I ordered a cheese plate with a selection of three cheeses ($18), which came with bread and a fig compote.  I also ordered two sides, mixed olives ($1) and almonds ($1).  This was the perfect small meal to share with another person.The service was simply spectacular.  Our bartender was wonderful, calm, and friendly.  He spoke to us about which cheeses we liked best and why.  When he noticed that we were running low on bread, he immediately brought us a new basket, with no extra charge and without having to ask.  This seems like a minor detail, but these small things are what separate mediocre restaurants/bars from the rest.DBWB is small and cozy, with just enough tables and bar seating to make this space feel intimate and not crowded.  With dim lighting and low music, DBWB is the perfect date spot regardless of whether it's a first date or your 30th anniversary.
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/5/2012,12/29/2012,83,197,4,9,6>Ah, going through an Italian meal without the usual spaghetti and meatballs feels satisfying. I feel more immerse with the cuisine and avoid the stereotypical aspects that could lead to food boredom. Tuscan Hills is the place to eat to get a taste of a different side of a home-cooked Italian meal. We ordered: Calamari Fritti ($10.50)These fried squid rings aren't your usual tiny refrigerated rings. They give a generous amount of decent sized calamari. Also it went great with the marinara dipping sauce. (7/10)yelp.com/biz_photos/tuscFettuccine Mare e Monti ($18.50)Homemade fettuccine with shrimp and mushrooms. A little under seasoned so it made it taste average. And the pasta was a tad tough. (7/10)yelp.com/biz_photos/tuscPappaedelle Sienesi ($17.50)Ribbon pasta sprinkled with little pieces of Italian bacon. I was kind of disappointed that it didn't have that much bacon on it but the pasta as a whole had enough flavor. (7.5/10)yelp.com/biz_photos/tuscCacciucco all Gri ($25.50)This is the restaurant's centerpiece dish. Tuscan Hill's famous seafood pie is a must try. As soon as the cover of the pie is lifted, the aromas of the clams, mussels, shrimp, squid, and fish hit your nose and brings a smile to your face. The taste just enhances that feeling. The broth absorbed the flavors of the seafood and they made it a little spicy to counter the fishiness. This was satisfying to eat and the leftover soup made a great dip. A bit pricey but it's worth a try. (8.5/10)yelp.com/biz_photos/tuscGood service and I love their kitchen being in the open so we can see the food being cooked. Each dish tasted homemade and unique which seperates this restaurant from other Italian places. I still can't get the Cacciucco out of my head.

<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2012,12/27/2012,37,39,6,7,6>For a special meal with my wife and a good friend, we decided to return to our new favorite Queens neighborhood, Long Island City.  We chose Alobar, for the location and the yelp reviews.From the very beginning, the visit/meal was perfect. We arrived a few minutes before they were holding a bourbon tasting. We immediately regretted that we hadn't known in advance - we would have brought other friends as well.  But that wasn't the only reason the visit was good - the maitre'd made certain we were seated far away from what was going to become the large party, so we could enjoy ourselves without all the additional noise.We decided to dive through the starter menu, punctuated by the Mac & Cheese  "Carbonara" (four cheese blend, pancetta, with a poached egg - rich and and creamy). For acidity, we had the Citrus Roasted Beet Salad, which made my beet-loving companions very happy. While it's not a favorite of mine, the salted pistachios and goat cheese with the arugala went really well with the...Roasted Bone Marrow. Yeah, not those little pipes of marrow, but a huge cow femur split lengthwise, with toast.  We thought it could have used a bit more salt, but hey - season to taste worked. (I was a little frustrated by the tomato jam, which could have been minced a bit more.)  It was heavenly.We also ordered the ginger glazed baby back ribs, which were wonderfully, fall-off-the-bone meat, and not nearly too fatty.Our server, Katherine, was awesome. I appreciated that when we ordered, she asked whether we wanted everything together, or brought when it was ready. She was also friendly, funny, but never imposed herself into our conversation. We felt totally taken care of, and never rushed.How well taken care of? When we ordered dessert (goat cheese cheesecake with plum compote and the adult fluffernutters with melted belgian chocolate), our waitress added the bread pudding with salted caramel. On the house. It was the best bread pudding I'd ever had - light, flavorful, and beautifully toasted on the edges.And finally, the bill was well within our expectations. Not outrageously pricey, and for the quality of the food, it was amazing. Alobar is definitely on our list for special dinners, celebrations, and on a whim.
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/26/2012,12/26/2012,307,372,9,9,10>I stopped in here because I was kind of hungry that day and heard about their lunch buffet for $9.99.   Its probably a first in Flushing to have a lunch buffet at a Dim Sum restaurant.   The lunch buffet has Dim Sum, seafood (crabs, lobster claws), soups, congees, veggies, desserts, sushi, cooked to order items (e.g. cow stomach), peking pork chops, fish balls, steamed buns, etc.Dim Sum - they usually have an option to have Dim Sum or the buffet.   The Dim Sum carts usually make their rounds and drop off some of the dishes at the buffet.Seafood - they had crabs on the day that I went.  The lobster claws are water logged, but there is something to eat and decent for the $9.99 price.    I got the impression the crabs were dead but its not like the other seafood buffets in the less than $30 range.  This place isn't a sushi seafood buffet but more of a Chinese Seafood buffet with Dim Sum.  They are kind of different animals.  If you are expecting a Minado or Mizumi you will be disappointed .  Expect a Chinese buffet with some things a little higher quality and catered to Chinese people.Seniors - be careful with them.  They will elbow and push you for the the items they think  have value.  With some growing up in a time a famine I try to be understanding.   At first I had trouble balancing my respect for elders and the last steamer of shrimp dumplings. Sorry, I didn't even get one today and you and your friends had a couple already.Environment - The place is comfortable and service was good.   The customers are mostly Chinese seniors, but this is common on a weekday.It isn't bad for $9.99 but don't expect this to be the Cadillac of buffets. They will automatically add a 15% tip on the bill.   Do what the locals do and be there a little before the lunch buffet opens at 11:30am.  3.5 stars.They also offer a buffet for dinner but its in the $20-$30 range.  The restaurant also offers Hot Pot in the $30 range.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/28/2012,12/25/2012,29,97,5,8,7>Chinese people open tons of supermarkets but they never bother to spruce them up and have them nicely decorated like the way that the Japanese or Koreans do. However, I'm noticing that the newer Chinese supermarkets are slowly becoming more aesthetically pleasing. (Great Wall Supermarket on Northern Blvd. next to city hall for one, as well as Sky Foods at Sky View)This particular supermarket adheres to mostly American standards. The aisles are wide and the supermarket itself is huge! The selection is fairly complete with American and Chinese groceries. (They even have a lot of Korean items to boot) They also have a pretty good selection of Asian cosmetic products on sale too (With testers!) making this place the perfect place for one stop shopping. One thing that's most impressive is that the supermarket feels superbly clean. I don't know if this will last since they are fairly new, but for the meantime... it feels so clean and nice.All in all a great supermarket... I can't really think up of any negatives aside from the fact that their logo and signage somewhat doesn't match the good aesthetics of the supermarket itself.

<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2013,10/13/2013,262,613,12,13,9>Motivated by a desire to undo the damage of the previous night's oil slick of a slice, on Sunday I sought pizza redemption. That foul wedge of misery was threatening my entire well being and I desperately need the dough of happiness to rise again.Enter Grimaldi's, scion of the Brooklyn legend, with branches spreading like trees across this green earth. Douglaston, Queens managed to secure a location despite there being a rather grim Aldi's in the Rego Park Center. (It's not that bad-- the Aldi's,that is, not my pun).Douglas-what ? Douglas-where? Fortunately, my GPS tells me how to get there. (By foolishly suggesting the Grand Central to the CIP to the LIE. Blasted highway preference setting!)But once there, where do you go? This is pizza for the Morlocks as you'll need to enter the subterranean world of parking for the Macy's, Fairway and other shops that compose the Mall. You aren't fully submerged as daylight and rain will remind you of what the surface of the earth is like. And once inside Grimaldi's you'll be focused on the pie, not the lack of sky.If you don't like Brooklyn lines, tourists or Manhattan newbies, this is your Grimaldi's. Remove the name and you'd think this was a local hangout, not the latest installation of the pizza empire.Like a Jim Camp corporate strategy book, Grimaldi's starts with no: no credit cards, no slices, no reservations (I miss that show) and no delivery.To which I'll add: No Problem and No Wait!The menu sat upon the red and white checkered tablecloth but there really wasn't any debate as to why we were there; not for a salad (though available) but for a pizza, a large pizza that the menu claims is ideal for 3-4 people. (Try 2, with one being extremely hungry and filled with pseudo-religious fervor to undo the wrongs of the previous night, a one man crusade to take back his remembrance of pizzas past!)We ordered a large pie with mushrooms and meatballs. Our sodas arrived in bottles, perfect for taking out of the restaurant afterward. And then I saw it, the circular platter of destiny, placed in front of my dilated pupils, my heart racing and sweat forming on my forehead. The flower duet from Leo Delibes opera "Lakme" (Otherwise known as that song from a British Airways commercial) is what I set this epiphany to, a calm dignity as I survey the never ending fields of dough, sauce and toppings, a flat earth that Columbus would eat up with gusto.Lift. Bite. Bliss. Redemption. The firm crust, the gentle toppings, the feeling of satisfaction while staring at the empty platter, all of these elements contributed to the restoration of my faith in pizza producing humanity. The mushrooms and meatballs swirled together into a yin-yang duality, the four corners of the pie a mandala of mozzarella and it was good. Sauce, the red and primal, sweet and tempting, the sea from which life and flavor emerge, the mother of this Pizza Child who gives His life so we may rest in piece. (And have another)My faith restored, my journey to the underworld of the Douglaston Mall complete,  I ascended back to the world of the mortals, having rescued my love of pizza from the death grip of grease. Fortunate are those who may experience Grimaldi's pure of heart and appetite, unspoiled by the savage slice peddlers of Sixth Avenue. For the Fallen, this is where you must go to remember what pizza can be, will be and always will be, a circle of nature's bounty on a checkered tablecloth with a picture on the wall of Bill Cosby smiling.

Yes, it's in the middle of no where, at least it's in a strip mall with a ton of parking. I have been here countless times since it's a 10 min drive from my house. The bakery makes some really great products and since it's Queens, it's cheaper than the city, even though the prices are going up. Their individual as well as whole cakes are fantastic.The bakery is co-owned by two former Waldorf Astoria employees. Chef Jean-Claude Perennou, from Brittany, was the executive pastry chef at the Waldorf Astoria and Chef Gnanasampanthan Sabaratnam, from Sir Lanka, was a sous chef.The food:Croissant- excellent, excellent, excellent. Buttery and flaky on the inside, crispy on outside. Heated is preferred.Tiramisu- one of the best tiramisus I've had, it comes in this little plastic see through cup. It's more about the cream and chocolate shavings than anything else. The layer of cake is just a simple sponge cake, the coffee flavor is not too pronounced and there is no strong liquor taste which I hate in my tiramisu.Espresso 31- Great cake, but I think the taste of the whole cake has better flavor than the individual. It's a chocolate sponge cake with milk chocolate mouse with some chocolate crunchies and a brownie bottom. Sorry for not being technical. yelp.com/user_local_photyelp.com/user_local_photSt Honore- I would call this a cream puff cake, It's mini cream puffs on top of what is essentially a large cream puff. It's puff pastry with vanilla cream with a harden layer of caramel with a mini cream puff on top. GENIUS!!! yelp.com/user_local_photyelp.com/user_local_photStrawberry Cake- strawberries are incredibly fresh with vanilla sponge cake and a British Butter cream. I usually order the whole cake versus the individual. yelp.com/user_local_phot yelp.com/user_local_photCreole- this used to be my favorite dessert until I found the other stuff. It's one of the prettier cakes though. It's a chocolate sponge cake, white & dark chocolate mousse, coffee Syrup, and thin layer's of ChocolateNapoleon- it's an OK Napoleon, nothing great really.Praline Crunch- they only sell this as an individual dessert. It's essentially a chocolate mousse cake with shards of pralines. Great contrast in textures, excellent flavor. yelp.com/user_local_photLemon Squares- this used to be my favorite thing, it kinda resembles key lime pie. I do, however, hate that candied rind thing on the corner that looks like shrimp poop.Bread Pudding- it's leftover croissant bread pudding. Very rich but heart attack good.Chocolate Mouse Cake- it's a chocolate sponge cake, vanilla syrup, with dark & milk chocolate mousse. This is a good dish if you are one of those people who don't like texture.Apple Strips- this was my dad's favorite thing, I guess old people love it. It was OK for mePecan Pie- got this for Thanksgiving, very standard pie, it was a tad sweet but the crust was very good.Chocolate Chip Cookie with walnut- it's a great chewy center and crunchy on the outside type of cookie and for a buck and change, Oh mommy

We stopped by just to check it out with no intention of singing, and one guy showed us all of their amenities and specials. We went back about a month later and the same guy remembered us. I don't read or sing in Chinese but they have enough updated English songs with their real music videos (instead of the weird 90s women posing at the beach that other places show) to make me want to go back. The bigger rooms include private bathrooms, but even the smaller rooms are big and comfortable! They have a touch screen for song choosing that shows previews of videos before you even select it, which is convenient. They serve Kung Fu Tea and some pretty random food, like brie cheese & apples. It was $19/hr on a Thursday afternoon and as with other Chinese karaoke places, you can get as much food as the amount you paid for, for the karaoke.

Did I mention their TACOS ARE AMAZING?!
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2013,10/9/2013,102,568,11,12,12>WOW, my first Peruvian meal!!!Like other fellow Yelpers, I've heard all about Pio Pio's famous chicken but never had a chance to try it and prove it for myself.  Then Pio Pio's name came into mind one day when I was thinking of a place to celebrate my birthday.  My sister was like, "let's go!" because she's also heard good reviews of their chicken.  So on a Friday night, my Sister, Brother-in-law, fiancé, and I arrived at 7:00pm sharp for our reservation.  Good thing for reservations!  The place was filled with hungry customers who did not reserve and the waiting line was out the door half an hour after we were seated.  To my surprise, this Pio Pio is huge!  Big restaurant!  Lots of tables.  Definitely good for large groups and special occasions like birthday celebrations.  Nicely decorated with large canvas paintings around the restaurant.  Hip music in the background.   Customers seem to be mostly families with children.  The dishes are meant for family style because the portions are quite BIG.  (Just be prepared to get stuffed lol)Chicken:Fresh!Moist and tender dark meat but.. somewhat dry white meat.Well-seasoned though.The green sauce is amazing.  It goes perfectly with the chicken.  A perfect pair!  Reminds me somewhat of a pesto sauce.  Spicy.  Tip:  Use moderately.    ***I loved the Pio Pio birthday experience!   Well, you may disagree, so you must try it for yourself.Note1:  The staff clap their hands when they bring out the birthday cake!NOTE2:  Make reservations ahead of time.  There is a long wait for tables without reservations.  Order a Peruvian beer or sangria while waiting.  They have a full bar!
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/18/2013,10/8/2013,147,108,4,8,6>Here's what we ordered: -Meat samosas: comes with two pieces. Definitely deep fried. Packed full of flavorful meat and green peas. 4/5-Cucumber/tomato yogurt sauce: My fav sauce, goes soooo good with everything! I'm not a 100% but I think it was called "raida." 5/5-Chicken tikki masala: Our favorite of the night. Happy we tried this based on recommendations from other reviews. This is a must try here. 5/5-Lamb with mushrooms: I found this to be a bit lacking in flavor compared to the tikki masala. Soft chunks of lamb with mushrooms. The sauce could be spicier. 3/5As far as the spicyness issue as other yelpers have noted, we ordered our dishes "regular" spicy as per our waiter. Apparently this means "no spice" because we didn't taste any spicy ness at all! Next time we will definitely get "spicy" or maybe even "extra spicy?"Service was a bit rocky for my taste. We were seated and had to wait about 3 min to get menus (wtf?) while our waitor was getting our water ready and doing other things...Hello! If you sit me down, give me a menu! I don't want to waste time staring at you while you walk around aimlessly. Our waters were filled very promptly. We asked for our check and this also took a while for it to come to us (around ten min). This again was confusing for me. On the bright side, the waiters did make feeble attempts to make conversation which was appreciated. Overall, I would def come back here for the lunch special...mm. Can't wait!
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2013,10/7/2013,1196,94,15,10,7>My night at Riverview couldn't have been more beautiful. The wonderful view complimented the beauty of my girlfriend, her eyes just took me away on a stroll of a river glowing from the moonlight with the city standing tall in the background.Here's a little background before I start my review. I've been with the love of my life since 2011, she's the yin to my yang. Ever since then, we have never been on a real dinner date. She's a really busy girl, so once she told me she had time on a Saturday night my heart pounced at the suggestion.Step 1: I Yelped all the romantic restaurants from Queens to Brooklyn, bookmarked the really nice ones.Step 2: I pretty much drove restaurant to restaurant, checking if it was worth taking her there and finding out where had available reservations.Step 3: Settling down with my favorite one and making that reservation.Step 4: Go shopping for some new clothes to wear that night, so I could show her I'm willing to do anything to step up and impress her.Step 5: Make the rest of the night ours, cause my girlfriend is definitely worth it.Getting my reservation here was no problem, even though this place was booked for a wedding in the main dining room. The manager saw me wandering and snapped her staff to attention, she told them to make sure to help me to the best of their abilities. This really made me feel good about the place because I came in with sweatpants and a t-shirt, I'm glad they weren't bias and try to push me away because of how I looked. The staff answered all my questions, I even asked for candles to be on the tables and was told not to worry because they will be there. They even went a step further to inform me which areas had a lot of smokers on a regular Saturday night, enough though I didn't ask. That helped a lot, because the GF and I don't smoke. I got the perfect table I wanted, with a perfect view of the pier and water.There's not a lot of traffic passing by, it's a quite place away from the hustle-bustle of the city. This restaurant is by a main street in an area that is under heavy development, so it should be expected that there isn't much street parking. I see no reason to complain about that, instead I choose to find the next closest place to park which was a parking lot about half of a block away. The sign there said $10 per hour so that's not too bad, considering the location, plus I'm willing to pay anything to spend more time with my girlfriend. She's definitely my good luck charm because when we came back later, the parking attendant told us that it's actually $10 in general not per hour.Our dinner, overall, was on point. In less than a minute after being seated, the bread and butter were placed on the table, then the wine menu following that. For appetizers, we ordered the scallops. As her main course, my GF ordered a prime steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli. I ordered something that just popped out the page, the lobster ravioli. I'm the type of guy who always tries to avoid the same thing he always gets, which is pasta, but I love it so much I nearly almost always end up getting it. For dessert we got the tiramisu, which the GF knows I've been dying to try.The scallops were delicious and juicy, the cauliflower puree and tangerine sauce gave it that perfect zing. My future wife is definitely the best, she gave me the bigger half of her last scallop.We are alike in the fact that we both like our steaks well done. When it got to the table it was well done but not to the way she likes it, so we sent it back and it didn't take long for it to be returned. Now, that is what you call a prime steak, it was really well done and still had much flavor.My lobster ravioli was a great choice, it was just delicious. That lobster sauce was too perfect, not too thick or too thin. I fed one to the girlfriend and she loved it. I definitely recommend that to anyone who comes here. The tiramisu was pretty good, but I would have preferred a larger piece.Overall, this is a nice restaurant to take that special someone out for dinner. It's nothing too fancy but it is very romantic and gives a good vibe. There's a pier across the street and is very clean, it is very intimate and a perfect setting to hold her closer. Taking my girlfriend here was really worth it, everything about her is beautiful, she looked so pretty and her eyes sparkled in the moonlight. I will always bookmark this place in our memories as our first dinner date.
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2013,10/6/2013,254,454,8,12,9>Wow would be an understatement for this place.I chose this place over Sushi Time because of the sheer number of reviews that were written. Over 260 reviews for a sushi place in Forest Hills? This place has gotta be special... and special it was, indeed. I thought I had eaten fresh sushi in the past, but never as fresh as Sushi Yasu. The sushi was served room temperature - a good indicator that the sushi is fresh, and it melted as soon as I put it in my mouth. I ended up ordering the Chirashi and wondered why it was so ridiculously expensive, but the price was definitely justified by the freshness and quality of the sushi.Need more validation? The rice for the chirashi wasn't just ordinary white rice, but they mixed it with seaweed and cooked fish to add to the taste. Moreover, I HATE salmon and squid sashimi. I think it's disgusting. But after having salmon and squid at Sushi Yasu, I realized that I've been eating crappy salmon and squid this entire time. I've never had squid melt in my mouth before like that. Warning: the prices are steep. If you want cheap sushi, go anywhere else. If you want extremely good sushi, go to Sushi Yasu.
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/13/2013,10/5/2013,364,373,5,10,8>I love to write about solid neighborhood restaurants. They are the backbone of the community. Great price. Good food. Very convenient. Pollos A La Brasa Mario fits this model in Astoria. Serving delicious rotisserie chicken.I have been to Pollos A La Brasa Mario a few times for eating in as well as take out. I have always had the same meal, their 1/4 chicken combo with rice, salad, french fries and consomme. Their rotisserie chicken is hands down delicious. Moist. Well season. Very flavorful. I have other chicken places that I love, but Pollos A La Brasa Mario does a consistent job with their cooking procedure for their chicken. Rice, salad and french fries are very standard sides. Standard white rice. Standard frozen fries. Standard romaine with shredded carrots. Actually very boring. Consomme, this is a HOME RUN. Outstanding to very outstanding. This was one delicious soup. Now, Mario's consomme is not your traditional clear broth consomme. This was one hardy soup. Packed with potatoes, hearts, chicken gizzards, white meat in a richly flavored broth. It was as good a soup as I ever had. Top 3 ever. Delicious.Overall, Pollos A La Brasa Mario is a go to place for some good chicken. It is very affordable meal for a 1/4 chicken combo: $6.95 for lunch and $9.50 for dinner. Chicken is always flavorful and moist. Yum.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2013,8/14/2013,211,584,8,15,10>Breaking news: Norma's is now my favorite cafe in my new hood.By a long shot.Here's the why:+Standard cafe selections, with a few "specials"Their menu isn't bombarded with a ton of sugary crap. Simple is oftentimes better.+The baked goods selection is awesome.Biscuits, cookies, mini bundt cakes, cupcakes, turnovers, brownies and a small lunch menu (today lunch menu consisted of a delicious looking salad, hummus plate and 3 different paninis).And they bake everything there! You can see them doing prep in the back...Unlike Chocolatte where everything is made in a toaster oven or in some  yet to be determined location.I tried the Jalapeno Cheese biscuit and it was delicious! Also got the raspberry lemonade (one of their drink specials), which was on the sweet side, but still yummy.+The staff seems awesome. No creepy lurkers. Everyone that walked in seemed like a regular, or was treated like one at least. I think I'm going to become a creepy lurker, because I want these people to be my friends...please!+The music is just the right volume. So many coffee shops BLAST their music. You can't read, talk or even think. Not at Normas. And to boot, their music tastes are awesome. They were playing some great disco hits while I was there.+The WiFi is EASY to get onto. The password is a normal password that is in view.+No air of pretentiousness here. Lots of chairs. I wouldn't come with more than 3 or 4 people though. Although not crowded, it's definitely a cozy shop.So many coffee shops are on this kick of being overpriced and overzealous. While I am often a patron of such places...I will be a regular at Norma's.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2013,8/13/2013,289,416,9,12,10>It is guaranteed to be the one of the rare fragrant places in Flushing.  As you walk in, the scent of roses wafting in the air greet you, setting the stage for a relaxing time in a well-appointed space. We were lead to one of  the red banquettes and presented with the menus.  I opted for the rose peach iced tea while my friend had the hot peach tea with cream.  We shared the Prince  William afternoon tea which consisted of mini-sandwiches at the bottom, scones in the middle and dessert items on top of the three (3) tiers. For one brief moment, I forgot that I was right in the middle of Flushing, one of the most crowded places in New York.  Service was efficient and gracious too and when the next table broke a glass, they were very nice about it.  I liked that. :) One drawback to Rose House is that there are no restrooms inside and one has to go to the mall to use the restrooms.  I consumed a whole pot of tea and when I went to the mall restroom, it was closed and I had to trek two (2) floors down and wait in line to use the restroom.  I almost felt bad but then I saw a bride who was also lining up to use the restroom which was so bizarre. My thought was that places that serve diuretics like Starbucks and Rose House have no business selling them unless restrooms are readily available to its customer right at their premises.  Then again, the smell of roses and the soothing tea after I came back made me forget all of the annoying restroom business.  Rose Tea House is a breath of fresh air, literally and figuratively.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/3/2013,8/12/2013,130,274,10,8,9>If you don't walk into a Mexican restaurant and there ain't a dude playing songs non-stop on a jukebox, you ain't at the right spot. Immediately you are given chips and salsa a given that is not a given everywhere. The chips have a hard texture which I kind of prefer and the salsa is really good. Worthy of where I wouldn't feel cheated if I was hit with a salsa surcharge. The salsa has just enough kick without being too spicy and just liquidy enough so it's not too chunky. One thing I will say those expecting to get your food at the same speed of a taco truck, you need to be like Frankie Goes to Hollywood and realxxxxxx. This is the real deal and everything tastes authentic, home style. One item that I really sticks with me was the chorizo torta. They use a hint of cinnamon on the chorizo and the presentation of the torta is just flawless.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2013,8/11/2013,200,343,6,7,10>Funny, I pass this sweet shop all the time, mainly weekends while driving down Metropolitan Ave after my Trader Joe's Grocery Shopping runs...er I mean my Home Depot Manly Do It Yourself Project Runs. I always thought this was some candy shop that nobody ever goes into.  Who would've guessed such a vintage ice cream shop existed.  They have antique cash registers, bar stools, signs, and decor.  They also make their own ice cream there.  I ordered a Coconut Milk Shake and enjoyed sipping on that while watching my team NY Mets beat the Washington Nationals on an old school Vintage Tube Television.  Harvey pitched another GEM Btw!!! Anyway, I'm so glad that I stopped by to check this place out. It's a nice little dessert spot and everyone is super nice.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2013,8/10/2013,98,53,9,10,12>Came to Gregory's with my family, after going to church for our Greek Palm Sunday. Every other place on 23rd ave had a really long wait and we heard that they have amazing food so we decided to give it a try. We got a lot of mezedakia (appetizers), lemon potatoes, fried zucchini and eggplant, giant beans,rice, Greek salad, ad feta and they were all delicious. I love the fact that you can either sit inside or outside and that for my mom and myself there was a ton of vegan options or ways to make dishes vegan. My sister ordered the bacalao fish and she said it was ok and my boyfriend ordered the special of the day which was wild boar and was a HUGE plate. Most definitely will be coming back it's one of the few Greek taverns in Astoria that when you sit at you don't feel like you're in Astoria but in Greece being that the servers are so friendly and the owners are as well.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2013,8/9/2013,86,461,5,8,7>If Yeh's Bakery plotted itself in Soho or other posh neighbors, the lines would be out the door (looking at you, cronuts), yet Yeh is like an introvert person who knows he/she is good enough to not delve into the mainstream, bustling competition.  And why not? Despite the gradual price raising (now a basic Boston pie is $19!), people are still lining up for a slice of the pie.  Unfortunately, I was in the area (hospital visit) and while I was there, I might as well stop by the bakery.  Even at 3 in the afternoon, there was a line of people patiently waiting to exchange a Jefferson for their signature pastry.  Their Boston pie is demure - from the naked eyes, it is just two basic sponge cake with a custard cream filling.  What's so special about that? Well, there are two folds - one is the fluffiness of the cake.  With a gentle downward motion of a fork, you could cut the cake with finesse.  Then the cake and cream would just melt in your mouth, like literally.  The second fold is the balanced sweetness, unlike the typical American cheesecake, pies, and cupcakes.  The kitchen in the back is like a magic oven cranking out pie after pie.  I cannot imagine what the workload is like around holidays, especially with such a small operation.  But let's shed light on the other offerings besides the pie, they also do other sweet Asian pastries (mostly Taiwan-style) and savory ones, like the chicken pie ($1.20) and curry puff ($1).  I got the curry puff and it was still warm from the heated lamp.  Good amount of filling, too.  The coffee and tea are just 'there' to quench your thirst after your sugary consumption.  While they sell sliced roll cake, they don't do that for the pie, which is unfortunate for people like me who do not want to buy an entire pie.  Instead, the closest cousin to the Boston pie is their 'special slice cake' at $1.50. It is a square vanilla cake covered with sliced almond.  As expected, it was moist, soft, and light.  It is a low-budget store, so do not expect fancy decor and five star customer service. But the girls get their job done well, so you could efficiently pay up and then off you go with your prize trophy.  Now I am inspired to experience baking a Boston pie...
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/17/2013,8/8/2013,243,374,10,14,16>The Thirsty Koala is a solid place to grab a meal. The food is good, the service seems very genuine (in NYC, how refreshing) friendly and attentive, plus the decor is simple and clean. We have tried the brunch/breakfast and the diner service (open until 12am on Fridays and Saturday), on both times we left happy and satisfied. The breakfast/brunch was not mind blowing, the omelet was a bit dry for me but overall it was great. For dinner, we tried the Chicken (yay for free range!) with grilled mango and avo salsa napoleon and the Boomerang fish tacos. For some reason I was expecting chicken with bones (dark/white meat) when M. order the dish, instead it was chicken breast. Nonetheless, it was tasty... it was like a toned down, uber natural, earthy-healthy version of sweet and sour chicken. The 2 fish tacos were surprisingly filling, as the waitress have suggested after I asked for her opinion. Which by the way, I appreciate that she didn't try to oversell me when I told her that I'm hungry but not starving. Another brownie point for the service at Thirsty Koala!Next time I visit, I'm planning to try their lamb lollies. Half of the restaurant that night ordered that. Seems like a quite popular choice.So eh.... what is not to like of this joint? p.s. It can get a bit loud on weekend late nights when the patrons are slightly intoxicated.
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/16/2013,8/7/2013,236,311,15,17,19>Can I have it super spicy? LooooooooooooolLooooooooooooolwe couldn't get the ahjumma to stop laughing during the time that our dinner lasted. Looks like she never had such a request from a white girl. Well, after I finished the soup, I honestly hesitate she had such request from many people on the planet ever. I guess that is how things taste over there in Korea. Cause that was really deliciously spicy. That was a burning sensation that went weaker over time. I am not sure if because of my body getting use to it, or if because the makkoli mixed with soju shots that may made my perception to drop off below average.  Whatever the case. Excellent soondubu. The super- red color was the first warming. But even when the spice was on the very high level, I could still taste other flavors in the broth. Deep flavors. Like when things are cook slow to allow the ingredients to integrate themselves. The star of the night however (in part because I have not find this dish in many places) is their ox tail soodubu. The broth is once again extremely flavorful, it taste like meat that has been boiled up to become on a liquid form. They use different cuts of meat and my favorite is their tendon. Excellent choice. The place is an open big space. Great service. And I heard is 24h. I am still dreaming about the tendon of that soup. Definitely coming back
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2013,8/6/2013,74,85,3,5,3>Trattoria L'incontro is an experience. The food and service are excellent. This is a go to place if you want to impress out of town company or a date. When you think of the classic old school Italian Restaurants from the 1940s and 50s, you think of a place like this. You just don't find this type of quality service or food elsewhere. The menu has a lot of variety, but before you make up your mind- wait for the waiter to list the specials of the day. It's insane how many specials they have. I feel like you need to bring a notebook to write everything down! Fortunately, the waiters are very patient and will repeat any of the categories of specials. They seriously have at least 10 appetizers, 10 soups, 10 meat dishes, 10 fish dishes, and then all sorts of pastas and other items not listed. The variety and detail of the specials is phenomenal. The food is amazing. Their ossobuco is the best I have ever had. It's fork tender and the marrow just takes it over the top. I've had it a few times there and always crave it. Their fish is always perfectly cooked and paired with delicate and flavorful sauces. The Mezze Luna is out of this world! Perfectly tender pasta stuffed with cheese, pesto, and asparagus. Really a stand out dish. Also the mozzarella is a must. Even their bread is memorable and fantastic. The waiters are also very attentive, but not obnoxious. They seem to know the second you finish your glass of wine, but do not hover. They also have wonderful recommendations and don't rush you to finish your meal. Also the chef always seems to take some time to talk to guests and making sure they enjoy their meal whenever I am there. Entrees can be a bit pricey, but you get giant portions and will not leave hungry. Definitely a must in Astoria.

Avg is my favorite vet hospital One thing I find very important is for  veterinarians and the staff to be compassionate and caring , if they are not they are in the wrong business and I will not give them my money ! I've been taking my zoo here for many years ,great doctors , great staff Also helps when you see that they have pretty much the same staff for like ten years  which means they take care of their employees .So now for some recommendations:Sorel ,  You are an angel! Sorel is the manager and a vet tech and groomer , he is great with the animals and he has really been there for me when my dog was near death and Ill never forget that , ever! Having two big pitbulls it's nice to see a tiny female vet  ,( my other favorite Dr. Smith )getting on the floor with them , hugging them and kissing them and just letting them slobber her face , now that my friends is an animal lover and I like to see this type of behavior ! Dr Smith is awesome with all my pets and they love her but lets not forget Dr. Kamer and Dr. Sakal , I can't stress how amazing these Drs really are !!! this is the only place I feel safe to bring my pets too They saved my dogs life twice and I will never ever forget that , also the love my dog received while she was hospitalized was heart warming , I love you guys and will continue to speak highly of this practice and recommend anyone I knowkeep up the great work!
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/20/2013,1/13/2014,628,678,18,19,21>It occurred to me in the middle of a sentence that ended in "I've never had alcohol in Flushing" that I... have never had alcohol in Flushing. Not once. If alcohol is involved, I'm 100% likelier to be in Manhattan or the Korean area further east. I have no idea where there are bars in downtown Flushing, no idea what they're like. To me, Flushing is a food neighborhood populated by communities who are really into eating - not the drinky drink. But one day, I left work, it had been a terrible week, I wanted to hang out, and the idea of sticking around and then having to drag myself all the way home to Queens* afterward was just... blaughhhhh.I was really pleased to learn that Zebra has a big ol' bar and shabu restaurant separate from the karaoke space. Something else I was pleased to learn: Happy hour = half price beers from open until 8pm! (Most drafts are $7-8 regularly.)The "Zebra Iced Tea" that my poor companion got was kind of crappy: a random mix of liquors plus pineapple juice and maybe some other sweetener. However, it somehow got him pretty tipsy, even though he had had two more meals that day than I had at that point. I had to help with his twee drink after I'd finished my beer and was feeling totally normal while he giggled his way to the bottom of the glass. Tsk tsk, Asian men. The salt and pepper chicken was good, and we got a whole bowl of edamame which I polished off because green things are good for you.  Yeahhhhh I like this place. Manhattan will still be more convenient; and the modern, loungey ambiance is not exactly my scene. But Zebra is still really nice, dim, and calming, and a great choice for an aperitif before ravaging the food mecca that is Flushing.*My whining aside, Queens is still the best borough.

It's COLOMBIA not Columbia.  Therefore it's Colombian food, not columbian food.  Puh-leeze!  ¿Q'hubo pues?!  Aaaanywho... Great Colombian food.  Very large portions.  Two floors of seating.  Packed all the time (even early birds) but the wait is not long as service & turn-around is fairly quick.  Came in with my small extended family of 16! (Because if you haven't seen an episode of "Modern Family", that's just how we do). The large group of us that arrived first were seated in less than 10 min, while the rest of my family was seated within 5 min of their arrival at tables immediately next to ours.The food was delish.  PLENTY of choices on their menu (more than most other Colombian restaurants).  My only gripe was that the food came out before our drinks did.  But that, I believe, is more of a reflection of the waiter.  On top of that, my kids & I had ordered a tap water with our meals but we were never served it.  He told me once it was on its way but... nada.  Your typical green (ají) hot sauce can be found readily kickin' arse & taking names.  I haven't tried the breakfast here (yet), but I hear that is mouth-watering good too.

You go full on raging carnivore, stuff yourself silly, have a great meal and then eat nothing but vegetables for the next few days. True story. This coming from a borderline pescatarian too. What do you order??? What DON'T you order!!! Our group of 10 decided to family style (YAY!)....Israeli Salad: Yes, I know I'm talking about going full carnivore but hey, I needed my veggies too. Typical Israeli salad consists of chopped cucumbers, tomatoes, onion. parsley, olive oil and lemon juice. What made this Israeli salad better? It came with half an avocado, sliced, on top.  Baba Ganoush: Cheburechnaya has totally changed my palate for baba ganoush. I tried it a few times in the past and it has always tasted like ashtray. I'm not kidding. However, this baba ganoush tasted more like a delicious garlicky tahini. The warm bread we ordered with it made it all the more MMmMMMmMMmmmSamcy with ribs: everyone saw a photo of this amazing looking pastry wrapped, minced lamb meat filled "rib" (it was just a bone the meat filled pastry  was wrapped around, for show) and decided we each had to get our own. The whole table seemed to like it but I'm not going to lie, I took two small bites and then handed it off to the boyfriend. Maybe it was just mine but the minced lamb was chewy and overall it was too doughy and fatty for me. He happily took it off my hands. Lamb Ribs (low fat) Shish Kebabs: I don't know how you make something low fat, grill it and still manage to keep it moist and tasty but two thumbs up for doing just that! Chicken Wings Shish Kebabs: Wings on skewers! Nice crispy skin and really juicy meat.  Beef Skirt Steak Shish Kebabs: really really tender and seasoned well. By the end of the meal I was ready to hibernate. Rest assured I will return. With an even bigger appetite...maybe for some fried beef brains?!PS - Cheburechnaya's lists the calorie count of every item on the menu. I'll leave it up to your tummy to decide if that's a good thing or not...
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/26/2013,1/10/2014,88,110,8,9,8>I've been here for a few birthdays.  Very good Greek restaurant in the heart of Flushing!!  I love this place!  I've been inside, in the lower level private room....very nice!  I've been outside, in the front patio....pretty cool also. We usually order a few appetizers, sharable for our party.  the mixed appetizers with a few variations is very good.  You will all fight for their ribs!! Sangria is excellent. I've had the pita appetizer which comes w a few different sauces. Very good if your just learning abt the Greek World. For entree I always get the salmon w risotto. Risotto is my absolute favorite. Highly recommend this place. They still have a $5 brunch special on weekends- $5 drinks & $5 entrees!! Hello!! Jump on it! You won't regret it!!
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/10/2013,1/9/2014,241,315,17,18,15>Oh God. I can't take it. I can't take it when I go into a restaurant and everyone is speaking Northern bro-mandarin and drinking baijiu. One could immediately feel that the English literacy of the entire restaurant, customers included, was absolute zero. It made me want to fob up and revoke my citizenship. The restaurant has the tagline "Northern homey eats" in Chinese but is complemented with a boring "Chinese food" in English, as if its meant to deter all foreigners. Hearing my friend and I speaking English to one another, the host shyly told us to "sit, sit inside" then promptly gave up on trying to speak English and straight up assumed we understood Mandarin. We did. And I saw relief on everyone's faces.The menu has English! Pretty accurate English! Each item is numbered like a takeout menu so even if the waiter speaks zero English, you're still guaranteed a great meal. Now for our crime.1) Lamb with cumin sauce - I hate lamb and I hate spicy food. This dish was lamb and spicy... but I loved it. Its 12 bucks for a huge plate of lamb meat and 4 toasted bread-pouches to put the meat in. Holy. Hell. The lamb was as tender as my ass after failing a math test (Americans will not get this joke) and the taste was absolute heaven. It was not as gamey because of the spice and flavor thats been infused but it still had the distinct smell of lamb-awesome. Highly recommended.2) Mei cai kou rou / pork belly - Served with bokchoi and mantou. Yes you heard me. 8 pieces of mantou surrounding the pork belly invited me to eat it like a sandwich ala Momofuku. Eat it straight or eat it sandwiched. It only proved one thing to me: when you need pork, you still gotta go to a Chinese restaurant. Oh yeah the generous serving of bok choi means you no longer need to order a vegetable dish. More meat = better life.3) Chinese cabbage pork dumplings - I was disappointed they did not have leek dumplings. Then I became happy once the cabbage dumplings entered my mouth. It was falling apart a bit, but probably because I kept dipping it into vinegar like a fobby madman.The service was friendly and they really treat you like family. So regardless of their English level, I think anyone would feel welcome here.I have some Northern Chinese fetish. The whole Chinese-bro thing turns me on and when it is enriched by delicious food, the whole experience just makes me cock my head back in ecstacy and write like a woman (yes you were thinking that). Three plates costed 33 dollars in total. Could have easily fed four people. Oh yeah if you didn't notice, all the meat dishes came with plenty carbs so don't be Southerner tools and order rice. Northerners love their bread. And I love them.
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/20/2013,1/8/2014,118,243,7,13,9>If you know me (at all),  I LOVE pork belly, especially kakuni. What is kakuni? Kakuni is chunks of pork belly simmered in soy sauce, mirin, sake, ginger, and other ingredients for hours. I never thought of putting kakuni into a sandwich so I give 5 stars just for this dreamy sandwich. Joju expanded the boundaries of all bahn mis by putting traditional dishes from other Asian countries besides from Vietnam. My friend was raving about the bahn mi fries so I decided to make a pit stop for a quick lunch. The fries are just okay but the "works" made up for it. Think of nachos but with fries and special sauce (brown sweet sauce?), green sauce, spicy mayo, daikon and carrot pickles, and diced jalapenos. Pretty spicy yet so addicting. Now, the bahn mis. I got the kakuni and my boyfriend got the lemongrass chicken with a runny egg (free with Yelp check in). WOW. The meat is flavorful, bread is toasty, and the pickles are tangy. Major(MAJOR) party on my taste buds. My sandwich wasn't spicy because I didn't know I had to ask for the jalapenos. Still tasted great, plus I already got my jalapeno fix from the fries. The only thing that was a let down was the frozen Vietnamese coffee mocha with whipped cream. Nothing special about it. Definitely will be back to try the grilled porkchops bahn mi, beef bulgogi bahn mi, and the kimchi fries. And if the classic and bbq pork bahn mis are good, this will be my go to spot for bahn mis from now on. Don't forget to check in for the free egg! Might as well spend a couple of more seconds if you're already on Yelp.Thank you Joju for the wonderful bahn mis!
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2013,1/7/2014,196,204,9,15,13>Came here on Saturday night with a large group.  At the entrance you will see many people waiting for a table, so be sure to make a reservation, because this place does get packed and stays packed throughout the night.  First thing off the bat is most of the patrons are Greek, so you can imagine the food is pretty legit.The service was decent and the food and prices were pretty decent too.  One thing I noticed is that their lamb dishes are tasty, but does not have a strong lamb taste.  It's probably good for people who are afraid of eating lamb for fear of overly gamey meat but this actually did not have enough lamb flavor for me.The octopus and the potato side were the highlights to me.  The octopus was honestly some of the best I have ever eaten.  It was seasoned perfectly, and not overcooked and chewy.  Definitely would recommend getting this.  Everything else was pretty good but nothing to rave about.  Portions are large and for the price and quality this is a home run.  An odd thing is we ordered the large dip platter, which did not come with pita bread.  We asked for enough for 8 people.  What came out were 2 large basket fulls of pita bread.  This was well enough for 16 actually.  I think it was 2 pitas per person cut up.  No complaints though cause they were hot, and delicious and for some reason the every piece you took was still warm even 40 minutes later, and it was in a regular wicker basket. Only problem with my experience was they forgot about the birthday cake, but I think that was miscommunication between who seemed like the owner(an older lady) and my waiter.  They provided us with some free dessert at the end and also comped the 5 coffees we ordered which was really nice of them.The coolest thing about the decor is in the back where there's a wooden frame ceiling with ropes hanging from it to the wall and the exposed brick walls.  Cool stuff.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/4/2013,1/6/2014,315,250,7,11,10>A little touch of spicy Sichuan heaven.  This little quaint place was the previous home of "Prince noodle house", but now has been transformed to a Sichuan restaurant.For starters try the Braised pork ears and beef lungs, it has got some kick, but it is oh so good!  We ordered the Chinese celery with goose intestines and watercress stir fried in garlic, amazing dishes, simple in presentation but loaded with flavor.Now I love soup and if you love soup like I love soup you must order the spicy pickled cabbage tofu fish soup! This soup is delicious!!! They bring it in a big clay pot and place it on top of a portable butane burner to keep it warm.  My least favorite dish of the night was the Chengdu spicy chicken with hot peppers.  It was beautiful to look at, but difficult to eat.  The dish was chopped up wings stir fried together, so it made eating this dish a challenge with all the bones.  I heard later you can order this dish with boneless chicken.  So next time I have to give it another go. The place is small and finding parking in the local area can be difficult, but if you want to experience some great Sichuan cuisine, its worth the effort!
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/26/2013,1/5/2014,223,77,6,11,8>I've been to the LIC Flea a few times since it opened. At first, I was slightly underwhelmed but I've become a huge fan after subsequent visits. The vendors are eclectic and give a diverse sampling of what Queens has to offer. The actual space seems to be small for the amount of vendors that are there. I don't foresee an opportunity to really grow as the LIC Flea becomes more popular unless it just completely moves to a different location. I was also hoping that they'd be closer to the water, as the general area around the Flea space is a bit grimy looking and full of construction.Clearly, the vendors are the stars of the show. My first purchase was a flask (from SITE, I think?), but every purchase I've made since then has been for food & drink. Here are some of my highlights:- Luke's Lobster: A lobster roll for a little under $15 (I got the full roll, but they also serve a half roll). A perfectly buttered roll, a PILE of delicious lobster meat (JUST the meat!), and an appropriate spread of their mayo. It was absolutely amazing. I don't think they're a Queens restaurant, though, which is slightly disappointing. - Oaxaca Tacos: Their potato poblano taco was great, and worth the $4 for the tiny little thing. A huge burst of flavor.- Butcher Bar: Kind of the superstar of the Flea, to be honest. AND they give out free samples of their brisket. YUM!I'll be interested to see how LIC Flea grows... I think it'll eventually become a big thing!
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2013,1/4/2014,41,92,1,6,3>Was trying to find another restaurant but passed by this one.  My group looked around and decided to try this place out.  It seems to be very popular among the younger crowd (I was there with my family and family friends).  We had a large party so we had to wait about 15 minutes.  The restaurant is quite big and fortunately we were seated in a more comfortable table in the back.  The tables in the front had stools and didn't look very comfortable (especially for someone like me that is short and often has trouble reaching the floor with some chairs).  This place opened up about a month ago and is apparently a chain restaurant created by a popular Korean comedian.We were seated in the back of the restaurant, the many side dishes were already laid out on the table before we were seated.  It was a bit confusing because I was used to having lots of little plates of appetizers, here they were very stingy with them.  We had two tiny plates of kimichi, and a bowl of another type of kimchi with maybe 4 or 5 pieces of cabbage in it.  There were also two small pieces of a pumpkin pancake.  Kind of lame.  This is a korean bbq restaurant, so of course you order meats!  They have two combos: a beef and a pork.  really surprised there are no chicken combos, or a combination of beef and pork together.  There are 2 sizes: a small and a large.  Beef being the more expensive one.  A large beef combo will set you back 90 buckaroos and according to the waitress, a large combo is good for 3 people.  They also have individual plates if you don't want to order the combos.  The prices start from 22 dollars and up.  Although the prices are steep, I thought the quality of the meats reflect the price.  All bbq combos come with all the fixings: the lettuces, the salad mix consists of green onions, bean sprouts, a little bit of onions and the bean paste.  The salad mix is supposed to be eaten with the bbq.  You also have a sweet soy sauce with slices of onions and wasabi on the side.  We ordered a large beef combo and a large pork combo.  The beef combo comes with marinated boneless short ribs, brisket, and your choice of either ribeye or prime boneless short ribs.  We chose the ribeye.  As for the pork combo, there is pork jowl, pork belly, and your choice of pork collar or thinly sliced pork belly.  We choice more pork belly!Whatever combo or meat dishes you order, it comes with steamed egg, corn with cheese, and your choice of kimchi stew or beef brisket soybean paste stew.  I think we got the beef brisket stew.  The meats come pretty quickly and the waitress cooks away.  The quality of the meats were absolutely excellent.  Especially the ribeye.  The watiress asked us how we liked it cook and we made sure she didn't overcook that awesome piece of ribeye.  Even though most of the meats were not really marinated, the natural juices was enough.  The marinated short ribs were excellent, the meat was soft and not chewy at all.  The sweet soy sauce and the salad mix always added some layers of flavor.  Of course, it's not like the AYCE kbbq places around the area, where you eat till your belly pops.  So a lot of people think it is not enough.  Two large combo actually fed our party of 5 adults and 3 teenagers.  The meal also comes with rice, great way to go with the meats.  The stew was yummy, with chucks of meat and lots of vegetables in it.  Spicy but not too spicy.It came out to about 185 bucks before tip.  So with tip, it was about 20+ per person.  Not too bad for a meat-centered meal.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/7/2013,5/3/2014,134,610,5,12,7>Welcome to the party pal!  Good food, solid beer selection, small cute well-aged place.I came to LIC right after Lounge 47 departed and never got a chance to check it out.  I remained disgraced and was prepared to commit seppuku months later, stopping just short of inserting the sword into my abdomen when I saw that a new place was coming to that same storefront.Every time we've been here, it's been crowded with either a wait or just getting the last table, which is great for a town that often has lots of open tables because the people who live in the tall buildings by the water don't go to the restaurants 3 blocks away.  The craft beer selection is pretty solid - I can always find 1 or 2 items on draft which are worth partaking, especially there 1 and done keg series with widely varying options available.The dining is pretty good as well.  Fries are solid, the lamb meatloaf was quite tasty, and the fish and chips did the job.  Brunch was nice as well - nice and fluffy omlette and quality french toast.While Woodbines has an outdoor space, they can't use it so it might as well not exist - neighbors bla bla bla.Net net, Woodbines is a quality addition to the LIC scenery for both food and the drinking.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2014,5/2/2014,223,77,10,17,10>Many of the churrascarias in Astoria/LIC are pay-per-pound. After searching on Yelp for a rodizio-style place I ended up on the basement floor of a Holiday (férias?) Inn and I could not be happier with the selection. *PROS*PRICE POINT - I frequent another churrascaria in midtown that is significantly more expensive. I often have to overeat at that place to the point of a stomach ache just so I can get my money's worth. With Rio Grande's price set at around $20 (plus gratuity + tax), I don't feel pressured to eat copious amounts of meat and can have a regular-sized meal.BUFFET - Given the price, I wasn't expecting much from the hot and cold buffet bar. Their options were surprisingly robust and all of the items had great flavor. Loved the yuca, white rice, & black beans. They were perfect accompaniments to the meat. My friend's favorite dish from the buffet was the pasta and I'm kind of reevaluating our friendship because of it. LOCATION - I live in Astoria and this place was easy to get to (right off the train). Also, there's the novelty/quirky factor to it being on the basement floor of a Holiday Inn. Also, if I tried hard enough, I could probably find where they hide the hotel soaps & shampoos and steal them. ATTENTIVE STAFF - Everyone was lovely! Large groups came in, as well. They were able to cater to all of us.*CONS*GRATUITY - No matter what size your party is, the gratuity is around 18-20% (I had a few caipirinhas so I couldn't really do accurate math on our bill). NOT ALL THE MEATS ARE A SLAM DUNK - I definitely had some dry pieces of meat and it seemed as if most of these pieces were on the medium well/well side (I like it more rare). As I left (and the place got busier), there were a lot more options coming out of the grill, so maybe I should've stuck around!I'll definitely be back!
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2013,5/1/2014,126,111,5,7,6>This is strictly a review for their smoothies and service.  I have yet to eat any meals here so far, but I definitely want to be back.I went there the other day with someone who really likes fruit and smoothies.  He handed me the menu, and I first resisted, then expressed some confusion."I don't usually like smoothies.""Just look at it.""I don't understand.  Are these smoothies or milkshakes?  They sound like milkshakes.  What makes these smoothies?"So maybe I have no idea what milkshakes or smoothies are.  I generally don't like things blended that don't have vodka in them.  I couldn't get over the "smoothie" that had chocolate ice cream, chocolate syrup, and peanut butter as its ingredients, so I ordered that.  I watched the manager prepare the first one - the strawberries and banana slices in the blender looked very fresh and vibrant, so I was already intrigued.  When he brought over the smoothie, he handed me a glass with 2 or so ounces of the pink stuff.  "This is for you to try.  You sounded very cynical about smoothies."I tasted it tentatively (very good), and sipped while he made mine.  I watched him shake his head in a huff, while the only person at the counter pointed to the plastic cup my smoothie was in and said something inaudible.  "I know, I never make a mistake."  He handed the smoothie to me and said, "This is on the house, I didn't make enough to fill it to the top."I really wouldn't have complained.  Also, yum. So I think what classifies my drink as a smoothie and not a milkshake is the blended ice?  Though all their smoothies' bases are ice cream, the smoothies themselves have just the right amount of sweetness, since the sugar is effectively "watered down" with the blended ice, so you don't feel too guilty for having dessert all the time.I've reached the end of this review because the word "smoothie" doesn't look like a word anymore.
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2014,4/30/2014,357,324,17,16,14>You've been doing it wrong. Here you were, confident that the way to go when you're in a taqueria is to order the tacos. Well, let me be the first to tell you that here, the torta is where it's at. This is no ordinary sandwich, boys and girls. This is the torta to end all tortas. I've eaten 3 of them in the past two days; mainly because I have no concept of self control, but also because this is one of the best sandwiches I've ever put in my face-hole.*As an added bonus, they're only $6-6.50, with the Cubana topping out at $7.25, which is where your cholesterol will be after you eat this if you shift the decimal a couple places to the right.*this is the only hole I can recommend putting this sandwich in. it comes with jalapenos, and those could cause some irritation.
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/20/2013,4/29/2014,61,112,6,10,7>How I never knew this place existed is completely beyond me. So, when my sister told me about it and claimed it to be "better than Cherry Valley" I knew I just had to try it. The first Saturday after my sister told me, my boyfriend and I needed somewhere to go for lunch so I hauled our tooshies right to this deli! I was totally in awe that it was so close to my house and I never knew about it. Looking at the menu you get overwhelmed because they have EVERYTHING you could possibly wish for a deli to have. The first thing I noticed were the prices. A bit pricey...but, a sandwich on regular bread or a roll is about $8 where as a hero--more than double the sandwich is, ready for it? Only $9! So we opted to share a sandwich for our first time. We shared the Clearview--chicken cutlet, fresh Mozzarella, basil and roasted red pepper all in balsamic vinaigrette. AND on semolina bread! YUM! The other sandwich I was drawn to like a moth to a light was the WOODS. That's right, the WOODS. What is in it you ask? Only the most amazing combination ever. The sandwich has a homemade chicken cutlet, soaked in gravy and then topped with bacon and MAC AND CHEESE. Yes, you read that right too...macaroni and freakin' cheese. Oh, and the whole thing is on garlic bread. The first time I had this sandwich was a day I was feeling particularly down and since i thought it was going to be the most fattening I'd ever eaten I thought it was fitting for me to hate myself even more post-meal. But it wasn't! So obviously I've gotten it a few more times since... Honestly the most delicious thing I've ever had, and now I'm craving it again...oh boy. My boyfriend also tried the Big C which he thoroughly enjoyed. You won't regret trying anything on their menu...I can't wait to taste it all!
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/19/2013,4/28/2014,311,812,5,8,9>I have spent a boatload of time in Great Neck over the yrs since it's my mom's hometown and we visited my grandparents there quite a bit.  I have passed by Mizumi, and its predecessors for that matter, many times while driving down Northern Blvd but had never stopped in until we attended a good friend's birthday bash there earlier this month.  Now that I've experienced it, I hope to return!I love Asian cuisine, especially sushi.  Spicy salmon rolls are my absolute favorite, followed by oshinko rolls.  Not only did Mizumi have those, but many other offerings including some special rolls with silly names like The Angry Salmon.  While at first I was a bit wary of the idea of eating raw fish at a buffet, I was at ease once I saw the quick turnover and the chefs constantly putting out fresh rolls.  I also took advantage of being able to serve myself ginger--I don't think you can have enough ginger with sushi.  I decided to venture past the sushi station, and try some of the hot offerings as well.  The Korean BBQ short rib was divine.  Unfortunately, everyone else at the restaurant realized this, so it was not easy to obtain.  The seaweed salad was also excellent, as was the cream of pumpkin soup which had a strong ginger flavor to it.  Since I'll undoubtedly be in the area again, I would happily come back, particularly with a large group.  The restaurant itself was clean and spacious, and the staff was kind and helpful.  As a side note, I thought it was sweet how our waiter joined us in holding hands as the birthday girl's husband said Grace before we went to get our first plate of food.  Overall, it's a nice place!
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2014,4/27/2014,458,267,10,12,11>I've been meaning to try this place for more than 10 years and I finally got around to it. Yes, I said 10 years, don't judge me. Been here quite a few times now and we really enjoy it. Food is very good, always an interesting variety of beers on tap, and the service is very friendly. I guess I used to stay away because it always seemed like a place that would get insanely packed, busy and nauseating. And you know I don't do lines, noise, trendy places and long waits. But happy to say I was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps it's different on the bar side, but on the restaurant side it's very nice. I would imagine sometimes it's probably wise to have a reservation, but in the times we've been there to date, we haven't had any problem getting in and seated, and this includes one instance at prime time on a Friday night. Only problem is parking which can often be a pain. But that's the case throughout the area. So if you're not lazy, just leave the car at home and hop on the Q10. Now a fan and we'll definitely be stopping in here more often.
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2014,4/26/2014,286,298,7,16,12>I've been coming to Portalia for about 2 years now, pretty consistently since they opened, so this review is long overdue. Portalia is one of the best brunch spots in the neighborhood and a dependable destination for quality Italian fare, joining the [Astorian] ranks of Vesta and Via Trenta. While it can be difficult to choose between the three, Portalia is definitely your spot if you roll deep; they can easily accommodate groups of 8-12 people. And even if you don't travel with an entourage, the elegantly earthy yet homey Tuscan ambience of the restaurant makes it a great spot to bring a date or treat the parents. I really wish they'd get rid of those two giant flat screens behind the bar though. Why, Portalia, why?BRUNCH (weekend 11am-4pm):Portalia's brunch menu includes a wide range of brunch classics and heavier lunch options. Just the eggs benedict alone gives you a choice of canadian bacon, pancetta, smoked salmon, crab cakes, or spinach and gorgonzola. Standouts on the menu are the French toast, eggs benedict (with crab cakes!), both burgers, and of course the pasta. Pass on the pancakes*, paninis**, and pizzas***. Mimosas, bellinis, and bloody marys are just $3 each, and you can do bottomless drinks for $15, though I'm not sure WHY you'd do bottomless unless you're planning on having at least 5 drinks (6+ to make it a deal o_O). Also keep in mind that refills on coffee aren't free; you will be charged per coffee ordered.DINNER:Dinner at Portalia always hits the spot. I love the gratis starter: warm goat cheese and marinara sauce to accompany the bread, though it now hits the table pre-mixed which takes a lot of the fun out of it, but I suppose too many people didn't know to mix it. Portalia makes a solid rendition of my favorite pasta dish, linguine alla vongole (baby clams, cherry tomatoes, pinot grigio) - seasoned just enough to let the clams shine, though I wish there was a touch more broth. And I've also discovered a new favorite in Portalia's fazzoletti allo zafferano (rough cut pasta with saffron and veal ragu) - the meaty ragu is hearty perfection. Portalia's risotto of the day is usually a safe bet and a must if it's paired with their osso buco. There was one time (out of maybe four or five times) where the risotto was too loose, but I'll chalk that up to a fluke because the other times it was the perfect consistency. If you still have stomach space after your entrée, don't pass up on dessert! Their apple tart and their flourless chocolate cake are both killer.Note: closed Mondays*best pancakes in Astoria: Sweet Afton**best paninis in Astoria: Il Bambino***best brunch pizza in Astoria: Diwine
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2014,4/25/2014,106,721,5,9,6>M. Wells, the diner I so loved before they closed.  When they opened up at Moma PS1 I was so excited only to be terribly let down.  Thankfully with this second  venture they hit it square out of the park.  I came here on my birthday for a nice steak dinner and was absolutely delighted by what they served.First things first, this place is so easy to pass by.  It is completely unmarked, no large doors to see, no signs, and in a largely deserted area of LIC near the bus stop/subway station.  Once you find this place and actually sit down and look around you find that they've done an amazing job transforming this garage into a restaurant.  We split the cote de boeuf and it was a fantastic piece of meat, seasoned well (I hate that many places over salt steak for some odd reason) and the quality of the meat was obvious.  Everyone says Luger's is the best, but I would have to disagree.  My cote de boeuf absolutely blows away what I've had at Peter Lugers.  The foie gras terrine was a great dish however I felt they had too much going on there to truly let the foie gras shine.  The onion and bone marrow soup however was incredibly well done that you could have kept going back for more of that broth.M Wells Steakhouse certainly isn't cheap but they have done an excellent job in putting out fantastic food.  A great once and awhile treat without having to deal with the nonsense some other steak houses have.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2014,4/24/2014,77,112,9,15,12>Honestly, I don't know where to start. This place is a gem. The greatest place in possibly all of NYC (possibly all the world).It's because of this place that I don't buy buns when I frequent such fancy Manhattan establishments such as  Ippudo, Boahou and, Momofuku (insert Asian Spot). How can you justify a 600% markup when you are getting the same if not better quality at this quaint little stall? Simple economics guys, hop on the 7 train till the last stop and get your a$$ here ASAP. Or don't, that just  means more for me..Greatest deal in New York, hands down.
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/1/2013,1/3/2014,83,197,7,9,7>Taqueria Santa Fe is not a sit in restaurant and it is barely your usual hole in the wall restaurant. But it is simple and effective. You just pull up a stool outside, along the side of  the restaurant and watch your food served right in front of you. Their various amount of tacos are great. There are nine varieties to pick from. I tried the:Al Pastor Taco - A pork based taco with grilled pineapples. It has a nice spice to it and you can tell by the orange coating on the meat. Also the sweetness of the pineapples balance the spice well. (7/10)Carnitas Taco - Another pork taco topped with a pico de gallo mixture (diced tomatoes and onions salsa). This was more moist and the salsa gave it a mild fresh flavor. (8/10)Carne Asada Taco - Grilled steak taco. This had a nice charred flavor but a tad dry. (7/10)The tacos are small for $2.00 each so it is better to buy them in sets of 3's for $5.00. But these are legit tacos and will make you hate taco bell afterwards.Additionally, I had the chance to try one of their plattersSuadero Plato Santa Fe ($6.50) -  This veal platter came with a side of rice and beans. The veal had the texture of braised pork belly and the taste of pernil. The tender, moist meat was delicious. (8/10)Service was also a plus. As I waited for my food for pick up, who I believe was the manager offered me a complimentary hearty chicken soup. He also tried to make small talk with each customer. This showed effort in building returning business.
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/10/2013,1/2/2014,101,229,11,15,12>The bottom line: if you've got jury duty or work near the courthouse, you want to hit this place up for lunch.  Most of the restaurants on the block are delis or pizza places with greasy food (that tastes really good to be sure), but the food here is more wholesome and higher quality without being overly expensive.I went here twice for lunch while serving jury duty.  One time I got a chicken pesto panini and the other time I got a grilled chicken panini.  Both were really good and satisfying.  Pro tip: go for the sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries.  The sweet potato fries are thicker and more tasty.  The regular fries are thin and McDonald's-y but not as good as McDonald's.  :(I would say you should get there before the lunch rush around 1pm, but the line actually moves pretty fast so everything should be fine regardless of when you go.Definitely give the place a try.  It's the place to go for lunch if you're in the area.
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2013,1/1/2014,422,494,6,11,8>Located directly behind the Mcdonald's (please use a a landmark for this instance), the foot traffic to this store can be described as little to none.This bubble tea shop was quite small as 10 people could easily crowd the place.But being fairly new to Woodside, I'm sure people will start to take notice soon.This bubble tea shop however has some of the BEST bubbles that does not call Flushing nor Chinatown home.It was just the right size and stewed perfectly.The store was very clean and quite a good set-up.I had the mango slush on this day and it was EXCELLENT.The service girl who was by her lonesome self was very friendly.Free toppings when you check in with YELP, FOURSQUARE, TWITTER and/or FACEBOOK.I'm a FAN.
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2013,12/31/2013,227,484,7,20,14>A few of my friends had recommended this place.  I was forewarned this is a no frills type of place. After a hectic stressful summer full of projects, this is exactly what I needed. I entered and asked what kind of massages they offer, the hostess at the front said one hour combination of hot stone, shiatsu, and swedish for $35.  Sold!I got a very young masseuse, I didn't think he'd be experienced but he was very strong and knew exactly where to find my knots without me telling him.  That's an experienced masseuse!  Here's what you need to know before you go:No frills, not a real spa. Small rooms for private massages.Strip down to your skivvies.Be quiet!*$35 for 1 hour massageAbove the Fay da bakeryClean rooms, bare minimum$10 minimum tipThey wipe you down with a nice hot towel at the end to wipe down the massage lotionEnglish is a second languageBonus! They crack your back and stretch your legs, arms, and back at the end of the massage.  A mini chiropractic finish.So don't be cheap, most massages cost at least $1 per minute!  $45 for an hour with hot stones and stretching at the end is unheard of.  Trust me, I've been around to all sorts and types of spas/massage places.  *Its not that quiet, you can hear people walking or the toilet flushing but what do you expect from a tiny place in Forest Hills!The only thing I didn't enjoy was the massage table.  It kept moving when my masseuse was putting a lot of pressure on me.  I'll be returning for a regular, possibly monthly massage.  What a great find!
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2013,12/30/2013,200,154,6,13,7>How did I not know about this place? I've lived in Astoria for two years and had no idea there was an Asian Grocery store in my backyard. Now, it is a teeny little place, but for such a limited space, they have a lot of interesting stuff in there. Individually packaged seaweed salad, two different types of kim chee, many many types of candy, kewpie japanese mayo, ramen (spelled ram-yun)... I was squealing excitedly at each new discovery. Will definitely be back to explore more. To my knowledge, this is the only Asian Grocery store in Astoria... if you know of another one, please do let me know!
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2013,12/29/2013,68,135,5,13,6>Just a quick update about the *new* Bungalow Bar after thousands of dollars in renovations (another local establishment ruined by SuperstormSandy). I want by around 11:30-midnight  the Sunday night of Memorial Day Weekend just to check out the new back deck, and it was like being in a movie. Or at a wedding??!! Everyone...ev-ery-one.. was dancing their a$$es off and having a good time. The place looks amazing also.I heard they are going to be featured on an episode of the show Bar Rescue so I'm interested in seeing that transformation. We were comparing it to what a night out was like back in the summers of 2000-2001. The place was crowded but the bartenders had no problem taking care of everyone. Awesome atmosphere. It's so easy now to get there with the (cheap!) ferry at beach 108. Totally worth the trip to Rockaway if you wanna experience a serious summer party night.
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2013,12/28/2013,783,346,4,8,4>Absolutely delicious roasted duck curry.   Totally satisfies any Thai curry craving, which, if you've experienced this sort, is NOT a craving to be messed with.   The duck is not over-cooked or crisped to death, like I've had in lesser Thai restaurants.  Yes, the slices of duck are dark-meat-lover approved, and are nice portioned between the lean and the fat.  You need the fat to flavor the dish, and there is plenty of flavor packed in there.  Noodles are a good bet here, as well as the taro appetizer.  I just wish they would use real brown rice instead of the sticky white-and-red rice they give when you request brown rice.
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2013,12/27/2013,134,610,6,7,7>Some of the best BBQ I've had in NYC!I love some good beef bbq, and Butcher Bar delivers like a mofo.  The sauce is solid, especially when I mix 2/3 of the original and 1/3 of the spicy to add a bit of kick.Butcher Bar itself is a nice place, feels like a classic BBQ place.  I've seen their setup too at LIC Flea - they setup the night before and slowcook the hell out of their meat, definitely worth itThe food itself. . .the beef and chicken was 4.5 stars, the mac&cheese was 4 stars, the corn bread was 2 stars.  Net net it's a 4-star BBQ, which in my mind is one of the best in all of NYC.  My girlfriend LOVES her pulled chicken, it's one of the only places in all of the city that offers it.  Great service, good sodas, great bbq, sides are okay - Butcher Bar is a winner in my book.
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/25/2013,12/26/2013,289,416,10,16,14>Astoria has noticeably changed in the past few years.  Although it is still as ethnically diverse as ten years ago, if not more so, the hipsters are now among the, shall we say, "midsters", thereby allowing both the young and the young at heart to walk  the streets of Astoria. Indeed, for the past couple of years, plaid and skinny jeans have become more visible apparels of choice in the neighborhood.  There is one place though where both the young and the young at heart are united in walking.  After all, tango is said to be nothing more than walking.  At Astoria Tango Club, young and old alike respect the rules of tango as well as enjoy the delightful food cooked by Circulo Espanol.  During Sundays, any one who wants to attend the milonga can pay $10 and there is a free tango class at the beginning around 6:00 p.m.  The head instructor, Mariana Fresno is an absolute delight! She will welcome any student and will patiently teach and answer questions.  What are you waiting for? Put on those dancing shoes!

These ppl have been in the restaurant biz for decades so they know their stuff. Came to this branch a handful of times already... It's clean and staff is friendly :)Some of our favorite dishes are: 3 cup chicken, Salt n pepper fish, Chinese brkfst items, etc...Another plus is the bilingual cashier & owner that hangs about a lot. You can always give 'em your direct feedback and any questions on the food. Need to come back to try more stuff!
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2014,9/20/2014,36,97,7,8,8>This is one of my new favorite places in the neighborhood.  Love the concept - there are about 4 taps at every table upstairs.  They have an extensive list of beers ranging from your standard to more unique to fruity to IPA and everything in between.  If the particular beer you want is not at your table you can order it off the menu.  I got a banana bread beer which I had never tried before and it was so good!The cool thing is they charge you by the amount that you pour into your glass so if you want to sample a beer you can and it will not charge you the full price.  The food here is awesome as well.  The group I was with ordered a bunch of apps.  We got chicken quesadillas which were flavorful and the chicken was very fresh, the sample wing platter which was great and you can choose 4 different types of wing sauce.  The turkey sliders were yum and my personal favorite the mac and cheese bites were incredible.  This is a great place for a party, a night of hanging out or just a dinner.  I loved it here!!
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,9/19/2014,183,197,4,10,6>I've been there two days in a row. They have only been open for three.Just a note:~They opened up the last day of April, which means for now cash only.~Cold brew coffee $4, Americano $3 just to give you an idea of the prices~Stan-the-coffee-man, as my other half likes to call him, is one of the owners (his wife being the other) is extremely friendly and down to earth. ~Stumptown coffee now in Astoria :) My roommate will be stoked.~The store hours (for right now) is going to be 7am-9pm, as they are still trying to see how business goes.On my way to check out a DVD from Redbox (CVS on Broadway) I happen to be looking at the stores on Steinway. By chance, I see a Stumptown Coffee sign through a large glass window, and immediately walk in. You see, Stumptown coffee reminds me of the West Coast (Oregon to be exactly) and I miss it. So to be able to enjoy Stumptown coffee without having to travel to busy-bustling Manhattan brings me joy.The place is cute and simple. The plants and wooden decor bring a relaxing feeling to the place, regardless that it's located on such a busy street. I LOVE the idea that there are no plug outlets. That's right, no outlets; as far as I can see. Which means people won't be sitting there, sucking up free WIFI FOOOR-EEEEV-EEEER (said like the kid from The Sandlot) Customers will be able to sit, drink a cup of cold brew coffee (my suggestion during the summer days to come) read a book, perhaps do some homework, even just sit at the bar and stare out of the window. I also enjoy the seating. It's just two counters/bar seating and a circle table in the center. As you can see I love simplicity. A coffee shop should offer a place for people to enjoy their coffee, not a place for people to suck free WIFI and turn their table into a work cubicle. Good luck Stan (and his wife who makes the cute adorable plant terrariums) I'm sure you'll do great!! I know I'll be back. PS: My other half is in love with the Americano. Stan was nice enough to ask if he wanted it strong. He did. It was. My other half is now in love with it.
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/28/2014,9/18/2014,84,161,4,8,6>I can't believe I've never written a review of this place before. Well first things first, a big shout out to Billy who was charming and delightful and helped pick out some good beers on their newly expanded list this past weekend. It's not easy being gracious to the rambunctious middle aged crowd I brought by.We've been coming to Mosaic for a few years now and I absolutely love their low-key style. Their new beer list is superb, you can get at least 8 different kinds of sour beer (which is something I always rate my bars by) and it goes to many pages of all your other traditional beers (lagers, IPAs, lambics, etc.) Their wine is isn't nearly as extensive but it hits all the major tasty groups. They used to have a banging deal for wine flights, but I'm not sure if it still exists.Their food options are also tasty. We almost always get the mozzarella hand rolls and the pretzel sticks (which are soft and buttery like Auntie Anne's). I don't know if I've tried anything else.The decor is possibly my favorite party. The place is filled cushy chairs and sofas that look well maintained. I'm not nervous sitting on any of them like I have been at other establishments. They keep the lights at the perfect "make everyone look beautiful" low light, which does everyone favors and will certainly increase my tip at the end of the night.It's now a tradition for my family bar crawl to make this the last stop before dinner. We swing by right as they open on Saturday and have the whole place to ourselves. Then we slink out to dinner before the regular crowd shuffles in. It's also perfect for a date night. The cushy chairs and low light just beg for you to snuggle up together.Highly recommend this place.
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,9/17/2014,665,302,8,16,13>M Wells is one of LIC's gems that's for sure. Reservations were made on the day. I called in after 5pm that day and was told that they either do not take reservations for 2 or does not have a table for 2. I might have misunderstood what the man on the other side of the phone said but we lucked out. He told me that he can put me in at 8pm for the chefs bar. IMO, best seats in the house. We were seated in front of the kitchen. A half wall of glass separating us from getting food splashed on to us. It was great, watching how the chefs work and the food that's coming out. They all worked with great dedication and precision. Very entertaining. I would not trade our seats for a regular table.The restaurant used to be an auto body collision garage. It is chic and rustic and service is at par with any classic steakhouse in the city. You will never be overlooked and forgotten. Every server, there to satisfy your needs.Afraid that we might once again overstuff ourselves, we set out to order what we believe would be a decent amount of food. We got half a dozen of oysters to start with our wine. 3 different ones, 2 of each. Very fresh. Complimentary pretzel roll and brioche was great. Served with butter of course and a tiny container of mustard. Will get your belly warm and started for a great meal. We ordered the bone in burger to share with sides of Foie Gras Gnocchi, Pommes Aligot and one of their specials Venison BBQ short ribs. Great seasoning on the burger, Chef Christine on the grill made the most perfect ribs and burger that night. Gnocchi are two huge fried ones with a generous amount of filling. Aligot is mashed potatoes with cheese, lots of it. It's stringy and creamy maddddd good. It turned out we did over ordered and couldn't finish the sides. Leftover lunch for the following day then lol.For dessert, we got their Cinammon Cake. We went past the Chocolate Charcuterie, since Goof Ball said he read the reviews and almost everyone says we should order this. It was good, yes. Mind blowing, No. Next time I'm going with what my gut tells me. And that means, get anything chocolate! Will most likely be coming back very soon to try their other offerings. Save that Chefs bar seats for us. We are coming.***Update: I totally forgot we got the onion soup. How can I forget???!!! Onion pup with bone marrow inside served with two crisp pieces of thinly sliced bread. Delish! The bone marrow worked really well with the onion soup. It will kinda get lost tho if you take the marrow and mix it with the soup. Just scoop a little at a time and eat with a spoonful. Or spread on the bread and take a bite after each spoonful. Whichever way you like there's no doubt this soup is wonderful. ***

I suppose that enough time has passed that I can now laugh along with everyone else, rather than live in fear that someone is going to go postal in Poorna-Salabhasana [1].I've been struggling with health problems and minor injuries of late and think that certain teachers, especially Anna and Laura, have been very supportive and encouraging in my practice. To have them cheer me on to strive for my best, even when I feel like I've been plowed over by a cement mixer, has proven to be a very valuable lesson in perseverance and faith in one's self.  It's a shame that Iyengar Yoga isn't offered more than once a week in LIC, because the pace and the postures are great for those of us who need something more restorative. For vinyasa classes, Danielle's move at a good pace - not too quickly, not too slowly.Although I have not yet gotten a massage at TYR, I noticed that prices are very reasonable ($85 vs. $120+ that most massage therapists in Manhattan will charge that do not accept insurance [2]). One of these days, I will have to try a massage and see if it loosens up the good old ropey shoulders and unrelenting pain in T3 [3].  Thanks to Nil, who is also a rockstar teacher, I'll hopefully be able to work through these imbalances through yoga and massage so I don't look like Quasimodo by the time I hit 30.[1] And if you see someone flailing around during Hot Pilates, that's probably me. I hope I've earned a more forgiving nickname than something that has to do with flatulence.[2] Can we review Obamacare on Yelp?[3] innerbody.com/anatomy/sk

All Gyros are Served W/Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions on Pita Bread with a choice of sauce, either on the gyro or on the side.The Pork & Chicken are both cooked on a twirling spindle giving the outer layer a slight char (yummy), Slicing off chunks of meat per order. The pork is cooked & seasoned perfectly, soft, moist & full of flavor. The pork is definitely the way to go. The chicken is seasoned well, but if it's not smothered in sauce it taste very dry. The Tzatziki Sauce ( yogurt, cucumber & garlic ) the usually white sauce on gyros. The sauce you must try is the BZ Grill Sauce ( home-made mayo-mustard sauce ) it's a little tangy, which gives the gyros a kick!Overall this is a great spot, all ingredients are high quality & fresh, with limited indoor & outdoor seating ... walking distance from Astoria park. Grab a couple of gyros & chill out in Astoria park that's the life....
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/10/2014,9/14/2014,427,354,6,8,7>I have heard about this spot for a long time. Drove past it a few times. But it was one lucky Friday night when Mama bear wanted Thai food. Since I was tired of bringing her crap I decided we would give this place a try. We called to see if there was any wait around 6:30 and they said we could walk right in and be seated...and that is what we did.They have a tiny parking lot but its a residential area so not too terrible to find parking. We left the car in front of a nice quiet lawn and headed inside.We orderd thai iced teas which both my mother and sister couldn't handle. My sister swapped for a sprite and my mom an Amazing Thailand. That Amazing Thailand was SUPER DELICIOUS! Almost made me cancel my iced tea but I stuck with it. It was so yummy and sweet but not overly done and you could still get a SLIGHT hint of the liquor. Our waitress was a little sweet heart and was totally attentive and not fussy at all about us canceling the two drinks. She politely hopped around and helped us whenever necessary.To the grub.. I'm usually pretty basic with thai food. (Pad Thai anyone?) But I was tired of always ordering the same old thang and was hoping to take my palate to Bangok...for real this time around. So I scoured some yelp reviews. Searched for something spicy and ended up ordering the Jungle Curry. For a beach loving, animal cuddling, carribbean blooded queen...jungle was sounding like a dream. Based on reviews it was spicyyyyyyyyy but they could turn it down if need be.  I had it medium hot with shrimp and brown rice. Mama Bear: Pineapple Fried Rice with shrimp. And for Sissy: Pad thai with shrimp.  For apps we  ordered calamari with a sweet chili sauce. Man oh man. The crunch on the calamari was amazing and the sweet chili sauce had little sprinkles of peanuts in it. Gave it awesome crunch and a salty sweet combo going on. It was enough for the three of us but we practically fought over who would have the last of it. My jungle curry was spicy but completely palatable. I love spicy so it was delicious. I could have gone for a bigger serving of rice but I had to leave space for my Fried Ice cream so it was best to leave it alone. The vegetables in the soup were so fresh and flavored so nicely I couldn't believe it. The only thing in there I didn't love were the pimento seeds. At least I think thats what they were. Everything else I devoured. The shrimp was juicy and plump (tails on and I didn't even complain!). So good. My sisters pad thai had a sweet deliciousness about it. She loved it. I loved it too as I kept dipping in her plate. I also took a few spoonfuls of Mama Bear's Pineapple fried rice and it was also delicious. Everything was SO tasty and fresh. The fried ice cream we ordered was vanilla. We had a choice of a raspberry sauce for topping or chocolate. We rolled with chocolate and once the three spoons arrived all hell broke loose. The crunchy outside. The gooey inside. The chocolate. OMG. It was a perfect end to a perfect meal.Our waitress again, was a doll. All the servers were helpful and polite. It was perfect for my little family and would be perfect for a romantic night also. The dim lights could set the mood. It was overall an awesome dinner and  we plan on coming back soon.

I decided to check this place out as it had pretty good ratings on Yelp, and I am glad I did!I called 30 minutes prior to coming in (this was on Friday afternoon), and the woman on the phone kindly took my name and number down for a mani pedi, which is only $22!I went in and was immediately ushered to the pedicure chair. The girl who took care of me REALLY took care of me, which did not go unnoticed! While doing my nails, she took her time and made sure the polish was meticulous before letting me go. My entire stay lasted for a little over an hour. The spa has really cute and modern decor, the music playing was nice background music, and they were playing What Not To Wear on Netflix! It made my stay seem a lot shorter than it was!A lot of nail spas tend to rush you, but I'm so happy that she took her time. Overall, she did a fantastic job and I left the nail spa quite happy. I will be returning soon enough!
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2014,9/12/2014,35,182,6,9,7>A predominantly food based flea market in Astoria? Consider me interested.GET IT:1. Tea n' Milk - Hibiscus peach white tea w/ tapioca - definitely a refreshing drink for a hot day in the sun. Other craft bubble tea spin offs will keep you coming back to try the other flavors.2. Khao Man Gai - Chicken wings had a nice flavorful garlic kick to them! Get the Watermelon drink to wash it down. Coming back next time to the 2013 Vendy Award Winner for their star main dish though.3. Bibingka-esk - If you're into Filipino pastries, show some support for this honest, local family start up shop. The UBE and S'mores flavors were chewy and delicious. 4. Butcher Bar - 14 hour smoked and super tender brisket? Yes.HONORABLE MENTION:5. Old Fashioned Doughnut -  Toasted coconut doughnut was a good change up from usual flavors, but the coconut crust falls apart off the donut too easily. Bavarian creme croughnut flavor was excellent, but the pastry itself was just ok.PASS:6. Oconomi - Okonomiyaki w/ pork and classic sauce. Unfortunately it wasnt very well bound together. Thin slice of pork in there wasn't special. 7. Lukes Lobster - $8 for half a lobster roll no larger than 4 inches, which didn't even blow my mind? I feel ashamed for even considering this.8. Jessy's Pastries - Only stopped by to grab a Mango/Papaya drink for an easy $3, but it wasn't as special. One of the only stands that offered empanadas so that may be worth considering in the future.
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2014,9/11/2014,17,30,17,20,14>I've been here quite a few times, and will continue to visit whenever I get the urge to consume massive quantities of farm animal flesh. I hope that builds up your appetite.So anyway, complaints about the decor of this place are absurd. It's a $20 buffet in the basement of a Holiday Inn, what did you expect? If you're looking for ambiance and are disappointed by this place, I'm laughing at you. I come here for one thing, and that's the meat, and lots of it.  So let's begin. 'Churrascaria' = steakhouse. Get it? Complaints about the salad bar? I'm laughing. Complaints about the service? It's a buffet! When you people start tipping 20% you can start complaining about buffet service.   Anybody know how much skirt steak is per pound? Try $13/lb. Yeah, so I don't mind the price so much. Yes, I see that they tack on a gratuity to that $20 admission, but it's still worth it. And do you know why they tack on the gratuity? It's because people are REALLY cheap at tipping buffet staffs. I try to ignore the salad bar, not because it's not good, but simply because my carnivorous desires prevent me from eating stuff that wasn't slaughtered and grilled. But from what I've tried, everything was fresh and tasty. I DO help myself to copious amounts of chimmichurri. It goes well with all of the dead animals. It's the only green thing I eat there.Now on to the meat itself. I fancy myself the grilling enthusiast. Are some of the meats overcooked? Yeah, sometimes (especially the pork loin which is kinda hit or miss but you can tell if it's overcooked since it looks like dried turkey), but for the most part they do a pretty good job. The skirt steak has always been decently cooked (it's hard to screw it up since skirt steak does really well on the grill and can withstand a bit of mediumness) and the beef ribs are a highlight. The beef short ribs are my favorite, their outside is grilled to a chewy tendon-like crisp, with lots of lovely marbled meet to gnaw off the bone. They're essentially giant Korean kalbi. The meats are all seasoned very well (hear that Greenfield's?) and I haven't had a piece of grilled critter that wasn't seasoned to my satisfaction. The succulent chicken thighs come to mind...As far as value, this is THE best churrascaria/rodizio I've visited. I'll take this over the $60/person Fogo De Chao any day of the week. To sum it all up:Great value, good price.It's in a Holiday Inn, it's $20 (plus gratuity), stop complaining.Wait for the beef short ribs and skirt steak. Don't like meat? you're in the wrong place.

Don't come crying to me with your hunger pains just because you don't know how to choose the correct pre-Columbian civilization. The Inkan's Peruvian style is legit. I have ordered from here 10+ times now, and every time, the chicken is tender, extremely juicy, well crisped and perfectly cooked. Their sauces rival those of Pio Pio (seriously) and the side portions are healthy. The rice is good but a bit bland, and the beans are often over or under cooked. But focus on the chicken.They have a bunch of other dishes too, which range from enjoyable (empenadas, soup, plantains) to those that need some work (their pork rind and steak are a bit tough and underseasoned, although one gets the vague impression that this is the style).Overall, I am a very happy customer. The price is right ($5.99 for a 1/2 chicken) for me to enjoy this stuff on a regular basis. Just be careful visiting during lunch hour, it's a small place and can get packed.

They also throw in some pickled vegetables.... and I do love me some pickled vegetables. I was sold (I would be coming back) and our meals hadn't even arrived.All the dishes come with salad. And like the reviews before me have pointed out this salad (yes the side salad that comes with your meal) is incredible. Really!  It's got all these herbs mixed in along with the perfect mix of lettuce's and veggies. It didn't even need the amazing side of dressing it came with. I had settled on the lamb shank over rice. It was cooked to perfection being tender and juicy the way lamb should be.  It also came with this spectacular red vegetable sauce that I kept pouring all over my fluffy rice. Yum!My companion on this journey ordered the Mussels Over Pasta in a light creamy white sauce. This can only be described as an entire colony of mussels living on pasta. The pile of shells on top of shells was so high we couldn't see each other. It smelled amazing and I'm told tasted even better. * shakes fist at the allergy gods *We were suitably stuffed so we passed on dessert. Something I rarely do, but to our surprise we were brought some complimentary dessert to take home with us all wrapped and ready to go. My eyes sparkled once again as I couldn't wait for to eat this treat in about an hour or so.  For under $50 (without the coupon) our dinner was spectacular. I cannot wait to go back and try some of the more 'exciting' meals they list on their menu. Don't let the 'no pork and no alcohol' fool you; this place is worth every step to get there and every penny once inside.The only downside to my experience here was I some how lost my take out bag of dessert after we left. I didn't even see what the dessert looked like or what it was, and I just know it would have been super yummy!  So yummy if that little takeout bag showed it's face right now, I'd eat it...oh yes I would.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2013,4/2/2013,76,31,6,17,10>I've been a Blink member for some time. I had a take a hiatus from the very first gym in NoHo, after resigning to being too lazy to continue the out-of-the-way journey to frequent that location. I still live in Jamaica now, and was working in Chelsea at the time. After 1+ year, and an increase in workload, I decided I needed a gym near my apartment to realistically get a workout in. It pained me to cancel my membership to the gym that helped me get into the best shape of my life. I ended up joining the YMCA on the corner of my block. For all intents and purposes, it worked out really well. It was right on my corner, so I had no excuses. But I've actually found myself getting more out of shape. It just didn't have the mojo of Blink.While running around Christmas shopping on Jamaica Ave., I saw the familiar blue glow of "Blink." I was astounded. A Blink was opening up a short five blocks from my house! The next day I went for a tour and felt like I was greeting an old and dear friend. I was home again. Nothing against the Jamaica YMCA, but it simply isn't Blink. I had built an emotional connection with Blink almost two years ago when I first walked into the doors of the inaugural NoHo outpost. And now, there's a beacon of simple and accessible quality fitness for the everyman, right in my backyard.I needed no convincing. I signed up on the spot, then walked over to the YMCA to cancel my membership. It felt good to be back.Per Blink (and Equinox's) m.o., it's very clean. The staff are extremely friendly and inviting (shout out to Jevonna and Alex). And the equipment is among the highest caliber. A marked difference between Jamaica and NoHo is the size of the locker room. That was my biggest problem with NoHo. The men's locker room was a sardine can, and it seems they learned from their mistake when building out this location.There's stiff competition to be had in Jamaica, with the likes of Bally, Lucille Roberts, and YMCA all only blocks away (and closer to the trains, no less). But there's a certain panache about Blink that, for me, sets it above the rest. I'm going to enjoy the empty evenings, and slow afternoons. Because I doubt it'll be like this very long. Welcome to the neighborhood Blink. I've been waiting for you.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2013,4/1/2013,242,92,7,12,11>Even for a Taiwanese girl, navigating through Flushing is very intimidating and nothing but unpleasant. (There is something about this city that makes people think that they are invincible when crossing streets!) Despite the frustration, I have a deep love for this city because it is chock-full of culture. Authentic food with robust flavors may be found on almost every block and at almost every... (wait for it) corner. Corner 28 is unquestionably a gem of Queens. It consists of a handful of little businesses including dim sum to-go. Its main attraction is a shack with a window facing Main Street. This shack is hard to miss. It is decorated with freshly roasted whole ducks that are dripping with fat and glistening with oil. Their specialty is Peking Duck which is traditionally served between steamed white buns. These buns are incomplete without fresh green scallions, refreshing cucumber, and thick hoisin sauce. Hoisin is sweet and salty. It's a sauce that is commonly used in Chinese meals for pork and seafood. Expect to get a sliver of meat in your bun with a thick cut of skin; people enjoy eating Peking Duck mostly for its cripsy skin. Besides its texture, the skin is rubbed with molasses and five spice powder. This is an expensive dish at most Chinese restaurants; you are usually given enough ingredients for roughly eight buns for $30. At Corner 28, you can buy as many as you'd like for about $1.00-$1.50 each. Portions are bigger and the duck is much fresher. If you visit Flushing, this is a must-try. These buns are highly addictive and will positively alleviate some of the stress you may have incurred driving in.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/21/2013,3/31/2013,179,443,3,8,5>I got my hair cut by Mela on Thursday evening (the only night the shop is open late). I called a few days ahead of time to make the appointment. I went to her because I read the other reviewers who mentioned that she is great with curly hair. I'm growing my hair out (I had a pixie cut about 2 years ago) and it needed a little something since it was all essentially the same length.On the night of my appointment, I arrived about half an hour early (oops), but there were two large comfy couches so I played on my phone while I waited. Mela was ready for me right on schedule and her assistant who washed my hair was super nice. Mela took her time examining my curl pattern and getting to know my hair, which I appreciated. She then proceeded to work some magic while making lively conversation and also gave me a damn good blowout, all for only $40 + tip. I couldn't believe it. I will definitely go back to Mela at Studio 34 as I continue to grow out my hair!
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2013,3/30/2013,219,1009,7,12,10>The moment I found out I had to go for jury duty, I knew I had to Yelp nearby places for lunch. When Salvadoran is an option, I'll always go for it. Why? HORCHATA. PUPUSAS. They're all I ever wanted. The storefront looked like a deli/grocery store, but once you go inside, you can get seated in the back restaurant part. Once I sat down, I was greeted warmly and introduced to the $5 for 3 pupusas special that day. Of course, I knew what I wanted already. As soon as I ordered my horchata, the waitress was delighted at my accent and from then on, spoke solely in Spanish to me. I was uber excited. Onto the horchata. It was like the name of the restaurant, just OK. BUT the pupusas, oh the pupusas! Stuffed with cheese, chicharron and cheese, and red bean. They were hot with melted cheese and perfectly cooked. If I ever have to accompany anyone going for jury duty, I will. Just to come here.
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2013,3/29/2013,149,276,10,10,10>I give Cafe Boulis a 4.0 stars for the fact that they served me fresh on the spot fried Loukoumades. I loved the fact that I see her operate the device that just drops the round donuts (Loukoumades) into the fryer right in front of me. These medium brown Loukoumades are then drizzled with a sweet syrup. -Mine- came in a puddle of the syrup. No need for that, it made it a little heavily sweetened than I would have liked it. Not a issue at all, next time I will ask for just a little. Why? Because these thin midsized donuts are warm, soft, airy and has a light crisp bite to them alone. For the freshness and quality I rate these a 3.9 stars. For one of the staff members being super nice, friendly and communicative, I boost this small 5 stool seating w. bar-like table top to a 4.0 star quaint cafe. There is also nice little wooden tables and seats at their outdoor patio area enclosed in a plastic housing to keep rain out if one wants that outdoor feel without the outside weather. There are cookies, baked goods w. Phyllo dough (spinach, cheese), Paninis, Flan, bagels, cake, wraps, etc... I topped my Loukoumades with cinnamon and powdered sugar but you can top it with your desired: Honey, Chocolate Syrup, Chopped Walnuts, Sour Cherry Syrup, etc... Next time I will try that Agave Nectar.The Loukoumades will set you back $4.00 for 5 pieces and $8.00 for 12 pieces for two toppings. The single Greek coffee came in a small cappuccino -like cup. It had a powdery off beat aroma and taste to it, kinda like something from Nescafe pouches, I dunno, I was told it's stronger than the organic coffee so I went for it because I like strong/bold coffee. It wasn't bad but if given the option, I'd try something else. The iced coffee was average but good. Or I'll try something from the fridge.Nice place with tidbits here and there to enhance a visit. I need to learn to read Greek to read the newspaper and articles laying around :] Though no Wifi at my time of visit, I loved the sign that said: No Coffee. No Workee. That's me in the morning.
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2012,3/28/2013,68,233,7,11,6>KANEEEEEEEE. BALL SO HARD, Kane's for true grit Queens residents. I see reviews here complaining about the mounds of dust nearby or the sanitary grades and none of it really matters. If you eat at Kane's you should know what to expect. Kane's is a 24 hour diner that's been in business for at least 20 years, if not more... I don't know the exact date but it's older than most people on this site. With that said it probably hasn't changed much since it's inception : still has that "hometown" feel, nothing fancy and certainly won't blow you away with anything specific. Want organic? Not here. Special request? Take them elsewhere. Pretend like Kane is a diner in the deep south where the teens eat their last meal before the horror movie really starts. That about explains Kane.I've been itching to try their Steak and Eggs that's advertised as $8.99 on their signs outside the building and on a quiet Sunday with no breakfast plans I made the trip. Let's get down to it : - Actual steak! (See pic) It's maybe a 6 ounce piece of skirt steak, perfeclty cooked with pink on the inside and hot off the grill. Delicious.- I ordered my eggs sunnyside up and they were made ok, I think their grill is a little hot so it fried the bottom fo the eggs a good bit and the yolk didn't have as much time to cook. But still acceptable.- Hash browns were slightly burnt but still edible. Overall I'm just glad that they advertise steak and give you steak, not like Longwood Gourmet. Long glare towards Midtown East.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/23/2013,3/27/2013,188,156,4,11,6>Sunnyside really does have some unexpected gems among all the new eating establishments that have been cropping up.          Words to live by: Always keep your expectations LOW and your hopes HIGH!  I really wasnt expecting much from this place but i ended up being pleasantly surprised on how good it was.   Me and my boyfriend were on a Chimichanga hunt around 7pm on saturday night. Beleive it or not, ive never tried a chimichanga. He discovered this fact and promised he would get me that chimichanga by the end of the night.  Flour tortilla stuffed with chicken and cheese AND Deep Fried? Surely i couldnt pass up on that idea, saturday can be my cheat day...right?   Our search lead us to Chip's in good ole sunnyside, we made a pick up order for one chimichanga, the mole platter and a large guacamole and chips. Every take-out place on earth has to learn from these guys on packaging. They put everything in leak proof containers, extra napkins, extra forks, extra salsa, extra chips and even placed cardboard barriers between the entrees so nothing would tip over. It's the little things that show how much effort people put into keeping customers happy.    As for the food, the portions are pretty large and its mexican food so obviously its very filling. The chimichanga was a bit on the greasy side but the flavors were well balanced and i love that they give you small sides of quacamole and sour cream to go with it. Their quac and chips are a sure bet, very fresh and they really don't skimp on the amounts they give you. We had tons of chips left over!     The most disappointing part of the meal was sadly the mole platter, it consisted of chicken breast in a deep dark brown sauce. While the chicken was juicy and cooked well, the sauce was just very bitter and not appealing. We wouldn't order it again and i wouldnt recommend it since there are much better options on their menu    Chimichanga mission complete! Overall it was a success and Chip's gets a check in my book.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2012,3/26/2013,628,678,17,20,15>I'm sad to report that the probability of your coffee being excellent increases if the baristas are wearing either beanies or fedoras. At Cafe de Cupping, they wear fedoras and my latte was delicious.Seriously this cafe is a welcome addition to the area, partially because of the stellar coffee and partially because sometimes you just need to sit around idly. (The next closest cafe with the holy trifecta of great coffee, cozy ambiance, and ample seating is the awesome Station Side Cafe about 10 blocks east, brewing Lavazza.)Cafe de Cupping brews Intelligentsia "Black Cat Project" beans. Do I care? Damn this coffee is great. There are Edison bulbs hanging pompously over the counter, but the counter girl is sweet (if not a little soft-voiced).Get each letter of their business card stamped (C A F E D E C U P P I N G = 13) for each drink and get one free. No minimum for credit. Check your receipt for the wifi password.
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/22/2013,11/13/2013,65,227,5,9,7>I own a pretty expensive road bike, but I don't know much about the mechanics of a bike, so whenever there's a problem, I would have to bring it to a bike shop for it to be looked at. I bought my bike at some place I thought was great, but customer service sucked after my sis said some stuff about them. Plus their skills as a mechanics were suspect. Nothing ever seemed right. So I did some search and found this place. We went there for the basic tune-up and they gave us a pretty good price. We really needed our bikes the next day, but they were able to accommodate. They told us to pick them up the same day, and they did have it ready for us by then. Andres, the mechanic, was the one who fixed up our bikes. He also gave us a call to let us know that they were ready. Andres is a really great mechanic. When we picked up our bikes, he told us that our seats might be too high, so he told us to get on the bikes so he can see. Indeed, the seats were a bit high, so he adjusted it for us. He also noticed that my seat was not an angle that was ideal; it was slanted downwards, so he adjusted it for me. He said that a seat that is parallel would allow me to better control my bike, and I wouldn't be shifting around so much sliding back and forth. We also chatted up a bit, and he told us that Bicycle Repairman Corp is a business owned by him and his family, and that he's been in the bike business for quite some time. I definitely would be coming back here (even though I get free basic tune-ups at the other place I bought my bike), because Andres did a really good job on our bikes. They were sparkling clean, and my gears were shifting pretty smoothly. I'm a pretty happy biker!
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2013,11/12/2013,183,197,5,6,7>This is based on the fact it's quick. Easy. Good portion for the price. If you can get a filling meal for less than $10, heck yeah.My go-to has always been the the Lamb over rice for $6! White sauce & red sauce.The chicken [over rice $6] is a bit to fatty for my preference.The falafal [over rice $5] is good: I think you get about 5/6 pcs. Smaller portion then the lamb.Lamb Gyro at $4.5 is a REALLY go price for the portion. If your starch of choice is bread, you can't go wrong.I swing by this place at least once or twice a week on my way home. You literally get off the train, (head in the opposite direction as the comic shop) go down the steps toward Ditmars, and you can see the stand. It sits in front of the Payless/Chase bank area-ish.  I can get 2 filling meals for $12. Good deal in my book.
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2013,11/11/2013,36,69,6,7,6>I LOVE this place!  My sister has raved about the Twist It Top It in Howard Beach, but I could never bring myself to go all the way over there just for froyo.  Needless to say I was thrilled when I saw one was opening in Forest Hills.Since it's opened, my hubby and I have come four times, and we've had an unbelievably positive experience each time!  The flavors and toppings are overwhelming, there are so many delicious choices! The store and counters are always immaculate, the staff is friendly, and the price, by weight, is reasonable (as long as you don't go overboard!).  We always take it to go bc the vibe inside is kind of family-ish (parents sitting at the tables letting their loud kids run around), but the tables and chairs are bright, inviting colors and it's always nice and air-conditioned, so for people who don't mind annoying children it's a great place to stay a while.  There's nothing better than a make-your-own sundae, and Twist It Top It's set-up is one of the best around!
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2013,11/10/2013,76,131,7,12,8>It is only a spring roll--a common Asian appetizer I have mindlessly consumed so many times before--and yet somehow I have rapidly devoured three of these crispy golden fingers before even realizing I have yet to dunk one into the accompanying chili sauce, which I apparently have subconsciously deemed unnecessary. Delicately crispy wonton wrapper crackles at the bite and gives way to a steaming center of tightly bundled al dente glass noodles, tiny slivers of carrot, and sweet lumps of fresh crabmeat. The flavors are intense, the textures playful, and I do not want to share even one of the four. Fortunately my friend is a vegetarian--always a safe dining companion when I don't want to share everything on my plate. "That has crabmeat in it, right?" he asks, after gauging the absurd degree of pleasure on my face. "It does...," I say, as if genuinely sorry. "You know, maybe I could be pescetarian just for one day?" he smiles as I watch in horror while his greedy, assuming hand snatches up the last spring roll. Taking notice of my clenched fists, he snaps the roll in two, and returns the remaining half to the plate, laughing. A spring roll this excellent can really heighten your awareness of just how monotonous and lousy most other renditions can be. It almost ended a friendship today, after all. I am already grinning, and this is merely the first taste of what is to come. The quality of food is beyond surprising, given the restaurant's less-than-sparkly location on a rather barren strip of Metropolitan Avenue in Ridgewood. Partially named as a play-on-words with the Vietnamese vermicelli known as bún (pronounced boon), Bún-ker Vietnamese is also quite literally just that--a bunker. Next up--the 'Saigon Special Banh Mi'--a flaky baguette stuffed with 5-spiced pate made in house, steamed pork shoulder ground with cinnamon, sugar, and fish sauce, and garlic sausage--all garnished with pickled vegetables, mayo, cilantro, jalapeno, and a ribbon of sriracha.The 'Pho Ga' is an intense, rich, flavorsome chicken noodle soup with a smoked shallot broth with juicy Bo Bo chicken that develops over the course of eight hours. It's the kind of soup you believe can fix any problem, cure any illness...Even simple plates explode with flavors carefully coaxed in the kitchen. Tomato garlic fried rice is like a crispy mountain of stir-fried risotto and marinara. Creamed taro leaves taste like southeast Asian collard greens, with a hint of curry, ginger, and garlic (a Filipino dish inspired by Zapanta's heritage). Drinks are limited to a cooler where customers serve themselves water, or order an artichoke kefir iced tea, or Vietnamese black coffee. Next week they plan to introduce several homemade soft drinks including flavors like lime-ginger-mint, tamarind, or chili lychee. Until then, plan on cooling your palate with a bowl of coconut tapioca pudding, with tender miniature pearls studded with slivers of young coconut, pineapple, star fruit, and palm seeds. Simple food, masterfully executed, with no pretense.

The backyard will be a boon when the weather warms.While called a taqueria, this place is more of a classy sit-down sort of restaurant versus typical spartan Ridgewood and Bushwick Mexican joints. I love those places, so wasn't exactly sure what to expect. I suppose the main competitor nearby is Fajitas Sunrise.I'm not sure which region of Mexico the cuisine is based upon, but the dishes and ingredients are a bit different than your typical Pueblan taqueria; I had a burrito filled with roasted vegetables, for instance (It's rare to find a burrito on most menus in the area, period). It was tasty and seemed of high quality, as were the each of the 3 salsas that came with our chips. Strawberry-lemonade agua fresca, and homemade tres leches cake for dessert.Highly attentive and friendly service.We were the only ones there on a Saturday afternoon, but this place will surely do well in time.

I was checking out the other food stalls, and was really tempted to get a Thai iced tea at one of the stalls out front, but decided to wait till we saw what all the stalls had to offer and it's a good thing that we did. Tea n Milk is at the back of the market, but I'm sure you won't miss them! They have pretty ladies taking down your orders and handsome gentlemen brewing your milk tea behind them. I like the fact that they use actual tea bags and slices of fresh fruit and not some powder mix with artificial flavoring. Every cup is unique, freshly brewed and refreshing. I wish these guys were here at the beginning of the summer! I tried the black milk tea, while my friend got the apple green tea. Both were pretty good but I liked the apple green tea better, especially the slices of apples in the cup. Yum! At $4 for a medium and $5 for a large cup, you can't go wrong. Oh, and they'll add tapioca at no extra cost! Good job, Tea n Milk! I'll definitely be back next weekend. :)

(Or in your case, probably just "yes.")He'll then open the many compartments in his cart-- take a little scoop of this, a little squirt of that, a sprinkle of this, a splash of that... swirls everything around in his plastic jug, and out comes a completely addictive snack of puffed rice, chickpeas, chopped red onion, tomatoes, cilantro, green chilies, roasted soybeans, and other unidentifiable tasty mix-ins.Watching him make it is part of the fun... but wait til you eat it!

Refreshing and delicious.  Now, my food, that was another story. I order the salmon and it came out raw and cold in the middle, although I asked for it well done.  They took the salmon back and brought it out again, but it wasn't cooked completely to my liking. Some places prefer to cook salmon on the medium rare side.  Now, you may be asking, why the four stars? Because of the way they handled this.  I ordered two drinks and a friend of mine ordered a drink.  They not only comped my food but these 3 drinks.  Plus the manager came to apologize, which I very much appreciated.  The way they handled this was what will make me come back.  I thought this was the right thing to do and didn't leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.  In fact it will actually make me want to come back. And the drinks were rather tasty. =)

More like she took me, since she was the one who picked me up. I've wanted to come here ever since I heard that they had chicken & waffles (fried chicken forever). - Atomic Fire Balls - BEST THING on the menu. Fried mac & cheese balls with sriracha and ranch sauce. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I don't even like m&c but I couldn't get enough of this.  - Chicken & Waffles - he warned me that it would be spicy (tabasco glaze), and asked if I would be okay with it. How considerate. It wasn't spicy but was rather bland, and it wasn't what I expected -- the chicken was boneless... I like mine the traditional way, bones and all. - Eggs Mc'Ruffin - this was good. Came with tots! YAY TOTS. Basically bacon and cheese on English muffin, toasted. Cute place with eclectic décor. I'll definitely come back. CASH ONLY. (They have an atm here)

After dropping it off I got a phone call a few days later saying what needed to be done (confirming my suspicions) and I agreed to the terms. I was issued a reciept with my name, date, type of computer, etc. Then I never heard from them again. I found it odd that they never called me back to pick up my laptop. This happened the previous time I used them also. I always had to call them to see if my item was ready for me to pick it up. I can only guesstimate as to how long a fix will take. It could be two days or it could be two weeks. I don't know if they have to special order some part from Apple or whatever. Just wish they called me to tell me my item was fixed. Nevertheless their services are cheap, fast and reliable. Their customer service is on point and very friendly.

I don't own a car, I didn't have anyone to drive me and I sure as hell wasn't going to spend the moeny to take a cab. My only option was to troop it. Taking the E train to the Airtrain with all my luggage on a cold Monday morning. I was a little nervous of getting lost somehow or the commute taking to long but it was quite a breeze. You have to pay an extra $5.00 to take the Airtrain but it takes a Metrocard and they have machines right by the entrance. On my way back from vacation the airtrain didnt leave the airport for mantenaince reasons. It took me over 3 hours to get home because I didnt take a cab  and the shuttle bus services were awful. That experience just makes you realize how convenient it is to take the Airtrain and how dependent people are of it. The Airtrain (when running) is an absolute life saver if only because of the $40-45 I would save in my pocket.
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2013,6/13/2013,147,108,5,9,6>So very delighted to have found this place! Thank you God! Found this place via other yelp reviews and I definitely think this place is underhyped. Compared to its competitors, this place is cleaner, the interior decorations are way nicer, and the service (from my experiences) was impeccable. We went on a week night and there was plenty of seating whereas Sushi Village would have been packed with sucky service. We ordered AYCE sushi and started with the apps. I wasn't expecting too much since the other reviews said the apps weren't that great but I was thoroughly impressed! I forget what exactly we got but It was definitely the usual-miso soup, calamari, gyoza, etc. It was comparable or even better than Sushi villages'. The best part for me was the sushi. They go light on the rice and the fish tasted very fresh. The presentation itself was beautiful! The rolls were amazing-the eel, tuna, and salmon were all very fresh and delicious.This place doesn't strike me as an AYCE. It's more like a regular sushi place that one day decided to add AYCE on their menu. The rolls are the quality of a regular sushi place as opposed to an AYCE place where the quality if mediocre and where they pack on the rice like there's no tomorrow. This place is definitely a no brainer for me. I am a very happy customer and will be back again and again! :)

Browsed thru Yelp and this place was on my Bookmarks since FOREVER!.  Came to the restaurant on a Wednesday night (7:30 PM), Half empty, chinese waiters and they were quick in serving us.  Looked thru the Entire menu (Lot of selection).  My plus one and I decided to order Pechuga de pollo a la plancha con arroz, frijoles y maduros.... and shared the order since I looked around other tables and orders were HUGE Portions.  So I told the Waiter that we are sharing the order, the waiting time for the food was less than 10 minutes, while we waited they served us white bread and butter.  Food arrived and we Inhaled it within 10 minutes!. Chicken was tender, juicy, flavorful and it wasn't oily.  the size of the Chicken was 2 large flat piece of 6X6 inches, so that was a LOT!.The waiter was so nice enough to bring us double plates and extra maduros and rice ("if you need more let me know and i'll bring it to you").At the end, bill  came out under $ 15.00 and tipped them really well for a great friendly service.I don't really have to go all the way on Upper East or West side for a Spanish / Chinese food.**************************CASH ONLY***********************
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2013,6/10/2013,393,406,21,16,15>Fortune Cookie is the first and only Chinese food I have gotten in LIC (Mr. Wonton looks terrifying) but I am quite happy with it. I don't order Chinese a lot, but have probably eaten here 15-20 times in the last year.The standards are all good, and some of the more authentic dishes (sorry, General Tso) can also be great. I really like their chicken with cashews and the cold sesame noodles are always solid. Every time we order, they remember us and delivery is at the door within 20 minutes. Everything you could ask for in a Chinese delivery place.The first time we ordered from here and picked it up ourselves, the manager was doing 15 things at once, his shirt was disheveled and he was covered in duck sauce. He was hilarious and really friendly. A week later, I was at Citibank and saw him in a suit depositing a fortune. I am convinced he lives a double life, and have dubbed him lo mein Bruce Wayne.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/18/2013,6/9/2013,242,92,5,12,7>This location's Red Velvet slices are always a hit or miss. Unfortunately, most of the time it is a miss.Martha's is definitely one of the better bakeries in Queens, however, the quality of their products is extremely inconsistent. Most of the slices I have purchased this past year tasted like it had been sitting out for days. The easiest way to lose your customers' business is to sell old products; businesses that are guilty of this save money initially but harm their business severely in the long-run. On top of that, Martha's overprices almost all of their products. Although they have a golden refund policy, I just do not have the time to go back to the store after every trip. Sorry.
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2013,6/8/2013,149,276,10,11,12>Based on the name, one would think it's a hardware store or general supply store until you peer in and see it is a small dinette setting, a nice place for brunch. Not that you can't have lunch (I certainly have) or dinner. The first time I was here, I read all the reviews beforehand saying how good the bacon items are, so I find out which items have bacon but there is no bacon mac n cheese today, only mushroom mac n cheese. I didn't have time for the Bacon Brunch this day. I order the mushroom mac n cheese which comes with the rotisserie chicken. I also order a bacon brownie ($3.50 at the time of this writing). Pizza is only available on the weekends from about 10am-3pm as I am told, their menu changed so I would call ahead.The white cheese mixed in with the taste of mushrooms made for an awesome flavored mac n cheese, the cheese flavor was pronounced but not overwhelming with just the right touch of milky flavor. It was thick and chunky, 50% mushrooms and 50% mac, and without skimping on the cheese, over all very good. Again, the mac n cheese came accompanied with the rotisserie chicken but you can order it separately. The charred rotisserie chicken skin was flavorful with notes of lemon or lime and other spices but not spicy, it was very good, but only a little better than I do in my Ronco. The meat was soft but not juicy, if it were a little more done, I'd call it dry, it was right in the middle. What I liked was that tips of the bone, like the wing and tiny drumstick, were crisped out and I could crunch on a piece like a potato chip, that is an art. The bacon brownie was pretty darn good but nothing too special, it was a very good regular tasting brownie. The bacon part made sound like it was infused with bacon or something or bacon baked in it. No, it's just a topping of a few cut up slice of bacon. It only had one piece of bacon inside it. The bacon did enhance the brownie but nothing I would call a bacon brownie, please call it a brownie topped with bacon.With a friendly staff who answered the phone right away, at least when I called and helpful in person staff gets a plus in my book. You can't blame the place for being small. But if it gets busy it gets crowded because of the narrow aisle for ordering and the 10 or so limited seating. However, the decor is pretty to quaint.Yeah, the food is a little more expensive than average but the food is above average, so it's a fair balance. I'm still waiting until I have time to get to other bacon items like the pizza and brunch.Another time

<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2013,6/6/2013,427,354,7,11,10>I awaited my return to Cheap Shots and last weekend became a reality. A random Saturday night and we just wanna dance and not pay much to do so...((Enter Cheap Shots))5$ cover for ladies, which isn't expensive at all! We had our bags and IDs checked outside beside a nice little heat lamp by some friendly security gentlemen. That set the mood nicely. Security was friendly and thorough and I felt safe and assured no weapons were getting in the spot. Gotta love it. As you enter you pay your $5 at the little podium and get your hand x'd (in red indicating you paid..not 2 black ones saying your a baby) Then there is the sea of party people. All crowding the bar and standing around. No one dancing just yet. Mind you it's about 1:30am. BUT to their defense the DJ was playing some awful music.  Let me rephrase. Not awful but nothing anyone in here seemed interested in. It was some reggaeton/aventura/mariachi band business which are all great when you're looking to get your Flamenco and Bachata on but with only 1 table of about 3 little Latinas who were too busy texting to dance to their native shxt it was pretty much just noise...So on the the next genre Mr. DJ ! My friends sauntered over to the dj to request something a bit more fun to get the crowd going. Within minutes he had some dancehall chunes and the crowd was in full swing. Gyal a bend over and all that great reggae dancehall dancing ! Now the party had started and it was safe to say it did tun up fi true!The drinks were decent. I was driving so Designated B only had a sip of my friends Long Island($4 ladies night!) maybe a hour or so after she ordered it so the ice was all melted, the glass was sweaty, and pretty much not the best time to judge. I'm assuming it was pretty good when she ordered it though...and cheap!The music kept up pretty well with more dancehall, hip hop, and some throwback &B. I'm talking real slow jams. Butter Love and Bump and Grind type stuff.After a while my friends and I were invited to a game of pool, which soounded like fun. BUT the one pool table in the spot was occupied. To stay busy while we waited we played free basketball. (is it always free?! That is awesome if so!) Not a single quarter was placed in that machine and I stayed there for maybe 40 minutes to an hour putting up shots. (Young MJ in the building!) They also have a punching thing game. You know the one I mean. You punch it to see how strong you are yada yada. Free as well I believe.As the night (morning rather) came to a close the security nicely strolled around and told everyone they had to get their stuff and go. They were nice enough and didn't get angry when we continued to linger.Overall a decent time. With the games added it throws some variety to your typical night out at the bar. Is this my first choice of spots to go to? Eh... top 5 because its super close, cheap, and since I go to St. John's I'm sure to see some familiar faces. Of course this is strictly a last minute-can-we-get-a-drink-I-just-wanna-dance-on-­the-cheap night spot.Glad I returned.
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2012,6/2/2012,11,103,3,4,3>Our meal at Trattoria L'incontro was, in a word, perfect. The service is friendly and professional. The talkative waiters wil fluently rattle off a list of specials that is longer than the menu itself. Warm focaccia is served with an addictive sun-dried tomato spread. We were already in a good mood. We ordered a crisp, fresh salad with pomegranate seeds, a perfect starter. I enjoyed Trattoria L'Incontro's signature ravioli in a flavorful, well-balanced sauce.  Save room for dessert. The semifreddo is to die for. Does that meal sound perfect, or what?
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/20/2012,6/1/2012,149,276,2,6,3>There are sweeter and more mind pleasing sensations better than biting into a donut made of chocolate dough and then dipped in a chocolate syrup to create an outer shell that is slightly hinting on a side that is a chocolate-crisp yet buttery-smooth and soft before chewing on the inner dough that is moist and melts away along with the outer shell. But when I do bite into those double chocolate made confections, those other sweeter and more pleasing sensations come in second. Entenmann's version is pretty good for a packaged product. I normally see and buy them at my local supermarket for $4-$5 a box, at best they might have it on sale for $2.50-At this Entenmann's Outlet you can get those donuts for $2.00 a box or 3 boxes for $5.00. -They also have $5 for 5 boxes of their pound cake.-Thomas English Muffins for $3 for 3 or I believe it's $1.25 each, it's still a bargain compared to supermarkets.-There are other assortments like muffins and other cakes, as well as soda, milk, coffee, cookies, nuts, candies and chips. Powerade, Doritos and other name brand goods for sale also.When you enter you can see that the design of the place is styled to bring out a Entenmann's brand feel from their white and navy blue colored checkered floor that matches all those boxes. The place is bright. The store is small but has a variety of treats and in limited quantities at times because at such a good price they go off the shelves quickly, hurry go!Four stars for being such a bargain, being clean/bright, as fresh as can be and satisfying a simple need in it's category with such a small store.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/20/2012,5/31/2012,65,147,4,10,4>I could not wait to come home from here this evening and write this review. Our cat, Toby was feeling very ill over the last couple of days. I don't want to go into too much detail, but it was all GI related stuff and he was lethargic and just completely out of sorts. By Friday afternoon, seeing as Toby was still looking and feeling quite ill - It was time to get him to the Vet. I have to say, I am both extremely critical and respectful of Veterinarians - my mother is a practicing Veterinarian and I know how demanding and intense this job can be. Since my mom practices out in Jersey, we had to find an option closer to home in Astoria. I had been recommended this place by my good friend and was floored by the amazing yelp reviews.The hours here are great - 8am to 9pm. Perfect for those who work late. And they have emergency and walk-ins! It was perfect for a first time client. While in the waiting room, I was greeted by the entire village of Astoria! Everyone here seemed to be locals and really caring pet-owners. Everyone was chatting up a storm, and Toby was more than pleased with the throngs of kids wanting to pet him!After an hour (hey we didn't have an appointment, it was nice they could even fit us in) we saw Dr. Smith. She was amazing! I knew I could trust her immediately because she graduated from Ohio State's Vet school - same as my mom - and my own alma mater. She was wonderful and ruled things out right away and immediately gave Toby the proper treatment. She told us to get dinner, come back in 1.5hours and he'd be fine!When we picked him up, he was all better and healthy! Again, GI problem - it was a quick fix - don't want to go into details. The prices for these fantastic services was more than reasonable. I am so grateful for Dr. Smith's warmth and kindness and complete help to us in this matter. Will definitely be back again...just hopefully not too soon!
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2011,5/29/2012,238,433,7,9,8>When El Shater left 43rd and 43rd, the loss of great tasting, homemade Middle Eastern food was downright depressing. The opening of Habibi (yelp.com/biz/habibi-sunn) really helped with the recovery. But while one of the brothers that ran El-Shater opened up Habibi, the original has returned! The founder of the original El Shater has returned to open Souk El Shater this weekend. While the initial attempt to move El Shater to Astoria fell through, I am sure the Sunnyside community will welcome him back with open arms.While the space is slightly smaller and the inventory of packaged goods are much smaller, the gyro machine and window display with all the homemade staples (hummus, falafel, spinach/meat pies, baba ghanouj, and grape leaves) and sweets (Baklava and Kounafa) are there. The falafel, beef/chicken Shawarma, and Kafta sandwiches are still reasonably priced at $3.50, and the platters (which come with salad and rice/french fries) are a bit pricier at $9. Special combo platters (3 skewers, chicken cutlet, or beef steak) are $10 each. While the platter prices are a bit on the higher side, most items are priced exactly the same as Habibi. It is quite exciting to now have TWO options for homemade Lebanese food, and both are within a block of each other. Short-term pain for long-term gain.Welcome back El Shater!

But I think it should be translated to.. *a meal that the guests will NEVER forget*.  =D

The sweet, but very slow and cumbersome grandmas. $6 for a box of cereal. Old bruised apples. Dirty floors.But no more! Because when I moved to Queens, lo and behold is a supermarket I looooove! First and foremost, I gotta have me some fresh produce. From collard greens to tomatoes to pears to poblanos to cactus fruit - its all fresh. Its beautiful raw food in amazing variety and glory. And its not nearly as expensive as some neighboring stores. This alone is enough to keep me coming here.Second is the international products. Soy sauce, arborio rice, lentils, gnocchi, mai fun, pureed tropical fruits, beans, pesto - you name it. It may take a little hunting - but they almost always have it. (I'd love them to switch their tofu brands though!)Third, meats and cheeses have a great selection and value. I buy tons of meat in bulk and i love trying new things from the dairy section.The seafood section is small but will most likely have what you need. There is also a deli and olive bar and a spot for baked goods. Frozen foods has your basics. And the store is all logically laid out and clean.The manager (in a suit and usually right in front of the tomato display) is super nice, helpful, and fast! I love that he's always on the job and keeps this place humming.
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/31/2011,5/26/2012,142,211,3,11,13>Going to Cafe Arzu is somewhat of an adventure. An authentic trip to a Soviet outpost restaurant. The place itself is located in a nondescript location off of Queens Blvd (a boulevard so large and inhuman that you could almost convince yourself that you were back in the USSR). The restaurant has no letter grade. The place serves no liquor (although BYOV aka bring-your-own-vodka is encouraged). The menu is in Russian and in English, and in many instances, the Russian version has more items on it than the English. Service appears to be unfriendly (although this is not true) due to furrowed brows, and you'll find few English-speakers there. Most items on the menu can be customized. Other items are requested by special order only (phone a day in advance). Yet other items are listed on the menu but not available. Ration shortages or something. JK. So authentic. To most, these minor snafus could be turn-offs; but to me, I love it.My meal there was great. Thankfully we got a friendly English-speaking waitress (from Tajikistan!) who gave us her recommendations and happily supplied us with dainty little tea cups into which was poured our BYO vodka. Na zdorovye! Then came in the Bukharian / Uzbek / Russian melange of half-portion salads: tomato and cucumber, spiked with tons of till; and a garlicky Korean carrot salad. Standard items, albeit super tasty, and best paired with Cafe Arzu's freshly baked lepyoshka or Uzbek bread with sesame seeds. Uighur laghman is a Central Asian stand-by and is done particularly well (maybe even better than Cafe Kashkar in Brooklyn) with springy noodles, a spicy broth and vegetables galore. Lamb kebabs, lamb ribs and chicken kebabs are all stellar meat choices, served with mild and crisp vinegary onions.  I'm in heaven until the waitress brings a plate of little fried pelmeni, which is a rare preparation of the ubiquitous Russian dumpling.Once you are into the midst of your meal, you will notice that the place is hopping, with families, groups of young couples and friends, most of whom speaking Russian, most of whom are laughing and taking more and more shots of vodka. I love the atmosphere, and may just have a major crush on Cafe Arzu.
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2011,5/25/2012,361,716,18,20,15>Along the vein of "it takes a village to raise a child," sometimes it takes everyone in a store to order food for a gringo. Tienda Guatemalteca is truly an undiscovered gem. It has all the characteristics that yelping foodies like: 1) authentic ethnic food, 2) no one speaks English, 3) no one else who is not have that ethnicity is around, 4) really good food and 5) incredibly inexpensive.When I walked inside, the eyes of the lady working behind the counter got really big and round and everyone stopped eating and stared at me. I think they thought I was lost and wanted directions. When I tried to order food, my goodness, the excitement! No one spoke English well, so the few people who were around tried to help me with their broken English. With their help and my little knowledge of Spanish (thank goodness I grew up in LA) I managed to order some food.Tienda Guatemalteca is a little bodega that has a little hot bar at the back that serves delicious Guatemalan food. Nothing fancy. Just down home cooking that you would expect from a little Guatemalan mother or grandmother slaving away at the stove top.Let me tell you how cheap this place is. A tamale, a plate with rice, black beans, and a short rib stew AND a Guatamalan popsicle came out to $6.75. I don't know how much each of the components cost because quite frankly ordering was such an ordeal that I couldn't bear to try to have another conversation with them. Don't get me wrong, they're really sweet people, but the communication barrier was really painful.Me: Uno tamale por favor.Him: Tamale. That's it?Me: Arroz, frijoles --Him: No rice. No rice in tamale. No beans in tamale. Only chicken.Me: Yes. Uno tamale AND arroz, frijoles --Him: NO RICE! ONLY CHICKEN!This continues ad naseum until one of the customers with slightly better English figured out that the little Asian girl wanted more food and not a different kind of tamale.The Guatemalan tamale is a wet tamale cooked in plantain leaves and boiled (Mexican tamales are cooked in corn husks and steamed). It's not a style that I particularly like because it's too wet more me. The masa is too mushy and falls apart. The plate of fluffy rice, black beans, and short rib stew was amazing. Really good. The short rib was succulent and tender from the long slow cooking process. I loved the big pieces of long beans and carrots. The carrots added a nice sweetness to the stew. A tad too salty, but terrific stick to your ribs comfort food. And considering how cheap it is (they gave me two large pieces of short ribs), I think it's cheaper to eat here than to cook! Especially since I was able to stretch this out to two meals.Yelpers, you guys need to get here because this is about as real as it gets. And for dessert, I had a Guatemalan paleta! Because it was a warm day, I chose to have watermelon because I wanted something refreshing. It was fresh, sweet, crisp and utterly delectable! It really tasted like a frozen watermelon. I could tell it was made from real fruit because I found little seeds in my paleta, which just added to the charm of this delightful popsicle.Fantastic food, incredible prices, and another popsicle for the popsicle throwdown!

I was all "Hell yeah!" and from that point on, things got fuzzy.I do recall there being some whiskey shots being sent over to my friend and I, and I know I enjoyed my martini because there was another round of them after the first. I am pretty sure I made out with an Irish guy at the bar. I'm also pretty sure he keeps texting me, though I have no recollection of giving him my number.It has a nice neighborhood feel, and the patrons here tend to be less sketchy than the ones who frequent Break Bar across the street. I remember there being a large contingency of Irish folk here, including the bartender and several customers, and the bartender seemed to know everyone-probably a lot of regulars here. I don't know if I can show my face here again after the night I had, but I like this place and it's pretty cheap, so I might just have to come back.
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/28/2012,11/23/2012,158,189,8,10,7>Either my fellow Yelpers were wrong or Namaste was quick to fix the issues gathered from the feedback from weeks past and made adjustments. I say this because on my visit to Namaste last night I was presented with an enjoyable meal and experience.  I was very nervous about eating here after I read the past reviews and almost cancelled my reservation. I am glad that I stuck with my gut feeling on this one. I came here with the GF and we were greeted warmly and seated promptly. Our initial waiter (I'll get to that "initial" part later) was very pleasant and friendly. I told him about using the Yelp check in offer (25% off) when we got in and he said no problem we'll take care of that at the end. His demeanor never changed once we mentioned that. He brought us some Papad (Indian cracker) with some Chutney and Tamarind to start us off with. The sauces has nice spice to them and you could tell that they were made fresh and the pepad was nice and crisp.  I got a Taj beer (they were out of King Fisher, but I honestly liked the Taj better) and our waiter let us take in the vast menu. He took our appetizer order of Vegetable samosas and Pattharka Gosht  (sliced lamb) and said he would come back for the mains as we wanted our apps to come out first. A few minutes later they came out and I was happy. The samosas were piping hot, crispy and flaky. The flavors were nice although I felt like it needed a sauce. It probably does not come that way, that's just my opinion. The Pattharka Gosht  (say that 3 times fast) was wonderful. The lamb was so freaking tender I was able to easily cut it with a butter knife and the spices were nice. Not too overpowering but you knew they were there. While we were eating our apps I noticed that our waiter was no where to be found. I then noticed a waitress (I think her name was Swati, forgive me if I misspelled it) going from table to table. She was all by herself but she swung by our table and took our main course order and again a few minutes later out came our Garlic Naan, Shrimp Saag and Lamb Vindaloo. Oh and our FREE rice.  At about that time we saw our waiter again and he brought me out another beer.The Garlic Naan was great, nice and puffy and you could smell the garlic wafting (yes I said wafting) off of it.  The Shrimp Saag was also good. I do not usually get that but my GF does and she said it was really good. (she ordered it medium and there was just a little heat to it, perfect for her). My Lamb Vindaloo was great. nice chunks of lamb and potato and the spice was right on. I asked for it spicy and the sweat beading down my forehead let me know it was just that.   The rice that came out with it was also good. Cooked nicely with great fragrant spices. Again while eating our main course I noticed the waiter was MIA, but our waitress came by to make sure everything was good. The manager also came by to ask the same.  Later on I found out why he had been disappearing. Turns out they had two people call in sick and he was doing local deliveries.  We did have a slight wait in between courses but Swati made sure we were well taken care of. Really in the end it was no big deal.  The whole staff was really great and made up for any breaks in service.In the spirit of full disclosure I will admit I do not eat Indian food a lot but I happen to be a professional Fat Kid and I know what good food tastes like.  This was good and the portion sizes were adequate. we got 2 apps, an order of naan and 2 mains and I have enough left over for the two of us to eat a meal again. Like I said earlier Namaste must have made some changes based on the feedback they got because our experience was enjoyable and I thought the food was good. For that and the fact that they kept the service running relatively smoothly despite being short staffed, I will be back.   Now if you'll excuse me i have some good Indian leftovers to devour!
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2012,11/22/2012,289,416,11,13,14>Due to the fact that every guitarist wants to have Dunlop's Cry Baby Wah Wah Pedal, I set out to check Guitar Center after realizing that Amazon cannot timely deliver this item.  I kept away from Guitar Center because it was right beside Chuckie Cheese and I'm convinced that a life spent without walking into a Chuckie Cheese is a life well-lived.  ~_-As I walked in the store I realized that it is not only a Guitar Center but that it  was also filled with other musical instruments like drums and keyboards,  as well. I can spend hours in here and ignore the thought that Chuckie Cheese is next door. Service was efficient and quick.  I had called earlier and the guy assured me they carried the Wah Wah in stock.  As I walked over to the counter and told them what I needed, they got it for me and I paid for it, all in less than three (3) minutes. It probably helped that there were not a lot of people in the store as it was a weekday.  So now I can play ala-Jimi Hendrix.  Or not.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2012,11/21/2012,1007,752,12,18,15>Bangin!! Straight up Bangin!Villa Brazil is literally just around the corner from my friend's house. The food is amazing for it's price! If you enjoyed eating at Green Field Churrascaria or Master Grill back in the day, you are definitely gonna love this spot! The layout is kinda like a buffet/salad bar. They have several dishes to choose from in those 2 sections but where you really wanna go is to their kitchen window where the meats are. Right next to the window is where they grill up their goodies. The grilled meats they have are just to die for. They have mouth watering hanger steaks, ribs, chicken hearts, and more. Just ask the guy what you want or if you don't know what you want, just have him show you what he has available and you can sample a piece to see whether if you like it or not.They charge by the weight of your platter so don't fill yours up with the cheap stuff. First I added a thin layer of rice, skipped everything else and went straight to the kitchen window for the meats. I got beautifully sliced steaks, a giant piece of rib, and a whole bunch of chicken hearts. To top things off, I added a few pieces of yucca because it's light and delicious. With the amount of meat I got, it came out to only $12 and change!! My friend's platter was almost double of what I had and his was only $17 and that's because he loaded up on rice and yucca.Beverages - They got some Made in Brazil Guarana soda (pretty delicious, $2), about 3 different beers, and some American sodas like Coke, Ginger Ale, etc.Verdict - Simply amazing. If you want desserts, they have plenty of sweet stuff by the register too. I'm definitely coming back here again soon for their hanger steaks. Perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. I haven't had such a great meal for such low price in quite some time. The yuccas here are nice and crispy, the rice is okay, just go for the meats! It won't disappoint! You're gonna eat like a champ over here!Tip - According to my friend, don't go on Wednesdays because the man behind the grill is off. Some other guy works that day and he doesn't man the grill as well as the other dude.
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2012,11/20/2012,545,1338,15,14,15>Stand up straight.Don't slouch.Never compromise on your height.Posture is key when you're holding a bow and arrow in position. Add to that string tension and focus and you've got yourself the makings of a bullseye.Leave it to major motion pictures to popularize archery. Some would argue it was Robin Hood. My sister would say it was Legolas. The squealing tweens would cry Hunger Games. I won't say which brought us to Queens Archery but we arrived with Living Social in hand, a car ride, and a braid in our hair.The experience was exhilarating and similar to the shooting range but with less danger. The introductory instruction period was thorough and micromanaging but I guess it was key because it all worked. You will leave wanting to shoot more. You may be a little bit bruised and banged up. You might even be sore but it's all part of the experience. Follow directions and your arms will be just fine. I loved all the deer on the wall and the feel of shooting an arrow on to target. Just call me Katniss.
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2012,11/19/2012,406,1092,4,7,5>Sunnyside isn't exactly the place to go for good places to eat, but after Salt & Fat, I was a believer of the neighborhood. Molly Blooms were one of those places that have been on my radar for a while, and going there for brunch was the perfect opportunity to check it out.When you walk into Molly Blooms, it sort of feels like you're walking into someone's home that has converted their first floor into a full-fledged bar. The bar is located on the left side with a couple tables in front and along the right-side. Just beyond that, are the bathrooms and a tiny tiny kitchen that 2-3 chefs operate. Seating is very sparse inside, so the outdoor backyard area is opened with a dozen or so wooden tables. From here, you can really take note that this place was once someone's home, as you can see that the 2nd and 3rd floors to the building are someone's living quarters still. The outdoor dining area is quite nice and serene, taking you away from the Queens Blvd. traffic. There is a retractable awning to cover you from the sun's rays and any other elements. However, one thing that we found somewhat annoying were the many caterpillars crawling on the tables, flowerpots and benches and flies flying every which way. It somewhat put myself in a state of paranoia making sure that no caterpillars would drop in my cup of coffee from the tree above.I ordered the Fish & Chips ($14.50). Yes, prices did go up as from prior Yelp reviews, and their website's menu that is still priced to this day, at $12.00. Their famous burger is now $9.95 as well, as opposed to the much more popular $7 price tag. My entree included two medium-sized pieces of battered cod, with a perfectly flaky and moist inside and a crispy and not too greasy exterior. Half a lemon was provided to add some acidity to the fish. The side of addicting tartar sauce was well-balanced with creaminess and texture that gave the fish some extra oomph. The side of hand cut steak-like fries were good. The fries were extra crispy on the outside and soft inside. It wasn't the most filling, but a tolerable portion so that you won't feel overstuffed. I guess this entree errs more on the side of excellent quality rather than quantity.I also tried Joyce's Parisian Ham & Gruyere Sandwich ($9.95) sitting in between brown multigrain bread, and slathered with dijon mustard and 4 small French Cornichons, which are small pickled gherkins, served on toothpicks. Served on the side is a choice of fries: Original, Sweet Potato, or Curly. I really enjoyed this sandwich, the bread was crispy, the ham was salty, and the gruyere was melted to a gooey consistency. The dijon mustard was just enough to be noticeable yet not overpowering. It was a very enjoyable sandwich, and is the perfect choice for those grilled cheese fanatics looking for a little twist. The curly fries were extra crispy, which I totally enjoyed in my ketchup, mayo, and pepper concoction. Yum!Service was superb here as our waitress constantly and consistently came to check up on us every 10 minutes. Coffee ($1.50) and drink refills came in a heart's beat without a moment to waste. The attentiveness was definitely there as she came by asking if we needed any additional condiments like mayo or mustard, and she also noticed that the sun was beating down on me and asked if I would like the shade to be deployed.We both enjoyed our food at Molly's, though I did feel like prices were ever so slightly steep for the Sunnyside area. However, there drinks are fairly cheap. I did forget to mention that during brunch, they have $4 mimosa, bloody mary specials. And their everyday draft beers range from $4.50 to - $6.00 which ain't too shabby. That alone, makes Molly Blooms a worthy place to check out.
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2012,11/18/2012,226,636,4,7,8>I'm not a huge fan of bubble tea, my gf put me onto it a few years back when she use to work close to Chinatown and there was a bubble tea joint at every corner. A few jobs later and a move to Astoria and it's been a long time since either of us had some bubble tea. Since we're a 15 second walk from Tapioca Story, we HAD to see if there bubble tea stacked up. We made our first visit on a scorcher of day this summer. Let's start of with the positives; fast friendly service, a free taste of their homemade ice cream and most importantly; our bubble tea's were top notch and definitely comparable to the ones we use to grab in Chinatown. I went with a french vanilla while the lady had oen of the fruit based tea's and we were both pleasantly surprised at the quality of the teas! However, they had no AC, what looked like dining room chairs from someones living room and a odd assortment of baked goods. I'm sure they'll get there act together and be an awesome addition to the ever growing 30th Avenue foodie scene, but I'll give that last star once everything is clickin' in here. Plan on taking their delicious teas to go!
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/12/2012,11/17/2012,509,142,5,5,5>Spicy spicy spicy!!! Just the way I like it.If you can't tolerate SUPER spicy food, this place is not for you. I was here last night having dinner for a friends birthday and it was delicious. We ordered 10 different dishes. I highly recommend that you give each of their cold platters a try. They are all very yummy. My favorite is their spicy fish head!!! It is the bomb!!! My only complaint is their service is very crappy. The staff is not attentive and forgets to bring you some of the dishes you ordered. If u want something, you have to call out to them. Otherwise, they won't come to u to clean your table or ask u if u need anything else. Tip: Make sure you order their can herbal tea or soda bc water is NOT going to help tone down the spicy taste is your mouth.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2012,11/16/2012,593,1089,17,16,12>go deep! go falafel balls-deep! do it for science, hunger, and of course, for Yelp!I've only recently begun to explore the Fresh Meadows area (my new dentist is there), and while it's not the most accessible neighborhood, it's worth the trek (for those without cars - there's a ton of buses that stop along Union Turnpike).start by picking falafel, grilled chicken, and chicken or lamb shawarma; then, whether you want it in pita, laffa, a platter, or on a salad. customize with your choice of sides and veggies, ranging from crisp peppers to grilled onions, babaganoush and hummus to rice and french fries.of course I chose the platter - you know how us Yelp Fat FUCs work! 8 bucks translated to several falafel balls, chickpeas, red cabbage, hummus, babaganoush, pita, and tahini sauce (chickpea overload mode!). the falafel was crunchy, flavorful, and best of all FRESH TA DEF. the vegetables were solid; that red cabbage was great . the hummus was smooth and creamy, and the babaganoush had a little kick to it.it's tiny shop with a few seats that gets pretty busy around dinner time, but the guys behind the counter work fast. besides the usual drinks they also have Israeli juices and soda.with an excellent customizable, delicious and inexpensive menu, Sizzle Falafel and Shawarma is certainly a hidden gem here in the farther reaches of Q-boro!
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2012,11/15/2012,225,493,6,7,7>This is a great place to ensure you get a pleasant burger experience.  The setting is very relaxed and the waitstaff uses smart phones to take orders.For the beef patty we opted for the classic served with dill pickle relish, apple smoked onions and ketchup.  It was good, but turned out not to be our favorite.  That award goes to the bison burger that we got  maple bacon style which was served with sharp cheddar, blackened maple bacon, lettuce, tomato, raw red onion and mayo.  This was a really great burger, so flavorful.The rings and fries combo comes with 4 dipping sauces, the spicy chipolte mayo and the Bareburger special sauce were my favorites.  The fries were tender, but not overly crispy.  The onion rings were great , super crispy and they were awesome with the dipping sauces.Maybe next time I'll be a bit more adventurous and try something like elk.

<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2013,2/12/2014,364,373,5,14,12>New World Mall Food Court is one crazy place with activity. I was overwhelmed by the scores of people eating, waiting on line, checking out the scene which made for a wonderful Sunday afternoon. New World Mall Food Court is definitely a destination place for any New Yorker, as well as visitors to our great city.Now, I have always been a food court fan, but I had no idea what I was getting into. The place is full of delicious stands of Korean, Japanese, Chinese and ever style of Asian cooking. This American/Greek/Latin boy was out of his comfort zone. The wife and I bookmark a couple of places, but as we walked by the stands around the perimeter, I wanted one of everything. Yum. I would recommend newbies like me to order a bubble tea or any other delicious drink available and sit. Then, observe and enjoy the scene. Check out all the good food being enjoyed and a few of the stands. After a few minutes of this, make a selection by only ordering one dish at a time. This way you can enjoy as many dishes as possible from the different stands.Overall, New World Mall Food Court is a HOME RUN. I tried Tea Twitter, Mojoilla Fresh and Lanzhou Handmade Noodle all good and I will review individually. I highly recommend New World Mall Food Court. Enjoy..........

<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2013,2/10/2014,103,107,6,9,8>I've been to Linn on many an occasion and it truly is something special. If you want authentic traditional Japanese fair, this is it. As far as what I like here, and what I recommend there is a bunch of stuff. To start, I like the onigiri, which is a traditional Japanese snack. Basically a rice ball, rice with your choice of fish in the middle, and a seaweed square. I typically go with the cod. I like this because you don't really see it many places, unless you get one from sunrise mart, and then its prepackaged.  I also like the pork belly here, its excellent, presented in broth, its falls apart when you eat it. Really the fatty parts of the pork belly comes out amazing, the broth no doubt aids the amazing flavors. Umami.As a main dish I really like the sushi of course and select rolls. My two favorite out of the ones I've sampled are the spicy scallion roll and the soft shell crab roll which I ordered last time. Both very unique and savory. Linn has a relaxed vibe and cool ambiance, I like the projector that shows old seventies clips and nature programming on the front wall. If you go on Saturdays they often have a Jazz duo which is cool as well. The Katsudon is good, but I would just throw out there that the pork cutlet is thicker then I was used to. I've only had katsudon a handful of times on my visits to Japan, but typically the cutlet was thinner. Of course, when I got it in Tokyo it  had a more fast food type quality, and this is more upscale, but I do prefer the cutlet to be sliced thinner. So just a heads up on that. Other than that drop in solo if you want and sit at the bar area near the chef. Oh, and grab a sake while your at it.
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2013,2/9/2014,188,156,4,11,8>What cute discovery in queens! The space in here is calm, relaxed and they play awesomely soothing music! I like!Unlike Starbucks, you can actually get a nice comfy spot to enjoy your overly expensive, foamy coffee-like drink.Honestly, I would give this coffee shop 5 stars if their prices were more reasonable! A small of almost any coffee drink ranges from $4.25 to almost $6, those are just ridiculous prices anywhere. Who agrees?The only thing you can scrape away with getting under $4 is a tea of lemonade.I didn't try any desserts but a friend and I picked up refreshing mango lemonades that were delicious and had the perfect amount of sweetness. I recommend coming here with a friend to catch up or even grab a drink and do some work. I could see myself getting so much work done with the calm atmosphere in this place. They have wifi access for costumers, all you need to do is ask for the password.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2013,2/8/2014,597,627,15,20,16>I've been to Arepa Lady a good handful of times, at least 4 or 5. I didn't know she had a Yelp check-in. I feel as if street carts don't get the same amount of respect, especially one out in Queens in a non-hipster neighborhood like Jackson Heights - much less when she's located by a major Queens train-hub (74th and Roosevelt) and in a location next to several other trucks all pretty much serving any variation of Colombian, Ecuadorian or Mexican sweet and savory treats.When commuting here in the morning (or at night) the smells that waft and linger through the air are enough to make even some string-out, emaciated model waif want to scarf down everything in sight. This brings me back to Arepa Lady...a name she more than likely wouldn't respond to as Spanish is her main language...Spanish and the language of delicious food making. I don't even like Arepas that much...or I didn't until I moved to Jackson Heights and met Roosevelt's very own Arepa angel. Thank goodness that I don't spend much time in this neighborhood or I'd look like a cow. A happy cheesey filled cow :).Gonna stop here and define what an arepa IS for those of you not in the know: An arepa is a flatbread made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. They usually contain cheese, vegetables or meats - but essentially you can put whatever you like in this amazing pickets of joy. I personally prefer the flour kind - but tradition calls for corn dough - both are delicious and not high on the nutritional or diet scale, but high on flavor and on my guilty pleasure list :).Arepa Lady makes two different types of arepas, cheese and chorizo (which is Colombian sausage and freakin' DELICIOUS). She also sells chuzoz which are like a shish-kebab only more delish cuz they have more meat...most of the time I mean who DOESN'T like meat on a stick? Vegetarians, that's who - but no worries! You can have amazingly gooey, buttery, cheese-filled arepas with crumbled tart cheese on top! Vegans not apply, you won't be happy here. Tis' what it tis'. Arepa Lady can't make everyone happy.Cheap, delicious, well-made and authentic Latin treats. That's what you can expect from Arepa Lady. Cinco estrellas!!! ***** (5 stars).
<review# 246,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/24/2013,2/7/2014,198,785,8,12,13>This is going to be a special restaurant for me from now on, as my fiancee took me here yesterday to propose to me. Everything about our dinner was special, even pre-proposal. I had the minestrone to start, which was delicious. Very deep soup which was perfect for the cold weather. For my main course, I had pappardelle noodles cooked in olive oil with garlic and eggplant. SO delicious, I had to stop myself from eating every last bite. The waiter was so considerate and made sure there was no meat broth or anything in my food. Dessert was obviously the most special, as that's when Adam proposed. The whole restaurant was clapping, as I was sobbing while reading "Will you marry me?" from a plate of chocolate souffle. I said yes, and had the world's best chocolate souffle. Thank you to Piccola for a memory that'll last a lifetime.

So I drove up and down main street and this seemed to be the only one in the area. It's the only one. Seriously. The only one in the area.I walked in---it was a bit outdated in appearance, but after eating a plain slice and a grandma slice, I was sold. But as I sat there and ate my pizza, I watched this serious looking old man sitting at one of the tables doing business..."Is this guy a former mobster? Mobster still? He definitely looks Italian to me." Just kidding. What do I know? Seriously. Don't want no rumors to go around. He was probably the owner. Phil?This place has good pizza -- definitely try their grandma slice. It was so good!
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2013,2/5/2014,316,388,7,12,9>Loved this place! Can't believe it took me so long to find it. As you ascend the levels of this museum, it just gets better and better. Movie props and costumes, make-up pieces, wigs, various movie-themed memorabilia, technical exhibits, old arcade games and so much more. I don't want to list all the movie props because it will ruin the excitement of the surprise but I feel like there's something for everyone here.Kid-friendly - video games to play and a lot of interactive exhibits, particularly on the top floor. Not a huge collection (which I actually appreciate due to my low museum stamina). You'll see everything in one visit. Free Fridays, 4-8pm. There is a donation box so I'd suggest giving something to help out!
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/17/2013,2/4/2014,156,170,13,16,14>Buttermilk fried chicken!! Yes, it's good! I'm a skeptic when it comes to reviews on fried chicken shops, it can get easily over hyped. Like Slyvia's in Harlem or Pies and Thighs in Williamsburg or Soco in Clinton Hill, the fried chicken is good but NOT significantly better than Popeyes. (Yes, Popeyes is my barometer of comparison) Mister Chicken blew away my expectations! Just recently hit up Dirty Bird To Go in the Battery park area, and was quickly disappointed. The menu is similar to Mister Chicken, but def not as good.The buttermilk fried chicken had a great crispy skin and moist inside. The buttermilk batter really is good! We ordered a bunch of sides as well. The Kale was surprisingly tasty (for Kale), Mac and cheese was good, the mashed potatoes was just ok (but I'm not really a fan of mashed p), what I think we should have ordered was the roasted potatoes! The guys inside working the joint were pretty awesome guys as well! Super nice! As we sat in one of the small tables, since we ordered so much food (8 piece with 4 side- wife was pregnant and indecisive:) I dropped my plate with a piece of chicken and sides on the floor. The guys were super kind enough to clean it up and offer a new piece of chicken and a new side (rice)! We ordered 8 and told them we wanted to take 4 to go, they made the 4 to go fresh right before we paid the check! These guys know quality and service! So happy I'm back in Queens! Place is small only 3 tables to fit about 6 people. And like other reviews say the chicken is fed organic whatever and is supposedly better than other chickens.
<review# 250,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2013,2/3/2014,318,55,8,9,8>Welcome to Elmhurst Wafel & Dinges ! What a great addition and change of scenery for those of us used to seeing the bazillion halal food trucks in this area. I normally see this food truck in the city but on Mondays they are parked right in front of the Queens Shopping Center on Queens Blvd. For those of you that never had Wafel & Dinges, it is fairly simple to order and not overly expensive either. First pick the type of wafel that you want and then pick the toppings to go with it. I normally go for the Brussels and the WMD for dinges (topping). The Wafel is only 5 bucks and the WMD gets you unlimited toppings for 2 dollars ! They have a good selection of dinges but  my favorites are banana, strawberry, nutella, walnuts, whip cream and speculoos spread! The lines may get long but these guys are quick and the wait is definitely worth it. For those of you that don't want to wait or can't wait because you are dying of hunger, there's always the halal truck down the block..and around the corner...and ...
<review# 251,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2012,4/14/2013,212,116,7,8,7>How have I never reviewed this place?? I eat here, or order from them, on average of at least once a week. The chicken salad w/ goat cheese and jalapenos and a whole lot of yum is my go to meal when I want to know exactly what to expect and feel completely satisfied. Had the lobster bisque once and now look for it on their daily special menu board. The portions are huge and their prices are reasonable. On sunny days, it should be mandatory to sit outside and people watch and just enjoy the -for the most part- friendly and attentive service. I bring my dog with me on those kinds of days and they always accommodate us with some water for her. On not-so-nice days, their indoor decor is very artsy and cozy. Almost an entirely different experience, but equally as enjoyable. After writing this I do believe it's where I shall be lunching today.
<review# 252,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2013,4/13/2013,262,613,9,8,8>I already knew that Jackson Heights was a hub of diverse eateries. I'd sampled Ecuadoran, over indulged buffet-style at Jackson Diner and knew all about the Arepas Lady.What I didn't expect during a casual walk along 37th Avenue was an encounter with a fully functional Polish European Deli!You'll find a plethora of Polonia here, from Polish brand juices to cookies to homemade dessert breads filled with jam and even calling cards to the motherland featuring the visage of Frederic Chopin.And then there's sausage.Sausage so firm and mighty you could use it as a policeman's club to engage in some brutality. We bought some of the krajana kielbasa to use in a hopping john recipe for the New Year. Krajana is double smoked-- yes, you read that correctly, double smoked!Other kielbasa on display include kabanos, which has an interesting etymology if wikipedia is to be believed. Derived from the word 'kaban', meaning young male pig fattened with potatoes, the kabanos is thin and smoky. At times I suppose I do resemble a kaban as well.The employee behind the counter was helpful in answering questions. No other customers were present which was fine for the purely selfish reason that the space is rather small.As one who suffers from a Spock like dilemma of being half Italian and half Polish, for many years my Polish side was neglected and left to wither away like a tree in winter. Visiting Mary's helped rekindle memories of the few Polish edibles I ate as a child and encouraged a hearty desire for more. I now have an option besides Hilshire Farm just a subway stop away in Jackson Heights.
<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2013,4/12/2013,42,175,10,19,11>I literally just came home from the two day Basic Rider Course held at Queensborough Community College. WHEW. What a weekend.MOST IMPORTANT:Do NOT be late. Under any circumstances. At all. Forever. You can be ten seconds late and you will be kicked out of the class, NO REFUNDS, no make-ups. This didn't happen in my class, but I know that has happened to other people.Next: Where the hell is the damn place? (Ties into "don't be late" because it was impossible to find without direction).When you are on the corner of 226th Street and 56th avenue facing QCC, turn left. See those two ghetto white little one floor "buildings?" Well, "annexes," whatever. Yeah, it's the further, left one of the two; it's the door next to the "Shadowbox Theater."The good stuff:I had Michael Friedle and Marty as my instructors. They are both old guys who look like Santa. And they both know bikes like you wouldn't believe. Michael is the sweetest grandpa-type ever. All you want to do is give him a hug and eat milk and cookies with him on Christmas. Marty is the tough-love type who strictly enforces the rules but still wants you to have a good, safe, responsible time. Michael does the same, but with a softer touch.Day 1 consisted of almost 3 hours of classroom lesson, going through the book and answering some of the 120 questions in the book. After that, we had a break and walked to the range (aka, little parking lot). Where is the range? When you exit the door of the annex you are in, turn left, then turn left again and enter the running track. Walk down the length of the track and you will see the said parking lot.On the range, you learn where the various controls/parts of the bike are, how to turn it on, how to power walk it, how to ride in first gear, how to work the "friction zone" (or ride the clutch, pretty much), how to brake, change gears, weave in and out of cones, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember.Every hour, you get a 10-15 minute break to eat/use the bathroom in the nearby building.While one instructor talks to you about the exercise you are about to do, the other instructor sets up the cones for that exercise. The two of them were ridiculously efficient and there was no wasted time. By the time you were done hearing about what you had to do and looking at a diagram of it, the range was already set up! Clearly years of experience on how to effectively have a smooth flow to the class.Day 2 consisted of about the same amount of classroom time, then one written exam. If you paid attention in class (which is really should), you'll pass the 50 question multiple choice, as long as you get 40 of them correct.On the range, we did more fun stuff including swerving, driving over obstacles (which are just 2x4 pieces of wood), coming to a quick stop, figure 8's (which are the bane of my existence), changing lanes/signaling, and smooth turning. Throw in some weaving, because that was fun, too.Once that's all done, you get 20 minutes to practice 3 of the 4 exercises that are on the practical evaluation. This includes a relatively tight figure 8, swerving, and coming to a quick stop. The fourth exercise is doing a 135 degree turn smoothly, but you practiced that earlier on day 2, so you don't really get a second chance to practice before the evaluation. Ultimately, the instructors seriously want you to develop good, safe habits. They know what they're talking about, so listen and don't take anything personally. Also, do NOT have your cellphone on you AT ALL when on the range. Marty will reprimand you and suggest that you leave the class. Leave it in your bag. It's important to remember that you do not pay $350 for a motorcycle license here. You paid for a Basic Rider Course. Don't just assume you have to get through two days and you get a license. You have to learn how to control the bike safely and perform the tasks they ask.My only criticism was that as a student with zero motorcycle experience, the fact we only did each exercise 3-4 times was not enough for me to get a good handle on it. On a positive note, Marty worked this out by saying I could practice during break. On day 1 I had a hard time smoothly changing gears, but the extra practice during break helped a ton.Actually, the other criticism is the fact that to register for the class you either had to go to the office in person or mail in the application. Come on, it's 2013, online registration would be awfully convenient. Or even over the phone registration.Miscellaneous:Bring food. There's nothing within walking distance to eat, but there is a Burger King/general fast food on Northern. There's a vending machine in the building, but that's about it. Riding for hours WILL make you starving.Anyway. Thanks Trama's, for the awesome experience. I would recommend this school for sure.
<review# 254,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/7/2012,4/11/2013,1007,752,10,16,17>500th review goes to Sakura Ya Japanese Market!I walk and drive past this market almost every single day. It's right off Ascan Ave and Austin St. I finally stepped foot inside for the first time a few days ago and was pretty pleased to find one of my favorite Japanese candies (Hi-Chew) for a cheap price. A single flavor stick of Hi-Chew is only 99 cents! The variety pack is $1.99! In Manhattan or in Williamsburg, I usually see single flavors priced at $2.50 or more.I walked around the store for a bit, saw a lot of Japanese brand products obviously. They sell a variety of Japanese crackers, chips, and more candy. Towards the back, they have a different kinds of instant ramen, and noodles. There's also plenty of Japanese hair care products as well as skincare. In their fridges, they carry some pretty awesome beverages that you won't find in any other asian markets. I saw some commonly found Sapporo and Kirin beer but also saw other ones that I have never seen before. They also sell Calpico and a few other sweet drinks that I enjoyed when I was kid.The owner and the employees are all definitely Japanese. It's not a Chinese or Korean market that is posing as Japanese. The service is very nice. They're very well mannered, respectful, and just super polite. The aisles are a little cramped and I could see that they're constantly working on something but Sakura Ya is a real gem in this area. It's not everyday where you can find yourself a legit Japanese market in New York. I've been to one in Astoria years ago, and the other would have to be Mitsuwa. It's pretty nice to have a small Japanese market in Forest Hills. If you're in the area and like Hi-Chew as much as I do, check them out. They got some pretty bangin unique flavors.
<review# 255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2013,4/10/2013,158,189,11,13,12>Tazzina is one of those restaurants that excels on every level of a what a great meal at a great restaurant should be.  The term "knocked it out of the park" ( Thanks Paul Jr ) doesn't even begin to describe how Tazzina executes a spectacular dinner. After reading a review from Mike B. I knew I had to give this place a try. I decided the weekend of Valentines day would be a good choice.....if  I could get a reservation.  I had called the restaurant and left a message and a little while later I got a call from Jason....as in Chef Jason Zukas. He was super cool and I got the date and time I was looking for.  Once we got there we were greeted and seated right away. The place itself has a homey vibe and as you sit in an intimate space surrounded by family pictures it is not hard to picture yourself as a guest in Jason's home. ( OK I copied that last part from their website but it's soooo true.  That and they play a great mix of music that really sets the mood.  We even witnessed a proposal, I'd say the fact that he brought her there really sealed the deal :) As for the food all I can say is wow!   The GF and I started off with the Fried Oysters and the Truffled Gnocchi.  The fried oysters were outstanding. Perfectly fried exterior while the center still retained all of it's oystery goodness. And words cannot describe the Truffled Gnocchi. Perfectly cooked handmade gnocchi miked with peas, asparagus prosciutto and truffle. I could smell the truffles wafting towards me like a hand from a scene out of a bugs bunny cartoon.  For our main dishes she got one of the specials for the day a Chilean sea bass with clams, muscles and shrimp and I got the Braised Short Ribs. Again, all I can say is wow.  The GF's sea bass had a great crust and was cooked to perfection as were the accompanying seafood goodies.   My dish had me conflicted at first. When deciding what to order i found myself torn. I love short ribs, polenta, not so much but I am glad I decided to go with it anyway because it was one of the best dishes I've ever had. The short rib was fork tender and the polenta was unlike any other I've had. Rich and creamy and full of flavor. The dish was finished off with perfectly roasted Brussels sprouts. We decide to end the night with some cappuccino, espresso and dessert. On a side note,  I am a professional fat kid, but I am a food fat kid, not really a dessert fat kid.  That being said, after I read some reviews i knew that an order of Nutella Lava Cake was in order. This thing is a masterpiece. As if a moist and delicious Nutella cake wasn't enough they pair it with some tart strawberries and creamy vanilla gelato.  Simply amazing....nay, this dessert was dish licking good!I am kicking myself for not coming here sooner after trying some bite at the Queens Summer Stunner ( Thanks Jando) It was really one of the best meals I've ever enjoyed. You must really do yourself a favor and make a trip to Glendale and try this place. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!
<review# 256,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/19/2012,4/9/2013,593,1089,9,11,10>just try and walk into Euromarket without singing the "Countries of the World" song from Animaniacs. it's impossible, I tells ya.what we have here is a great supermarket with a wide variety of pan-European groceries. Italian, Greek, German, Russian, Slovak, Hungarian, Polish, Irish, and more. meats, vegetables, beverages, packaged/canned goods, desserts, and more. it's like the EU threw up in here!there's also an epic library of beer on hand, both imported and American. hell, I didn't even know there were so many types of cider available (we picked up a pack of Woodchuck for a party we were heading to). I think they let you mix-and-match, because I noticed some bottles had individual pricetags on them, but I would ask them if you go with that intent.prices seem pretty fair and the diversity of food here is awesome. the store is large and quite clean.I love all the pan-Asian import stores strewn throughout Queens, but it's nice to have some balance with the rest of Eurasia (who we have always been in an alliance with). I'll definitely be back to give Euromarket a more thorough look.
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/9/2012,4/8/2013,238,433,7,13,9>One of the nice little hidden gems in Queens that offers novice golfers (like myself) a chance to work on their short game. The Par 3 Pitch and Put in the middle of the park is a clean and quiet course that makes for a fun afternoon for those who want to practice their wedges and irons.  Price is very affordable (under $20), and the wait time is usually minimal.  Night time is just as fun as the course is well-lit (aside from the 18th hole) and there is usually no wait. The golf center also has a good supply of irons, wedges, and putters even if they are a bit worn out.  Just make sure you bring an extra set of golf balls as it is very easy to lose them. This one managed to lose 3 balls on a single hole!  If the Par 3 is too threatening, you can definitely try your hand on the mini-golf course. That course is certainly more family friendly, and you are much less likely to lose your golf balls.
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2013,4/7/2013,522,450,7,8,8>De Mole has off the chain Mexican food. We made a special trip out here from the farther parts of Queens just to sample their delicious offerings.The guacamole was great! Guac can be made poorly, but here there were plenty of chunks of creamy, appropriately ripe avocado with cilantro, topped with tomato and onion. It was awesome, and the tortilla chips came in a cute little brown paper bag. I appreciated the presentation. Actually, everything looks really pretty on the plate, which is nice in such a small place.The chorizo nachos were OUT OF THIS WORLD. I had never had chorizo before (!!!) but my friend talked me into splitting the dish and I'm glad she did. The chips were also covered in black beans, guacamole, pico de gallo & sour cream, but the chorizo is really what made them stand out. We had to fight over the last bits of meat.My sauteed spinach quesadilla was the low point in all of this culinary goodness. While it tasted quite fine, the spinach made the meal super soggy and that detracted both from the taste as well as my ability to eat it. Next time, I'm not going to bring my new-found health kick to a Mexican restaurant, and I'll just stick with the old cheese plus meat combo.We finished off our meal with the coconut flan. I'm not sure how to describe the cocnut flan except for BEST EVER. It is everything flan is supposed to be. It's also probably about 24043950495893486 calories. It definitely tastes that rich, creamy, and sweet. If you're coming here, you absolutely have to save room for this dessert!

Tuesday is .25cent wing night, Wednesday's are $10 steak night, and Thursday's are $3 burger night. They also have $2 mugs for the Sunday Night Football game. The deals just don't end. Thank God I don't live any closer because Dillingers might become an obsession. The service is always above and beyond. They really go the extra mile for you.Beers on Tap:Coors LightWarsteinerShock TopShock Top PumpkinYuenglingTuesdays:With .25 cent wings and $11 pitchers of beer Tuesdays get very popular at Dillingers especially during the Summertime. Price aside Dillingers has some of the better wings that i've tried in Astoria. I believe you can get mild, medium and hot for .25cents and the Dillinger Sauce is .35cents.Wednesdays:Haven't yet tried the $10 steak nightThursdays:$3 for a burger with fries!!! I don't think I should have to say anything more. Thursdays are awesome. Where can you buy a decent meal for $3. No where, that's where. Well Dillingers on Thursdays is awesome. I believe your choice of cheese is free and every other topping is 50-75cents more. Weekend Brunch: The weekend brunch is pretty awesome. For $11.95 you get a meal with unlimited tea, soda, coffee and if you want unlimited screwdrivers, mimosas, and bloody mary's it's just $19.95. Dillingers definitely has one of the more wallet friendly brunch specials around. The food was okay. I've tried the Eggs Benedict and the Breakfast Quesadillas and they were good.  As for their drinks my friend said the coffee was pretty awful. I tried all the alcoholic beverages and the screwdrivers were so watered down it was undrinkable. The worst screwdriver I've ever had, hands down. My friend had the bloody mary and couldn't take more than a sip because she said it had to much horseradish. With that said I'd suggest just sticking with the mimosas, you can't go wrong.

We cancelled the Veggie dish because we had SOO MUCH FOOD!
<review# 261,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/3/2012,2/3/2013,1007,752,13,18,17>Cannoli cake is crack! They have the most amazing cannoli cake I have ever tasted. The sponge in their cake is incredibly tasty and perfectly moist. The cannoli cream is delightful and the cake is just delicious! I come to La Dolce just about every holiday and birthday to purchase this wonderful Cannoli cake. It's that good! The Cannoli cake is $20 which isn't that bad. It's moderately priced. The only problem I have is that they can't pipe "Happy Birthday" for their life!! Just take a look at my pictures and you'll know what I'm talking about.Verdict - Great tasting cake, horrendous piping of Happy Birthday. They mess it up every single time which I find hilarious. They always forget to use piping gel and use a thick piping cream for the lettering. The tastiness of the cake makes up for it :)
<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/16/2012,2/2/2013,509,142,8,7,7>I loooove this place!!! Likes: 1) Delicious and authentic canton style food. They have great house fried rice, fried crabs, fish maw soup, mayonnaise shrimp, lamb chop steaks, and Peking duck. 2) Attentive and friendly staff. Great service. Dislikes:1) A bit pricy for downtown flushing but not too bad2) Staff does not speak English. Oh and there's one other weird thing... Every time I come here, they stare at me and comment on me being super tall. For example, I would walk in and one of the waiters would say, "It's the tall girl again." There was one time, I stood up talking to my friend and had my back to one of the waiters. He tried to measure how tall he was as compared to me secretly behind my back. I turned around, watching him using his hands to see how much taller I am than he is. Hmm... Way to make me feel like I'm a giant! 3) Parking is a hassle. It took me 40 min to find parking there today. Tips: They do not accept credit card. It's cash only.
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/26/2012,2/1/2013,593,1089,18,23,20>you have NO excuse to not check out this impossibly delicious restaurant. none, whatsoever. no, I don't want to hear it, get in a car, take a bus, pedal your bike, hitchhike. just do what you have to and go.I'm sitting at my desk drooling just remembering the meal we had last night. it's the type of place that would make my beloved 91-year-old Nonna jealous.start with the bruschetta trio platter: diced tomato and basil with goat cheese; a creamy garbanzo paste and roasted peppers; ricotta and prosciutto. this was a fantastic mix of fresh ingredients atop hearty portions of bruschetta (which was the perfect balance of crispy outside, softer inside). well, that certainly hit the spot.there is a dish which has BOTH the gnocchi and the braised short ribs, the house specialties. the meat is so tender, a spoon can shred it. the gnocchi are so soft, you don't need to chew them. just savor them, one. at. a. time. the onions, mushrooms, and basil add a nice touch. the portion size, presentation, and taste were amazing; it's no surprise that the chef, Jason, won on Chopped. Caroline had the butternut squash ravioli, which were like precision guided bombs of pasta and vegetable deliciousness.even after all that, and a glass of wine each, we decided that dessert was necessary. espresso for her, cappucino for me, and a Nutella lava cake with vanilla ice cream and strawberries for us to split. WHY DOES THIS THING EXIST?! so moist and delicious. dessert's been ruined for me now.the ambiance is perfect. candlelights, maybe 20 or 30 seats, and music from the 50s-70s played at a low volume. perfect for a datenight or small group gathering. service was awesome. prices are fair.I just wish I hadn't delayed going here for so long. but in the words of General Douglas MacArthur: I SHALL RETURN!

Def is not someplace you should come if you prioritize ambiance and an owner that will chat you up. However, they have a great customer base because the FOOD is so good and the service is fast. Everything is made on the spot when you order it.Two things that I love here are the katsu curry (curry over fried meat...drool) and the katsu don (who doesn't like fried egg?). All the dishes come with a side salad that has that yummy tangy ginger sauce and the sushi are made very fresh :)Also, where else in New York can you find spam musubi??This is the place to go for homemade Japanese "fast food"..not to mention its awesome hangover food as well.

All Yelpers pointed me to Minitalia Pizza. I don't always follow the Yelp stars, often opting to see for myself, but in this case, I'm very pleased that I did!The crust was crisp! The sauce was robust and full of flavor! The toppings were generous, yet not excessive. It was slightly salty for my personal taste, but not so much that I didn't love the pizza. Whether by the pie or by the slice, it always tastes great! The gentleman who works the pies recognized me by my second visit. Cool folks!Best pizza in the area? I can't say since I haven't tried the others, but what I can say is I love this place and I dream about their garlic pizza. One of the movers who came back to the area to visit me mentioned wanting to go back, so I'm not alone in this love.

I don't know if the meat or veges are cheaper at this market but I do like the neatly displayed pricing, isles are nice and wide, and floors are clean and don't wreak.
<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2013,1/28/2013,522,450,13,13,14>Last night, we were deciding what to eat for dinner. After a rough drinking weekend and only feeding myself pasta, I declared that I didn't want anything "too ethnic" (read: spicy or heavy) but also didn't want burgers or Italian food. This left me with the pizza option, but my dining companion had half a pie the previous night."What about sandwiches?" he inquired.I am pretty sure my eyes lit up with the fire of about 10000 suns. Sandwiches, you see, are the food of the gods. I mean, it's an entire meal that you can hold in your hand and eat without utensils. You can put whatever you want on it, and it will usually work out pretty well (even if it's a peanut butter sandwich filled with crushed Reese's peanut butter cups).So we embarked on a journey to Othello's. During the course of our several block journey, I was told that Othello's had literally the best sandwiches ever, that they were huge, that they had every combination in the book.All of these things are true. My sandwich was one of the best sandwiches ever. It was huge, probably about the size of my forearm (who needs to eat a sandwich the size of their forearm? Me.), and there were boards and boards full of meat-cheese-veggie-spread-bread possibilities.My eyes immediately landed on the Alex Rodriguez: mayo, turkey, roast beef, and muenster (or provolone, I cannot for the life of me remember) on a hero. I was told to go up to the counter and order by the name. This was the first time I've ever said "I'd like an Alex Rodriguez, please." I'd say it's the only time, but I might have to indulge in seconds one day. Though Derek Jeter did look tempting, for the first time since middle school...Anyway, we waited for some time for the sandwiches to be finished. I perused the beer selection -- nothing special -- and then we paid ($7 each) and brought our extra forearms home.It was amazing. Everything was nicely grilled, mine wasn't too greasy (though the other sandwich was the Frank Sinatra, and with peppers and prosciutto, that got a little slippery), and all of the meat and cheese flavors blended in perfect harmony. It was a sandwich party in my mouth and I couldn't get enough, even though I couldn't down the whole thing in one go. But that's ok. It kept well after I wrapped it up, and was just as delicious when I had it cold on the subway ride home.$10 credit card minimum.

When the bartender asked if I wanted any other toppings I impulsively said bacon. Then my arteries said "stop" and opt for a greasy cheese instead of bacon overkill. Of course, I requested no bun since I'm on a lo-carb regimen.

It's impossible not to see a tv no matter where you turn and that's always a major plus if you are watching sports.The best deal on the menu is $6.99 for pitchers of bud and bud light which is a pretty awesome deal. The only knock on this place has to be that we were served warm beer and thats a big NO-NO but i'm going to give a pass because they've been open less than a week and I don't think they were entirely prepared for the Football crowd on Sundays especially since the primetime game was the hometown Giants. I knew what I was getting into and what to expect given Bud's was a new place and there was sure to be a crowd so I figured ordering the special would keep things simple but every pitcher i got was warm and my friends said the same thing. I had friends who got the burgers and they were delicious cause I tasted them. I ordered the nachos and the chips weren't tortilla chips, they were potato chips. Nevertheless they were really good. Like any other business it's going to take a while before everything becomes routine and after coming on one of their very first busy days I think they did a pretty good job. Bud's Ale House is a large place. It was packed and they managed to keep everything under control. The staff was awesome and friendly and watching a game here is pretty awesome. I'll try this place again for sure. Its a good place for a large group of people. My friends also said the desserts were the bum diggity.

<review# 271,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2013,11/23/2013,287,270,10,6,5>HeavennnnnnnnI'm in heavennnnnAnd the arepas are so big that I can hardly SEEEEEEEEEAnd they are so yummy and so frigging cheapAs the arepa in my mouth dances from cheek to cheek.That basically sums it up, Sinatra style. These things are amazing, and I honestly can only handle one of them if you also split an appetizer with someone (Fried yuca with green sauce all the way). Also the brown sugar lemonade blows my mind and is probably the most refreshing non-alcoholic summer beverage I can think of ever having. Add to that the fact that the place is never too crowded to get a seat and the service is always impeccable --  and I really can't think of anything better when you're in the mood for a cheap, tasty, unique meal.
<review# 272,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2013,11/22/2013,62,424,21,28,10>Since there was so much fanfare about this place, I decided to check it out this morning.  Of course, I took advantage of the deal for a scrub, massage, and entrance fee for $105.  It was the best investment I ever made.  Thanks to all the yelpers!I arrived at 9:00 AM, paid for everything upfront and there was a woman who directed me to my locker.  This is where you get the main different between Spa Castle and this place.  You take off your shoes, carry it with you to your locker and they have a small slot at the bottom of your locker where you place your shoes.  They don't even give you a uniform.  You strip.The woman attendant asked whether I'd like to get my scrub and massage after 20 minutes.  Instead, I asked that I start at 10:00 AM.  Okay, this is where I went wrong.  There's nothing really there to do other than soak in a large hot pool, go steam, bake in the sauna, and/or take a shower.  After 20 minutes, I changed my mind and told her I'd like to start right away, lol.  She mentioned I should have said so earlier.The scrub was AMAZING.  There I am lying on the table thinking I don't have that much dead skin on me.  I had my eyes closed.  When I opened my eyes, there was a bunch of dead skin laying all about me.  I was a bit grossed out but it was definitely satisfying to see all that dead skin gone.  After almost a year of hell, it represented all the negativity I carried with me and I was happy to see it shed off my skin.  This woman, scrubbed me over 3 TIMES!  She was determined.  Afterwards, she told me to rinse in the shower while she prepared the cucumber mask.  The facial mask was very refreshing.  Shit, the whole scrubbing experience was refreshing as well.  She then proceeded to obliterate all the knots in my body.  My upper/lower back, neck and everywhere else was full of tension.  The woman climbed on top of me to put as much pressure on my lower back as possible.  My upper back has been taken care of as well as my hair.  She washed my hair like a professional at a salon - my head was massaged really well.Then she slathered my corpulent body with milk oil.  She squirted some in my hands so I could put in on my face.  When I was done, she squirted some more milk oil so I could rub my face again.  She then pulled me upright and said goodbye.  When I went to the shower, I wasn't sure whether I should soap off all the oil.  She said not to soap but just wash off the milk off my body.  Currently, I have a faint smell of cereal aroma from my body.  Hell, I don't care.  My skin feels AMAZING and I feel so relaxed.  I got so much done afterwards.  I shopped for all my domestic items I needed, ate lunch, picked up my dry cleaning as well as drop off, and now I'm about to get my laundry done.  Thank you, scrub lady.  I wish I knew your name but if I asked, you would have said, "WTF?  Why the hell do you need to know my name?"  But, this scrub and massage was a lot more than a treat.  It was really equivalent to taking off the unnecessary excess of shit in my life.  Oh, sorry I got a little sappy.  Yeah, I'm gonna go again in probably a month.  This is not a place like Spa Castle where you lounge, you get scrubbed, massaged, and then get the hell out to go about your day.  Minus one star because of the fact that it's not loungey - you just get your body worked out and then go.
<review# 273,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2013,11/21/2013,54,133,7,8,7>I earned my Elite badge for three years in a row for basically not cooking. It's not my strength nor passion so god bless NYC restaurants and local delis for keeping me from poisoning myself with my very own creations.  however, when my friend invited me to Open doors she had a special surprise for me- master cooking class with Aaamazing Odette Fada. She was on Top Chef and used to work for San Demonico yet she is super sweet and just lighten up the the room with her present. I so do have a girl crush on her.Upon entering this cute and welcome neighborhood restaurant, we were taken to the main dining room at the back where Ms. Amazing Fada had her chef table all set up and ready for the audience. Sipping glass of delicious bubbly we made our pasta dough from semolina and white flour under the chef's supervision  and then while dough were "resting" (if that's the term? Don't judge me) Odette taught us how to make pesto sauce and baby octopus salad. The room full of grown ups ,we were having fun with making our food (which usually I consider a chore and when I was a teen that was my punishment)  sipping delicious red and white wines that were paired with our food. Dinner was wrapped up on a really high notes and by that I mean heavenly panna cotta made by the chef. I'm usually not a big fan of puddings, flans and anything doesn't have chocolate in it (those not a dessert, those are Lies,) but Ms Fada's pannacotta was out of this world.I definitely  enjoyed that interactive  experience and I'm glad that I got to step out of my regular routine of standard dining. Since open table will be having more classes (hopefully) maybe finally cooking will be one of my superpowers. For now I mastered only sarcasm and writing semi decent help reviews.
<review# 274,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2013,11/20/2013,360,150,5,10,7>i am SO happy to have this place within 1 minute walking distance from my new place...since moving in i have been eating here or ordering delivery almost every day no lie.  i've tried their, fish over rice which is SO good way better than chao fan across from starbucks, they do not skimp on their ample pieces of fall-apart properly sauced white fish and it comes with slices of bamboo, green peppers, snowpeas and black fungus.  of course, their staples are the hand pulled noodles and their house special noodles are good but my favorite so far is probably the knife noodles with beef, the noodles are fresh and just the right amount of chewy consistency and their broth is good too.  ive also tried their duck noodle soup and i was blown away when i bit into the duck, most noodle places that dont do BBQ use dry and gross duck but it tasted just like those BBQ places, the duck was yummO.  i love adding their LU DAN braised egg which kinda tastes like tea egg to my noodles, my friend once ordered the stir fried beef noodle and i was so sad i didn't get to try that because i was stuffed after my meal.  they also offer an array of cold dishes, i didnt realli like the seaweed because i prefer seaweed knots but the celery and dried bean curd? is that what its called is good and crisp, the black fungus in sesame oil wasn't bad either.  honestly i have been going so much the takeout guy, the waitress and even the chef recognizes me and says hello on the street LOL.  such a huge fan, please try this place.  they carry a bunch of asian drinks as well as soda ie apple sidra and chrysanthemum tea, sometimes i wish they had one of those stamp cards ie eat 100$ get a free meal because i barely go 3 days without eating here
<review# 275,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/7/2013,11/19/2013,44,100,10,9,6>This salon is decorated in so many pink ruffles that you feel as if you've stumbled into an 8-year-old girl's princess fantasy bedroom. Compared to other venues in the Flushing area, I found this one to be very clean and professional--no stray dust bunnies or strange stains on the bedding. All of the women share a room, but there are curtains for privacy and I didn't even notice there was another client being worked on until I finished! In fact, the setting was so peaceful and comfortable that I repeatedly dozed off during my facial.While it's not impossible to get service for a walk-in, it's better to call ahead. Four women work at this salon, with varying proficiency in English (I have seen non-Chinese patrons there). My favorite is Lisa, who unfortunately speaks very little English, but is so motherly, sweet, and careful. She repeatedly asks if you're comfortable or need her to do something differently. When massaging my neck and shoulders, she applies the right pressure and works on the knots in a way that makes me mellllllllllt.In addition to deep-cleaning your pores, the standard facial comes with a long face massage, steam, mud mask, various creams to revitalize your skin, eyebrow pluck, and a weird procedure that will leave your arms crazy smooth (your skin is slathered in lotion, saran-wrapped, and then stuffed into heating pads). In fact, I couldn't stop touching my arms and face for hours afterward because of how unbelievably smooth/soft they felt.The price for facials and massages is a little above average for Flushing ($45 for a standard 75-minute facial), but worth the extra cost. There are discounted packages and you're allowed to share the package services with friends/family. I think they charge 4-5% extra for using a credit card, so carry cash when you come.
<review# 276,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2013,11/18/2013,35,25,3,9,4>When I saw that another Thai restaurant was opening in Astoria, I have to admit that I wasn't exactly thrilled as we already have a pretty good selection to choose from. That said, I was very happy to see the spot where Aroma 31 languished in obscurity filled, rather than just sitting there, empty.  When I saw the beautiful decor, I started to get a bit excited as they seemed to really have put a lot of work into making the place look wonderful.I stopped by on a random Thursday night the first week they opened and I have to say, I had a wonderful meal. The staff were obviously restaurant vets as the place was running smoothly, with no "new restaurant hiccups". I was offered a complimentary mojito and had 5 or 6 flavor to choose from. I chose the lychee flavor and it was delicious!For dinner, I ordered the Garlic sauteed chicken. It was absolutely delicious and was not at all greasy, served with a generous portion of steamed veggies. While I was eating, the staff stopped by a few times to ask if I needed anything. They were extremely friendly and helpful and seemed really grateful to everyone in the restaurant for comingFor dessert, I had the mango with sticky rice, which is one of my favorite foods. It was plated beautifully and was probably the best I've ever had.When I paid, my waitress asked me how everything was and thanked me again for coming. I left feeling full and happy. I will definitely be a regular customer!
<review# 277,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2013,11/17/2013,32,24,10,10,8>This review is strictly related to the bar.Without a doubt the most chill place to grab a drink in Flushing, but still have a crazy fun time if you want to.  All the bartenders are cool and down to talk.  Typically it doesn't get very packed as most patrons come for the karaoke rooms.  This actually lends itself well to coming in here and having a great conversation with the bar staff, and other fun stuff like asking them to make ridiculous crazy cocktails.The bar is long and separated into two parts, so you have ample space.  I recommend sitting at the first bar section if possible, as you're in line of sight with the bartenders then.  Also the tablet to select songs is located near the entrance, so if you want to rock out to some songs it's best to be near it.  Usually most people just use it as a jukebox, but if it's late or the bartenders are into it, then there's ample drunken singing going on.  The selection is the usual Flushing fare of cpop, kpop, hiphop, and Selena Gomez all-day every-day.Drinks are $6 for most brews, and $7 for others.  Credit card is accepted here, as opposed to some other nearby establishments living in the past which will not be named!  Be sure to take advantage of the Yelp deal as that can be used on your bar tab, but be sure to ask first.There are TVs which are either tuned to the karaoke machine or sports.  If you're a smoker, you don't have to walk all the way down stairs.  Opposite the bar there's a door which opens to the roof which you can use instead.  Oddly enough this place closes at 2am, but frequently the crowd will drunkenly meander to the place around the corner which stays open till 4am.Thanks to Erica, Dani, and all the staff for dealing with the drunks who roll through here.PS. If you see a guy named Pick here, start drinking heavily.  Trust me on this.
<review# 278,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2013,11/16/2013,35,103,3,11,6>I've had my fingers crossed that Forest Hills would slowly turn into a place that my husband can love right along with me, and the Station House definitely gives the neighborhood a huge step in the right direction. The beer selection is fantastic and I love the menu screens all around the restaurant (the manager even switched one on near us so we didn't have to crane our necks). So much better than attempting to read one chalkboard above the bar, yet not as obtrusive as it may sound. And their whiskey/bourbon/rye cocktail list (7 in all) made my mouth water. I will definitely be back to slowly make my way down that entire collection...The menu is a very funky and delicious sounding collection of items. We were pretty hungry, so we picked 3 "starters" and a salad to share. Note to anyone thinking of doing this: "starters" was a definitely misnomer for some items!! The portions were very generous (particularly for the sausage plate) and we took home some leftovers because there was so much.I am a sucker for a roasted beet salad and Station House will definitely be my go-to place for this hankering from now on. The kimchi empanadas that another reviewer raved about were awesome - particularly the spicy mayo sauce. The sausage plate had three different kinds of sausage (kielbasa, a bratwurst, and something else? totally guessing here...) and a really good whole grain mustard. Last was the fried pickle & brisket balls. Okay, here's where we were a bit confused. The best part of fried pickles is that weird kind-of gross yet delicious warm garlicky vinegar taste. So when you list something as fried pickles... that's what you're anticipating. Instead, these were balls of shredded brisket with some pickles, in an almost fritter-like dough/batter. They were okay... but not what we were expecting at all.Altogether, because of the $2 off drafts happy hour (12-7pm, wow!), the bill for 4 plates plus 2 beers was around $50 plus tip. Everything was delicious, service was great, and we came home with leftovers. Sounds like a win to me!
<review# 279,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2013,11/15/2013,205,249,6,8,6>Love this place! I have been here twice and it has been so delicious each time. Service is pretty good here. They are busy so you have to fight for their attention but once you get it, they are pretty good about bringing you what you need. I love the giant parking lot in the back. It is so clutch for downtown Flushing. Both times that I went here, I came with a large group. This last time, there was 7 of us. We first ordered the combo number 1 and 2. Combo number 1 included an assortment of 4 marinated meats: pork, kalbi, spicy pork and chicken. Combo number 2 was about the same meats, just not marinated. We ordered an extra side of Kalbi for BBQ because each combo is only enough for two people. Then we got the grilled octopus and codfish stew. We also ordered some staples including a sizzling Bi Bim Bap, Jap Chae and of course Soju for the table. I always like Korean BBQ but I especially love it here because they give you soybean paste and salt in sesame oil to dip the BBQ in. They also give you lettuce to wrap the meats in and make mini wraps out of the BBQ which was delicious. The codfish stew was just ok but the grilled octopus was great! It came with some udon noodles and after mixing the noodles in with the red pepper bean paste with the octopus, it was surprisingly very delicious. Their sides are great and they give you so much variety. They also give you free ice cream at the end for dessert. I couldn't quite put my finger on what flavor it was but it tasted like a vanilla yogurt. Apparently they have a whole separate area for weddings too as we saw a wedding banquet going on while here. Definitely won't be my last time here; can't wait to come again!
<review# 280,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2013,11/14/2013,14,81,8,13,8>Came here to celebrate a bachelorette party. It was a good time. Its definitely hard to find a good R&B, Hip Hop and Reggae spot now a days. Apparently according to the youngin's they only listen to electronica. I personally don't know what that is, I just know I was told that I was old. This was the place to hit up if you wanted R&B, Hip Hop and Reggae, had a blast. They did not bother us about buying VIP or doing bottled service for getting a guest-list going, which is pretty good. Another good thing about this place - its close to a train station and its easy to drive and find parking in the area, unlike the city. It's not that big of a spot and can get a little crowded but I guess when you have one club with the best music it cant be helped. =)
<review# 281,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/18/2013,3/25/2013,121,1222,9,9,9>Got delivery from here recently.  I'd been wanting to try this since those jerks at Antica Trattoria lied about delivering to my area of Ridgewood despite being closer than another restaurant that delivered to us without changing their minds a week later.  Needless to say, I was happy to see them get some competition.  My review is exclusively for the food.The chicken parm was okay.  It wasn't the best chicken I had but the sauce & cheese were very good.  I also got a vegetable side that my husband loved along with mashed potatoes; definitely a different spin than the usual pasta that comes with it.The person who took my delivery order was extremely polite & informative.  He answered my questions about the dish I was ordering for my lactose intolerant husband as well as those about their desserts.The tiramisu was pretty good.  Not as good as the one I had at Capizzi's later on or at Mappomondo but far from horrible.  I wish there was a little more on the menu my husband could eat but perhaps I'll order something else there sometime.  They seemed accommodating enough to me.As one reviewer said, we definitely need better restaurants around here since miles down Fresh Pond is NOT my neighborhood & I'm not going to hike down there when I can take the train into Manhattan and get better food.
<review# 282,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/18/2013,3/24/2013,565,622,6,7,9>After having tacos from a lot of the highly rated places on yelp, I think these guys are the most under rated taco place in NY. Of course calling them a taco place is a bit of a disservice because they serve a lot of other authentic Mexican food as well but as I have said before: Their Al-Pastor taco is the king. ALL HAIL THE KING!I'm still looking for better tacos in NY than Los Portales but haven't found it yet. Matter of fact, their chorizo is the bomb diggity as well. It's a bit oily but the flavor is on point. If you are ordering a chorizo taco, I'm guessing you aren't too concerned about the nutritional value of your food in the first place. You can't go wrong with the lengua or the suadero tacos either but beyond the taco menu, I'd say it's better to keep it simple. The horchata is good and so are the cemitas and tortas. I've been coming here for a couple of  years now and apart from the stuff I mentioned, I haven't had anything else that's made an impression. Almost everything they have goes well with their green chili sauce.But man oh man.. those tacos... and all for $1.50 each!
<review# 283,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2012,3/23/2013,59,195,6,9,9>My first experience with John Brown was when they catered to a friend's wedding last May. It was, by far, the most delicious wedding buffet I have ever eaten from! Since then I have been meaning to go to the actual restaurant, and finally this past Saturday, I was able to go! We arrived around 8. I was worried burnt ends would be sold out, but they had a ton! They were actually sold out of pulled pork but we didn't care since we all ordered burnt ends (all 5 of us). Keep in mind, they do say on their website that they "[cook] only a limited amount per day." I called in advance to make sure they had what we wanted available so that we wouldn't be disappointed.Along with my burnt end sandwich, I had mac n cheese and also tried the cole slaw. All yummy. Every one of us was floored by the deliciousness of the burnt ends. They were just so ridiculously tasty and pretty much melted in your mouth. Dude. We didn't find an excess of fat either, and what fat we did find, we ate with pleasure. I have never enjoyed fat as much as I enjoyed at this meal. It was like butter.As for the restaurant, it's a bit out there in an isolated spot but close to lots of bars on Vernon. We were able to find a table easily and service was great. I will definitely return!
<review# 284,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2013,3/22/2013,167,240,9,12,10>After reading the reviews for this up and coming, my friends and I decided to drop by to try it out. And good thing I have seen the pictures of the facade or else we would've missed this. The other reviewers were not joking about the restaurant being a little gem in a secluded spot. The outdoor lights definitely stood out and made it easier to locate. Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. And if the friendly face doesn't give you the impression that the staff will be lax and considerate, the modesty in the decoration and atmosphere will. Extra points for the hand-painted details and hooks along the wall for coats. Between the 4 of us, we ordered a few items to share and our own entrees. -Banh Xeo: We should've ordered more of this! Sharing this between 4 people was difficult because it was absolutely delicious. This is traditionally served as a soft crepe, but Bunker serves it with a crispy crepe, which I definitely have no problem with. Fried = good. What I loved about this is the creamy egg sauce that's folded into the filling which added a another level of flavor and provided a nice hard-soft texture comparison with the crispy crepe and crunchy bean sprouts. -Garlic Fried Rice: Yums! The rice had tons of garlic and also had diced tomatoes, which added a little tartness and acidity to the dish. But just to warn you - if you are not a garlic lover, you might want to stay away. And if you are a garlic lover, bring gum. -Charred Baby Bok: Pretty simple dish and on point. You can taste the "heat" of the wok in the boy choy. The drizzled shrimp chili oil also added a little unexpected but delightful kick. -Bo Luc Lac: I had a taste of the beef cubes from my friend's plate and pretty yummy. The beef was tender and cooked to medium, while still maintaining the sear and caramelization. My friend opted to add an egg, which was great. But suggestion for Bunker - rather than frying the egg, you might consider making the egg sunny-side up or over-easy. The runniness (if that's a word) of the egg would be amazing on the rice and would compliment the beef cubes nicely. -Mo Pho: This is definitely not the traditional pho you usually get at Vietnamese restaurants. The broth is much more hearty and possesses more of a nutty and earthy flavor - opposed to the traditional pho which is more sweet. What I liked was the meat: the beef was sliced paper-thin and included a big piece of oxtail with marrow still intact. It's also nice that the onions are included as a supplement instead of already placed in the bowl, allowing me to add as little or much as I want.Overall, good food with friendly service. Tip: The restaurant does not have their liquor license yet so it's currently BYOB.
<review# 285,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2013,3/21/2013,364,373,9,16,14>The Olde Prague Tavern is a new Bar & Restaurant that opened on Super Bowl Sunday. It is located on 31st Street, right off 30th Ave which use to housed Zlata Praha.I think I am going to love The Olde Prague Tavern. From the moment I walked in, I felt "Welcome, Special and Appreciated". What more can you ask for. Roman, the friendly bartender with a smile and Barry, the owner, also with a smile. They are a welcome addition to a neighborhood that sometimes bars and restaurants don't make you feel "Welcome, Special, and Appreciated". They are spoiled because 30th Avenue is so busy that they don't need to make you feel "Welcome, Special and Appreciated".The Olde Prague Tavern was going through some opening pains last night. This is to be expected with all new operations, but how they handle the hiccups without alienating customers and making fun of the situation; was well done. While trying to fix Direct TV on the televisions, Barry the owner somehow blew the outlet with a beautiful display of sparks. Now this was a non dangerous situation, but the humor that followed was very entertaining. The Bar did not lose a beat with the dozen or so customers. All join in with "cracks" because no one had a flash light. Priceless.The Olde Prague Tavern is a full bar with tasty Czech Beers on tap and a nice espresso machine. It has all your standard beers and liquors, but I did notice some Czech specialties. I am sure with the coming months, they will add drink specials, Happy Hour, Czech specialty drinks, etc.,etc. The restaurant (food part) will be opening in a couple of months and I look forward to some tasty food.Overall, I highly recommend The Olde Prague Tavern. Like I said, it just opened and The Bar and Restaurant needs to get their feet wet. It has to take that new edge of the wall and acquire that warm fuzzy feeling that is all good. They are certainly on the right track with Barry and Roman. Competition is fierce on 30th Ave, but if they make everyone feel "Welcome, Special and Appreciated" one customer at a time, The Olde Prague Tavern will be successful. All the Best......................

Some pizzas can't be uneaten. Eventually I just become dead on the inside. Then Basil Brick Oven comes along and shows me I don't have to live this way. I can let go of my pain. This pizza is different. It doesn't care about my past. It loves me unconditionally, even if I wake up screaming every night. And you know what? I open my heart again and some emotional music crescendos and a playful breeze ruffles my hair and you see me smile again. Maybe I'm standing on a beach as the sun rises or something.THE ENDWritten, directed and produced by me.

<review# 287,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2013,3/19/2013,230,472,5,6,6>Ridgewood's Egyptian Coptic community spawned this restaurant last year. The corner storefront space combines a deli and breakfast counter with a selection of Middle Eastern grocery products for sale (get your tahini here), a few tables, outdoor seating, and a full kitchen.The food seems to have improved since they opened. On my most recent visit I ordered the tamiyya (falafel) platter. The balls were on the oilier end, but served in a bed of fresh parsley, tomato, and lettuce. Really creamy baba ghanouj. They also have hummus, ful, various kofta dishes, and, incongruously, hamburgers.I wish they had koshary.Overall, very good food and friendly service in a spartan environment, and the only proper Middle Eastern restaurant in Ridgewood since Istanbul Shish-Kebab closed a few years ago.
<review# 288,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/9/2012,3/18/2013,200,154,6,6,7>I love the vibe at Fatty's Cafe. They have one of the cutest outdoor seating areas in Astoria, with potted tropical plants, and an adorable faux beach shack. Indoors is also cool, with aqua painted walls, and they play awesome music. I've been for brunch on a couple of occasions. I'd say my favorite item so far on the brunch menu is the Cubana Sandwich. I've also had the Dominican Sunrise and the Mofongo. The Dominican Sunrise is a caribbean twist on your typical egg platter - it had fried queso blanco and tostones in addition to the 2 eggs and sausage. I've only really had mofongo once before, in Puerto Rico, so I don't have much to compare it to. Fatty's version is tasty, albeit a tad bland & heavy. This may just be how the dish is supposed to be (it's basically a giant ball of mashed plantains stuffed with your choice of filling, so y'know). I think the funky ambiance at Fatty's is what makes me love this place so. The food is unique - there's nothing else like it in Astoria, but it's that irie vibe that keeps me coming back for more.
<review# 289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2012,3/17/2013,271,569,8,8,8>I've always been curious about Gamjatang (direct translation: potato stew). It's called potato stew, but it's really pork bone stew with a few potatoes thrown in.Man, where has this been all my life??22 of us descended on Geo Si Gi after church, and they split us up into two groups - a table of 6 on one side and a table of 16 on the other. In an effort to eat as much as possible, I moved over to the table of 6.We ordered the standard gamjatang - Geo si gi gamjatang as we didn't need anything extra (like seafood, curry, kimchee, etc as the other gamjatang options). We ordered the 4 portion option, as well as gamja pajun (potato pancake)!I LOVE potato pancakes (LATKES!), and seriously - didn't even know that my people had our own type of potato pancake. It's AMAZING.It is a bit of work to eat the Gamjatang, as the meat comes on the bone and you have to pick the meat off with chopsticks, and it's really messy, but it's SO GOOD. I also really enjoyed the sweet wasabi dipping sauce that added another layer of flavor on the pork + vegetables. Definitely not a date dish as it's really sloppy to eat, but it's so worth it!After we had eaten our fill of the pork and vegetables, they made a fried rice dish with the leftover stew afterwards. I ate so much I needed to lie down for a few hours afterwards. Even with the four portion option, the 6 of us ate to our hearts content and ended up shelling out $22 per person. I was literally just here a few days ago, but I'm sitting here wondering if I can get someone to go back here with me this week! SO GOOD!
<review# 290,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2012,3/16/2013,458,267,6,10,9>Here's another long overdue review. Tienda Vieja has been in the neighborhood for about 5 years now, and we've been coming here for just as long. If you know the area, you know that Spanish food of any kind is very hard to come by, let alone Colombian food. Needless to say we were ecstatic when this place opened. Always friendly service, and the restaurant itself is pretty simple, spacious and rarely busy. You can dine in, take out and have food delivered. In fact, most of their business is take out and delivery, so don't be alarmed when you see the place empty every time you pass by. The food is very good, and as near as I can tell business is booming. I've been coming here since they opened, and I'll continue to be a customer. Tienda Vieja is really an asset to the area, and I'd like to thank everyone who has supported, and continues to support this place ;-)
<review# 291,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2014,7/22/2014,156,170,7,10,9>Talk about things you love about Queens and Rincon Criollo might just be part of that conversation. The diversity of foods just makes you forget about your passport and grab a metro card! Rincon Criollo is in a crazy busy part of Corona (which part isn't busy?). But its pretty much the best Cuban Restaurant I know in NY. (I don't know much, so take it as you will) Not only is the food great, but the service is pretty top notch! Not only are the servers attentive, but polite, amicable, and you're not limited to your 1 server but any of the servers in the restaurant. They all kinda just come by the table and ask if you need anything! (I posted a pic of one of the servers going ALL OUT, dancing, singing and shouting congratulating a couple on an anniversary dinner. They really make a scene of it!)The best part of the place is the food:The Chicharon de pollo is pretty much the overall winner so far. Hands down one of the best entrees in the place!If you're craving a little red meat at a great price, the Bistec rincon Criollo is pretty good. Good portion size, its not a Great steak (its pretty much flat and cooked well done) but its well flavored with the onions on top. The breaded pork chop cutlet was HUGE! Each entree comes with 2 sides.My favorites are the Sweet Plantains (maduros) and the Cassava in garlic sauceI hear the desserts are good, but there's always so much food I never have enough room for dessert! A gem in Corona!
<review# 292,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2014,7/21/2014,90,59,7,11,6>Yet another native New Yorker who finally broke down and decided to learn how to drive before he turns 30 here! Weary from not so good experiences with other driving schools, I put all of my eggs in my Yelp basket, found my way to Learn-Rite and bought their 5-course package.I knew this school would be way ahead anything else I had experienced before from the moment I walked into the Flushing office. Open, clean and friendly (gives you Dentist office tease), the office was what all schools should aspire to be; approachable. Low and behold Approachability would prove to be a reoccurring theme of my time studying with Learn-Rite. From my 5-Hour class with Elizabeth to my 5 lessons with the incomparable Rebecca, to just a few days ago where I received my license from the Great State of New York, the entire experience was been wrought with friendly, professional and helpful service.  As for my driving instructor, where to start? Rebecca, who is not only an experienced driver/driving instructor but also teaches people how to fly planes was all that and a bag of funions. Possibly insane but absolutely hilarious, she made driving a fun learning experience. I felt like I was driving with a friend a most of the time; cracking jokes, sharing and over-sharing. Many times I would have to slow down because the hilarity would not stop. Learning with her made driving seem second nature...quickly reminding me to pay attention to my surrounding, polish up on distance and a load of other techniques, Rebecca helped take the fear and tension out of being a new driver.With license in hand, I can absolutely say that trekking out to Flushing on the Q25 was absolutely worth it. I'd love to see Learn-rite expand to other parts of Queens but do appreciate that this type of service is usually best kept small and intimate. Regardless I see nothing but good things for this company. All the best to them and their future students! Thanks for everything!
<review# 293,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/16/2013,7/20/2014,43,102,5,8,7>I can honestly say that it has been nearly 10 years since I last ate at Spice (Union Square location), so sitting down to eat at the LIC location was a bit of a throwback.Of course, this time around I wasn't a twenty-something early in his career and eating on a budget; now I am a thirty-something deep into a new career as a teacher and toting two young kids and eating on a budget...the more things change, the more they stay the same!That also applies to Spice: new location, same taste, same value.  I got here for the lunch special (11:30AM-3:30PM every day, weekends included), and I'd suggest you do as well.  Each entree comes with an appetizer, so that helped with feeding the kids.  We ordered Chicken Curry, Home-style Beef Panang, and Three-Flavored Whole Fish with Andaman Dumplings and Signature Shrimp Fritters as apps.  Long story short - they were all good, and the two adults AND two kids left happy and full.  Even had leftovers of the beef and the whole fish to take home, which I happily dipped into later that night.
<review# 294,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2014,7/19/2014,66,77,6,7,6>I like this place. If you don't then I'm sorry to say, this is really your only option for ice cream crepes so learn to like it haha. The crepe shells are soft which is what you would expect from a french crepe. From the reviews it seems like its supposed to be more of a Japanese crepe, which is crunchy but I'll explain later on why I like it soft. Its lightly salted so it complements the sweet ice cream and topping very well. The ice cream is shipped to them and seems below average. Its more water then heavy cream. My family owns a ice cream store so I know a thing or two about ice cream. Now on to how I eat it. First of all, throw away the spoon. You won't need it. The crepe is okay/salty, the ice cream is below average. Dissecting this thing apart with a spoon won't help your enjoyment. Second, EAT IT LIKE A SANDWICH. The soft crepe makes this possible. Take a big bite of it and experience the complex mix of salty, sweet, cold and warm. Once I started doing this, I started to appreciate this place.
<review# 295,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2013,7/18/2014,1041,271,8,12,9>I don't oftentimes bestow five stars on a restaurant but in the instance of The Sandwich Bar they are well deserved. Of course the five stars of this sandwich joint are relative only  to the universe of sandwich shops. On one hand they discovered the secret sauce of sandwich success!  But on the other hand this isn't alchemy. It's about connecting the dots of common sense.So without further ado here are the ingredients of The Sandwich Bar's secret sauce: 1. High quality ingredients. 2. Great recipes. 3. The right bread. 4. Ambiance. 5. Knowledgeable and friendly staff.The Ditmars Blvd area in the Queens neighborhood of Astoria is home of some of the best restaurants in New York City, blending great food and price points.  I chose The Sandwich Bar from the many restaurants available to me and I'm glad I did. The room is warm and inviting and full of earth tones. The lower than usual bar is very inviting and so is the staff. I was immediately greeted by Christina who sat me down and she took my order.  She was friendly, very knowledgeable and efficient. And now for the food...I sheepishly ordered the meatball parmigiana sandwich. Christina said that the meatballs were homemade; I've heard that before I thought to myself. Shortly afterwards my sandwich arrived. And what a sandwich it was! It wasn't small but it wasn't obnoxiously huge either. The meatballs were spiced well and perfectly textured. The sauce was a bit too acidic for me but it tasted great. Topping the sandwich was perfectly melted mozzarella cheese. But these great ingredients alone didn't cross the goal line. The piece de resistance was the bread! Not those frozen dough, place in over for 23.5 seconds sort of stuff, served-up as subs that way (wink, wink)  at other places. No this was the real deal. Later that evening I returned with my GF for a quick dinner. This time it was Jenn that helped up. Christina had relinquished her waitress duties to bar tend. We started with the fried chicken strips that came with the best honey mustard sauce I've ever had.  This time around I ordered the roasted turkey and my GF ordered the brisket. Both tasted great but the mostly white-meat  turkey was a bit dry for my taste. Both sandwiches were well dressed with their respective toppings. In both instances we could only finish half the sandwiches and enjoyed the balance earlier today. I can't wait to go back.
<review# 296,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2014,7/17/2014,181,68,7,8,6>I really like this kung fu tea location, reasons being:1) THERE IS A SEATING AREA2) THEY ACCEPT CREDIT CARD AND THERE IS NO MINIMUM... seriously more bubble tea spots need to get with the program3) You can expect good quality tea from this chain, and the boba is always fresh with the perfect amount of chew.My favorites for Kung fu tea have to be passion fruit green tea with tapioca, honey green tea with tapioca and herbal jelly, and any green tea variation really. Dislike: the taro milk tea, not just at this location but all kung fu locations. Taro is one of the best milk tea flavors but it has a strange after taste in this chain. Because of this I have yet to try any of there other milk teas for the fear its going to have the strange after taste. For now I'll just stick to tea without any milk.
<review# 297,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/4/2014,7/16/2014,424,43,6,10,10>Kulu in Flushing... how exciting! I love dessert places and I'm so glad they opened up one in Flushing. Even though there's already a ton of bubble tea/sweet shops. Though I went before their official grand opening the decor looked nice. It definitely looked like something i picture a lot of kids to young adults hanging out at. Service was nice. Since it wasn't too busy we had 4-5 people helping us. Then again we did also order a lot of drinks and desserts. I had the Mango Pomelo and it was made pretty much exactly what I had imagined it to be. My friends thought it was too sweet. The Papaya smoothie was very sweet but again I don't mind it since I love Papaya. I also had the Grass Jelly which wasn't anything too special just grass jelly. I also tried the Mango Sago with Pudding. My friend did not like it and neither did it. It tasted like burnt tofu. o.o Not sure what that's about but could be just not made properly. Overall it looks like it could be a pretty poppin place. Would I come back here? Yes, excited about the crepe. Mmmm
<review# 298,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2014,7/15/2014,98,71,4,7,5>Anything i have tried from this bakery has been DELICIOUS.  All the pastries, breads & chocolates - all fresh.  The homemade chocolates are all fantastic (ive probably tried them all by now).  There are only $20 a pound which is really not bad (i mean Kosher cold cuts are more expensive then these chocolates).  Most of them are filled with a ganache and the favorite (of my family & friends) is always the long cylinder shaped one.  The chocolate covered cherries are my personal favorite and im pretty sure they have rum in them.Moving onto the pastries... At only $2.50 each they are a steal as they are not only all delicious but fairly large.  Most bakeries in the City sell pastries and slices of cake for $4.99.  There are slices of a particular chocolate cake with a cream filling which is really nice, its moist and not too sweet.The spinach pie is awesome!! I love it, and hot or cold, its really tasty and hits the spot.  They have a wide selection of cookies and alot of beautiful cakes (havent tried the porcupine one yet but its on my list).
<review# 299,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2014,7/14/2014,118,313,7,11,8>These cute, quaint little cafes seem to be opening up all over the place along Northern Blvd. This place comes off super trendy and I love their bench seating outside. As a coffee lover, their selection is utterly drool worthy. I love the wooden seating - their overall decor and ambiance makes it extremely welcoming. I was there again just this morning no more than a half hour after their doors opened at 7AM, and I was half expecting a cold shoulder followed with the "it's too early to be nice to you" attitude you get from some of these fancy looking little shops. I was wrong. He was extremely kind and smiley. Even to my chatty 4 year old who couldn't for the ever thinning patience of mine, figure out if she wanted a parfait or a cold oatmeal for breakfast. Their added bonus would be the parking lot. I think on a "me day", in the middle of a weekday afternoon, I'd just like to find a corner at bean & bean to park my ass and hide away at with my laptop and copious amounts of coffee. Just for a few hours.
<review# 300,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2013,7/13/2014,36,186,6,21,10>My wife and I just moved to Astoria and wanted to find a new gym. We decided to tour the closest gyms to see which one was the better fit. We walked into Life Health & Fitness and were immediately greeted by a lovely woman named Jackie who gave us a tour and explained their membership options to us. She gave us each a 3-day pass (good for consecutive days once you activate it) and signed off on the special rates she mentioned if we joined together. After our 3 days, we joined right away!They have free towel service (small towels are readily accessible in the front, but I believe you have to ask for larger towels for showering). The locker rooms are spacious and clean. Several bathroom stalls and shower stalls. There's a steam room, too. We haven't tried that yet, but its been working every time we go and people seem to enjoy it. There's also a bar with protein shakes, drinks, fruit, etc if you need to fuel and a small seating area with tables.They have a nice selection of cardio equipment (treadmills, elliptical, steppers, stairmaster, jacob's ladder, stationary bikes, row machines). Each treadmill has a television and there are big TVs spaced out above the ellipticals and steppers. The treadmills don't have the keyboard option to punch in your speed so it can be annoying to do interval work. The cardio machines fill up super fast during busy hours, but I've never had to wait (or seen anyone else wait) longer than 5 minutes. And generally there's another type of machine open if you're not too particular.Thus far, we haven't used the free weights or weight machines, but they have a nice selection. There's an open area with TRX bands, BOSU, stability balls, kettle-bells, ab rollers, trampoline, etc. A section on the side with punching bags and a speed-bag, and in the very back- dumbbells, barbells, benches, and the more "manly" strength options. What I REALLY love about this place is the fitness classes! Here's a rundown:GET RIPPED: This class is tough, but not grueling. You get a pair of dumbbells from the rack in the corner. This class is popular though, so if you have your heart set on a mid-range weight, make sure to elbow your way through the crowd or you'll be left with either the lowest or heaviest weights. No mats. The warm-up is basic stuff- high knees, jumping jacks, etc. Then its a series of strength moves, mixed with a bit of light dance. So Terrence will have you move your hips to the rhythm of the song and then add in various strength moves. There's also floor circuits with lots of planking and push-ups. Its a great workout! Be sure to bring water!BOOT CAMP: This one is super tough.  Lots of push-ups, burpees, box jumps, planks, squats, and laps. Yes. He made us leave the actual gym THREE separate times to do a lap around the block. It is nonstop, no breaks, heart thumping out of your throat fast-paced. I'd love to try it again...in about 3 months. Better for intermediate to advanced level people.CYCLING w/ED: This was my first spin class. Ed was amazing at showing me how to set up the bike and how to have proper form. He's apparently a DJ, so the music is pumping and will definitely get you psyched! It is challenging, but Ed is super encouraging and gives you ample water breaks to catch your breath. I'll definitely be going back to this class!ZUMBA: My Mom takes a Zumba class back home and is forever telling me to try it, so I finally gave in. But holy crap....this was NOT my mother's Zumba class! This class was tough! I was sweating like a beast!!! The instructor, Mabel, could move her hips in ways I still don't understand. What a great calorie burn, though! Don't worry if you're not coordinated- there were all levels of dance ability in this class and I never felt weird or silly. VINYASA YOGA w/DAWN: I love this class! Its certainly not the toughest cardio-wise, but you WILL get your heart-rate up and you will most definitely sweat! And if, like me, your upper body is not particularly strong- it will be challenging. If you're not very flexible, there are yoga blocks to help with variations. Dawn is a wonderful and very attentive instructor. Friday night classes are a great way to wind down from the hectic week. If you're new to yoga and get confused with the lingo, stick with it! You'll catch on quickly and then you can focus on moving through your vinyasa, rather than wondering what the heck a vinyasa is :)Overall, this gym is amazing! I love the staff, instructors, and fellow members. Super friendly and non-judgmental. And for the price, you simply cannot beat it!
<review# 301,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2013,5/26/2013,50,111,7,8,6>I really do love the peace and calm you can find at Astoria Park in the morning hours.  Joggers, dog walkers and the quiet.  Armed with a cup of coffee and the day's newspaper, I can sit on the benches near the Hellsgate bridge side and stare out over the water for hours. It's very relaxing.Or if you like sun and activity more, there's the open grassy expanse in the center of the park.  Bring a blanket and picnic with some friends.  This is also a great place to people-watch...hilarious sunbathers, yoga gurus, kite flyers, people attempting strange and ridiculous forms of martial arts.  If you don't mind people and are looking less for privacy and mind-clearing moments, come later and enjoy the day.A view of the city just before dusk can be seen from the sidewalk at the bottom of the park's hill.  Great for budding photographers or anyone interested in a great view. There's more to this park for certain - like a gigantic pool, a track and fitness area and tennis courts.  Have a day at Astoria Park, it's totally worth it.
<review# 302,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2013,5/25/2013,44,113,3,7,4>4.5 stars actuallySo I was moving..again..and I was deep in queens and didn't know anything around me... a quick yelp search and Wafa's came up... after perusing the menu I realized i was salivating a little too much and figured that was a sign that I needed to try it... I walked in and it is a cozy little spot, that was pretty busy around 7 pm on Saturday night.  Immediately the middle eastern music made me smile.  I was greeted right away and told them I wanted to place an order for takeout...Now the menu I honestly wanted to try every appetizer bc it was everything that my mama makes back home and as I have been craving her food and missing home I was tempted to order every last item... however self control took over and I ordered a kibbe and the swiss chard soup.  My entree was the mixed grill platter with Shish Tawook( chicken on the grill) and shish kebab ( lamb kebab), it comes with two choices and i decided on the hummus and rice.  I also ordered two chicken shwerma sandwiches for the two people that helped me move my stuff... i'm nice like that...Anyway back to the food, the reason I took off half a star was the wait time the young lady said 15 minutes however 30 minutes later I was still waiting...I got home and my salivary glands were in overdrive especially as I first emptied out the cargo van before I started to eat... The kibbe was on point... not dry not overcooked just right! The swiss chard has probably got to be one of my favorite soups I have tried in nyc... the lemony light goodness of the soup with a nice balance of lentils and swiss chard was awesome...now on to the main dish... it was HUGE! I mean I opened up the container and was like how am i suppose to finish all of this... The chicken honestly was so moist and flavorful and the kebab was not dry and just done ever so right... i loved the fact that with their rice they put lentils as well yummy! and the hummus was just creamy goodness! perfectly seasoned just the way i like it...The guys loved the sandwiches as well, they kinda inhaled them....I was honestly in a food coma when I finished but I was smiling the whole time...I really hope I have a reason to be back deep in queens as I feel the need to go back soon... very soon.....
<review# 303,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2013,5/24/2013,286,298,12,24,20>***This review is based on swimming pool membership only.I've been coming to the Astoria Sports Complex pool for over a month now. (Operation exercise-so-that-I-can-eat-as-much-as-I-want is officially a go!) I used to swim competitively year-round in high school and I've always loved swimming so it's nice having a reliable and inexpensive place to swim in my own neighborhood. Membership rates are the cheapest I've seen for a pool and I didn't have to pay a registration fee for one year's membership. I believe the price varies depending on the deals and promotions they have going on at the time. About the pool: OK first things first. The pool is not Olympic-sized as advertised, which is obvious as soon as you see the pool. For those unfamiliar, an Olympic-size pool is 50m x 25m so that lanes can be set up short course (25m) or long course (50m). ASC's pool is 22yd (about 20m) x 4 lanes - so it's shorter than short course. If you're training to compete you'd better find another pool that is actually Olympic standard. That said, the size of the pool is just fine for lap swimming as exercise.The four lanes are labeled by pace, but I've never seen anyone follow the signs. This isn't a big deal because the pool is rarely crowded. On weekdays after 7PM there are never more than two or three people in each lane and there were a few days I was lucky enough to have an entire lane to myself. A life guard is always on duty. Their rule of 1 hour only of swimming per day is loosely enforced, and children are not allowed after 8PM. The pool closes at 10:30PM and I'm usually out way before then, but the one time I was there later than usual I was kicked out of the pool at 10:15PM so I wouldn't plan to stay all the way until "closing."According to their website the pool is kept at 82 degrees, which I recall thinking felt slightly warmer than I'm used to when I first started swimming at ASC. I've since adjusted to their temp. The water is a little murky but the amount of chlorination is pretty standard. They have kick boards and pull buoys available to use to workout. They don't have flags up for swimming backstroke or a poolside pace clock for swimming sets. The women's locker room adjacent to the pool is equipped with the standard bathrooms, showers, lockers, and benches. You're expected to bring your own lock and you can't leave anything overnight unless you rent a locker. There are coin-operated hair dryers, but no swim suit dryers. Overall, ASC is a no-frills-get-what-you-pay-for kind of place, and that's fine by me.
<review# 304,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2013,5/22/2013,223,77,6,9,8>This is the best place to get Brazilian BBQ in Astoria (or Long Island City? Who knows these days). Unfortunately, I live way west of the N/Q line, so this place is a bit of a trek for me to get to as I often opt to walk. Maybe this is a good thing. Otherwise, I'd be here every day!One of the reasons why I'm in love with this place is because of the hot buffet bar. They generally have a great selection of dishes that you can choose from. You don't often see robust fare like lasagna or stews at a buffet like this. It's usually the wimpy side dishes that occupy those spaces. Of course, the real star of the show is the meat. Like everyone else has mentioned, you go into the corner and ask the person at the station to load your plate up with meat! Their selections are really moist and well seasoned, and I've never had a bad experience at the counter. If there is one tip I could add, it would be to TIP the person working at the meat counter! I don't know if its the time of day I usually visit (which is always at the end of the day) but their tip jar is generally too malnourished!
<review# 305,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/10/2012,5/21/2013,76,131,11,13,11>I might need an intervention.After the former M. Wells closed, I committed to trying to show more restraint when the new incarnation was born.  Like a failed New Year's resolution, it lasted about a month... and last week I found myself feasting there with friends two days in a row.I'm ordinarily not a sensationalist, and I acknowledge that M. Wells has gathered an obnoxious amount of hype.  But try as I might to find something I don't enjoy, I can't.Chef Dufour's culinary wizardry genuinely is intoxicating.  Many chefs have said that at this point in history, no new dishes are created anymore, merely reinvented.  But M. Wells actually defies that, turning flavors on their head and smacking you in the face with something refreshing, playful, sometimes decadent, but almost always exquisite.Do you have to wait sometimes for a table or even dishes?  Maybe.  But the payoff is well worth it.  What you contribute is what you get back with the staff.  Come in a hurry wanting to rush your experience, and leave disappointed.Come with an open mind to have great conversation with friends, doodle with crayons in the desk while awaiting your food, ask your server her/his personal favorites, stop and observe the faces of fellow diners around you in awe over their dishes... and you will have a wonderful, unique experience.There is nothing else like it... anywhere.  And I simply love it.
<review# 306,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2013,5/20/2013,383,301,8,11,8>First time here the other night for a gathering/birthday event. I was pleasantly surprised by the venue!Food: there were complaints from my friends that some of their items were slightly high in salinity, specifically the noodles, but I was very impressed by everything else. The "Yan Su Ji" or Taiwanese Style Fried Chicken "Nuggets" are so good here that they rival some of the neighborhood authentic Taiwanese places! The fried dumplings or "guo tae" ("pot sticking/stickers") as per Elsie W.'s review, are phenomenal! Portions are smaller than I had hoped for, however. We made up for it by ordering multiples of each item. I must say that the Blue Moon Beer on tap here seemed very watered down. This made it lose one star.Service: extremely responsive! It took me a while to figure it out, but I could pick up the phone, press the middle button and tell the server(s) precisely what I needed. This is perhaps better than a system of pressing the "call" button and expecting the server to come in and hear your order over the KTV system.Decor: the small room for $60 (rate on weekends and Friday evenings) was probably large enough to fit 10 people. It's a great deal, until you realize that the food prices are slightly high. However, you get what you pay for. The bottles are on par with other competitors in Flushing. The sound system is amazing, though I found that there is a bit of a learning curve because the Karaoke song selection system is unlike anywhere I've been to. The bar area is slightly odd in the sense that there is hot pot being cooked at the restaurant very close by. It's an interesting mix, not sure how I feel about it. I need to spend more time at this bar to soak up the atmosphere (and the smell of cooking hot pots).Oh, and I must mention that Jando bought me a shot of Jameson for my birthday at this bar! He's the man!This will now become my go-to KTV place in Flushing. Since Zebra Lounge 1 is under construction and this is a significantly safer area to be in anyway, I may just drop Zebra 1. Kindly note that prices are slightly higher than competitors in the area but again, you get what you pay for (generally speaking).
<review# 307,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2013,5/19/2013,227,484,8,11,10>I had to come a few times to try out the soup dumplings and other dishes before I could write my review.  Also I'm holding out on sharing with you guys because I don't want long lines at this new place.  This new place isn't centrally located and we wouldn't have known about it if we didn't drive by.  As everyone else mentioned, parking is sparse but is available.  You have to circle the block and go to the side streets for parking.  So after eating the steamed tiny buns 3x, we decided we like them.  The flavor inside is cleaner, less oily, and lighter than that of Joe's Shanghai.  The broth also looks clearer and the soup inside tastes sweeter.  I also judge my mini buns by the ability to stand up to my chopsticks.  No breakage is a good sign.  Breaking and leaky soup buns make me angry.  I've been getting a lot of breakage at Nan Xiang at Prince.  I believe they changed their recipe for the bun.I hate waiting in line at Joe's Shanghai and the skin on their buns are a bit thick.  They also put so much MSG and oil in all their dishes, it makes you so thirsty you have to finish a pot of tea.  I give this place 4 stars because their other dishes are pretty good as well and they have a large menu with a variety of Shanghai cuisine.  Their pan fried dumplings are awesome, not thick skinned, perfect golden crust, un-greasey, seasoned pork filing.  Cha Chiang Mien, Shanghai fried rice cake, stewed beef w/noodles, and watercress w/enoki mushrooms were very good dishes.The only thing that wasn't good that we've tried was the fried bean curd and bean noodle soup.  The soup was a little bland, was thinking it was just an off night, for the price and the portion I'd give it another try.A light must get dessert is the sesame rice balls in soup.  So good!  They take a while to order so place the order when you get your dishes.  Sometimes the service is a little slow, because the staff is young and they mostly speak Chinese.  During dinner hours there is barely a wait.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be getting delivery at least once a week.
<review# 308,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2013,5/18/2013,734,760,13,14,14>Can you handle it? Can you handle 16 of 'em? ...Because I can't.My 16 Handles affair began 2 years ago in the East Village. Being a long-time PinkMango fanatic, I didn't like 16 Handles. Sure, I loved that they had a huge variety of flavors to choose from but did I like any of them? Nope. When it comes to froyo, I have a strong dislike for any flavors other than tart and pomegranate because the rest all taste artificial. I didn't exactly jump all over the place when 16 Handles came to Astoria but since I've joined Planet Fitness about 2 months ago and didn't want to make that boring trip to Red Mango, I've been frequenting 16 Handles.I've always loved the fun atmosphere of 16 Handles and looks like there's a whole lot more options of toppings since I've last visited one. They have lychee topping, which is a plus! They've also added a few fun flavors like egg nog (too sweet for my liking) and coffee. Unfortunately, my old stamp card has no value as they've also switched to swipe cards but I think I'm finally hooked after all these years!
<review# 309,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2012,5/17/2013,7,71,7,9,10>S Prime is A++ in my book!I couldn't say better things about this place!  This was my first time here and I couldn't wait to write a review.  I had an amazing experience and wanted to share it with the world!  We had 7:30 reservations on a Thursday nite.  To my surprise, there weren't any patrons inside.  I know this place has only been open for about 2 months now so the word hasn't gotten out...but it should!  I just can't get over the meal I had here. We were promptly sat towards the back at a rather huge table with super comfortable leather seats.  The table was a bit raised up right in front of an open display case of hundreds of wines!  I was already impressed and I haven't tried one thing yet.  We were greeted by our lovely waiter, Kate.  She was such a sweetie and answered all of questions from menu selections to wine/steak pairings.  By the way, the menu's they give out are quite gigantic!  I couldn't get over the vast selection of wines!  I'm no wine expert so I asked Kate what I should order with our steak and she recommended two bottles but also suggested by the glass.  I figured let's go all out and go with a nice reasonable priced bottle so we decided on the Siena? I believe that's what it was called.  The apps. came next.  Once again, our waiter suggested we try the Tartare's.  They had three kinds!  Steak, Spicy Tuna and Salmon.  I couldn't decide so we opted for the Trio Sampler.  You get a taste of all three! Yummy!  I enjoyed all of them but my favorite was the Spicy Tuna.  Maybe I'll do that next time.  Next Kate brought out a selection of breads - Multigrain, Pumperknickel and one other one.  We swallowed the bread like no tomorrow while munching away on the tartare. Wait! did I mentioned, one of the waiters brought out a sampling of a butternut squash soup on the house!  Yummy! Now the main course - Porterhouse for 2!  I've had this type of steak at many steak houses but this one actually blew them all out the water!  The main reason is that S Prime cooked my steak perfectly!  Sometimes you go into a place and you ask for Medium, they bring it out Medium Rare or in some cases, very well done.  You never get it just as you like it.  At least for me.  I love Medium to medium rare but I'm afraid it was going to be too rare so I had asked for Medium to medium well with a little pink inside as to not cook it too well and the steak came out perfect!  The steak just melted in my mouth.  My wife and I were some happy diners last night!  We ordered two sides - Cream Spinach and Garlic Mash Potatoes.  Both to die for!  Towards the end of our amazing experience, the manager or owner (not sure) brought us a complimentary sampling of another wine from one of their wine tastings. I was just lost for words at this point.  Dessert?  Nope.  Sorry.  Me and the wife were so full!  In summary, service was over the top perfect, the food was simply amazing and the decor was spectacular.  I can really go on and on about this place but I'm going to have to stop myself.  I really hope this fine establishment does well in the coming months and hopefully for years!  Forget about Manhattan!  Forget about Peter Lugers or Benjamin's Steakhouse or Uncle Jacks.  S Prime is where it's at!
<review# 310,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2012,5/16/2013,90,616,6,8,7>Like most typical Chinese restaurants, the decor and hygiene is understated.  I find Shun Wang an awesome place to meet with family, friends, even a date.  It has a bathroom and ample seating for about 70 or more.  It has quick seating.  I felt that the service from waitstaff was prompt as well as personable.  I came in on a Friday evening and was able to get a table for 9 immediately.  Shortly after, we sat down at 6 pm, the place was starting to fill up.  By the time we left around 9 pm, the entire restaurant was 80% full, so I recommend heading there around 6 pm if you despite a wait before a huge delicious meal.  We ordered a number of meals including: Siu ji yook(that is as good as I can say it phonetically)/roast pork with crispy skin-now, this is an incredible creation, with enough hoi seen(sauce that comes with this dish), the meat is flavorful.  Just think of a huge pig on a rotisserie grill, and there you go.  The skin is similar to those pork rinds that you find in the junk food section of your local deli. Yes, very crispy indeed.  I loved this!Frog legs-these were deep fried in batter and cooked with random small vegetables, not badwonton soup(2 bowls)-freshly wrapped wontons in a soup with sliced scallions and scrumptious broth.  Very appetizing, but maybe not so big to constitute your whole meal(unless you were not that hungry).  sauteed clams in black bean sauce-amazing, I found that the sauce was prepared just right.  This is one platter of great flavor and definitely one of my favorites herepork chop dish-drenched in a sweet honey sauce after the chops were fried, was our group table favorite, so awesome that we had to bring some home to eatoong choi-Chinese vegetable resembling large green straws, sauteed in oil and garlic.  It has the texture of spinach and kale and is a juicy vegetable with leaves
<review# 311,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2014,8/21/2014,410,456,6,10,9>My boss Jack can't stop raving about this place like it was the best Italian restaurant in the whole of New York & I remember stopping here once,  years ago but didn't quite leave an imprint on me... I guess it all depends upon the kind of food you order. Don Peppe is located at 135-58 Leffert's Blvd, South Ozone Park, between 135 & 149th Ave, 11420.Well, last Friday my boss took us all to Don Peppe's  & specially ordered his favorite dishes.   It was also to celebrate one of our lawyers ....Pat's birthday. We all crammed up in his small car, 5 of us in the back seat, and 2 in the front seat, we were lucky we didn't bump into a cop otherwise we could have been flagged down.  As soon as we we were seated.......He started his litany of orders starting from the 4 bottles of wine...Bread in Baskets & butter. then came the Baked Clams, Don Peppe Special Salad, Pimento & Anchovies for appetizers..We didn't even wait for the celebrant as he was tide up in court with a client.Then came the Pasta, Two kinds of Linguini, One with White Clam Sauce & with the other with Red Clam Sauce, It was delicious. (my favorite so far)  The celebrant arrived at this point.Then came the Veal Parmagiana, Breast of Chicken Marsala with Peppers, Mushrooms & Sausages, & the Lobster Fra Diavolo with Clams, Mussels & Calamari . It was awesome!!The Desserts  were equally appetizing too. Freshly made  Cannoli, Cheesecake &, Lemonchelo. It was glutony at its best!!! We can't hardly move after that..The waiters were all so attentive & on the go, Very pleasant bunch....BTW, No cards please Just Bring your cash!!!....
<review# 312,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/27/2014,8/20/2014,64,138,6,11,7>Finally made it to Il Bambino! I don't know HOW it took me so long, but I promise you, Astoria, I'm planning on making up for lost time. Like a lot of the restaurants here (I'm discovering), Il Bambino is small, intimate and unpretentious. The dining room only has a handful of tables (in plain sight of a fluorescent meat counter and coffee bar), but with the candles and dim lighting it's elegant enough to meet up for a date or with relatives from out of town. The menu is here is simple: salads and small plate "tapas" appetizers, paninis, and crostini. It took us approximately 1,000+ hours* to make a decision because EVERYTHING LOOKS DELICIOUS. Everything, everything everything. And surprise! Everything IS delicious! We ordered the String Bean small plate to share (baby string beans with toasted bread, shaved parmesan and truffle vinaigrette), I got the Prosciutto Panini (with fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers, olives and rosemary aioli) and my friend chose the Mushroom Panini (with fontina, truffle spread, "dirty chips," and caramelized onions). Without going into FULL dish-description-mode, everything we tried was great. 600+ Yelp reviews aren't wrong: Il Bambino takes simple, high-quality ingredients and smashes them together into plates of awesomeness. And the prices (for food and wine) are totally reasonable. Definitely going to be one of my new neighborhood staples!*Delicious food tends to make me exaggerate. CONSTANTLY.
<review# 313,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2014,8/19/2014,223,77,13,11,10>On occasion, I get some very intense pupusa cravings. The last time one struck me, I waited for the Q18 bus in the rain for close to 40 minutes just to get to Woodside. I could've certainly taken the train, but sometimes pupusa cravings can cloud my judgement. This place is awesome. I don't know the name of the guy that always takes my takeout order but he's really sweet and welcoming. Every time I walk in it feels like I'm breaking into someone's home. The atmosphere is just so welcoming. All the pupusas are good. The mixed ones are the best. It's illegal to eat them without the salsa and curtido (the cabbage salad), so make sure you don't break the law.
<review# 314,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2014,8/18/2014,71,370,5,9,5>This place would get 5 stars if it weren't so pricey.  My salad came out to $14!!!  (this is almost the same exact salad that I get at Cafe Metro in NYC everyday for $9 - the difference is that I get grapes instead of oranges)  Albeit the salad was HUGE but still, $14.  They charge a little more for certain ingredients.Decor = 5 StarsFresh/Delicious Food = 5 StarsFriendly Staff = 10 StarsProximity to home = 5 StarsThis is a cute little place located on Union Turnpike that offers really fresh food and great service.  Their menu mainly consists of fresh salads, wraps, bubble teas, Slushy drinks and some desserts like Rice Pudding and Frozen Yogurt/Gelato.I also tried:Almond Green Tea w/tapioca pearls = Good!Mangolicious Rice Pudding = Delicious!!!I like this place and now that I have tried it, I will most definitely order more often.BIG PLUS, They will be offering Veggie and fruit smoothies soon.  now I can get my Spinach/Ginger/Apple/Celery smoothies when I don't have the stuff at home!!!  YAY!!!
<review# 315,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,8/17/2014,134,610,6,8,10>"Welcome to the party Pal!" - John McClane, Die Hard . . .  and me after my first of many visits to Transmitter Brewing.A nano-brewery, meaning they make beer 5 kegs at a time.  Sounds like a lot, but it's tiny, like back when you were a kid and made water colors with those little cups, so you'd have a bit of paint to work with.  Know what I mean?  Okay, maybe not, but it's a tiny amount.So that allows the good folks at Transmitter to use good ingredients, charge high prices (supply & demand) and make excellent beer on a small scale.  I love excellent beer made of good stuff, so this is in my interest.Transmitter itself is a small place in an industrial area near Fresh Direct, located almost directly under the Pulaski Bridge from Long Island City to Greenpoint.  You can drive there or walk (from the 7 or whatever) - use the stairs up to the Pulaski Bridge as your guide.  Once you're at the base of the stairs, it's 15 feet, across the street.  Yes, it really is located off of Borden, yes the road to get to it is across from the ramp off of the Midtown Tunnel, yes you have to cross the train tracks.  Cross those tracks after looking both ways, walk 300 feet and it's on your right.I went there on their 2nd week open after having one of their beers during Queens Beer Week - wow.  WOW.  Lovely saison, wild yeasts, belgian styling, so good.  Came here to try their beers, found a small tasting room offering free sips of their newest bottled items, with same bottled items available for sale.  First was good, second was better, gladly bought a bottle for $15.  Beautiful label, cork stopper, sits in the fridge for sometime to enjoy this week.Long Island City is quickly becoming a craft beer hot bed with Rockaway and Big Alice - Transmitter may yet be the best of the bunch.
<review# 316,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2014,8/16/2014,275,34,10,13,15>We were told about Bakhter's by a family friend, and I'm SO glad we decided to give it a try. We've been back numerous times and it is truly the best Afghani food we've ever had. The white sauce isn't too thick and the portions are very big. We almost always order the Chicken Kufta and tika platter - you can split this with another person unless you're feeling extra hungry.The food is delicious, but service here isn't the best. You walk... choose a table and... wait. Sometimes you have to wait forever unless you make your way to the front and place your order, which I highly recommend. It isn't like most restaurants where you'll have a server and they'll consistently check-up on you. You grab your own drinks from the front and if you want to place another order, make yourself noticable. Bring cash!!! They do not believe in credit cards. *Also this place is not very vegetarian friendly.*Last piece of advice: If you're taking out, make sure you ask for extra white sauce and hot sauce because they'll give you very little.But all in all, the food is amazing.
<review# 317,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,8/15/2014,15,45,5,6,7>Subarashi! This small place is really thebombdotcom. When you enter, the lights are dim, the seats aren't uncomfortable chairs, they're quite comfy, the table is set up nicely, and the sushi bar is right next to you (depending on where you're seated), and the waiters are welcoming.Our server for the evening was Eddie, who was awesome with explaining what some of the dishes were and how many pieces of sushi/rolls/maki etc. it came with. (Thank you, Eddie!) *I don't know who Eddie is, but I feel the need to point out that he did a good job.*We started off with California rolls, which tasted fresh & weren't cold and hard like the ones that are supposedly freshly made at the supermarket. You can taste the difference... I didn't want them to disappear so quickly. ): they were so good! That avocado was perfect. But then... came our meal..The Chicken Udon Soup was the perfect warm meal to have on this cold rainy night. Perfect ratio of noodles, veggies (celery, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms), and chicken. The chicken didn't taste like the fake pieces you'll get with chinese take-out. It tasted like homemade chicken noodle soup. You can even drink the soupy part of the dish, the soup isn't salty, flat, or watery... I swear it's perf. They give you a hefty bowl too, so don't think it won't fill you up. It definitely will. Yum in da tum!~ The beef gyoza (which is sort of similar to a dumpling) is fried (or steamed) to perfection. They're not as thick as chinese dumplings, and they feel less heavy.The shrimp tempura rolls were SO YUMMY. The perfect amount of crunch, the teriyaki sauce drizzled on top, and the avocado all wrapped into one... I thank the sushi sensai of Japan for creating such delicacies.My friend ordered the chicken fried rice; compared to Dee Thai's fried rice (obviously they're two different types of asian cuisines) TJ had a healthier taste. Healthy is always better, yes? Yes, of course. SO LET'S GET MORE.To finish off, we had the tempura fried ice cream. Almost like the Thai fried ice cream, only the batter is fluffier and a tad sweeter (which I liked very much), and the green tea ice cream was creamy and sweeter as well. I personally like the Japanese version of fried ice cream better than Thai fried ice cream. I guess I just have a sweet tooth. :}The waiter(s) were super attentive and really nice. They refilled my glass like about 7+ times, lol.The bill came out to be almost similar to what's spent at a Thai restaurant, but at TJ's we had an appetizer & dessert included. Same pricing for the bill but more food involved?? What what! This place is great.Fresh, tasty, clean, welcoming... I like this. I like this very much.I believe I have a new spot. ;)**AND they have take-out/delivery. Oh boy. I think they have a new favorite customer.(Note that delivery might take a while. They make sure your order isn't rushed, so it can be freshly made and not sloppy. It's worth the wait!)
<review# 318,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,8/14/2014,165,4,5,8,9>Nusara is a clean and simple Thai restaurant with amiable service and delicious food. It wasn't overcrowded on a Saturday evening which worked in our favor. The service was attentive and fast. The hostess was very friendly as well.We ordered the green mango and crispy chicken wings for appetizers. The host offered us to try the seasonal green mango and I'm glad we did. I was a little skeptical when I noticed no spices or sauce were accompanying the sliced up green mangos on a plate. As soon as I tasted one piece I realized nothing else was necessary to make it more delectable. It had just the right amount of sweetness to it. The crispy chicken wings with the sweet sauce were pretty good as well. Next were chicken larb and panang duck. The deep fried roasted boneless duck in panang curry with white rice (which was molded into a butterfly shape, how cute!) was mouthwatering. You must try. We decided to wrap up the evening with the final item. Mango with sticky rice for dessert. O.M.G. It was the perfect sweets to end a perfect evening. We were already stuffed but devoured it as soon as it hit the table. Soo delicious! It's a seasonal dessert, so make sure to try it before July-August. I will definitely be back again. Soon.
