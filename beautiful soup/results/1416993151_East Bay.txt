<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/17/2014,11/25/2014,419,343,5,11,9>Instead of studying, I'm writing this review over freshly-brewed coffee and their scrumptious strawberry shortcake I had from the previous day. Yes, the shortcake is still firm to hold all that strawberry and whipped cream!CONCEPT: This is the brainchild of Alison Barakat, a former line chef at Chez Panisse who loved their buttermilk fried chicken whenever it was served and wanted to recreate the experience. She started selling these chicken sandwiches at farmers markets to tremendous success and fanfare that she opened up a little shop in Temescal that is only open from Tues-Sat 11-3 or when sandwiches run out, the latter being a more common scenario.VENUE: On the corner of Telegraph and 51st in Oakland's Temescal neighborhood. The ironing board tables are located on the sidewalk. It just adds to the quirkiness of the town. [Slightly off-topic: I fell in love with Temescal at first sight and I WILL be back here to check out the other cute stores that line Telegraph and the back streets]The actual store is bare-bones, but you don't need to look fancy just to serve sandwiches for three hours a day. Menu items are written in simple paper and marker.Bakesale Betty is easily spotted by the line of people around the store, but when I went on a Saturday afternoon, line went by quickly. I got their two signature items: their fried chicken sandwich and their strawberry shortcake. They also offer a fried tofu sandwich, chicken salad (everything but the bun) and a daily variety of cookies, which the offerings are written in the same style.Fried Chicken Sandwich ($7.75): The sandwich is served on recyclable carton. Inside is a burger bun with the signature fried chicken and a generous portion of their coleslaw. I dunno if the burger bun is a temporary fix but it looked better in roll form.As much as I liked the sandwich, I wasn't madly *in love* with it. It doesn't help I don't usually eat fried chicken sandwiches and I avoid cole slaw as a side. Technically it is a masterpiece, with crunchy skin and tender breast meat, the skin flavored enough with the right amounts of seasoning and spice to give it a kick at every bite. Jalapeños in the slaw enhance that spicy kick a bit and the greens do add flavor and are not just veggie filler. If you reheat in toaster oven it does retain the original flavor. Though one of the best chicken sandwiches I've eaten, I'm just not a fried chicken sandwich lady. Please forgive me.Strawberry Shortcake ($5): In contrast, I am madly in love with their strawberry shortcake and I would brave the line just to get it. There's a generous amount of strawberries and a dollop of cream at the corner, but the shortcake is firm enough to handle all the strawberry juices and cream. Each bite is just full of strawberry, cream and shortcake goodness. It's a perfect dessert meant to be shared or if you're living by yourself, can be enjoyed over several days.This is one of the must-eats of the Temescal neighborhood and at least now I understand what all the hype is about.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2014,11/24/2014,246,234,22,30,28>I had no idea that Semifreddi's does tours. We were lucky enough to get a guided tour by the owners. I love tours. Usually when it comes to food, the tour only consist of looking at the machines and the guide explaining what each one is used for. There is usually no activity.To my surprise Semifreddi bakes round the clock. We were able to see hamburger buns, Cinnamon rolls, Morning buns and variety of rolls in the making. They let us try their classic Sourdough bread, right off the rack. If you haven't tried fresh sourdough, you are missing out. We made a pizza using the focaccia bread and now that I know the bread is made fresh, we are new fan of Semifreddi.The owners gave us a run down on the facility from the flour/sifting room, yeast refrigerator, massive oven and several prep stations. The smell of bread and pastries baking was AMAZING!!The breads have the basic 4 ingredients...Flour, water, salt and yeast. Which makes them Vegan!! Yes HOLLA AT ME!! The only bread that isn't Vegan is the Challah, Cinnamon Twist, and Brioche. They do not offer any Vegan pastries.I found out they deliver to all the bakeries/stores every morning. Any bread that did not sell, will be removed from the racks and brought back to the facility and broken down as chicken feed. So if you are buying a Semifreddi bread, know that it is fresh. If you plan to do a tour here, there are a few rules no dresses (long pants), closed two shoes, no earrings, no jewelry with stones (bands are ok) and I recommend you wear a t-shirt (not long sleeve) or a thin long sleeve shirt. This place is hot, due to the oven being on all day long.The owner of the company is hilarious. I don't know how to describe his character...lets just say very interesting and out there. LOL. He made the tour a lot of fun. I definitely recommend Yelp CM's coordinate a tour here. It's one of the best food tours I've been to. In the end we received an awesome Schwag bag which contained (2) Biscotti, baguette, Rosemary Focaccia or Challah, Reusable shopping bag, French pastry (mines was a blueberry muffin), temporary tattoo, and a menu of their café. Thanks Semifreddi for the awesome tour!! Check out the awesome video below. This isn't fast forward, they really move this fast. Way Cool!!youtube.com/watch?v=iBfA…
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2014,11/23/2014,142,274,6,12,12>I counted 5 different potato dishes on the menu the day we came!  5!  Rack 'em up!  It was the best news!  Hopefully this wasn't just a fluke and my best friends are regulars on this creative and scrumptious menu.  The salt cod and potato cazuela was way in the lead for favorite.  This salty, savory, mouthwatering spread came with slices of baguette and hit all the right notes on my salted, pickled, and mayoed Russian palate. The fried potatoes with herbs and sea salt were pretty close to tie.  They were cooked perfectly with a delectable texture and seasoned flawlessly.Patatas bravas with a kind of roasted tomato sauce were messy and delicious.  If they were the lone potatoes of the menu, I would've been wholly satisfied, but with the multitude of other finger-licking potato dishes, they were only pretty good by comparison.  The cocktails are dangerous.  Creative and delicious, I gulped them down like water without a second thought.  I switched to a rosé towards the end of the meal to cut down on the alcohol content a bit and it, too, was impeccable!  And went wonderfully with my bread pudding.  I love that they don't take reservations -- it levels the playing field and sets up a laid back neighborhood feel.  Even when it was busy and they only had one server (I think), service was still pretty spot on and I didn't see anybody have to wait for a table.  Somehow, we drained almost 3 hours here!  Come with a full wallet, an empty stomach, and good company!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,11/22/2014,292,447,7,15,9>There are no words...yet I am going to expel a lot of them on this review so bear with me. It'll be worth it I promise! So I was sick on my birthday weekends and my plans to go to Foreign Cinema were thwarted. The weekend after my husband, the amazing husband that he is, called Pathos one Saturday afternoon and spoke with the Owner Nick who said that reservations were booked up, BUT he would call back and see if he could work something out. That he did. Upon arrival we were seated right outside the open kitchen, nice and toasty sitting in front of the wood burning fireplace. I am all about atmosphere and the décor and atmosphere here rivals some of the amazing places that my husband and I have found in NYC. Absolute beautiful yet comforting surrounding. Upon being seated Nick, himself waited on us. Between him, the bartender and the chef's we had an absolutely amazing time. Great conversation about the food, the inception of the restaurant, the beverages and wine...just top notch company to keep. Both my husband and I started with cocktails, and like Nique F. said if you are into mixology you will LOVE the signature bar selections. I started with a Aphrodite de Guadalupe, because anything with Lilikoi (Passion Fruit) is a favorite of mine and I thoroughly enjoyed that beverage. Down to the presentation of their cocktails, Pathos is beyond perfect. Next, I told the bartender I was trying to choose between two different drinks, and after telling her what sort of concoctions I like (No icky sweet, fruity frou frou drinks for me) she brought me a Demeter's Daughter. Whew...The complex combination of Gin, Rosemary, St Germain, Lavender Bitters & lemon peel blew me away. Wonderful drink! I know I am getting carried away with the booze but man, were they good. An even more celebrated topic with me though...FOOD. Oh where to start? With our cocktails we ordered up some of the small plates, Htapodi (Octopus with red onion and capers), Spanakopita & Dolmades (both of which are staples for us and two items in which we measure Greek restaurants up with) Simply put, Pathos has replaced our previous measuring stick of Kokkari, and is now the example that which all other restaurants are measured. Having said that...my third personal measure of greatness at a Greek restaurant is the Moussaka and lastly the Baklava. As it stands right now, my last meal on earth would consist of this creamy, perfect Moussaka and sweet, crispy Baklava. I know I have droned on for quite a while about this amazing restaurant but I truly did not want to miss a thing. This remains at the top of our favorite restaurants of all time and we will be back frequently!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2014,11/21/2014,82,62,4,9,11>This is the first vegan (and Asian vegan!) restaurant I've ever been to in my life and I'm ready to go back already! The service was quick and efficient. The waitress came and checked on me and my friend multiple times to make sure we were doing okay.I ordered the Crispy Ginger Seaweed Soy Fish. It was AMAZING. I was surprised at how much it tasted like real fish. In fact, it was better than most fish I've had in a while. I usually hate eating ginger too, but I thought it complemented the "fish" very well. The ginger didn't have such a stinging aftertaste to it compared to most ginger I've had. On the other hand, my friend thought the ginger didn't taste fresh. Despite his opinion on the ginger, we both devoured the fish.  i can't wait to come back.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,11/20/2014,340,339,10,11,12>Va de vi translated to English is "wine was." Since my Catalan is rusty (i.e. nonexistent), I would assume that the same syntax for English applies to Catalan as well... (Forgive me for the butchery I am about to commit and the ignorance I am about to display, Catalonians.) Va de vi amazing.Va de vi enhanced by the delicious tapas.Va de vi the catalyst of a glorious evening.Va de vi plenty.Va de vi happiness. I adore the ambience of Va de Vi. It is chic without being snobby, sophisticated without being pretentious. It is a great place for a date or to hang out with your girlfriends if you are in the mood to get gussied up.For this visit, we had the red wine flight. Their selections are all fantastic, and all the tapas we ordered complemented our drink. While all delicious, I think the clear winner for us was the risotto. It was simply perfection - creamy, cheesy and flavorful, it is the stuff you would think about for days after. The service was excellent as well. I love Va de Vi and will most definitely go back. I love it so much I chose to write this for my 200th review!
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/1/2014,11/19/2014,122,136,5,9,10>It's great to see Vallejo come up. I was all giddy to try this brew! I came on a weekday and the house was PACKED! Don't bother calling ahead because there are no reservations. Just come and find a seat where you can. They didn't disappoint with the brew. I loved them all. But my favorite had to be the stout. It was so malty and smooth! Really dark and rich! I suggest trying the sampler. Only 8$! Prices are reasonable her. And the service is great, despite the packed bar. Cody is like, the best bartender ever! I've been running into him at a few places I frequent and he always takes care of us. Ryan the owner is super super kind. He's out there on the floor with everyone else ensuring quality service, I LOVE THAT! I really really want this to stay successful. The view to the marina is fabulous. Go during sunset!! It's so gorge!!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2014,11/18/2014,206,658,8,10,10>I am kind of in love with Orchard Nursery and completely giddy about finding a new garden store to add to my rotation. The layout and attention to detail makes a trip here an experience versus a simple stop for plants. I felt as if I were treated to a mini botanical garden and I could wile away a good part of the afternoon looking at everything on offer.All the plants I saw looked healthy with glorious blooms. Their variety is top notch and I was especially impressed with the selection of lavender and sage, two plants that seem to do well in my sunny yard. In addition to seasonal items, they have perennial garden favorites, hanging floral baskets, ground cover, succulents and an adorable indoor plant section/florist, complete with nature inspired home decor.For $24.99, I left with some flowering sage, two succulents to add as border plants, and a small indoor fern. Customer service at the register was friendly, although no one seemed to be asking if I needed help while I was browsing outdoors. It was okay-I was kind of just lost in garden euphoria and knew what I was looking for.Definitely a 5 star nursery, but reserving the 5th star for after I plant everything and see how it does. Definitely worth a drive to Lafayette to check out!
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2014,11/17/2014,119,95,9,11,10>Too long, didn't read: Fun spot for everyone over 21, not just the Oakland hip or Hawaiian shirt aficionados. Attentive service, good location that's constantly growing, good focus on food, lay off the Fernet for a night and come get your happy drink on.If someone asked me what kind of bar-staurant Oakland needed, initial thoughts would be to serve a niche audience -- Juggalos with a sophisticated palate perhaps; a tiki lounge would not have been on the list. Upon my first visit, I was planing to just stick my head in to get a feel for the place. My partner G and I sat at the front which looked like a waiting area, but we were promptly greeted and given menus. G peppered the server with questions to make sure she's not allergic to anything--what couldn't be answered was found out. I scanned the menu for high protein foodstuff and was pleasantly surprised to see a few options. Back to Oakland and tiki lounges. Scanning around the room, it made sense to open a tiki bar. This downtown Oakland area is quickly becoming a dining/drinking hub for hip folks with a young attitude -- the problem is that's a very small part of the population. A tiki lounge attracts all people, one group looked like they came from a high school faculty meeting, another looked like regulars at Tribune. Longitude has a laid back environment, but serious where it counts -- service and quality. The Trinidad salt cod fritters (Caribbean fritters with a cilantro and roasted red pepper aioli) were served 5 to a banana leaf -- each large enough to be 2 bites worth. The fried exterior had a very thin crisp to it, the inside was soft and tender; each bite made me want to pause to enjoy it before stuffing my maw with another one. There was a slight mixup with the order of sweet potato fries, but it was quickly resolved with a fresh batch and every piece was devoured. For beverages, I'm not usually into fun drinks, but who wants to go to a Tiki lounge and gripe about that whale that escapes your harpoon year after year. I chose the Firecracker because of its curious ingredients: vodka, pickled ginger, lemon, and wasabi. As you can probably guess, it tasted like drinking sushi -- I mean that in the most laudable way (put that harpoon down). It would be fun to blindly order a bunch of  drinks and share them with your friends (who are free of communicable diseases), guessing the ingredients and which is what. The owner is the former manager of Forbidden Lounge in Alameda. Her mom created the illustrations on the menu and all around the restaurant. Kyoko is awesome server. I'll be headed back in proper attire next time.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/6/2014,11/16/2014,147,142,11,12,10>I mean. There are brunch places. And then there are brunch spots. This is The Spot. Lake Merritt is steadily booming, and rightfully so; this area has so many things going for it and Portal just adds to the hood perfectly. Located on the corner of block that makes me feel like I've apparated to Bushwick, rests this gem. The brunch menu is perfect in size and in offerings. You want breakfast? Cool get yourself some benedict or stuffed french toast. You want a bit of Mexican? I feel you, order the Chilaquiles - which are nachos with eggs that are finished with a sprinkle of of crack. Lunch you say? Pick from one of the bomb.com sliders. (which are only slightly smaller than normal sized burgers - you will think 2 is not enough when you order BELIEVE YOU ME TWO IS ENOUGH) You can also take off your bottoms for $18.* The staff is amazing. I don't want to say that everyone is queer...but I'm pretty sure everyone is. The folks that come for brunch are a lil bit of everything, making for a really great and communal atmosphere. If you can swing the wait time, get a table at one of the huge and gorgeous wood benches outside. This is easily one of my top three favorite spots in the bay thus far. Here's whatchya need to do: 1. Plan ahead - you are going to wait for about 45 minutes to an hour. For me this means eating prior to eating. Aint nobody trying to brunch with a cranky SOB.2. Bring/buy some booze of your choice and head to the lake to chill while you wait to get your brunch game on. 3. Eat everything and get happily drunk on the patio of Portal. 4. Go back to the lake and take a nap. And that is your perfect weekend brunch adventure. *By bottoms I mean alcohol. Bottomless amounts of it. But by all means please pay a server $18 and take your pants off. I will be the person smiling and raising my mimosa to you.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/30/2014,11/15/2014,54,200,1,11,6>Thanks to Yelp and Rita L for telling me about this awesome place! I went to the soft opening at the 10pm show.  It's located upstairs to Spice Monkey, which also looks like an awesome place to eat. Dinner and  comedy show for a great Sat night! Venue was great - open space, and still small and intimate for a good show. I really liked that there were a variety of performers, 5 comedians before the headliner came on. It was great that we could still order food and drinks for the show. Our waiter messed up an order or two  but it was no big deal and he was so nice about it comping us a drink.Overall we had a great time, and I look forward to seeing future comedy shows here.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/6/2014,11/14/2014,201,130,6,10,7>Holy Smokes!! What an absolutely perfect addition to our town.I had this place bookmarked forever and had mentioned it to my mom several times. She had given up coffee some time back and today was going to relapse, so whats a good daughter gonna do? Well, this one took her to Mountain Grounds. Cute from the get go. The owner met us at the door and was so very friendly. I ordered the Crème Brullee because I had to, it was a deal I made with myself and did not disappoint. However next time I must try a cold drink. Mom had a latte and then walked outside for a phone call. The owner remembered exactly what she had described her perfect coffee to be (I didn't) and made it perfectly. Then after chatting for a while he offered us cinnamon toast he has been playing with, sweet and delicious. I gladly took the stamp card as I will be back. Probably very soon.Oh and mom had a coffee rush the rest of the day! Perfect! A+..
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,11/13/2014,406,300,4,5,6>The perfect place to enjoy some tasty beers with some good friends. All the beers we ordered were great. Very complex flavors. Even the stout had some bright fruity notes. So good. The side dishes were solid. Not off the charts, but definitely interesting and well made. In order of enjoyment, we had the braised beef lettuce wrap (almost Koreanesque), the Thai curry popcorn, the pickled vegetables, the sammich (corn bread soaked in honey with a spread in between), and the miso pork sandwich. Tasty enough to stand up to the beer!I was impressed that when one my friends told the bartender that I like Prohibition Ale, the bartend recommended the Flanders Red ale. And they were right. I definitely did like it! Not to mention the ambiance was a great mix of cozy and hip. Extra points for style, lost & found!Our pours:Rodenbach Classic Flanders Red Ale ($9/12oz)Anderson Valley Brewery Company Heelch O' Hops Double IPA ($7?/12 oz.)
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/16/2014,11/12/2014,269,485,8,12,8>5 stars for Alejandro and the taco bar catering service!They did arrive 15 minutes late, which did make my heart race, since my party was starting in 15 minutes from they time they arrived and my guests were showing up early, but Alejandro was so fun and happy that it was hard to be stressed out.Our guests raved about how good the tacos were. The rice and beans and chips were excellent too!Since our party I have been to two other parties that used taco trucks and seriously neither were as good. One was really greasy and didn't even offer chips. Boo!!I love that they gave us all the leftover. We had amazing food for days!My only ehh, was that what Alejandro called guacamole tasted like green salsa. Maybe it was just a mis-communication, because I really wouldn't have expected them to include guacamole without an extra fee.They are a little on the pricier side for person compared to some other companies I called, but have a 40 person minimum vs. a lot of companies that have a 50 person minimum and they bring all the utensils, plates, napkins and extra tables with the serape cloths.We're going to a party tomorrow night from a friend who was at our party and they are using Rancho Grande Taco Bar Catering too.Can't wait to have some tacos!!
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2014,11/11/2014,158,99,6,12,8>I was craving a burrito after 2 months abroad in Asia. What is more American than Mexican food? (it's a joke, don't kill me) I went to the rusty trusty Yelp app to find a spot as I wandered around downtown Oakland and Ole Ole came with firm recommendations. I was not disappointed. The food here is super cheap and every order comes with a rainbow assortment of tortilla chips and access to the super fly salsa bar. The avocado salsa is everything everyone says--creamy yums. And the service is always extra friendly and efficient. Weekend mornings you see all manner of dudes and dudettes getting their breakfast burrito hangover grub and around lunchtime people working in the area flood the joint for their fast fix. It's not too big of a place so you might have to stand but I've never waited more than 20 minutes for an order. All of these perks combined with jumbo servings and a price tag usually $6 or less, I know where I'm going for burritos from now on.
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/14/2014,11/10/2014,279,212,5,9,5>Boiling Crab? Kickin' Crab? You might stone me for saying this, but I think Ray's Crab Shack might be better than both!Let me be completely transparent. We went to Ray's with little to no expectations. That's probably why I left so satisfied. Another reason is how much the other two make me feel oily and puffy (due to high sodium). However, Ray's delivered a great dining experience. GARLIC NOODLES ~ 4 stars: Much like Boiling and Kickin', Ray's garlic noodles are best enjoyed when you mix it with their sauce. Since their tables are lined with a clean sheet of wax paper when you sit down, just dump the noodles on the table and pour some of the sauce that's mixed with your boil on top. It adds a lot of flavor. If you haven't been doing this, you'll thank me when you try it. yelp.com/user_local_phot…SOFT SHELL CRAB ROLL ~ 2.5 stars: Too dry, not enough flavor and the fries were a little salty. They should put more mayo and/or slaw to counter the fried crab and french roll. The flavor was okay but eating it was comparable to stuffing your mouth with a handful of saltine crackers - Mojave Mouth. yelp.com/user_local_phot…CRAWFISH BOIL w/ MILD ULTIMATE POWER ~ 4.5 stars: The star of the show didn't disappoint. Sandy opted for the Ultimate Power sauce which is a combination of all their other sauces mixed together (Cajun Lemon Pepper, Original Cajun, Cajun Garlic Butter). First of all, the flavor was great. It was very similar to Boiling and Kickin' with a slight citrus note (from the lemon pepper) and good garlic flavor. But let's talk about how big Ray's crawfish are. They're huge! There were some in the bag with heads as big as a small chicken egg. That's a big win because it makes all that work so much more worth it. You have to admit one of the worst things about eating crawfish is all that peeling and pulling only to get one tiny morsel. Sandy has a huge crush on crustaceans, especially when it comes to crawfish. So her opinion probably holds more weight than mine since I'm just an average crustacean lover. She said Ray's is awesome and possibly better than Boiling and Kickin'. I don't blame her, I felt the same way. yelp.com/user_local_phot…All in all, the bill was only $33 pre-tip so I thought that was kind of awesome. Garlic noodles, soft shell crab roll and 1 lb of crawfish. I think that's pretty solid. We left full and satisfied - two things you should always walk away with from a solid restaurant.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2014,11/9/2014,110,127,7,14,11>It says a lot when you can walk into a restaurant not knowing if you'll enjoy the food or not, then walk out feeling confident about coming back and knowing you had a great experience and a fantastic meal. I must admit I am not a huge fan of Indian food, but Delhi Diner went beyond my expectations. The high quality of the food and service make this arguably one of the most professional and tasty Indian restaurants on Solano Ave and in the East Bay! Something I always like to recognize and appreciate is when a business owner not only actually works with their employees, but also introduces themselves to their customers and makes them feel welcome. When I ate here with my parents, Delhi Diner's owner, Subhash, greeted us warmly and made sure we were doing alright. Subhash told us he had over two decades worth of restaurant experience and that he believed in serving his customers the freshest and most authentic food possible. Your typical Indian all-you-can-eat buffet serves food that sits out in the open until it gets cold and needs to be reheated. Delhi Diner is strictly made to order and is served straight out of the kitchen(no stale naan bread or lukewarm curry here!).I ordered the chicken curry with medium spiciness and was very happy with how good it was! When you eat it over rice or use naan to dip it with, its very filling and flavorful. I was also able to try their vegetable samosas which were quite delicious, I could easily get full with the appetizers we ordered alone! Their idli sambar soup was one of my favorite dishes that I tried. I've had sambar at other Indian restaurants before but it always seemed to be missing something compared to sambar I had at one of my favorite Indian restaurants that closed its doors for good. Delhi Diner makes an incredibly hot and yummy sambar soup that is the closest I've had to what I remember to the sambar of my former favorite restaurant. The restaurant has a really sweet decor and is big enough to accommodate groups of people without feeling crowded. There's even live music played here at night during specific days of the week! This would be a great place to bring a date or have lunch or dinner with friends and family. The staff is very attentive and friendly too!Delhi Diner relatively new to Solano Ave but its operated as if its been here for years.  Its easy to ignore or avoid something you've never tried before and settle on something you know, but as I've learned quickly from eating here, you'd only be missing out! The food and service has the potential to rival Ajanta and is superior to most Indian restaurants that focus on buffets or chaat.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/20/2014,11/8/2014,42,127,12,14,15>The first thing you notice as you walk in is the lovely little covered courtyard with flowing vines and a water fountain. It makes walking into Old Weang Ping immediately special. The you pass through a small waiting area into the cozy dining  room with it's retro booths, mismatched chairs, wooden tables and christmas lights circling the room (which is being watched over by a very chill deer wearing sunglasses and a scarf.)We were seated in a cozy corner spot and immediately were brought over what looked like a well-hydrated urine sample but tasted like a really light thai iced tea without the milk. It was refreshing and much better than plain water! The cups were filled several times by a gentleman, that from previous reviews, I'm assuming is one of the owners. The service was quick and friendly.We ordered corn cakes as an appetizer, which we both loved with the dipping sauce. They were fresh corn kernels in a batter, I know there was something else in there to add to the flavor but I forgot to ask. Shrimp maybe?  I got the duck curry special with pumpkin and pineapple. Sooo good. Generous duck chunks, good sauce which was just spicy enough.  My boy had the roasted coconut shrimp curry on the Indian crepe which was delicious.It was busy for a Thursday night, but a very mellow crowd. The was a wait for tables at 8:30 when we left. Prices very reasonable, our bill came to $34 for 2 entrees, an appetizer and two beers + the bottomless thai tea. We were stuffed when we left, and even had a little leftover for a snack laterWe'll be coming back!
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,11/7/2014,342,502,8,16,12>And here I thought the pearl milk tea scene in Berkeley was saturated. Sharetea gives every boba business a reason to tremble (except maybe Sweetheart's because they still have the best pearls and serve food and stuff and maybe Asha's, because they serve an entirely different demographic and have ridiculously high quality teas).Anyway, if you're wondering what to order, these have been my favorites so far:Hot Handmade Taro with Fresh Milk and Pearls (30% sugar)Honey Green Tea with Pearls (80% honey)Okinawa Pearl Milk Tea (it's made with brown sugar instead of regular sugar and the level of sweetness cannot be customized for some reason)Matcha Red Bean Milk Tea with Pearls (0% sugar)What's interesting is that these items are ordered differently than in San Mateo. Over on the west side of the Bay, I'm able to get the Honey Green Tea with 30% honey, and the Matcha Red Bean Milk Tea drink already comes with boba. Not sure why the discrepancy exists, but there you have it.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/29/2014,11/6/2014,309,712,2,11,6>One of the best Sunday brunch places I have been to in a very long time!  So glad to hear from a friend that Campo had Sunday Brunch we had to go!  The buffet was placed in the middle of the place in front of the indoor bocce courts. Plenty of room to walk/serve from both sides.  All drinks were included in your meal.  They also offer Mimosas, Bloody Mary's, Tequila Sunrises, beers and any other well drinks they can make you FREE for the first 90 minutes of your meal!  JOY!!Beautifully displayed were pastries of muffins, mini croissants, assorted danishes. Ripe melons and pineapple slices.  Cheese platter with cheddar, Swiss and something else I can't remember. Charcuterie board of ham, salumi and prosciutto. There was also Smoked Salmon and cream cheese and capers and onions. 3 types of fresh salads. Yummy peel and eat shrimp.  The typical brunch items of bacon and sausage, french toast, eggs benedict and an omelette station with prime rib and roast turkey also baked chicken and a hot pasta dish.  The desserts were also good.  Mini Cheescakes in at least 4 different varieties, cannoli's, carrot cake slices, chocolate cake slices and tiramisu. Service was excellent!  Our waiter kept the drinks coming, filled waters, cleared used plates. Sunday brunch was only $29.95!  What a deal!   We had a great time and will definitely come back!

<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,11/4/2014,156,215,3,12,9>[Slap on wrist!] I somehow neglected to write a glowing accolade of Beauty's - my regular weekly bagel fix for the past 2 years. Beauty's joins the ranks of the FEW places I frequent frequently. Owner knows my name and my preference for warm, plain bagels (always order 2 - they are THAT good). The soups are mostly vegan and the salads are fresh. I never have an allergic reaction (meaning no icky preservatives). J usually gets the special of the day. We enjoy coming here on the weekend and sitting at either a table (alone or shared) or the bar (high and low). The scene is hipsters, families, post yoga ppl (Flying nearby). Local art for sale on the walls. Consistently clean bathroom. Bus your own table. Food pick up at the counter. Queue up for the 2 ipad cash registers. Receipt texted or emailed to you. Our tab for 2 ppl usually runs around $22-$28.Hint: Free refills if you drink coffee there (in their mug, which is smaller than the take out cup). One free refill of ice tea (can go to the front for the refill).On weekends, the lines can get long, parking can require circling, and food can take up to 30 min to prepare, but Beauty's is WELL worth the wait and effort. The owners are to be commended for consistent quality and for creating a place that is a pleasure to return to, week after week. I heart Beauty's!
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2014,11/3/2014,92,111,36,20,24>I do love this store. I do! Back when I was unhappily single, rounding the corner toward forty, and feeling like everything in the goddamn world pointed toward Happy Family Times just to spite me, I used to go by a games store in the Lower Haight that had "family board game night" and I would go ooooooohhhhhh! somedaaaaay! someday I will bring my family to family board game niiiiiiight!"wellll that day has not yet come because my kids are still too little to appreciate Parchesi, but still: Board game stores have a special place in my heart. And I want to support them! In any way possible! So when I realized my friend's daughter's birthday was coming up, I thought, "oh! Jeez! Martha loves minecraft so much she goes to a special camp for it. I will get her those minecraft earrings I saw on Thinkgeek. But oh crap! Her birthday is tomorrow! I know, I'll shop local!" and headed over to Games of Berkeley.Oh my GOD PEOPLE! Is there really no subject that Berkeley can't be reverse-snotty about? Really? I walked in and asked if they had any Minecraft-related gifts, and the two people at the cash register looked at me like I had just pooped into a trucker hat and asked them to try it on. They didn't just say "No, sorry." The two of them looked at each other in horror -- HORROR. Had they been wearing pearls, they would have clutched them, I emphasize again, IN HORROR. Instead it was "We wouldn't have anything like that." "Huh! Why not?" I said, still not grokking the mine(GEDDIT?)field I had just plodded into. "AH-this store is for BOARD games. We just ah-wouldn't HAVE anything related to COMPUTER games." "Ah," i said, and indeed, I did feel estupido. But then I started shopping, and what to my wondering eyes did appear? Oh, nothing much, just a metric PLETHORA of items relating to Angry Birds, a hand-held version of the console game Centipede. MANY temporary tattoos relating to VARIOUS video games. I could go on.In fact, because I have no filter and am extremely socially awkward, I DID go on. Every time I found an item in the store pertaining to a computer game, I held it up and waved it at the snotty cashiers, saying "Oh look, oh my god! What is this doing here? It pertains to a computer game!" and they got heartily sick of me very soon.And then when I got home I searched their website and guess what! They have Minecraft stuff. Just not the earrings I wanted. Anyway you should totally shop there, because I'm sure they need the local shoppers, BUT you should also annoy them because that's just fun when people are snotty.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2014,11/2/2014,297,199,3,10,8>SPECIALTY - FALAFELIn the Spain episode of "No Reservations" Anthony Bourdain talked about the Basque restaurant Asador Extebarri as a specialty place because it does one thing great - grilling food. The term specialty also refers to this eatery. There are several items at this restaurant but I come here for one item - falafel wrap.My introduction to this eatery came about three years ago when after a Cal football game I was heading towards the Bart station. As walked towards this place someone from this eatery was giving away free samples of freshly fried falafel. I took a bite and I was hooked. Apparently during that time it was the grand opening. I knew I had to come here again for the falafel.The first time I ate at this restaurant I ordered the falafel wrap. I was totally addicted to this item. Ever since then when I come here I always ordered the falafel wrap. What makes the falafel wrap addicting? First the falafels as mentioned before are freshly fried. I've had falafels in the past where they're cold and stale. At Oasis Grill I love the breaded crunchy texture of the falafel. You would think since the falafels are deep fried that they would be heavy but they're not. Also I the wrap is lightly toasted over the burner. This makes the wrap light yet has a slight crunch as a panini. Inside the wrap the yogurt binds together the fresh vegetables. Overall this dish is hearty because it'll make you full. Anthony Bourdain said it best that he would like vegetarian dishes if people really knew how to make vegetables tasty. Well this vegetarian item is delicious. I believe if he had this item at Oasis Grill he would love it also. I admit I'm a carnivore at heart and not too fond of vegetarian dishes as the vegetables tend to be overcooked or mushy. I'll go on record by saying this is the best vegetarian dish I ever had.I've had other items at Oasis Grill but nothing compares to what I believe is their specialty - the falafels.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/25/2014,11/1/2014,1027,1954,5,6,5>I've seen the reviews for this place slowly climb over the past couple months and remain at 5 solid stars.  I can see why now!Shrimp has been on my mind a lot lately and the craving has been insatiable.  The folks at Cal Eats cooks shrimp to succulent perfection. Ordering is similar to Chipotle in the sense that they'll work on your meat/seafood filling and then build the rest of the bowl/burrito with you.The shrimp and steak burrito costs around $8 but tastes super fresh.  Just two of the blackened fish tacos ($2.95 each) fills me up.  Good size fish, sufficient amount of toppings and sauce.I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the Cajun Shrimp and Chipotle Shrimp.

The burgers are bombdigitty. Happy hour is great too! We ordered the 1/2 pound "poundies" for free technically with the $5off check-in deal.Those poundies were friggin' delicious! Pork belly meat, sour cream, cheese, and other goodies delivered to your mouth via nacho formation.Bronson burger - beef patty + pork belly slices + the perfect amount of balancing veggies. Prepare to get messy. TRH knows what's up. So juicy. So flavorful.I'd skip on the garlic fries though (the garlic was still semi-raw).

<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2014,10/28/2014,444,238,34,47,37>LEGIT Vietnamese in San Ramon? What the Pho?!I've made quite a few trips to Pho Sam, with each trip validating my previous, positive experience... These guys have consistency down to a science (even to-go!), so I felt compelled to show them some love...Again, a majority of my visits have all been To-Go & it's extremely rare (regardless of where you go) to get a decent bowl of DIY Pho, particularly w/ the clumpy, impossible to separate noodles & bland-ish broth... Here however? Items are extremely fresh, generous noodles (though aren't mashed into the container), fresh veggies, broth flavorful & scalding hot (meatballs included in the #18, Pho Dac Biet), etc... When I get home to prepare my soup, it looks (& tastes), just as good as if I were to eat-in... Broth temp is PERFECT & hot enough to safely cook the sides of rare beef, without having to first reheat in the microwave...The #11 (Hu Tieu Thap Cam) is delicious as well, with practically every spoonful including hearty chunks of chicken breast, ton's o' shrimp & strips of fish-cake... VERY good & may have just been promoted as my personal fave...They do a decent job on the Banh Mi here as well @ $4.95 which is about double the cost of their SJ counterparts, but they don't skimp & still relatively reasonable in price, particularly when comparing to other lesser-quality options within the area...Goi Cuon during my initial visit seemed to be missing sprouts, though subsequent visits proved that it was just a fluke. Ingredients are very fresh, sprouts crunchy & sliced pork as tender as it can be (especially for goi cuon, if you know what I mean)... Great peanut sauce as well & even better once you add Sriracha to balance out the sweet with some spice. Definitely glad I gave the rolls another shot since they do a very good rendition here (not to mention being a "regular" & welcomed side addition as a result)...I'm very happy (ecstatic actually), to have found this hidden gem, tucked away in such an unassuming location/strip-mall (between Fresh Millions & Beer Area Liquor store)... It's close to 1AM, I've got touch of Insomnia & now craving a bowl of Pho... Great thing is? I don't have to drive all the way to SJ to satisfy my cravings... Oh yes, I'm a regular...

After a great bike ride along the Lafayette-Moraga trail, this delicious little spot was the perfect place to stop in to sit in the sun and enjoy some quality, authentic Mexican.The menu at this place isn't as expansive as some Mexican joints but I was happy to see a wide range of tortas and plates.The guacamole and salsas were top notch. There was a variety of salsa to choose from but I was pleased with pico. While the chips and salsa aren't free like some places, they do have unlimited free refills.I enjoyed the vegetarian burrito which was perfectly sized for a post-ride meal and my buddy who is a regular chomped down on some delicious tacos. The tacos looked excellent--lots of meat and well seasoned. I'll have to try them next time! My veggie burrito was well stuffed with beans, rice, veggies and a healthy serving of guac. We came around 4 pm and while the service was a bit slow, they did it with a smile. To their credit, it looked like they weren't expecting an early dinner rush.
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2014,10/26/2014,301,86,3,7,5>About time. .. . a new hot spot in Oakland! I checked out this place yesterday after the A's game and I was really impressed. The inside is really spacious and everything looks shiny and new. When we first entered the diner we were greeted by a couple different employees, which was awesome. It was kind of empty so I was a little sketch about eating there, but later I found out why. Since the diner is new they haven't finalized their hard liquor Ls, they have wine and beer only. The menu has typical American food, but they're missing a few favorites! I was really craving a BLT after a full day of drinking, but they didn't have it on the menu. When I asked my waitress about this she said they can make it for me without it being 1,000$. Haha and when I received my bill it was only 7.95 with french fries, not bad at all! They don't have Blue Moon, but they have Shocktop on tap. They also have 2$ mimosas which are pretty strong
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/14/2014,10/25/2014,470,139,6,9,8>Holy crap, I don't deserve this!!They're a little pricey, to be sure, but for the quality it's a bargain. I got there right as my massage started, which meant that I couldn't take advantage of the showers and spa beforehand. I made a note to hit that up later. David is a magic man! He was very professional, gently guiding me from the waiting room to the massage room with his hand on my back as though I were a cherished child.The Swedish massage was amazing. David hit all of my tension without causing any pain, and I've had a few really uncomfortable massages in my day. I think he could tell when I seized up in anticipation of pain, and then he would back right off. I asked him to focus a little on my shoulders, which he did without ignoring the rest of my body. Other points I really enjoyed: scalp massage, foot massage and forehead massage. I would have enjoyed if he'd used the same technique on my hands as on my feet, but perhaps that effort went to the shoulders. no complaints here.After my massage, David guided me back to the locker rooms where I learned an important lesson: rich people use a LOT of water! The shower had nine heads!!! It was crazy and I'm still not sure it's necessary. I personally didn't find it any more comfortable that a single-headed shower, and I fretted the whole time about the drought. Well, admittedly, I could have used the single-headed wand, but didn't. ;-)Then there was the spa. Clothing optional, but I was the only person who was nude. I was too relaxed to feel awkward. Jets, amazing view, wet towels with ice on them... What more could I want? Validated parking. Which they have. Jam!One more note: I forgot my wallet at home and they were TOTALLY cool about it. I didn't realize until I was already in the parking lot 15 minutes before my massage, which was nowhere near enough time to run home for it. I scrounged up a few documents from my car (insurance, work badge), and the manager let me use the credit card on file. I appreciate that. In a world where no one trusts each other, the faith was quite refreshing. And so was the cucumber ice water.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,10/24/2014,291,487,5,10,10>I love this place!  I was so happy when they finally opened their doors a few weeks ago.  I have been waiting since January for opening day.  This past Sunday they had a proper grand opening celebration & beer lovers from all over the Bay Area came out to celebrate!There is plenty of seating & two outdoor patios.  If you visit on Thursday you can watch the band play at the weekly farmer's market.  The beer selection is constantly changing.  They have a nice mix of local beers (Rare Barrel, Faction, High Water, Altamont, Heretic, to name a few).  Check the menu screen for the current beers on tap & what's on deck.  The little keg icons next to each beer show how much is left in the keg.  Cool!  It also shows the type of glass your beer will be poured in.  The only thing missing is the IBU's, something I am personally interested in so I don't order a super hoppy beer.  If you're not sure what to order, ask!  The staff are super friendly & very knowledgeable.  They are more than happy to give you a taster of any beer.  It's so cool how they have their radio studio right in the taproom.  If you're lucky enough to visit during a broadcast, you may learn a thing or two about beer.Congrats to the folks at The Brewing Network & thanks for bringing this great little hangout to downtown Concord!  I can see I'll be here pretty often.
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,10/23/2014,179,235,6,14,6>Love love love Expresso Airport Parking for those early morning flights when you can't be bothered taking BART. You can reserve a spot for free on-line (highly recommend). Outdoor parking is often very crowded and the last thing you want to do at 4:00 a.m. is drive around looking for a spot in the dark. For that reason, go with the lit indoor parking ($9/day with the on-line coupon). TIP: Be sure to print out the coupon!!!! They have Peet's coffee and sometimes pastries & newspapers near the cashier (free of charge) and the shuttles run often (every 10-15 minutes). Friendly staff too! Anyone who can be cheerful at 4:00 a.m. is tops in my book :) The lot is close to the airport and takes less than 10 minutes to get there. They only drop off at the far end of the island at the airport so it can be a bit of a walk depending on what airline you are flying on.
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,10/22/2014,28,168,3,12,6>This place is AMAZING!!!  It was the one thing that bummed me out by moving from Cleveland out here.  I missed going to my local Aladdins for some Mediterranean food.  When I noticed this place on Yelp, I got super excited to see a new place in town.  Plus, with all the high ratings, I knew I had to try.  The concept is very similar to a Chipotle.  You pick either a Bowl or in a Pita.  Can get Falafel or Chicken (Free Range) or even cous cous.  I got a combination of both to try -- which was amazing, but I think for future I will just get falafels because they were sooo good.  You can also get tomato cucumber salad, tabbouleh, purple cabbage or even lettuce.  They have some extras like feta cheese, olives. All this for $6.95.  Definitely worth the price. They even sell 6 pack of pitas, which I bought to take home.  Service was friendly and told them it was my first time so they walked me thru the whole process.  The only downside is the dining area/parking is limited, but I think I would always buy and just bring home.  Highly recommend and I will definitely be back.  SO HAPPY!!!!!!!!  Oh and the Baklava was AMAZING!!!!!!
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2013,10/21/2014,587,317,5,11,6>This may be my favorite Chinese restaurant since I've moved to the West Coast.  I know people rave about the crab at RNG Lounge and Crustacean/Thahn Long.  I think (if you like spicy) the Ma Po Tofu Dungeness Crab here is the best crab dish in the Bay.  THe salt and pepper crab was also delicious, but the mapo tofu crab is unlike any crab dish I've ever had!  It's got the deep szechuan heat - not tongue searing heat, but a deep spice.  Another must try is the five spice pork shoulder which is off the hook and pretty much on every other table.Service is very much a chinese restaurant - don't be passive - call them over.  I called my server and he came running over to take my order, and the gentleman next to me was complaining, saying "I was here first!!".  That's like standing on a corner and when I hail a cab, trying to claim you have first dibs...Anyway, the food here is solid, spicy, northern chinese goodies.  Will definitely be back and bring friends so you can order a lot of dishes - each dish is pretty big.
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/24/2014,10/20/2014,354,58,3,13,6>I can honestly say this is my favorite Thai food restaurant, on all levels. Service: Unbelievable. The first time my wife and I went, our waiter informed us how the sauces were made (home crafted), the differences between the dishes and offered to box our dinner up with more fresh rice and actually had extra's of our entree made for us to take home hot. Every time we have been back, they check in often, refills are plentiful, and they always want to make sure our food is what we wanted. Food: The best. I typically order the basil chicken, and I've had this at many Thai places... and it doesn't get better than this place. The sauce is light, yet bountiful in flavor. My wife has tried all sorts of curries (I'm not a curry fan) and swear by them. My dad too. We've yet to have a bad dish here, and everything we get that we've had elsewhere was hands down the best in quality and flavor. Price: Reasonable for what you get. Entree's range from around 10$ to mid 20's depending on what you get. My wife and I get out of here for around $50 after tax and tip for dinner. So.. we don't eat here often. But when we do, it's worth the money. Overall, I rate this place the best Thai food around.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,10/19/2014,334,415,2,12,10>From the moment I laid eyes on this place, I breathed a sigh of relief that finally (!) downtown Berkeley has a destination that fills the void between high end (overpriced) and college food. Walking in through the unmarked door, the decor is obviously well-thought out with all the right finishing touches. I especially love the subway tiles in the bathroom, slate gray flooring, and butcher block like tables. The all-American menu boasts at least 30 rotating beer taps, Californian wines on tap, and although there is a full selection of liquor, the whiskey collection is the proud gem of the bar. A small menu of specialty cocktails are almost a mere token compared to the whiskeys, but the best deals are the $5 "Bear Brew" (a Racer 5 + a shot of bourbon!) and bloody mary. Definitely try to catch happy hour, which goes until 6pm every day. There are fantastic deals on apps, and $2 off everything else.The only thing that tempers the Eureka! spirit is the hit-or-miss service. At first I attributed it to the restaurant finding its legs when it opened, but it's still extremely hit-or-miss months after opening. Depending on who's tending bar, this can definitely be one of those aggravating places where every man at and 3 people deep will get served before a female. Be wary!
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,10/18/2014,180,411,5,9,6>This is the place I compare all my pizza to. Need I say more? The service was sweet, attentive. The outdoor space is dreamy and perfect in the early summer evening with a glass of red. However, the inside space is really snazzy too. We sat next to this awesome guy who was asking the waitress whether she preferred Dustin Hoffman or Al Pacino, followed by a light debate. The salad was just lettuce on a plate - but wow, that was a dish made for bunny royalty! And the pizza just blew my mind - lightly salty crust with a bit of chewiness, a rich and dimensional sauce, the best homemade sausage I've ever had, and just the right amount of mozzarella (not in every bite). I will stick around for dessert next time and try some other items.

I ordered the popcorn through the email on their website (since I had some from their food truck during Off the Grid). John was very helpful with my requests and answered questions quickly. I paid through paypal after I worked out my order and picked it up at their commercial kitchen in Alameda a few days before my wedding. All the popcorn was sealed and boxed and was fresh, light and yummy for the day of. Everyone loved the popcorn and wanted to know where I got it from.The flavors I chose were:Matcha Green Tea and White Chocolate: Very sweet and tangy, if you love green tea you will LOVE this popcorn. Everyone told me it was their favorite.Saigon Cinnamon: Spicy and sweet, strong cinnamon flavor and very bold.Plain popcorn: just regular popped corn, my husband loves plain popcorn and it was a must to have it at our wedding. It was very yummy with our open bar (ha!)And Original Kettle (with purple food coloring as per my request to make it purple to match my wedding colors): Kettle to me is like the best....sweet not to sticky but not chewy, it had a light crunch and is sooooooo tasty!If you ever need popcorn to be catered, I would definitely go with Peter's Kettle Corn. Their flavors and service cannot be beat!!
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/22/2014,10/16/2014,320,266,6,12,10>I've been dying to go here, so as soon as I heard they opened, we ventured out to check them out.  It has been only the 2nd day after they had officially opened.  I tend to like to wait for a week or so for the restaurant to be running smooth usually, but I just couldn't hold back.  With much excitement and anticipation, there is always a chance I'm going to be disappointed, but got to take that risk sometimes, right?We arrived on Wednesday evening about 7:30.  The restaurant is fairly busy, but not completely packed.  We asked to sit at the bar, and found seat at the very left of the bar where the bar is lower and we could watch bartenders at work. The bar was almost fully packed and several bartenders were there working quickly. One of the bartender acknowledged us, and said he will be with us soon. We were originally thinking abut wine, but after watching him make cocktails beautifully, we decided to go with cocktails instead.  The menu has a nice selection of cocktail using small batch spirits.  After speaking to the bartender who had vast knowledge of each cocktail, I decided on DILL-ICIOUS with lime, cucumbers and dill, and my husband had BLOOD AND SAND with blended scotch and cherry bourbon.  Both were excellent, and very refreshing.Now on to the food! They have a nice selection of oysters, all are around $3-$5 range each, but they also have their daily oyster that are $1.50 each. Today's oysters were Fanny Bay.  We got 6, then another 6 because they were really good.  They are smaller in size and briny which I love.  They come with selection of 3 sauces -- mignonette, cocktail, but also their house made habanero sauce. Habanero sauce was smoky, sweet and savory, complex flavor of some onions/garic and others, with some heat.  I'm an oyster purist and usually shun gimmicky sauces, but this was no gimmick, it was the real thing. I really enjoyed a small amount of this sauce on the oysters as well as the other sauces.We also ordered lobster roll.  I saw on some of the yelp review lobster was barely cooked through, but ours were cooked all the way through.  To me, pretzel roll was a bit too heavy for the taste, and I prefer lighter rolls. I still can't forget lobster roll I had in Boston, and around here Sam' Chowder house still have the bests.  This one was good, and my husband loved it. Fries were excellent.  They have really good ketchup -- I forgot to note the brand.Then came the soft shell crab.  It was crispy, not heavy, probably the best soft shell crab I've had.  My husband loved it.  Clam chowder was very good and also interesting.  They have crunchy celery bits in them instead of well cooked celery.  Bacon adds smoky flavor and richness to this chowder.  To me, I can live with less bacon in this soup and taste more clams, but I know the love of bacon around here.  Still an excellent chowder and great flavor.  They were out of squid ink carbonara... a big bummer for me.  I need to go back for this.Last dish we selected was their grilled octopus.  It was probably the best grilled octopus I've had in west coast.  The octopus was tender, and potatoes were yummy with nice fingerling potato texture you get when you rost them.  I think I tasted tarragon and parsley in their nice rich virgin olive oil sauce.  I finished the meal with gin martini with lemon twist which had an excellent flavor. Chef came out a couple of times to ask about food, and service and food was excellent.  The bartender that helped us was very knowledgeable about their food as well as their drinks.  I could not believe how well they are running, only 2 days after their official opening. I'm so excited to have a great local oyster bar without crossing the bridge, and also enjoy excellent drinks, food and service.  We will be going back for sure!
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2014,10/15/2014,47,34,8,18,11>This new addition to the Oakland dining scene is a must try!  I've only had a few dishes, but the oysters with cucumber blew my mind. The perfect bite on a hot summer day, the diced cucumbers added a fabulous crunch.  The shrimp lollipops were moist and flavorful (and fun to eat), and the crabmeat & corn on crostini was sweet summer perfection.  While there, I tried a blanco tequila and beer (yes you heard me) cocktail that was refreshing but with a nice kick.  Bartenders are master craftsmen (and women!)The decor is soothingly nautical in color and tone, and the addition of an 8 foot copper sink for Chef German's customers to cleanse messy hands after having engaged in crawfish boil excesses, is whimsical thoughtfulness at its best.Can't wait to go back and sample more of the menu.  The outdoor dining should be just the ticket for hot summer evenings in Uptown Oakland.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2014,10/14/2014,233,174,11,17,16>Heat Hot Sauce Shop is unreal. As I walked through the door, I thought I was dreaming. Bottle after bottle of magical sauces bound to evoke tears. You could spend a solid half hour just reading the labels. How can you not get behind a place that sells products called "Satan's Blood" and "Reaper Slingblade"?Heat carries sauces and condiments from all around the world - locally made flavors and exotic tastes. Salsa, harissa, marinade, mustard, bbq sauce, jam, spicy candies and chocolate, you name it. Just in case you were wondering, they also stock pure capsaicin, which seems like more of a terrible prank than a useful spice, but where else can you buy it in town? If you're hesitant to buy a bunch of bottles without tasting first, don't be shy to sample any or all of the open bottles near the register with their complimentary tortilla chips. In case of emergency, those faint of heart will be pleasantly surprised to know that they have a water cooler but I would still read the fine print before trying anything. Since coming here, I've developed an addiction to Marie Sharp hot sauces from Belize and have become that crazy person with a bottle of Orange Pulp Habanero in my purse. It's my current must have condiment. The Grapefruit variety is also exceptionally tasty. I have yet to try the Green Habanero or the Belizean Heat but I have heard nothing but good things.  In terms of staff, the lone guy behind the register was very friendly and encouraged my friend and I to be adventurous with the samples. He pointed out some of the best sellers, had a laid-back demeanor, and provided service with a smile. A+. If you're a heat seeker, your experience at Heat Hot Sauce Shop is bound to be life altering. Don't walk, run!
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2014,10/13/2014,242,113,10,18,14>Whenever I walk into the Livermore Public Library, I feel happy knowing that at least some of my hard-earned tax dollars are being spent wisely. The library is spacious, clean and well-organized, with plenty of comfortable seating, computer terminals, and private rooms for group study or meetings. If you have little ones, you MUST go to this library. The kids section alone is as big as some other libraries! Besides books and DVDs for all ages, they have computer terminals and listening stations, a toddler area (complete with benches and tables and sofas and stuffed toys!), and a special room for painting and other activities. There's even a separate kids bathroom in here! As summer is just winding down, I must mention the library's summer reading program. They track up to 35 books your kids read and they can come in to claim prizes and do activities (like face painting) after every 5th book read. Both my girls took part this summer and loved this program. Other things I love about the library are the excellent wifi, polite and efficient service, regularly updated art on the walls, concerts and other events, outdoor seating areas to enjoy a cuppa from the adjoining cafe, and beautiful grounds if one wants to take a break and stretch ones legs. I can go on and on --- there are a few things I'm missing for sure. Go check out the Livermore Public Library - and feel pride in being a part of our community!
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2014,10/12/2014,370,470,6,10,6>Got a buck? You're in luck!I've always seen taco specials advertised on Tuesdays. But, here at Whipple Taqueria, everyday is taco day here!I was working from home and was feeling hungry. My first attempt to come to this restaurant was a fail. I got here thirty minutes after closing time. From then on I was on a mission to try this place out. That day came and I found my way back to the taqueria.I arrived here around 3pm and it was semi busy in the dining area. As for the counter for ordering was not. I took a look at their menu offerings on a over head menu. They had a variety of meats for their tacos. I decide to get four tacos with meat of choices of al pastor, carne asada, pollo (chicken), and carnitas. I also order a California burrito, which contains french fries in a burrito if you're not familiar with it. I had to take my order to go since I was on my work clock. My order took about ten minutes to prepare.Once I got home, I unwrapped the foil of the paper plate revealing four nicely prepared tacos. Assembled with flour tortillas, meats, and topped with cilantro and onions, my mouth was already watering! With the squeeze of some lime over these tacos made them taste much better. As for the California burrito, it was good. It was stuffed with french fries, carnitas, cheese, sour cream, and refried beans. The carnitas tasted a little bland, but with a little hot sauce did the trick.Why wait till Tuesday for a taco? Give Whipple Taqueria a try where taco day is everyday!
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,10/11/2014,174,447,6,13,13>A few weeks ago, it really clicked why Oakland is getting so much press about being a great destination from local blogs to the New York Times.  There is a there here.  Grand Ave from Telegraph Ave to Mandana  plus the slight detour onto Upper Lakeshore is one of the best places to stroll, eat, pamper, learn and shop.   It started out as just brunch with friends but essentially took an unexpected vacation day worthy of travel on a plane ride.I had my epiphany at stop #8, Alchemy Bottle Shop.  This delightful shop sells high end local and small boutique spirits.  I love the bottle of Square One Cucumber Vodka I discovered here. Of course you can get things cheaper at chain stores but the personal touch, staff suggestions and enchanting environment take me to a happy place. The little touches make this place extra special.  The best is the bitters tasting station.  You can try samples of the vast selection of bitters. I bought the Firewater one from Scrappy's - its delicious.  They also sell a homemade tonic water spice packet from the Oakland Spice Shop. Make it yourself or give a great hostess gift to a Vodka or Gin lover.Alchemy is a clean, well lighted place to buy boutique spirits, bitters and other mixers. Highly recommend.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,10/10/2014,297,409,13,19,13>But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Sanctuary Bistro is the sun. Butchery of Shakespeare aside, let me just say that I REALLY REALLY REALLY like this restaurant. I booked a table with extreme enthusiasm, as this place has been in the works for many months now. During that time, I stared longingly at all the photos of their gorgeous food, hoping that one day I might be able to sample it with my own taste buds. My friend Gerry and I were scheduled for a 7 o'clock reservation. However, they were running a bit behind. No worries, it was a pleasant evening, and there were some nice benches to sit out front and chit chat. The interior is very simple and homey, yet charming. I am a huge fan of exposed brick walls, and this place has them. The place was abuzz with talking, laughing, and even live music. An adorable pixie playing the guitar crooned away as we dined. Jen (one of the owners) buzzed around the room like a firefly, making sure each table got its complimentary taste of the Chef's chèvre "cheese" on a tiny cracker wedge. It was super yummy. I don't think I have ever tasted an actual chèvre, but it was delicious nonetheless.First course consisted of an "oyster mushroom crab-less cakes, micro greens with a remoulade sauce". I loved the combination of the creaminess of the sauce and the 'shroom crab-cake. Second course was the salad course, which consisted of "mixed heirloom tomatoes from Eatwell Farms, lemon cucumbers, fresh basil with a house 'cheese', tossed with a balsamic reduction". Confession: I am weirdly not a tomato gal, and I tend to pick them out of my salads or off my sandwiches. I'm not even sure why. Whatever the reason, they are not one of my favorite veggies. I did enjoy the cucumbers and the "cheese" on top. I prefer my salads heavy on the greenery, but if you are a tomato fan, you will love this little number. The third course was a "house-made porcini ravioli with a mixed mushroom and 'cashew cheese' duxelle in a spinach sauce with braised carrot and zucchini slaw". Gluten-free folks rejoice, as even this was GF. I loved the meatiness of the mushrooms inside the pasta. Quite easily, one of the better raviolis I've tasted.On to the fourth course. This was the pièce de résistance. I mean, it was a real beauty. Something you would do a double take on. I think I literally gasped when it arrived at the table. It was a "Southern tofu served with a twice-baked potato topped with shiitake bacon served with a summer squash medley with a sweet Dijon drizzle". Okay, folks. Brace yourselves. This was one of THE BEST tofus I have tried. Ever. In all of my 27 years, I would say that this is easily in the Top 10, perhaps even the Top 5. I have eaten a heckuva lot of tofu in my day, so it's hard to narrow it down precisely. The crunchiness on top was light, and perfectly seasoned. The butter sauce perched atop the potato was rich and creamy. The veggies were perfectly cooked. Simply a delightful little dish. My compliments to the chef! Any finally, the thing that leaves the final impression, the last taste in your mouth, the ever-important dessert course: "bananas foster served with an orange Liquor and fresh strawberry coconut ice-cream". Gosh, I'm still thinking about that lovely ice cream. It melts super quickly, so snap your instagram photos post haste and then gobble it up! Jen and Barry seem like a wonderful couple, full of passion and energy. I would love to talk to them at some point, as this place has quickly become one of my new favorites.Summary: the food is all vegan and gluten-free. All of their beers and wines are local. They have kombucha on tap. Go there.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/10/2014,10/9/2014,346,364,17,16,18>Sauced is my JAM! People come in from out of town, Sauced.  Eating Downtown with a large group, Sauced.  Whenever I want to go out to eat but don't want Mexican or Afghani food, Sauced.  Portions are huge which makes the borderline outrageous prices worth it.  Every meal is the equivalent of two unless you get the burnt ends sandwich.  Save your $14 bucks on that one because there are bigger and better things to order.  I usually have no patients for salads.  I consider their contents only suitable as food for my food to eat, but I make an exception for the Sliced brisket salad.  It's delicious. Even the half order of the Rednexican Nachos is a spectacle.  It's huge and piled high with almost every ingredient Sauced keeps on hand.The Loaded Sweet Potater!   This is my new love.  Bacon, beans, cheese, sour cream, Jalapeños, and chopped brisket atop a 1.5lb sweet sweet tater!  This is a two meal meal for sure and is even better second day.I also happen to like the atmosphere.  It's like a sports bar crashed into a trendy, rustic, industrial restaurant.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,10/8/2014,85,168,8,9,8>Let me start by saying I'm NOT a breakfasty sort of gal. I know it's the most important meal of the day, but like Hazel Grace in The Fault in Our Stars, I don't like being pinned into one type of food for a specific dining time. That being said. I. LOVE. DENICAS. I've had many breakfasty dishes including their incredible Eggs Benedict (with THREE eggs, mind you), Chilaquiles, Omlettes of all sorts and one of my favorites James's Special (which is an egg/mushroom/chorizo/sausage/onion scramble). I've never gotten past the savories to try pancakes, French toast or crepes, but have it on good authority from my daughter, husband and a good friend each of those items are scrumptious as well. I take that back... they've given me bites and they are delicious! Most of the time you get a side of home potatoes on the side and they are just fantastic. You will NOT leave hungry unless by your own choosing. My hubby ordered the blueberry pancakes once and I swear it was as big as a hubcap. I love their coffee which is not true of most eating establishments. I'm not a coffee snob, but I know bad coffee and Denica's does not have bad coffee. The coffee is served in homey mis-matched mugs. I always like to see which one I get. :) Did I mention they have complimentary chips and salsa available? There are always fresh tortilla chips and delicious salsas available. Let's talk about Denica's cinnamon roll which I like to lovingly refer to as a Cinnamon Ottoman. My daughter teases me because of my proclivity of using a baby as a unit of measure. However, in this case, Denica's cinnamon rolls (nee Cinnamon Ottoman) are CERTAINLY bigger than a newborn baby's head. They are absolutely delicious from the outside in. Typically I eat from the inside out on a cinnamon roll because I love the ooey gooey centers and don't want to fill up too fast and not get to enjoy the center. With other cinnamon rolls the center is about as good as it will get, but with Denica's Cinnamon Ottoman every bite is wonderful. Denica's cookies are absolutely a treat. Sometimes I don't feel like baking, but still want a cookie. I can't compare her cookies to a baby, but it's fair to say they are just this side of smaller than a DVD. My favorite is the Snickerdoodle and the Oops. The service is always friendly and on a few occasions I've seen and spoken with Denica herself. You can spot her looking radiant in colorful chef's jackets. I recall once I had Chilaquiles (in the Dublin location before Livermore opened) and my chips were on the cold side. She came back and immediately whisked them away and had the chefs make new ones for me. I only asked if they could just get zapped in the microwave as I was not picky. The counter staff is always cheerful and friendly as well as the serving staff and bussers. So from this non-breakfast loving gal I wholeheartedly recommend Denica's to you. Maybe one day I'll even try a lunch item, but for now I'm pretty delighted with the breakfasty offerings. So put on your stretchy pants and meander over to Denica's for some tasty food and great service!

I didn't taste the shoju. I simply felt it. A little tingle. In my ear. And the warmth on my nose. The jasmine tea though. Wow, that's where it's at. I love my Asha Tea House but this joint's jasmine tea was SO nice and jasminey. Like not eau de jasmine jasminey but like WOW I HAVE JASMINE IN MY TEA jasminey.

<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/24/2014,10/6/2014,503,1251,8,18,16>I've always known that there was a separate restaurant on the Miraku property, I just never gave it much attention.  Miraku Japanese Cuisine & Sushi is easily seen from Broadway St., but it's little sister in the back, Miraku Noodles, is easy to miss.  They are actually the same building, but are painted different colors to differentiate the two restaurants, have different signs, and customers cannot access one from another without walking outside.It was pretty warm out as I walked to the Noodle house and I started to rethink my idea of a hot soup for lunch, but I was too curious to turn around. A tiny woman greeted me and sat me in front of a TV broadcasting sports. So far, so good.  She brought me an iced water with lemon and a one-page menu listing the soup and salad selections. I ordered a hot ramen soup with spicy broth.  For $2.50 extra I choose seafood instead of the land animal options.A small plate of edamame was served complimentary and followed by a lightly dressed bowl of salad. Shortly after, my soup was set in front of me, hot and steaming! Fresh broccoli, bok choy, green onions, delicious ramen noodles, and a very tasty broth! Plus lots of shrimp, mussels, fish cake and more! This was actually the first time I've ever tried a fish cake, and I liked it.It was a huge serving and I wasn't able to finish the bowl but I was happy to have some leftover.  I took it to-go in the container I brought with me and walked back to work, glad to have tried and enjoyed somewhere new today!
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2014,10/5/2014,185,86,6,9,7>Food: This place has been my go-to for a great local burger since I was in elementary school.  So that's at least ten years now.  I think that says something in itself, but seriously, the burgers and sandwiches here are the best.  It's a little different from fast food joints and tastes more like what you would grill yourself at home, so the food has a nice smoky, char-grilled taste.  Definitely recommend the cheeseburger or the terriyaki chicken sandwich, both of which are amazing.  Oh, and the fries are nice, thick steak fries that I can never have enough of.  Stay away from the onion rings though because the portions are really small-- you get a small size for the same price as the large fries.  I have rarely strayed from those two sandwiches and an order of fries but when I do, I am still never disappointed.  Service: This is probably where the place should lose stars but my love for this place transcends stars.  The place is run by two korean ladies that speak broken english.  When you go up to the order window, they often will be completely silent and just ignore you as they go about their business.  They are always working and are never lax about working, but if they are busy with something else, you will basically not exist.  But once they step up to the ordering window, they always have a smile and take your order with enthusiasm.  Kinda strange, but its all good.  Also during lunchtime on weekdays, expect a line from the hoards of nearby high schools and community college.  Since they make everything to order, it takes a bit of time no matter what you order.Environment:  Its a small little stand in the middle of a plaza.  You order your food, they give it to you all at the same window and then you can take it to go or eat at the little picnic tables in the plaza.  Nothing special but looking inside, you can tell the place is well-kept and clean.

I seriously had the best time!TIP#1: To all the non lightweight individuals, I recommend you pregame beforehand, or else you'll be spending some $$$. But don't drink too much cause you want some memories to hold onto!Cover is $15 per person. I got inside around 10:30pm on a Friday night. The place was huge and already starting to fill up.My friend got me a drink, and that's where the fun all started.There are different stations of things you can do. You can watch the ladies on the bar tops singing and dancing. You can attempt to dance to country music. I was stumbling all over the place... lol. For $4, you can sit in the dentist chair to swig some alcohol. For another $4, you can ride the mechanical bull! TIP#2: Ride the mechanical bull earlier in the night, or else you won't stay on for very long.... hahaha! Also lean back, not forward.TIP#3: Apparently if you dress up and wear flannel, it's very obvious that it is your first time, but you should do it anyway to get into the spirit.I really enjoyed this place, because it's such a different scene, as opposed to the usual bar or club scene. It's like a different world. It was nothing but good vibes that night... I loved it! Have fun and be safe! :)
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2014,10/1/2014,188,238,15,20,19>If there was ever a dish that had my name all over it, it would be the Chicken Souvlaki from Demitri's. Yeah, I'm considering changing my name to Chicken Souvlaki. This dish is THAT freaking fantastic! The grilled chicken is wrapped in a warm pita bread with thinly sliced tomatoes, red onions, and an amazing tzatziki sauce. It is also served with fries or pasta salad.Before I go any further into my new name, let me rewind. I came to Demitri's for lunch on a Saturday with a girlfriend. The place was just starting to fill up. We were seated right away, and our waiter brought us a basket of toasted bread and a strong garlic dip. Slather some of that garlic spread on the bread and oh boy. Try to stop eating! My friend and I both ordered the traditional pitas. She opted for the gyro, which was delicious with slabs of roasted beef and lamb meat. She was too full to touch her pasta salad so Demitri's portions are very generous as well.Now let's return to my Chicken Souvlaki. Good lawd. This was SO tasty! The chicken was moist and tender, the pita bread was lightly toasted, and the tzatziki sauce brought it all together. The ingredients and sauce just meshed so well together--exactly like the Greek gods intended. I ordered fries instead of the pasta salad for my side dish simply because I love fries, but you'll get your fill of carbs either way. The fries were sizzling hot and crisp. They were the perfect thickness. All other fries out there should try to emulate these crunchy slithers of potato heaven.So if I haven't made my case already, Demitri's Taverna provides some homey and authentic Greek food and a Chicken Souvlaki that will leave your taste buds buzzing. Needless to say, I'll definitely be back!

We took the Bridle Trail to Chown to French and back around, and although this was just a tiny portion of the park, this hike took us about 2 hours. Tip: pay attention to the elevations on the map! We came here for the first time anticipating a pleasant stroll among the trees, but parts of it were more like Mt Midoriyama.This is a wonderful escape, and so close to home. It's nice to come to a place like this, breathe in the fresh air, and realize how small you are in relation to the world. Beautiful beautiful beautiful.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2014,9/29/2014,235,168,6,10,8>New favorite alert!It's the Tpumps of Castro Valley (same concept) but of course nothing compares to the original. But Cloud 9 gives them a run for their money. As you navigate your way to Cloud 9, you will pull up to what looks like a house. With a porch, comfy furniture, lots of tables, a deck and game room for guests to play Wii, you will feel as if you are just hanging out at home with your friends.The teas are made from the real thing (tea leaves) and the drinks are customizable. Like Tpumps, you choose from either Black or Green Tea and you have the option of adding milk or not. The sweetness level is customizable and like Tpumps, you can mix up to 2 flavors, which consists of the standard strawberry, mango, peach, pineapple, etc. The boba has a good chewy texture and the prices are so reasonable! $2.50 for a milk tea without flavoring, .50c per flavor if you choose to add. They are also known for their ice cream burger. Yeaaaah, you read that right. Your choice of ice cream with your choice of spread in between two pieces of bread. What's not to love?They also have shaved ice and other desserts. What I really dig though, is their game room. Like I said, they have a Wii, with games like Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Melee, Zelda, Super Mario Party and Just Dance for you to play for free. They even host Wii tournaments every now and then. Overall, a very cute hang out spot and well-run family business. Where do I sign up to be a regular?

That's a steal if I ever saw one.As you walk in, you can grab a menu from the start of the line or you can look up above the assembly line. You can choose from one of their signature pizzas or build your own. I opted for the White Top, which included white sauce, mozzarella, bacon, and arugula, and I added in mushrooms and tomatoes for some extra flavor. The pizzas are entirely customizable, so if you want one of their signature pizzas, but you don't want some of the ingredients that come on it, just let the workers know, and they'll happily sub in something else for it.The blood orange lemonade is a must-try. It can quickly become too sweet if you keep drinking it though, so I like to mix in some unsweetened iced tea to make a super tasty Arnold Palmer.Customer service is awesome here. The owner makes himself visible behind the counter and also comes out to greet guests. It's as if you're having pizza in his home, which is am amazing feeling as a customer. (My mom also says he looks like James Bond...)Can't finish your pizza? Help yourself to a take-out box that's stacked neatly next to the condiments and napkins!

They also have games, shoes, and other home items. Nice cribs and strollers too.During our visit yesterday, my wife spotted a stroller for twins, and then commented how fun it would be to have twins. We immediately left the store before she could make any other suggestions about things that sounds like fun.

My friends ordered: iced raspberry oolong (which was so amazing I wanted to steal her drink), iced HK style milk tea, and hot oolong tea.  WOW.  Every drink was awesome that I might as well order two drinks every time I'm there!Some other cool things about Asha: on University Ave, so the ambiance is very studious, but it seemed like a good place to catch up with a childhood friend.  In addition, they do have stamp cards but UNLIKE any other place I've seen, you can actually keep your stamp card AT Asha!  Cool thing for people who lose their cards frequently! :)  Overall, remarkable tea house with legit tea.  YAY all the way!Pro-tip: They also pronounce your name right.  Don't know if it is luck or what, but thanks for that!
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2014,9/25/2014,535,179,7,16,10>I find myself coming here more and more. They have a Mon - Fri, all day happy hour menu. We're talking $3-$8 a dish here. Where else in Walnut Creek can you get deals on good food ALL DAY!!? This is affordability at it's finest! I absolutely LOVE chilling on their patio. When it's cold outside they have heat lamps and fire pits to warm you up. On a hot day, well, the sun sets on the other side of the restaurant so shade comes not too late in the evening. If you know you are going to have a large party, make sure to call ahead and reserve an firepit table. They are very accommodating.The bar area is very small and has a pungent smell. I come often for lunch and sit at the bar just to get out of there quicker. I often have to sit on side closest to the chefs to avoid that funky smell. if you're not in a hurry, I would just avoid sitting at the bar in general.Some days are better than others with the bartender. A word of advice, don't buy a mimosa, buy the small bottle of sparkling wine and ask for a side of OJ. Otherwise, it's a waste of money. The Szechwan basil chicken is scrumptious. I alternate between that and the spicy crispy chicken. Both dishes involve basil which I cannot refuse. My co-workers hate me when I order from here and bring it back to the office. I have them envious of my food.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2014,9/24/2014,732,444,7,17,15>This corner of Oakland is so hot it's hard to keep up: the Punchdown was replaced by 2212, which has now been replaced by Captain & Corset. The space is sleek & modern, a balance of classy & comfortable; apparently there will also soon be outdoor seating on the patio (!). C&C caters to a diverse crowd, from families of 5 to tattooed skateboarders to ladies sipping (lots of) wine at the bar (ahem!!). And to add to the class, a touch 'o fun - Christopher Walken movies projected onto the back wall. (Did anyone else forget that he was in Batman Returns...?)We liked it so much we stayed for dinner. We tried: the chicken paillard with caramelized onion gravy, french beans & fingerling potatoes; lemon honey asparagus with hazelnuts; & wild arugula salad with raisins, carrots, crispy quinoa & honey mustard vinaigrette. I was admittedly wary of this seemingly fancypants new menu, but the food was outstanding. Every single bite of it. The (organic, free range) chicken was perfectly cooked - tender & juicy, with a sauce that was salty & sweet & so good we licked the plate clean. I didn't think I could stomach anything more, but somehow we ended up with Curbside Creamery ice cream sandwiches - mint-chocolate-chunk ice cream between chocolate cookies, & cinnamon ice cream between snickerdoodles. Honey, these'll break your heart. If I could've fit another 8 in my belly, I would've. Best part: they come from the lady on the curbside (literally) who sells 'em from her Oakland ice cream cart.I'm not sure what the best part of C&C is. The staff rocks & service is top notch, the quality of the food is outstanding, the dishes are delicious & affordable, the wine selection is sophisticated without being snooty & well-paired with the food, & the ambiance is the perfect combo of casual, fun & classy. I'm not sure what more one could ask for. Welcome to Oaktown, Captain & Corset - we hope you're here for the long haul!!
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2014,9/23/2014,1131,179,13,21,18>Ahh long, crispy, and filled with meaty goodness. Just the way I like it. Cam Huong is easily the best place to get your Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwich) fix in the Union City area or if you're nearby at all. Ranging from $2.75 to $3.25, Cam Huong packs enough stuff to make you quite full. The bread that they serve it on is just right. Not super hard nor is it too soft. It has a nice crunchy texture to it. I would have to say that my favorites here are #4 BBQ Pork and #6 Special Pork Combo. But I honestly think that I order #6 most often just because they give you a variety of their meat in it ;) Service here is pretty quick but be careful going in the early morning or at lunch time because it does get quite busy. Great thing about this sandwich place is that they open at 7am :)) Perfect for any early morning trip food!Try to ask for the pickled veggies and cilantro on the side just in case you are picky about how much you want in your sandwich. I honestly don't care cause I can eat anything. OH...CASH ONLY! :)
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2014,9/22/2014,303,540,9,16,13>Food truck mania is here to stay, in CA and all over!  And now hundreds of Walnut Creek office workers have reason to celebrate, as we have our own food truck party every single week day for lunch!  Anything that helps us escape from the monotony of the deli life is a welcome welcome sight.  I hit The Bend on a sunny Friday at lunch time and the party and feast was in full swing!  The Bend, so named for the bend in the road where it sits (as Le Virage, French for 'the bend' or 'the turn', did before it), is a home to 4 trucks at lunchtime.  This particular day the trucks were El Ranchero, Yummi BBQ, Yummy in My Tummy and Tutto Bene.  El Ranchero previously held a permanent spot by the nearby BART station and they seem to be making this their new permanent home.  Reasonably priced Mexican, though not mind-blowing taste wise.   The two Yums were Chinese BBQ style trucks, though both offered alternate options like corn dogs or tacos.  I opted that day for Yummy in my Tummy's #1 meal deal, a BBQ chicken skewer, two spring rolls and a cup of steamed white rice for $8.  Rounded out with an ice-cold bottled water for $2, it was a decent lunch for $10.  The food was tasty and cooked well, and was reminiscent to me of the caliber of Chinese food you get at carnivals and fairs - simple simple simple.  Those trucks and El Ranchero are more classic style food trucks, while Tutto Bene is a great representation of the future of the industry and the far more gourmet direction it's heading in.   About 8 flavors of gelato were offered that day, with 3 choices of cup sizes, and two flavors is always an option as with any good gelateria.  We were also offered samples quite generously!  I went with a small of their TCHO Chocolate and Strawberry Cheesecake for $4.50, which might sound steep but they pile the gelato on generously and was a VERY satisfying dessert after lunch on that hot day.  Fantastic, some of the best food truck fare I've had!  My only gripe, as is the case with all food truck markets I've been to, is that the background music (no matter live or canned) that plays totally adds to the fun atmosphere, but makes it very hard to hear and be heard by the truck workers.  Especially for shorties like me, they're like 10 feet above me!  I need to be able to hear them!  I'm very happy to welcome TheBend to the WC office cluster - hopefully with a little time the variety and quality of the food trucks will improve a little.  But so far, so very good!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2014,9/21/2014,166,289,7,6,8>Such an excellent experience both times this year. I love the new back patio waiting area, its very homey and relaxing. First Street Ale House gives great service, prepares excellent eye pleasing, tummy filling scrumptious food! Very reasonable prices and as always the beer is served nice and cold! The kids fish dish was very fresh and actually it was quite big pieces. I would recommend you try out first Street Ale House. On a Saturday night it might be a little busy but please take your time out in the back patio have a beer, you won't be disappointed & you will fully enjoy your meal and company and the ambiance... it's a very loud fun place for a Saturday night dinner with your family.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2014,9/19/2014,200,260,10,19,17>I must've been dozing off when this whole cream on top of teas craze hit, but I'm wide awake now! And a huge fan, I might add. I'd had my eye on Gong Cha for a while, but unfortunately I don't go back to my old hometown that often, so I jumped on the chance to come here when I was visiting friends this past Saturday. Located near the entrance of a busy Asian plaza (I'm starting to see a pattern with milk tea places flocking to areas next to a Ranch 99..), the line was out the door in the early afternoon. There are maybe two or three cramped tables inside, but it's definitely more of a grab-and-go place. My favorite thing? White pearls! I was intrigued when I saw a sign up on the door stating that they now offered white pearls, which are supposedly higher in fiber but lower in carbs compared to the traditional black pearls. I'm not a health nut, but if there's a healthier option I'll usually take it, so I opted to try this new topping. The texture takes a little getting used to, since it's a little deviant from the traditional chewiness of black pearls. It's almost a little crunchy, somewhat like seaweed salad except sweet. I know that doesn't sound exactly appetizing, but I thought it was surprisingly good and light. There's none of that gooeyness that can plague traditional pearls either, which is always nice if you're getting a large tea and might be nursing it for a while. I tried a milk foam oolong this time. My friend decided to try the milk foam green tea, and since I didn't want to get the same thing, I opted for the oolong. My friend said the milk foam green tea was a little bland, and while I thought the oolong was a bit watered down, it still had good flavor. Per usual, I got it with less sugar and less ice, which I thought was perfect, especially after mixing the foam in (the foam itself is a little sweet). Apparently there are multiple ways you can drink a milk foam drink, which are explained on a cute little sticker stuck to each cup. I'm a sucker for little details like these, and I tried two of the three ways recommended. I didn't take the lid off to drink it like a latte, but I did try slurping up the foam on top first and then dipping down into the tea. It was good, but so was mixing everything together and chugging it like a regular milk tea.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/6/2014,9/18/2014,185,670,2,13,10>Cool new venue that's part of the Linden Street Brewery complex (in addition to being an annex of the new Dock restaurant next door) but serves a variety of California craft brews in addition to Linden, such as Faction, HenHouse, Magnolia, and Drake's. The space has a rustic feel to it, with long wooden communal benches, plus layout and decor that accentuates the underlying brick warehouse building. The industrial aesthetic extends to the intimate patio, which can hold about 15 people and offers views of the neighboring Port of Oakland and rail yards. Service is friendly and approachable, and the casual, unhurried, accessible, and unpretentious vibe of the place is uniquely Oakland. A welcome addition to the greater Port / Jack London Square / West Oakland area.

So much fun to sit out here with good friends on a beautiful day!  Have fun tasting all kinds of unique beers.  They have food and beers for everyone from the most simple palate to the most adventurous foodie.  My group had everything from the great pretzels and classic sausages, to a homemade blood sausage.  Everything was very tasty.  As for the beers, it's hard to remember what we had but I know we all loved what we got.  Our waiter was excellent at finding just the right beer for everyone.  He was also very generous by letting people taste beers until they found just the right one.Do I also love when a beer place uses the glasses provided by that specific beer company? Yes. Yes I do.I'm a huge fan of Brotzet Lokal!

A little higher in price but worth it in my opinion. I had their three tacos special for $9. The first one was Cali: House Marinated Steak, Fries, Guacamole, Pico de Gallo, Spicy Sour Cream, Cheddar Cheese. - It tasted like San Diego. I may get some hate from that, but the flavors were all there and although I'm not a SoCal native I have love for their fusions.The second one was the Belly: House Marinated Steak, Rice, Korean Slaw, Kimchi Aioli.- My guess was this was their signature dish so I had to try it. It didn't disappoint! It was like a korean bbq in a taco, what more can you ask for?The third one was Steak and Eggs: House Marinated Steak, Fries, Fried Egg, Chipotle Aioli, Garlic Aioli- This by far was my favorite. I can see myself coming for brunch and just ordering a bunch of these. Now if only they offered mimosas with their Homemade Nectars... (you heard from here first)I'm excited to go back and other things on the menu. Happy I work close by.Until next time.Cheers.
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,9/13/2014,76,363,4,6,8>Livermore, you might just be my new favorite place for great food. Three out of three places tried, and so far everything is amazing. We had dinner at Uncle Yu's around seven o'clock. The place is beautiful inside. Gorgeous sculptures and artwork, plus a wine wall that literally covered the back wall. The one upsetting part, was that we were seated at a table, right next to a pillar. I had to squeeze myself between the pillar and the table to get to the booth. That aside, the service was amazing. Belle our waitress was awesome. She even came over and offered me spicy oil sauce for my food. It's like she read my mind. The bus boy's came out promptly after we finished with our food. Picked every thing up with ease, and just sailed off, like it's nothing. I used to be a server and I couldn't make clearing dishes look that easy. The food is phenomenal. We started with pot stickers (a must, whenever we go out for Chinese) and crab meat cheese puffs. I love pot stickers. I love their pot stickers. Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The filling is just to die for, but this time the pot stickers were beat by those crab cheese puffs. Oh My God these are the best thing I've had all night. Crispy pastry filled with the perfect, and I mean PERFECT mixture of crab and cheese. I know you're thinking (If you've never had them before) that cheese and crab is kind of a weird combo. Not when it's cream cheese. You bite into it, and you get the grab flavor, with the creaminess of the cheese. Orgasmic. Our entrees included steamed rice, Mongolian beef and Kung Pao chicken. Everything but the rice was spicy, our mistake, but a delicious mistake. The beef was good. Had a lot of good flavor that was taken to another level with the spiciness of the dish. The Kung Pao chicken was my favorite of the two. Kung Pao chicken is just always so amazing. Even the smallest things such as the peanuts, add so much to the dish. So besides our little problem with the pillar, this place was amazing. I swear to you, Livermore does not disappoint on delicious places to eat.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2014,9/12/2014,126,1452,12,19,13>Lets bring some history back to you all today.  Yes, they are located at an old train depot. Yes, you can sit in an old train car and dine if you desire.  And yes, this was the first place that I went to dinner the day I turned 21.  Yelp's Cocktail Girl was born at Vic Stewart's all those years ago.They have a five star cocktail menu for sure.  It changes with the seasons.  They really know their booze and combinations and I've loved every cocktail I've had here.Recently we came in for our wedding anniversary.  For cocktail starters we had the Canton Ginger Cosmo. It has Grey Goose, Canton Ginger Liqueur, fresh lime & cranberry juice.  So refreshing and not to sweet not to bitter.Their Caesar Salad  was perfectly executed.  One of my favorites anywhere.  The Coconut Prawns were a little burned for our tastes and we should have passed but we couldn't resist.  But he Buckley Bay Oysters were fantastic.  My husband had the Filet Mignon.  He wasn't that impressed and he even said that Flemming's is better.  Sorry, I disagree.  This was like Meat Silk, so delicious and smooth.  I had a bite it was great and Ill order it next time we come in on date night.  He also hated his scalloped potatoes.  I didn't try so Ill take his word for it.Lets talk about Lamb Shank Baby!  Yes baby sheep isn't worth being silent about.  The meat was juicy and succulent.  I've cooked this at home and could only dream of achieving the flaky, succulence of this meat.  The presentation was quite fun as well.  However, the mashed potatoes that came with mine were very bland.  Even with the drippings from the Lamb Shank it didn't save it.Our final dessert cocktail was the Grasshopper cocktail. It was so smooth and good except that the color was a grotesque neon green.  We had two of these.  I do really love a minty cocktail.Service was fantastical!  Slow at moment but when serving us it was great.  We also brought our baby in with us and it was very baby friendly.  I would probably find a sitter for the toddler like we did but when making a reservation let the host know that you're bringing a little baby with you.  Little babies and maybe the 6 year old and older kid crowd are good dinner companions to bring.  The toddler crowd, I wouldn't dare.I loved it here and need to come back more often.  Why haven't we?  I've honestly never had a bad experience here.  You'll be seeing me here for my birthday coming up for sure.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,9/11/2014,158,177,7,13,13>BOBO Drinks is a vividly decorated, spacious boba shop in the heart of Downtown Berkeley.  Their selection of drinks AND snacks is quite extensive, which makes the store name quite misleading!  I have had three drinks here, and recently, the BOBO sticky rice with roti chicken entree.  Much to my delight, the entree was quite large and only costed $7.95.  My plate had a scoop of mung bean sticky rice, three large pieces of falling-off-the bone chicken, a small salad, and a dish of sauce for the chicken (I think the sauce contained the drippings from cooking the chicken).  It was quite delicious, a bit too oily, very filling, but served at a completely affordable price!  The drinks I have tried include the BOBO special drink, durian milkshake, and the jasmine milk tea (free with Yelp check-in if you purchase something else! EDIT: No longer the Yelp check-in offer.  Now it's buy a food item and get a black or green tea free) My favorite is the jasmine milk tea.  Based on the three drinks I've tried, I have surmised that BOBO likes to make very rich and creamy drinks.  Their BOBO special drink was way too sweet for my liking with the milk tea, boba, ice cream, and whipped cream on top.  The durian milkshake was also too sweet for me, but I'm not sure if it's just because I am not a huge fan of durian.  My favorite is the jasmine milk tea, even if it is a little richer and creamier than other boba shops.  Compared to the other drinks I've tried, it's just right. :) If you're craving a more milky boba, you'll like BOBO, but if you prefer a more tea-infused boba, skip over to Asha down University.  It's really only a couple blocks from BOBO!When dining in, BOBO serves their drinks from mason jars affixed with BOBO's logo.  When taking drinks to go, you'll get the American style two-piece cups instead of the thin plastic sheet covers from more traditional boba shops.I give BOBO four stars for providing a large, welcoming space for conversing with friends, great service, and more substantial food to eat with your boba.  I'm fairly certain that no other boba shop has as much seating and as varied a menu as BOBO.  However, keep in mind that the quality of the food and drink is not the best when comparing to other boba shops, but the space within which you can enjoy your food is the best.Don't forget to check in on Yelp for your free black/green tea with purchase of a food item!

Bette's has the advantage of being located on Fourth St, so there are plenty of diversions for your wait, but just make sure you set a timer and check back in because the staff won't go looking for you!Outside or inside seating? Inside, you'll get the full diner experience, complete with a massive pie slice sculpture hanging over your head. Outside, you'll find a more intimate experience with plenty of people-watching, but you'll also be the target of many a people-watcher, particularly those waiting to be seated. Bette's also thoughtfully provides large, forest green blankets for every patio seat!It took about a 20-minute wait for a party of two to be seated, but almost right away a waiter was ready for our order. We, unfortunately, were not. After some deliberation, we settled for one of the specials (Multigrain Walnut Waffle) and the Chocolate Swirl Souffle Pancake. We were concerned about the size of the Souffle Pancake, but peeking over at a table a few feet away, it turned out to be slightly smaller than a dinner plate, but with much more depth. They served both dishes at the same time, after about 20 minutes. - The waffle plate came with two sausages and two eggs cooked to order - much more personalized than I was ready for. I was offered the options of scrambled, hard-boiled, soft-boiled, or poached. I chose soft-boiled and was again offered options of how long I wanted them boiled, from 1-7 minutes. It turns out 4 minutes is pretty much a delicate egg white with a slightly viscous yolk served in cute egg holders, and a spoon is required to eat it. The waffle itself was a large, flat waffle with a bronze-y hue, complete with banana and strawberry slices on top. Just the right amount of crisp, with crunchy walnut pieces baked right into the batter. I'm not a huge fan of maple syrup, but a dollop here and there definitely added to the dish. - The Chocolate Swirl Souffle Pancake was absolutely freaking delicious. I was worried it would be too sweet or too dense, but the souffle puff refuses to be dominated and the batter was just the right balance. - Libations? They've got them. Mimosa was heavy on the champagne, but hey, who's complaining?
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2014,9/9/2014,120,51,9,12,13>I really cannot extol the virtues of this cute little place sufficiently! First of all, the cooks, workers, and owner are all very pleasant and nice. Today I saw the owner/head chef making a cute little boy feel really proud about making his first purchase and counting out his money successfully. It was adorable, and indicative of the kinds of things I witness here all of the time, and the general tenor of the place.I continue to get soups here regularly, and I've never once been disappointed! One of my best friends swears by the Niçoise salad, and though I always want to order a salad or sandwich, I'm just so obsessed with the soups!! I've also now had the occasion to try the tarte du jour multiple times, which is always a vegetarian tarte inspires by seasonal veggies. It has always been delicious--they pick the freshest vegetables and the crust is light and flaky! I'd order it more regularly if I didn't feel compelled to eat the entire thing (2-3 people could easily share one) all by myself--it's that good!They also have nice beverages. In addition to standard French drinks, they have some unique natural sodas that are delicious: hibiscus, clove, ginger, etc. In short, Le Petit Cochon is a wonderful place and a wonderful addition to the neighborhood! I'm being totally hyperbolic but there's no other way to explain it! It does truly make me miss southern France so much though, boo!!!

It stretches from 12th Street on its northern edge to 6th Street on its southern edge, Broadway Street on the western edge and Lake Merritt southern tip in the east.With the growing Asian population in the Bay Area, Oakland's Chinatown has steadily grown during the last 30 years to serve as a destination for East Bay residents as an alternative to the Chinatown across the Bay.   However, it is not tourist-oriented as San Francisco's Chinatown, rather it's a Chinatown where people come to do their grocery shopping and to dine in one of the many restaurants.  One of the newer complexes here is the Pacific Renaissance Plaza, a residential and commercial complex.  It features a multi-level public underground parking facility and features shops and restaurant including the Asian Branch of the Oakland Public Library and the Oakland Asian Cultural Center.If you looking for a touristy Chinatown, head across the Bay, as Oakland Chinatown will serve you well for your grocery shopping and dining needs.

Not to say that I'm, in any way, affiliated with this group, but I did travel a sort of long distance just to do pub trivia night at Buddy's Bites & Brews.Again, while admitting nothing, I will say that I did meet up with some other East Bay Elites who were also there for pub trivia night. Situated on a busy corner, the building wasn't much to look at from the outside. But inside was reasonably nice & we scored seating at a bar table shaped like a surfboard.Along with trivia, true to the name of the establishment, Buddy's also had bites & brews. Having partaken of all 3 on this occasion, I would rank them as: trivia being 1st, brews were a close 2nd & bites were a just OK 3rd. For sure, for me, the pub trivia night was the star at Buddy's.I've done trivia night at a few different places now (again, not admitting anything in the way of being 1 of a number of clandestine trivia junkies) &, in terms of organization & difficulty of questions, pub trivia night at Buddy's may have been the best of the bunch. Our team did well. & while we were not victorious, it was still a lot of fun.Brews at Buddy's were excellent. The tap selections here were good enough to please any avid beer nerd. The only thing not-so-excellent at Buddy's were the bites. I ordered the Unda Da' Sea-viche, basically a ceviche, & it was average for NorCal.

Who knows...
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2014,9/6/2014,151,178,19,22,21>Cozy and comforting decor, friendly service, and delightful company made for a great introduction to Doukkala, whose menu boasts an intriguing California slant on Moroccan cuisine. Two food items that are reason enough to visit:- the escargots. Drenched in butter, garlic and green herbs ... were absolutely succulent. If you've never had snails, this is a great dish to de-flower yourself with. If you're a fan, these might top your 'best of' list. An extra sales point, they come in two sizes, with a half order of three for only $4.50 ... which might embolden the curious spendthrift.- the scallops. Dear dear, this is how they should always be cooked. Tender, moist, perfectly flavored.  Floating on a bed of Jerusalem artichoke puree. And, as with the snails, a dish that's offered in two sizes, of two and four. The rest of the food was notable, from the refreshing intro of a trio of salads to the dessert of a chocolate fondant with a whisper of cardamom.  The shared main dish of maple duck tangine showcased the idea of California's take on Moroccan; as the veggies' textures were crisper, the tastes were fresher than traditional tangine.  The only disappointment was the side bread offered -- probably outside my cultural experiences to adequately comment on, but I found the discus-shaped loaves  a bit hard and dry to really enjoy. A very respectable wine list (another facet of their California influence) rounded out a great time and enjoyable meal.  I'd enjoy another dinner of Doukkala, though impatience may warrant a drop-in just for an order of snails and a glass of wine before that.

<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2014,9/5/2014,313,779,4,8,11>A pretty solid ramen spot located in the old Mortar & Pestle (RIP).Based on the reviews, I tried the Black Garlic ramen (delicious - two slices of roasted pork, lots of greens, a soft boiled egg and seaweed), the Takoyaki (octopus balls - loved these, you get about six, topped with brown sauce, Japanese mayo and bonito fish flakes - much like the version I ate and loved in Nara, Japan several years ago) and the Grilled Rice ball (not a fan, slightly charred). I saw that they have an Izakaya menu - if you don't know what those are, it's essentially bar/pub food done Japanese style, and I'm a fan. I would like to bring the husband here for happy hour sometime! Nice to have this five minutes from home. Hope it stays around!
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2014,9/4/2014,363,125,5,7,11>This has become my new favorite sports pub! I came here with a few buddies to watch Game 1 of the 2014 NBA Playoffs to support my Golden State Warriors. I honestly didn't expect to have this much fun watching a game on TV! The atmosphere is fantastic if you like places that are loud, full of beer, and with people wanting to have fun. There's also a private parking lot so it's not much of an issue. I can say that this the probably best place to watch any bay area sports! First of all, there's 21 flat-screens plus 2 big projectors. There is no place in this pub where you'll miss the game. Also, this place is pretty big for a sports pub with plenty of chairs and tables. However, if it's a really big game, I suggest coming early as this place can fill up fast! They don't take reservations and it's first come first serve. There's a large variety of beers to choose from. From dark brews to pale ales, they'll probably have something for you to like. A pint is about $5-$6 and a pitcher is about $18.00. In my opinion, the pitcher was not big and a bit pricey. The pitcher served about 2 full glasses among 3 people. Minor complaint but I wish it was bigger.The food is also very delicious. I had the Kobe Sliders which was flavorful and had enough taste with each bite. It was categorized as an appetizer but to me it felt like an entree. I also ordered and was very surprised by the Mudpie because it was huge! I thought it wasn't too overly sweet either and it definitely filled me up. The food here is not bad for a sports pub.I had an awesome experience here and will probably come again. If you like watching sports with other people, you should definitely come here. It's loud, fun, and you get to root for your team with other fans! If you can't actually make it to the arena on gameday, give this place a shot. It's the closest thing to attending a sporting event without actually being there!
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/20/2014,9/3/2014,340,339,7,16,14>Being a new ramen fan, my hunt for great ramen is now a legit mission. Having looked up through Yelp ramen joints near me, Sobo Ramen became my destination one ramen-craving evening. We got here fairly early (at around 6 PM) for dinner, so there were only a couple of other tables occupied. The servers were friendly and prompt. We ordered the Spicy Black Tonkatsu with Pork Belly and Chicken in Miso Broth. This was the daughter's first foray into the world of real ramen and she was most pleased with her bowl of ramen. I had a sip of her broth and it was indeed rather tasty. For my part, I enjoyed the spicy, rich broth of mine. The pork was tender and the noodles were just perfect.We will return for more ramen.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2014,9/2/2014,21,206,12,12,9>So I go to the Buddhist Temple across the street and yesterday, one of the members brought a bag of their basket fries and told us all that she wants to be buried with this when she dies. So naturally, I had to try them for myself and oh my Buddha, these fries are so close to enlightenment. I had to come back today to buy a whole bag for myself. Why do you ask? Because of what they call curry ketchup and chipotle mayo. Those are the most dangerous condiments because I might not be able to control myself around them. I couldn't even grasp how they had it out in the open for all to squirt out into a to-go container. I might have taken the whole thing. Anyways, if you need fries, come here. Trust that I will be back. Will do my best to not just order fries next time.

I knew if I was pulled under your spell it would be a downward spiral. But, I couldn't resist. Our first meeting you teased my tastebuds with your vanilla salted toffee almond. Our next rendezvous we met at the Concord Farmer's Market, where you enticed me to try one of your brownie ice cream sanwiches with cream fraische ice cream sandwiched in between some of the most delicious brownies I've ever tasted. Even my husband joined in on the fun.I feel like I've met the love of my life. You haunt my dreams. I love you.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2014,8/31/2014,206,268,9,9,10>When I met Jason at the meet and greet, I really noticed that he was gentle with my puppy Riley in the way he interacted with her.  He has a calm and sweet way with animals that made me feel comfortable boarding her with him while I had some house remodeling done.  Riley has a lot of energy and needs someone to watch her to make sure she doesn't get into trouble since she's still young and Jason did a great job.  I was really impressed about how Jason handled Riley when she tried to eat a bee on their walk and he thought she got stung.  He rushed her to the vet hospital but sat with her for almost an hour to make sure she wasn't having any swelling or allergic reactions and when she seemed fine, he took her back to his place and emailed me to tell me all the details.  I asked him to check her mouth for any sign of a stinger and he did a thorough check and was able to locate the stinger and pull it out.  He kept in great communication with me through everything and kept my mind at ease.  When I leave Riley with Jason, I know she's in good hands.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/4/2014,8/30/2014,212,150,1,9,5>If you live in or near Oakland, you know that Filipino food is hard to come by. Thank goodness for this place!!! Located in East Oakland, smack in the middle of 580 and 880 you probably would never pass this place unless you were headed here. Luckily I found out about this restaurant through a yelp event they were at.  After trying several samples of their Bistek fried rice, I knew I had to try a whole meal here!They serve comfort food and have a decent selection of dishes to choose from. You order at the counter and they bring you the food when it's ready.  We got two dishes: The Bistek fried rice and the Special Garlic Noodles. Both dishes were top notch!!! I have never tasted such flavorful fried rice and Bistek. The Garlic noodles were also delicious as it had piece of Crispy Adobo pieces mixed with Garlic noodles. Did I mention the portions are quite generous. We got the food in two large bowls (more than we expected) and could easily be packed for leftovers!  As far as other dishes, they also serve breakfast (-ilog dishes). I will have to try that next time. Prices is definitely quite affordable. For the taste and the portions of food you are getting, it's definitely worth the visit!!!!!From a seating standpoint, I would probably not recommend taking too many people here for dine-in at one time as  there's probably seating good for about 10 people max inside and  (plus a couple tables outside). An alternative option is that they deliver to a limited area but that's always a plus to get Filipino delivery. Note: They are on the Eat24 App from what I recall .They also catered my friend's wedding so definitely something to consider for future events when I need delicious food! I will definitely be a regular coming to this place as I'm already hooked!
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2014,8/29/2014,155,167,7,10,9>This place has made me a brunch-iever, and that, fellow Yelpers, was no small task.True to my INTJ-ness, I really value things like structure, order, and decisiveness.  Brunch?  Br-unch?  That nebulous portmanteau, that slippery little linguistic blend of "breakfast" and "lunch" has never inspired much confidence in me.  But I've got friends and family who love to blur the meal lines (#askThicke), and that's how I found myself making a reservation last Friday night for a table for 6 at 11 am on Sunday.  The reservation, made through the Yelp app, did not count for any OpenTable Dining Points, boo!, but I appreciated the confirmation email that came right after, and then the reminder email and phone call from a hostess at Lake Chalet on Saturday.  Very thorough!The church my family and I attend, Regeneration, is just on the other side of Lake Merritt, so Lake Chalet was really the ideal restaurant choice for a Sunday brunch.  We were running a bit late since the morning service ends at 11, so we drove over and totally lucked out with a parking spot right in front.  Actually, we didn't luck out.  God totally put a hedge of angels around that space as a reward for going to church that morning.  Just kidding.  Oh my gosh am I kidding; I am no prosperity gospel-er.  In any event, I know my Heavenly Pops has a sense of humor, so it's all good!When we arrived, we had our choice of indoor or outdoor seating.  It was a warm day, but kind of breezy, so we opted to sit inside.  They gave us a table right next to the window so we had a sweeping view of the lake.  I don't know if this place plans on remodeling anytime soon, but if they do, I hope they swap out the windows for ones with no grids so that the view is not obstructed... and I can take a proper panorama shot of the lake with my phone.  Priorities!Our server, Avery, was such an amiable, easygoing, but still very attentive person.  Loved him!Here's what we got:Mimosa - $8Strawberry Guava Lemonade - $5.25Cranberry Juice - $2.25Coffee - $3Beignets (5 per order) - $8Sorbet (Flavor of the Day - Coconut) - $6Bread Pudding - $9Lemon Pudding Cake - $9Dungeness Crab Cakes - $16Fried Calamari - $13House Salad - $11LG Scallops - $28Meyer Lemon Ricotta Pancakes - $13Lake Merritt Breakfast - $15I'm only going to comment, of course, on the things I ordered/tried:There's definitely more strawberry than guava in their lemonade, but it was a very sizeable, refreshing drink nonetheless.  My aunt asked for 2 orders of beignets to start, and then another two afterward, and we didn't take any home with us.  Crispy outside, doughy inside, light dusting of powdered sugar on top.  It's served with two sauces, raspberry and dark chocolate, and neither of them are too sweet.I am IN LOVE with their Meyer Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  I grew up really wary of pancakes since I had only ever eaten them from some Bisquik, Hungry Jack, etc. box mix concoctions... but these are delicious!  There's just the slightest touch of lemon, and the pancakes themselves were golden and fluffy.  It's served with two slices of bacon, some syrup, and a handful of raspberries and blackberries.  You don't even need the syrup.  Would definitely order these again!I guess they rotate their ice cream and sorbet flavors, so our options last Sunday were vanilla ice cream and coconut sorbet.  You get three tiny scoops of sorbet served in a ramekin, and I'd say the coconut was pretty good.  I know you can get a pint of Ben and Jerry's for $2.50 on sale at Safeway, or some Talenti gelato for $3.99, but getting to complete the dining experience here with family made this little splurge worth it.My Dad has been away for a while and this was his first visit back to the Bay.  It was so great to spend time together as a family again, and our experience at Lake Chalet really could not have been any better.  Highly recommended!
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2014,8/28/2014,118,211,8,13,12>Halo Halo Bar & Boba Station already won me over when they said, "Large tapioca is already added to the drink." SAY WHAAAAT?!?! Those are golden words to hear if you're a boba bum like I am. Nothing beats not paying a stinkin' penny for those chewy tapioca balls!Halo Halo Bar & Boba Station has an innovative boba menu. Although they offer your typical snow flavors like Mango, Thai Tea, Taro, Strawberry, etc. they took mixing up drinks to a whole new level. Ever heard of the Purple Oreo? If Taro and Oreos banged each other, out would come the Purple Oreo. The taro mixed with oreos remind me of your typical cookies and cream shake with a hint of Asian flavor. Plus, let's face it, the large tapioca is perfectly cooked! The only reason why I gave this place four stars instead of five is because I wish they have the option of substituting their drinks with soy milk. Also, if you want boba on the get-go you might find their service a little slow.However, Halo Halo Bar & Boba Station is arguably the best non-franchise boba place to get your boba on in the Solano County. Very reasonable prices plus there's munchies to snack on!
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2014,8/27/2014,1310,187,27,19,19>When you have a friend who is willing to drive up from San Jose during peak traffic hours, we're talking 6pm on a Wednesday - JUST to get some Homeroom Mac n Cheese... c'mon.How could I have not stopped by Homeroom EVER? I lived in Oakland my whole life, I am ashamed at myself.I showed up and I  already knew I've been missing out because the wait was 40 minutes and the whole corner of the block was covered with people waiting. I felt like I was waiting for a roller coaster ride at six flags, except not in a line. The waiting style here is the classic first come first serve name on the list type of sign up wait. Forgive me for not knowing/coming to Homeroom earlier. I'll make it up by going again right after I write this review.Seating on the inside, seating on the outside.Don't worry about the cold, they got heaters outside! It's very family feel around Homeroom, definitely feel the local love and seeing a 40 minute wait of people just feels right for a place like this.We didn't mind the wait, esp cause we knew we were getting the monthly Mac - THE PESTO MAC N CHEESE. I added chicken and bread crumbs to mine and it topped off to about 13 bucks. The majority of the Macs are about $9-$11 before Add-Ons.Add-Ons range from .50 cents to $2.We're talking chicken, mushrooms, scallops, onions add-ons.. the list goes on.The food takes 15 minutes to come out - not bad for a place jam packed. The staff is super nice - OH, and there is a "fly-thru lane" for those who want to order on their app (yes they made their own friggin app) and just drive your car to the curb outside and pick up the food. Yes, they will walk the food out to you. You don't have to get out of your car.I'll be back. Going right now.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2014,8/26/2014,193,936,4,11,7>What an amazing find. This small winery is located in the Rodeo Marina. It even has outdoor patio to enjoy a different view of the bay. They are opened from noon to 5pm on the weekends. The owners/pourers are friendly and even were able to answer a question about the bay.The wines are good.  I prefer red wines normally. However, their Harlequin Chardonnay is a winner.  This wine could make me a white wine drinker. I also liked the Zin and the Jester Petite Syrah. I am a fan of wine created with grapes from Lodi and they use mostly Lodi grapes.I am so pleased that that they chose Rodeo to locate their tasting room.  They are close, and the wines are good. Rodeo might see like a town the time as past by, hopefully 4 fools winery will put it back on the map.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/24/2014,8/25/2014,3448,1617,6,13,14>I'm a fan of Mi Terra market and shop here often because it's one of the bigger stores in my area that sell a variety of Latin foods. They have a large selection of dried and fresh chile peppers, spices and vegetables - which is mostly what I buy. A larger variety than other stores, so when I don't want to run around I just come here. The torta rolls are made fresh daily and 4/$1.00. They have fresh cheeses, meats and a seafood department. You can buy delicious fresh mexican cheeses by the pound, I love the queso fresco and the cotija. You can get some good deals with better flavor (marinated meats) over shopping a larger grocery store. They also make fresh squeezed juices and sandwiches that look delicious. If you love to cook as much as I do, you'll find Mi Terra to be a great resource for those hard to find ingredients.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,8/24/2014,142,274,15,19,11>After 25 years of hating cats, I adopted a 10-year old cancer cat who sprung back to life on a kidney diet to the point that if she DOESN't wake me up meowing at 3 in the morning I think she died.  As a pragmatic consumer, I decided to shop around rather than throw my money away at the vet.As the name implies, Petvet Petfood is both a clinic (provides basic services at a discount on Fridays and Saturdays) and a good old fashioned store.  I'm not positive if the prices for my super expensive prescription diet are better than at the vet, but they're right on par and sure as hell cheaper than Amazon.  It may not look like it right away, but this place is big!  Aisles and aisles of food and some basics in the back.  I was worried about buying the food because the vet did not give me an actual physical written prescription, but the super helpful and very friendly gentleman said that as soon as I step through the door, I become their client, so as long as my vet recommended I buy it, they'll sell it to me.  It's just food, after all.  It's very reassuring knowing I have a place to buy her food without hassle and constricting vet office hours.  Whew.  Huge weight lifted off my shoulders.
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2014,8/23/2014,246,234,16,21,18>LOVE!! LOVE!! LOVE this place. I usually don't speak highly of a "fast food" place, because to be honest why should I, since 75% of it is usually not healthy. When a place serves great food, reasonable price and it's not all bad (except for the fried part) than it's a win win!!This place is very simple. Step 1: Choice either chicken or falafel. Step 2: Choice either a Bowl or Pita and Step 3: Pick your condiments. How easy is that? We decided to try one of each with Falafel. The Pita came in a very unique box. You gotta order it. What a genius idea! I ordered the bowl which comes with a bed of mixed greens. I think the bowl gives you more bang for your buck, especially when you order a side of pita bread. The falafel was cooked perfectly and the size was great. No one wants small balls. Heck I know I don't! I want a mouth full, darn it!!FYI...Not everything on the menu is vegan and not all the condiments are complimentary. Some items (i.e. olives, roasted peppers and etc.) are not included in the price. Make sure to ask the employees first. That part doesn't make sense. If it's on the condiment sections it should just be included.The serves is excellent. The people are super friendly. I wish all places we ate were that friendly. There is no seating inside but plenty outside. They even have a little doggie station with water and a latch to hook the doggie leash. Pretty cool. Bathrooms are located in the back of the building and private parking all around. Great place to grab a meal before or after you watch a movie. Then again, you can be like me and smuggle that bad boy into the movie theatre...yup I'm one of those people!!
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/22/2014,8/22/2014,579,194,7,25,11>$40 for a 1 hour deep tissue massage. Head 2 Toe where have you been all my life?! This is not a promotion but a standard rate that you can get anytime you visit. If you pay with cash or debit they'll knock off a few bucks too. My friend has been raving about this spa for a while and it's a spa she frequents. After a long morning at the Sonoma Raceways we decided to get pampered.  I made an appointment for 2 and was able to get us a spot in an hour. When we arrived we were asked to complete a form that inquired if we wanted a male or female masseuse, the type of massage I wanted, and to circle all the areas I want the masseuse to target. THIS IS GENIUS! I get exactly what I want by specifying it on a piece of paper upon entry. After I completed my form and paid for my service, I was led to my room with a few minutes to get ready for my much needed massage.My masseuse's name was Helen. She did a VERY THOROUGH job on my body and pin pointed all my problem areas. I can tell she spent extra time on my shoulders and back which were parts I circled on my form. I was worried that she would focus on just the parts I circled but she worked through my entire body, literally head to toe. She does both sides of your body and the bonus is the amazing butt massage. You'll see when you visit :) The head massage was awesome too! Overall, the pressure of my massage was perfect I suggest you get this massage in the nude so nothing gets in the way of their magical healing hands. I felt completely relaxed and was in a daze when I walked out my room. I love it here and will be returning once a month with my friend.NOTE: The facility is clean and the staff was professional and polite. Be sure to tip on your way out. Ladies, your makeup will be messed up at the end of your massage. Wear little to no make-up or bring something for touch ups if you plan to stay out.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,8/21/2014,72,161,3,8,11>Babette's fantastic pastries, lunch salad trios, and slow pour coffee keep me coming back. The pastries sit on a grey slate behind some glass and tempt you while you're waiting in line to pay. Get one - the chocolate hazelnut cookie has chunks of real hazelnut, isn't too sweet, and is a refreshing change from Semifreddi's cookies (is it just me, or do they have a near-monopoly on baked goods near the southeast corner of campus?).  The make-up of the salad trios changes constantly. Over the past months, I've had salads with asparagus, crumbled egg, farro, orecchiete, quinoa (duh), wonderfully seasoned mixed greens, beets, apples... not all at once, of course! Babette can probably make a salad out of anything under the sun and in the garden. The only way my lunches could be more healthy and thoughtful is if my mother packed them.Beverages - top notch. You can't go wrong with Verve and Ritual. They also have a selection of bottled beers at a great price ($4-5), which means you can enjoy your brew on the sunny patio and have yourself the most peaceful happy hour ever.

Always have to take advantage of the natural vitamin D.  We ordered the miso spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, pork tonkatsu., and mochi for dessert. The spicy tuna roll was very fresh. The avocado in the shrimp tempura was mouth watering and super creamy. The tonkatsu came with hot mustard sauce, other spices, and a bed of cabbage. Very refreshing and flawlessly crispy. The green tea and strawberry mochi were cut in halves and drizzled with caramel sauce. Not only was the quality of food top notch and flavorful, but the presentation of the food was very neatly executed. The price wasn't too bad. With splitting the bill, I only paid $17. Surprisingly, it wasn't too busy during lunch hour. You can find parking on the street. I can't wait to come back and try more.
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2014,8/19/2014,163,180,4,10,10>I don't have a big sweet tooth, but Meadowlark has me craving their soft serve.Their soft serve cones are perfect on hot summer days.. actually I take that back. They're perfect on any day and any time of the year. They also have a good selection of flavors to choose from. I've tried their pineapple/vanilla swirl and their chocolate/vanilla swirl. Both satisfying without being overly sweet. You can't beat how cheap their soft serve is: $2/small, $2.25/medium and $2.25/large. The medium was the perfect size for me. Their most expensive item is the Diablo (slushie + ice cream) at $3.25 and their slushies are only $1.75. You can satisfy your cravings for just a few bucks. I found that the drive thru line and walk up line were both long on the Sunday afternoon that I went. I instead opted to park (parking was easy) and walk up to order. The line moved fairly fast despite how long it looked. I would rather enjoy my soft serve outside to avoid a sticky mess in the car. Although it is a bit of a drive for me, their cheap and yummy soft serve is well worth it.

On a Thursday!!!!?!?? In Pleasanton!!!!!? WTF!!!" I was kinda pissed. And then.....Yeah-- I'm telling you, from one skeptic to another (from one 20 something to another for that matter), this place is THE place to be on a Thursday--- I don't care where you live in the great U S of A.The band reminded me of that awesome scene from the hangover where the dude sings out "big butts" in lounge style-- they had a live band for hip hop and it was amazing!! I think I said "I want them to play at my wedding" about 5 times-- and I'm not even engaged.  Cougars and 45+ something's getting their thing on, on the dance floor and pretty much every other inch of this place. Talk about trying to still hang on to your 20's--- thirty years later. It's great, I don't know if it's inspiring or just something to gawk at-- but you get it girls! I hope I'm as energetic as you when I'm your ageThe drinks/food/cover is steep for a week day in the tri-valley, but hey besides a strip club I don't think I'll get this much entertainment and alcohol before 10pm on a Thursday night. Worth it! Pro tip-- bring your 40/50 something mom who's still trying to be trendy, she'll love it and make friends :) P.S. Fish tacos-- $16 for 3....pricy but good drunken munchies as you make your way out when they do last call around 9:45pm
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2014,8/17/2014,341,458,8,16,11>This is not just another Italian joint in downtown Hayward.  Ristoranti di Palermo is Italian with Mediterranean flair.We were able to enjoy Palermo during its grand opening.  It's only been open for four days!  The space is nice and open, yet with a cozy feel to it.  There is patio seating out front, and I'm told that well mannered dogs are welcome.The owner and our server were gracious and enthusiastic.  My understanding is that the owners are of Turkish heritage, but have many years experience in the Italian restaurant business.  So Palermo is the best of both worlds.  The specials sounded fantastic, but we ordered off the regular menu.  We had the Mese Misto appetizer, a Mediterranean plate of delicious fresh pita bread with a wonderful hummus, stuffed grape leaves, red peppers and tzatziki.  I could have eaten that pita with the hummus and red peppers all day.  I ordered the Penne ala Vodka, with sundried tomatoes and sea scallops.  Very tasty.  Mr. M had the Involtino di Pollo, a chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella and prosciutto.  Also good.  We didn't have room to try dessert.  We need to plan better next time.While the beer and wine license is coming soon, take advantage of no corkage fee if you bring your own wine.  I don't know when the license will come, so call ahead to confirm.  Also, they have a breakfast menu that sounds delish.  Listen to this: "Benedict Palermo - English muffin with two poached eggs, crispy prosciutto, housemade Hollandaise sauce, topped with a pesto drizzzle."  Mmm.Enjoy!
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2014,8/16/2014,419,343,6,10,10>Stopped by here on a stroll around the Richmond Farmer's Market. I first saw this potato when someone brought it as lunch to work one day. I never saw a baked potato so stuffed and he seemed like he was enjoying it.For $6 you can get a buttered potato with all the fixings. Mine included a generous amount of bacon bits, jalapeños, chives, cheese, and sour cream. Not to mention that the potato itself is freaking HUGE (as many a Yelper have said). If you were to look at the potato pic I posted you'd have to agree. Portion is pretty good for a meal in itself, satisfied my hunger even if I didn't eat breakfast before going to work. Tip: The $6 is for any and all toppings, so get your money's worth and get ALL the toppings please!For an additional $1 I got a Coke - good way to wash out a mouthwatering potato.Only thing missing is something to satisfy the sweet tooth - should be easy if you're at a farmer's market.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2014,8/15/2014,110,127,10,13,10>Where else can you buy a delicious sandwich with a drink and a snack for under $10 and still have enough money left to treat someone else? Its definitely not Subway! The Vietnamese sandwich or banh mi is served fast and is surprisingly inexpensive at Banh Mi Ba Le Deli. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal nearby.This particular location is supposedly related to an East Oakland business of the same name except this is in a safer area with a private parking lot. Its within walking distance of the El Cerrito Plaza BART station and a block down from Rialto Cinemas Cerrito.The banh mi is served on a very crunchy baguette and has the usual choice of meat with cilantro, pickled carrots, shredded daikon and sliced chili peppers. I've only tried the #9(BBQ chicken) and the #10(vegetarian) sandwiches so far and really liked them both. They also serve various traditional Vietnamese plates and pho as well as Vietnamese snack foods like dumplings, spring rolls and desserts. The service here is great in terms of speed and attentiveness but its not the friendliest either depending on who helps you. They've never been rude to me or other customers but I wouldn't say they are welcoming exactly. Its not a big deal for me though since I am well aware of how testing it can be to work with the public face to face constantly!I'm proud to say that this was one of my first introductions to Vietnamese food and to their popular banh mi sandwiches. However I would not come here to dine-in! Its just not set up that way. Its a small location with very few seating arrangements so you're encouraged to get something to go rather than sit down. Its also a cash only business so stop by the ATM if you're only carrying plastic! I suspect this is one of the reasons why they can afford to charge $2.75-$3.00 for a sandwich! For a quick bite to eat or a lunch break you really can't beat the price. And while Banh Mi Ba Le may not be on par with your favorite Vietnamese restaurant, its superior to any local deli nearby for its affordability and speedy service.
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/20/2014,8/14/2014,63,9,11,8,8>They try to make it all about the wine. That is, after all, what Va de Vi means. They hand you an exhaustive list of reds, whites, bubblies, and scurry off to grab you bread and butter while you ask yourself the eternal question: how drunk am I willing to get???? And yes, by all means, get a glass of wine, or a cocktail, or soda, get WHATEVER, as long as you don't let it distract you from the real star of the show: THE DESSERT SAMPLER. YEAH, YOU HEARD ME. They call it a "dessert tasting for two" but I think a more accurate term would be "dessert tasting for three: me, myself, and I" because the only thing I think after the first bite of the chocolate soufflé is "anyone who comes near this soufflé is going to get my ooey-gooey chocolate-covered fork shoved clean through their hand." The dessert sampler comes with four mini desserts, which ALWAYS includes their signature soufflé (which is soooooo chocolatey and decadent omg) as well as three others that change frequently (profiteroles, bread pudding, crème brûlée, etc), and they're generally all excellent. SERIOUSLY, GET THIS. "But I'm so full!" STOMACHS CAN STRETCH, Y'KNOW. "But it's kinda expensive..." TREAT YO'SELF. "Think of the calories!" LOL, OKAY. As far as the actual food goes, it's all pretty good, albeit a bit on the pricer side, but that's to be expected at a place that's literally five steps away from a Tiffany's. They do warn you right when you sit down that everything is a small plate and that sharing is caring (read: family style). Generally, two plates per person will be enough to fill you up. They used to serve seared dayboat scallops, which were AMAZING, but haven't had them in a while ): You also can't go wrong with the black cod or the lechon! (They tell you that the ahi tartare is their signature, but it's honestly just passable). One last thing: this place is just so goddamn adorable. Try to come when the weather is nice and sit in the little cobblestone-lined alleyway. If you squint real hard, you'll start to believe you're at a little café in Paris, munching on a croissant, sipping a citron-pressé before realizing that, oh, no, it's just Walnut Creek in all its banal suburban glory. Well, it was nice while it lasted. tl;dr: did your eyes really glaze over this review without seeing my caps-locked rant about the dessert sampler?
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2014,8/13/2014,313,58,15,14,17>Home of Charlie Chaplin. Well he did his first silent movies here. Great shops to buy antiques, collectibles, bars, they have added a few smaller specialty restaurants, sandwich places, ice cream parlor, jewelry stores, train that runs from Niles to Sunol and back. The last Sunday of August is the best and biggest flea market you can find! Seriously this whole township gets in on it. Also watch the local info for Charlie Chaplin days, car shows and more. Just come on down to Niles and enjoy the atmosphere. You will be happy you did.
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2014,8/12/2014,182,323,8,10,11>This girl is on fiiiiiire! Or at least her mouth is...but in a so-good-it-hurts kind of way. I studied abroad in Shanghai for a semester so I could handle the heat. Just a quick disclaimer though--Sichuan heat is intense with a mouth numbing effect. What we ordered:CHEF'S SPECIAL FROG LEGS: frog legs stir fried with jalapenos and other spicy peppers. They were definitely a big portion of frog legs and the heat was evenly distributed throughout the dish. I wish they added a mild vegetable like bell peppers or onions so we could eat more of the vegetables.SICHUAN SPICY FRIED CHICKEN: one of my favorite dishes of the night...little bits of chicken are fried perfectly with peppers and just a little bit of the "ma-la" spice that makes your mouth tingle. Between the three dishes we ordered, this was the least spicy.FISH SUPREME IN SPICY BROTH: my absolute favorite dish of the night because it was the most SPICY and because it reminded me of my study abroad adventures. The broth is super intense so you better get your bowl of rice and extra glasses of water handy. I loved how the fish filet pieces, napa cabbage, bean sprouts, and other veggies seem to be marinating in this spicy mixture. The glass rice noodles were also a nice surprise hiding in the bowl. We didn't finish this and I brought the broth home to toss with noodles and rice (literally just finished the leftovers tonight). I am a pretty big fan of Lulu's now because it's hard to find good Sichuan cuisine in this area. You have your usual Americanized Chinese food or Cantonese/HK dishes and dimsum, but Lulu's adds a unique choice for people to try out a different aspect of Chinese cuisine. It's a little pricier but everything is family sized and you can have leftovers!If you're feeling adventurous, definitely come try out Lulu's.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2014,8/11/2014,194,145,7,9,7>Very solid meal, I'd happily recommend this spot...just make sure you make a reservation to avoid the wait.***HAND CHOPPED CALAMARI, wok fried, tossed with jalapeno, ginger, scallionsIs calamari ever really that good? My interest was piqued when this was the first item recommended by our server, who said if it wasn't good we could throw it at her. Deal. While I was really looking forward to practicing my pitch, I was even more ecstatic to find that this was the very best calamari I'd ever tasted. Anywhere. It was just so freaking soft & fresh (imagine, texturally pleasing squid!), perfectly breaded (not to excess), and the jalapeño & ginger gave it this pleasing kick & snap like no calamari before it. Well played, Marica. Accompanied by a pleasant little salad.***PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND MUSSELS, Pernod Shallot BrothAnd of course our server had to go and send out a complimentary dish of mussels--way to butter us up. Speaking of butter, these mussels were floating it the most delectable butter broth, strangely light with a hint of shallot. Perfect to sop up with bread. The mussels were the freshest of the fresh, just like they should be. Not a hint of fishiness as I have sadly come to expect.***SEAFOOD STEW, halibut, scallops, shrimp, simmered in lobster cognac sauce, served with gruyere cheese soufflé puffFantabulous. Not the least bit fishy, these generous chunks of halibut were bursting with flavor, the shrimp was beautifully fluffy, the scallops were perfectly melt-in-your-mouth (sinful I know, but many places screw this up).  It was the mushrooms, onion, garlic, & cherry tomatoes that put it over the top--all pleasantly robust and present. The broth was almost peanuty, but I don't mean that in a bad way--it was delightfully mild and sufficiently but not excessively buttery. The gruyere cheese soufflé puff was lovely & sweet, nice and light and perfect to soak in the broth.***MESQUITE GRILLED LOCH DUART SALMON, Pineapple ginger beurre blanc, organic mashed potatoes, spinach and fennel puree, grilled asparagusThere was nothing glaringly wrong with this dish, but I found it to be rather boring. The salmon was cooked properly, maybe a second or two too long as it wasn't as creamy and soft as it could have been. The pineapple didn't add much in my opinion, maybe detracted a bit. The spinach/fennel puree was lovely, the mashed potatoes were very standard, as was the asparagus. Certainly not bad, but a bit yawn-inducing.***MIXED BERRY BISCOTTI TRIFLE, Soft & crunchy biscotti, house made custard, topped off with whipped cream and seasonal fruitIt was pretty good I guess. Fresh raspberries on the top. The whipped cream tasted a bit spray-can. Biscotti wasn't crunchy, though I wouldn't have wanted it to be--flavor was mediocre. Custard a bit lackluster. Strawberries were marinated in syrup and soft. It's practically impossible to beat my homemade trifle, so I don't know why I even bother to try others when I know I'll be disappointed.ALL IN ALL:Posh little place, quality food, nice servers. Come here and you certainly won't be disappointed.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2014,8/10/2014,132,150,8,11,8>Street Fighter II Turbo, Mortal Kombat, Neo Geo, Contra, Double Dragon, Pac Man, and Tron... If these titles don't stir any kind of emotion in you, keeping moving. These are few of the classic games you'll find at High Scores and for a $5 admission fee, you can play any available game(s) for an entire hour without the hassle of going to a change machine. For $10, you gain admission for the entire day. Seriously, how can you go wrong??I actually appreciate the fact that there aren't any recent (within the last 20 years) titles present bc that not only keeps the price low, but more importantly, it keeps most of the young, untamed rascals out too (yes, I said 'rascal').I only wished there was a vending machine or some snack bar. But on the other hand, would you allow food and drink into a cultural history sanctuary?
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/14/2014,8/9/2014,612,401,11,14,10>4.5 stars for their Hennessy Red (Red Velvet cupcake soaked in Hennessy) and S'more cupcakes. Judging from how good these two cupcakes were, my friend and I are definitely going back again to try more of their cupcakes. The Hennessy Red I got last Saturday was the BEST red velvet cupcake I have tasted so far from any cupcakery that I have checked out so far. It has everything I expected from a perfectly executed red velvet cupcake: super moist, velvety texture (tender but not crumbly), perfect flavor (chocolaty and not too sweet) and bright red color, but with more: the cognac infused flavor. It was distinct in the mid to top section of the cupcake. My friend and I each took a bite from the side of the cupcake that contained both the frosting and the cupcake without the cognac. We were both "oohh & aahh"'ing at that point already by how moist and tender and delicious our first bites were. Then as we took more bites we were pleasantly surprised by the kick from the cognac, which really worked to enhance the flavor. My friend's S'more Cupcake was a winner too. It has a thin layer of graham cracker at the bottom and then (moist) and flavorful chocolate cupcake filled with sweet, creamy marshmallow, as well as delicious frosting that contained chocolate fudge, a graham cracker piece, marshmallows and chocolate ganache. By looking at this long list of items in a cupcake you might think there is too much going on. On the contrary, all of these items did "gel" well and the result was one super yummy, orgasmic cupcake. I mean I have never seen a guy who moaned so much over a cupcake at the lunch table. We tasted these cupcakes after lunch at a Chinese restaurant. We were both full and were just going to try a bite at each cupcake. Before we knew it we chewed down all of them. The restaurant staff was gracious enough letting us sit there eating our dessert from outside without charging us for "cupcake corkage". But that was quite eye opening for them and they inquired about this cupcake shop as well. Their standard sized cupcake is at $2.5 each (mini is $1.50 each); compared to other cupcakeries such as Sprinkles or Kara's Cupcakes that charged something like $3.25 each this is a way much better deal, especially considering that so far I have not liked any of the cupcakes from the above two chain cupcakeries as their cakes are too sugary and the texture was more dense and dry. Thanks to the Cupcake War on the Food Network I found this cute little local mother-daughter duo cupcake shop. I still remember I watched that episode last year. Even though they did not win that episode, they are winners in my book and I will definitely go back to try more flavors!Oh and they have different daily special; the Hennessy Red is a special they only make for Saturdays. They do have Red Velvet cupcakes as one of their regular menu item though in case you want to try it without the cognac.

I thought I would never find a deep dish pizza I liked as much as Zachary's but now...I'm going to be driving out to Lafayette and stripping the ozone layer with my gas guzzler just to get Patxi's pizza. I can't pronounce it, I can't even spell it, but I can definitely eat it with a smile on my face.I got the chicago-style deep dish with mushrooms, onions and jalapenos. I ordered it online (are you reading this Zachary's?) and picked it up on my way home from work. After 20+ years of doing the re-dial dance trying to order from Zachary's over the phone, now I can order my delicious pizza online. I'm reserving a star just in case last night's pizza heaven was a fluke. I'll update as soon as I know.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2014,8/7/2014,291,487,6,13,12>We surprised our Mom with a limo trip to the Livermore valley this past weekend & our driver randomly picked Darcie Kent as one of our winery stops.  Turns out this was our favorite stop of the day!We walked in to a pleasantly uncrowded tasting room/gallery.  It's one big open room so you can sip your wine & stroll around admiring the artwork (all done by Darcie, who is a phenomenal artist).  Since it was such a gorgeous day, the staff encouraged us to sit on their patio & taste outside.  I was a little apprehensive since sitting outside usually = bad service, but that was not the case here.  Our server was warm, attentive & checked on us frequently without making us feel rushed.  He took the time to talk about the winery, the vineyards, and each wine in detail.  In fact, all of the staff we spoke with that day were friendly & not the least bit pretentious.  Now, to the wines.  The first sip of their chardonnay, I was in love.  I like buttery chards and this one had an amazingly creamy taste.  My next fave was the pinot noir...light, fruity, & spicy.  We also tried the Gruner Veltliner (like a sauvingnon blanc), the merlot, & the cab.  I can't say I was disappointed with any of them.We enjoyed their wines so much that my Dad joined the wine club & took home 3 bottles, and my sis & I both bought a few bottles for ourselves.  They even threw in a poster of one of Darcie's beautiful paintings as a birthday gift to my Mom.  Nice!I'll be sure to come back for some tastings with the Wine Club folks!Kid friendly too.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2014,8/6/2014,330,444,10,12,13>Big fan here.  Since EVERY review contains a statement about "credentials" for having an opinion; here are mine: Born on the East Coast, a Nana from Yonkers, a lot of Polish/German in me,  grew up with many a Jew in Westchester county. Mazel Tov. I hold this restaurant near and dear.  I love the high ceilings, the booth seating, black and white tile, and the certain Berkeley je ne sais quoi you can't find anywhere else. This place is fast becoming sentimental for me, but I'll start by saying there are times when it is disappointing.  I wouldn't come here with a large, demanding group, for example. Service can be spotty in that college town way.  I really love some of the standby staff and the old timers, but I bet the college students don't tip very well, and working in North Berkeley - with the public - can be HELL- so, props to Saul's for serving this community.  Thank You for having East Coast/Eastern European/Jewish/Delicatessen style food in the East Bay.  Such a creature of habit, you'll find me here on Thursday nights, when they have a Chicken Schnitzel special. When you get the some thing on the menu every time, you begin to detect the variety and quality that dish can present.  It's been sort of....Meh..on occasion, with the chicken being too dry, the parsley, egg and caper garnish scrimpy... you know, just not that great.  However, after taking a several month Saul's break, I returned to enjoy a plate I just LOVED and was reminded of why I always get the Thursday night special.  I really like that the veg side salad that's served with the dinner specials varies by season.  Good veg side on the dinner plates and good mashed potatoes. The latkes, I've had better.  I got hook up from my neighbor. She totally cooks those things up so deliciously!!   Anyway, in addition to their wine list, which is well selected, interesting and always pairs quite well with their menu, they have a *liquor license*, (YES!)  with some cool cocktails for a good price.  Having never tried the celery infused vodka martini, I was totally thrilled when I tried it.  It is in the rotation. For a deli case, I don't see the turnover being high enough on some of the items and they seem a little old, not to mention OVER-priced.  I don't go here at any other time than dinner, so no comment on the counter service in the AM, but from what I see this place is more of a go-to for dinner/diner than for the deli case.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,8/5/2014,327,431,16,24,16>Nature Vegetarian appears to be just another rundown low budget Chinese restaurant from the outside. Actually it appears that way from the inside as well. However once you open up the menu *hallelujah* you're instantly transported to a world of pure Vegan imagination. It's a serene dining experience that you wouldn't expect from the outside.Like many Buddhist restaurants they eschew the use of use onions or garlic so I'm confused how the food can taste so damn good? That's my go to flavor enhancer of choice so I would be curious to know how they get their dishes so flavorful.You want the best wonton soup in The Bay Area? You'll find it right here in Oakland's Chinatown. This is the stuff you'll be craving for when you are feeling under the weather. Then again, I've only had wonton soup from Golden Lotus and other Veg places so perhaps It's only the best meat-free version.Their eggrolls were perfectly crisp and not dripping in oil. They even cut them on the bias and neatly decorated the plate. Try finding that anywhere else around here. The other dish that stood out for me was the Sweet & Sour Pork. So perfectly executed with their homemade pork substitute. There is a good amount of breading but it's just the right amount to me. A far cry from their "Pork Spareribs" which are nearly all bread and nothing else. I would avoid that dish. Check out the General Tso's Chick-non for another five star dish. The story of how Nature Vegetarian came to be is actually quite endearing. The owner formerly owned a traditional Chinese Dim Sum place called Lucky & Lucky yelp.com/biz/lucky-and-l… He became ill and had to sell his shop. He learned Vegetarian cooking while working in a monastery. Once his health improved, he repurchased his restaurant, opening it up as a Vegetarian only eatery. For that the Vegan community is very thankful. Bonus points for the cool little book of Buddhism quotes a nice old lady handed me during my last visit as she was stocking the tiny bookshelf up front. "One should not kill a living being, nor cause it to be killed, nor should one incite another to kill. Do not injure any being, either strong or weak, in the world" sounds like something I could get with.Excellent prices, good service, great food depending on what you order, conveniently located, win win win!! They're so close to 12th st BART that it's difficult for me to pass by here without hopping off BART to grab something to bring home to my babygirl.My love is a fan of Nature Veg as well: yelp.com/biz/nature-vege…
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/20/2014,8/4/2014,143,256,6,10,7>Well, well, well, isn't this cute.  This is quite a hidden gem (literally) this restaurant is located behind the Craneway Pavilion.  As I entered I see Mad Men on the screen, and  the smooth, golden voice of Frank Sinatra was wafting all around.  I had Aseemble bookmarked for quite some time, and with a little time to kill it was my opportunity to partake.  I took a seat at the bar, and the friendly bartender served up "The Paloma"; a cocktail with St. Germaine, grapefruit juice, other things I can't remember, and a salted rim.  It was tasty and refreshing.  To nosh on I decided on the homemade BBQ chips with onion dip.  The chips had  the perfect balance of crispness and spice, and the carmelized onions in the dip had a great flavor without being overpowering.Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday, and the menu looked fantastic.  I can't wait to go back and try an entree or brunch.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2014,8/3/2014,54,200,4,11,6>WOW, probably the most  unique and interesting sushi meals I've ever experienced! I wasn't sure if I was happy, offended,  exalted, or uncomfortable, or all of the combined, but I definitely left feeling something and isn't that the true marker of a great dining experience?A warning to the wise: DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT TO EAT YOUR MEAL IN PEACE.  Aki- San loves to talk! And he will talk you through every dish, how to dip it in soy sauce, how many bites to take and he might even grab your nigiri while it's on your plate to show you how to hold it. Personal bubbles do not exist here!   I can see how some people would HATE this, but I thought it was  entertaining and very informational. My bf says you shouldn't take it too seriously because it's all theatrics. It's like a Broadway play and Aki-san is star. So if you come with an open attitude, you will have a blast. Do not ask a simple question and expect to get a simple answer. It might also be that when we came, there were only 3 people in the restaurant so we were getting prime attention.Apparently, they only seat the bar- which has about ~8 seats. They never use the rooms with the sit down tables. I'm glad we came on a slower weekday, so we didn't have to wait.The meal: We started with the cucumber/seaweed salad. I wasn't a big fan of this, same with miso soup. I think because the flavors were more subtle and there wasn't as much salt as typical sushi places. This isn't necessary bad, just not what I'm used to. Aki- san urged us to get the scallop nigiri and i'm so glad he did. It was from Japan, and SO DELICIOUS. Every taste bud on your tongue is ignited- so flavorful and savory sweet. Same with the yellowtail nigiri, we weren't planning on getting it, but Aki told us it's the most popular item and for good reason. Hands down the best yellowtail I've ever had. I could feel the electrical pulses in my mouth traveling to my brain giving off endorphins. So much umami here!Usually salmon nigiri is my favorite, but I actually didn't enjoy it too much here, probably because I was so enraptured by the yellowtail and scallop. My bf loves tuna so we got the blue fin tuna. It was so delicate and although I'm not a crazy tuna fan, I could even appreciate how good it was (16$ for two pieces though!)Pressed salmon sushi- never tried it before and I don't think I liked it. It was very sweet and a bit sour on top. probably wouldn't get again, but good to experience.Overall, some items were better than ever, and so far, one of the best sushi places I've tried but the entire dining experience makes it worth it!SO easy to spend 100$ here for two people! There is actually a minimum of 25$ a person here (excluding drinks) I left feeling very full and knowing a heck more about sushi than I did before I came. Definitely a place to go when you want to treat yourself!
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2014,8/2/2014,184,198,6,11,11>Tamon Tea just opened across from Berkeley City College, and we need to give them some major Yelp love.  It's a tiny place, so if you blink you might pass it by, but the quality of its equally narrow menu is BIG!  Have you ever had Omusubi, the little rice triangles wrapped in seaweed, with  a bit of something in the middle?  No, you haven't, unless you've had them here.  Most of the time, they're hard, cold, and you can't find the filling.  At Tamon, they are made on demand - the rice is moist and warm, the seaweed crispy, and the filling, oh, the filling - We tried the Unagi and the Spicy Tuna, and they were a revelation.  We were hungry and ate them lickety-split, but when we got home, we looked at each other and said, "don't you wish we hadn't eaten those, so we'd have them to eat again?" - the ultimate compliment to food.  We noticed there's a party plate of Omusubi, but I think we could eat the whole thing between the two of us. Besides various Omusubi choices, there are Mochi-based snacks, both sweet and savory, from Mitarashi Dango to Choco Monaka & Mochi ice creams, combo plates, Donburi, soup, salad, teas, and shaved Ice, or as the Hawaiians say "shave ice"...in fact, they have a machine from Hawaii that produces ice as light as fresh powder snow - unlike the chunky ice you get most places.  We tried the Green Apple, never my favorite, but the fan among us loved it.  Super-sour but light and true to flavor - really like a very tart apple, not at all syrupy-sweet like some places.  It was refreshing and perfect.The couple who run it seem very nice. Try something new...Come for the Omusubi, stay for the Kushi Dango! And order us a party plate to go.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/3/2014,8/1/2014,325,666,11,8,7>Heart and Dag is what I like to call it. Probably my favorite bar in the Grand Lake neighborhood. It doesn't look like anything fancy from the outside, just a nice tattoo inspired sign above the porch. I half expected to be walking into a biker bar by the way the sign looked however I was greeted with a completely different type of biker. A bunch of fixies locked to the rack. Don't worry though, the place isn't too hipster-y.Just a bunch of 20-somethings throwing back cheap beer playing pinball, arcade games, skee-ball and pool while a muted Dr. Strangelove DVD (possibly VHS) ran. How had I never been here?- I thought.  I instantly knew that I never wanted leave. Setting up a cot in the corner and sipping on strong cocktails while discussing Peter Sellers movies till the end of time.The patio is fairly large with plenty of seating. It features a water dispenser so you don't have to bother the bartenders inside. The place can get fairly chilly on some nights so I recommend a jacket or a lot of whiskey. Dogs are welcome here so be aware. Reasonable prices for drinks top to bottom, friendly patrons, and great bartenders. CASH ONLY! (they have an ATM though)My only thing I'm not a fan of is the smoking on the patio, at times at can get a bit out of hand. I don't mind smoking at a bar, but when the I leave smelling like an ashtray, it's a bit much.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,7/31/2014,128,357,6,9,5>A new restaurant in the Livery where Flame Broiler used to be.  It's similar to Spice Kit and Chipotle in that you assemble boxes with mix and match rice and proteins.  Pickled and steamed veggies are included.  The difference I saw is that food is made to order, and not dished up from a steam table.  As a result, the food is hot and yes, the meat does touch the grill!  We like this far better than Spice Kit- The Thai Taco was interesting, with a nice Roti bread, pickled veggies, and a hot and spicy chicken filling. They gave lots of chicken but the sauce was way too sweet for me and overwhelmed everything.  A minor disappointment.  Not sure if they can make this with their grilled meats or back down on the sauce.  If so, this would be excellent.  - Korean BBQ pork with White Rice I got for the wife.  Chicken char grilled and very tasty from the marinade. Rice was puffy and well cooked, and the veggies added good balance.- Thai dark meat chicken and sweet chili rice was my box of choice.  Like the  pork, chicken had that nice smoky flavor that only comes from a grill.  Rice was pretty balanced - not overly sweet nor spicy.  Just good!Will definitely come back.  If grilled meats aren't your thing, they have a number of wok items including pumpkin curry and various tofu items.  They also have some interesting apps on the menu like curry puffs and pot stickers.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2014,7/30/2014,333,495,6,15,9>Good food, the best shakes and decent prices. I have been coming here off and on since high school and it has remained the same through the years. I like the burgers, chicken sandwich, fries and those thick creamy shakes. I had a pineapple one and there were chunks of fruit, so good. Hubs had a chocolate and strawberry mixed and it was a lot better than In N Out's neapolitan. Orders can take a little long when they are busy due to food being made to order. I like taking my brown bag and shake over to the park to enjoy. I noticed my total was a tad more on my bank statement when I used my debit card. I think it was a service fee. I don't remember seeing a notice to customers.
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,7/29/2014,339,571,7,14,9>Finally a hipster coffee shop in my hood! I've been waiting for lattes with cute mugs and designs in the milk forever! I got a heart this time I came and the kicker is, the coffee is actually good. It isn't just good looking. This place just opened up kind of randomly. Nobody was expecting it unless you looked closely at the building where the old hobby and sport shop used to be. It appears they bought out the space next to the hobby shop that used to be a comic store as well. They put the two spaces together to create the coffee shop. You walk in and they have a looking glass with pastries and macaroons. They looked pretty tasty. We ordered at the register and I got a vanilla latte and my girl got an east bay iced that comes with Havana syrup? They have different syrups to sweeten your coffee and my girl got the Cuban inspired syrup. I'm not sure how to describe the taste but I can tell you it was tasty. We also picked up two macaroons, passion fruit and pistachio raspberry. The macaroons were chewy with a little crunch so it was a good consistency cookie. The pistacio raspberry one was good but the passion fruit lacked a taste other than butter. So they are hit or miss but if you get a good one it's pairs nicely with your coffee. My coffee was nice and warm and needed no extra sweetener but it also wasn't sweet to begin with, it was just right. They highlight the taste of your coffee like no other place in the area. My girl's iced coffee was the same, the Havana sweetener was all you needed. No extra milk or sugar. We came on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't busy but there were people inside using the free wifi and typing papers or hanging out. It's a very chill scene and they had some nice music playing that was very relaxing. I would love to come again in the near future. I might go again after work today. Pretty tasty stuff and it's about time we got something like this in our area.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2014,7/28/2014,783,516,15,12,12>I'm on an all carb diet. I really want to lose three pounds. Okay, not really, but if I were Regina George, I'd put down the Kalteen bars and head over to Wonder Food Bakery, where I can buy carbs on carbs on carbs for basically nothing! Just the other day, I bought a pineapple bun, egg tart, and mochi with red bean for a mere $1.75! You can't even buy a mochi with red bean for a $1.75 from some Japanese sweets shops. Wash it all down with some cranberry juice cocktail and you'll be shopping at 1-3-5 in no time. CASH ONLY.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,7/27/2014,279,212,7,10,6>Born and raised in Southern California, I was spoiled with excellent Mexican food. The best Mexican food this side of the border are served in hole-in-the-wall mom and pop shops. There's no denying that statement. If you think going to a place and paying a premium guarantees "better" food, you're wrong. Places like Javier's in Orange County or Tropisueno in San Francisco are good, but you'll spend too much on food that doesn't even come close. I've always said a good meal at a Mexican joint should never cost more than a cheap handle of tequila. Enter Taqueria El Mex-Cal (TEM-C). A true-to-form mom and pop shop offering excellent food at very reasonable prices. There's nothing fancy about this place. Everything from the decor to the atmosphere is lacking. However, they focus all their attention on their product and that's where TEM-C hits the nail square on the head - FOOD!THREE ITEM PLATE ~ 4 stars: I got two tacos al pastor and one enchilada barbacoa. It also came with a generous side of rice and beans. The al pastor was cut into bigger chunks than what I'm used to, so it was meaty. Combine that with excellent flavor, you get a winner. The enchilada was pretty standard. It wasn't bad, it was just average. If I didn't know it was barbacoa, I would have assumed it was just regular beef. I have to say the enchilada sauce they use didn't do the meat any favors. It pretty much masked the taste. However, it was still delicious. The refried beans were packed with flavor. They either cook it with broth or use special seasoning because it was definitely different than the norm. yelp.com/user_local_phot…WET BURRITO AL PASTOR ~ 4 stars: Ok, it was really a wet chimichanga. Don't ask me why but Sandy ordered this. I don't think she understands the concept of a chimichanga. The tortilla is supposed to be crispy so if you drench it with sauce it, well, doesn't stay crispy! So she essentially ordered a wet burrito. However, all the flavors were still there. With the same al pastor I had with my tacos, this thing was a hit. Packed with your typical fillings of rice, beans, onions, cilantro, salsa and meat, this thing was a winner. yelp.com/user_local_phot…HORCHATA (large) ~ 4 stars: TEM-C makes a pretty damn good horchata. It's not grainy but very smooth with the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. Absolutely refreshing and does a great job countering the spiciness of their salsa and pickled peppers (available at the salsa bar). FYI, their large cup is f*cking huge. It's pretty much the size of a carafe. This whole meal went down for around $26.20 w/ tip. I was excited to try this place because it's been on my radar and it didn't disappoint. It's a very casual place to grab a bite and it's always busy during lunch on the weekends. We went for dinner on a Wednesday night and it wasn't that packed.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2014,7/26/2014,233,174,11,22,15>This location has always had tons of potential, but past owners beat the "swanky" tapas bar and elevated Indian cuisine concepts to death, never generating enough buzz to keep the doors open. Perdition Smoke House is the perfect solution. With high quality BBQ, a vast craft beer selection, and laid back atmosphere, they show staying power. The dining room is quite expansive, outfitted with community tables, booths, and a stretch of window seating with stools. The back patio, filled with picnic tables, is definitely a summer time friendly destination to knock back some beers and catch some rays. The decor is minimal and tasteful - look out for the periodic table of meat. The staff I encountered were upbeat and managing their tasks well, despite the hungry, encroaching crowd. My my, what a killer array of comfort foods. Normally, I dislike cafeteria style ordering but it suits the vibe of the place and allowed me to lust after all the glorious organic meat. Brisket, pork shoulder, hot links, pork ribs, turkey breast - all dry rubbed and smoked. I am a die hard combo plate kind of girl but even the sandwiches looked delicious. If you're a true carnivore or dining with a group, you can order your meat of choice by the pound. Don't forget to sample their condiments - house BBQ, spicy, vinegar, and mustard. You can always mop up the leftover sauce with the plain white bread slices.The sides include potato salad, mac & cheese, coleslaw, black eyed peas, and baked beans. I was particularly taken with the potato salad, which complimented my choice of brisket famously. I instantly regret not ordering hush puppies but it gives me good reason to come back. If you want to end on a sweet note, they serve pie and cookies but between the savory fare and delicious beer, my stomach hit capacity long before I even noticed their existence. Last but not least, for those of you who geek out on beer, there are 43 varieties on tap that can be ordered by half pint, pint, or pitcher. Swoon.Happy to have you in the neighborhood, Perdition Smoke House.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/5/2014,7/25/2014,112,275,6,15,6>Nice local place with craft beer and a limited menu, but the quality seems pretty good.So I've been waiting for quite a few months for this place to open up. When I heard the grand opening was going to be on Cinco de Mayo, I immediately called a good friend and made plans. I felt good vibes from the place itself. The modern and classy look worked very well! We walked in and were immediately greeted by the taps and a decent bottle selection, but it took a while for the staff to notice us. After they did, it was all great, though! Anyway, they offer a few craft snacks (pita chips, chicken satay skewers), signature fries with a choice of two dipping sauces, salads (if you're into that), locally sourced artisan sausages, burgers (only two types), and various sandwiches. I love the simplistic menu as it allowed me to focus more on the beer. That's why I really came here, right? Speaking of which, they have quite a few taps and bottles. I saw a few firestone beers, 21st amendment, Green Flash, Ninkasi, and some others on tap. Bottles (from The Bruery, Lost Abbey, Allagash, ect.) were up front. If I wasn't driving, I'd probably get that bigfoot (barleywine style ale) since I don't normally see that on tap but I ended up with a coffee porter that wasn't bad. As for the food, I ordered the avocado bacon cheeseburger ($10, sharp cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, bibb lettuce, caramelized onions, house dressing, grilled bun) and split an order of fries/chipotle aoli with my friend. The fries were pretty good. Thick cut. The chipotle aoli was great as well! They charge for extra sauce tho. The burger was tasty! Right on the money at medium. I also liked how 1) the burger didn't fall apart on me and 2) they chose to go with bibb lettuce over iceberg lettuce. What would've made it better in my opinion would be to add that chipotle aoli. Also, toast the bun a little more as it was a bit soft...but that's me nitpicking. They did a great job.A few more things. Despite having "growler" in the name, they do not sell growlers. Also, I talked to an employee and they do not have beer flights but will have them soon. In short, we loved our experience at The Growler. Only minus a star because I feel like they still need to work out a few kinks (-1/2) and wasn't completely blown away by the food (-1/2) but maybe I can bump them up after they've been open for a while. Just need to see what other beers they tap and if they work things out a bit. We'll see. I'm looking forward to returning and I suggest you stop by and check this place out!
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,7/24/2014,156,215,6,15,9>Diversity, thy name is Lake Merritt - on any given day, I can hear Cantonese, Mandarin, Spanish, Vietnames, French, other European languages, or African languages being spoken, not to mention training my feet over the varied terrain (pavement, dirt, grass, hills, level ground) and seeing many types of birds. In the AM, I observe small and medium sized dogs, Tai Chi, bootie camp, circuit training, jogging stroller parents and in the PM, roller skaters, slack lining, picnics, salsa dancing by the pergola, gigantic unicycles, partner yoga. People of all shapes and sizes, individuals and groups, make the lake part of their daily life.Walking the lake has been my savior since I injured myself in Feb. If the walkway is crowded and not much room for me to move to the left, I like to say "on your left" when passing people - who are amused at times because I am walking and saying this vs running. Note: I appreciate when runners or walkers or bikers tell me when they are passing me no matter what time of day or how crowded it is. At first when I started walking, it was a little like driving, I would wonder why some people forced me to the right or at times on one foot (because they expected me to move since they were running and I was walking but I didn't have room) or other people would give me dirty looks because I passed them, perhaps too closely? Then I realized, that as long as I was aware and avoided physical collision, all is good. The lake is also good for contemplation. Sitting with hot tea on a bench overlooking the lake and watching birds is a rare and valued pleasure. Cheering the 2014 marathon runners at various points around the lake was much fun, particularly with the back drop of live music. Look forward to hearing live music at the ampitheater in warmer days to come.
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,7/23/2014,242,113,8,19,10>Faz has become my go-to place for lunch with friends or colleagues in downtown Oakland. I usually schedule an early lunch to beat the crowd, snag the best booths, and get a head start on their delicious flatbread and specials. Yesterday we ordered the salmon risotto special which was incredibly juicy and moist, and IMO the best dish on the regular menu - chicken kebabs - which were tender and succulent. I usually skip dessert in favor of coffee but the server sold me on the peach cobbler, which he said was made from farm fresh peaches purchased that very morning. Boy was he right! Topped with ice cream - it made for the perfect ending to a delicious meal.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,7/22/2014,297,409,17,24,19>I finally got a No No Burger in my mouth, and all I can say is, my life has completely changed for the better.Many of my Yelp friends had posted glowing reviews of this company's stellar veggie burgers, but I never found myself in the right place at the right time.Finally, much on a whim, I decided to visit Concord, and the farmers market was happening in Todos Santos Plaza. What a happy surprise! I had been dreaming about this momentous occasion for quite some time.I stepped up to the window to order, my eyes glistening like a child on Christmas morning. I couldn't decide between all of the tasty-sounding options, but I decided to stick with the Classic With Cheese, opting for the Daiya vegan cheddar. I also got a side of sweet potato fries, because really, who can resist the seductive call of deep fried vegetables?My name came up and my order handed to me. What a beautiful sight to behold. I swooned a little bit before I took my seat and sank my teeth in. One bite in, and I saw stars and rainbows and fireworks. This is the veggie burger that defeats all others. After years of munching on mealy, mushy messes, I have finally come across a PERFECT creation. The texture and taste mimics real meat without all the grease, fat, or cholesterol. This baby is made from organic and non-GMO soy protein. Even the toppings are super fresh and delicious: lettuce, tomato, grilled and raw onions, pickles, and a creamy sauce that reminded me a lot of In-N-Out's, very thousand island-y. The sweet potato fries were incredible. They weren't overly oily and maintained a slight crispness without being rock-hard or squishy. No No Burger? More like Yes Yes Burger. This is something that everyone needs to try once. Just don't be surprised if you get hooked on them.
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2014,7/21/2014,119,95,6,12,12>A clean, well-lighted place to learn about and buy fine, quality booze. There is no shortage of places to buy alcohol in this area, it's no surprise the City of O was a little hesitant to grant another liquor license on this street, but thankfully they did. Every time I walk into Alchemy it's an education -- either through chatting or dropping in on a tasting. I've learned all about bitters (wonderful in tea) and that I actually like brandy (when it's mixed with coffee, ala Firelit). Most recently, I learned how much a pleasure it is to drink alone at home! Alchemy Bottle Shop is run by 2 very well-informed people that seem to always be talking or cleaning. This is equivalent of what Good Vibrations did for le sex shoppe, its displays reflect the effort the distilleries put into crafting their fine concoctions. Upstairs is an art gallery/tasting room in the works. It can also be rented out for private events with liquor purchased through a caterer (gotta follow the liquor laws).
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,7/20/2014,216,493,7,17,9>My back was as stiff as a 2'x3'x2 inches thick plywood board, yea, I was THAT stiff.  Stiff as a board.  Not only that, my right arm and shoulder was seriously hurting.  For the past 2-weeks, I've been working 10 hour work days.  All that computer work and tight deadlines added more pressure on top of pressure.  I was ready to combust, so, I called in an emergency massage early Saturday morning and was able to book an appointment ASAP!  And I do mean ASAP because right after I hung up, I drove over here in 12 minutes and was the first customer.The place looks like they picked up a section of Thailand and dropped it into Union City because the decorations are beautiful. There were 5-6 traditional Thai massage rooms that are separated by thick curtains.  Each room had a thick mat and pillow with  sturdy looped scarfs hanging on the ceiling for the masseuse to use when pressure stepping on top of you.  To keep the romance of Thailand,  the lights were dimmed and soft music played in the background for added relaxation.  It really felt tranquil and beautiful.My masseuse, Mint, was excellent!  I told her my problem of right shoulder aches and she recommended thai oil massage so she can work on knots.  I went into my room, striped down to my underpants and layed on the mat with a blanket on top.  They start with a warm towel on your feet, which is a good idea because who wants to work with stinky feet?! She worked her way up from feet, legs to back, then head.  But the second she touched my back was when she recommended hot stones to alleviate my board like back.  I said yes to the stones therapy.  The entire massage consisted of hitting the pressure points by using her feet, elbows, hands along with oils, lotions and then hot stones.  Boy!  Were they hot but as long as I felt good, the pain of hotness didn't bother me.   When my session ended, I was no longer a stiff board!  All the aching shoulders had melted away.  I did however, feel sore for several days but once that wore off, I felt totally balanced again.If you love Thai massages, I would highly recommend this place.  It's located in a strip mall, so, there's plenty of free parking.  However, the only alarming thing is, it's next to railroad tracks and towards the end of my session, the roar and rumble of a train passing by scared me!  The website said walk-ins are welcome but I don't see how that can work since the masseuses work the front and back rooms simultaneously.  Its a risk that you would have to take and I'd recommend calling ahead instead of doing a walk-in.  Prices are okay, it starts at $55 and moves up with each additional service provided.  But they do have a stamp card, once it's filled up, you get a freebie!  I like that.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,7/19/2014,751,162,9,17,10>Legit New York style pizza all the way on the West Coast. There's a reason why this place is so highly rated. Their stuff is good!I came here with my mom randomly since she just started using Yelp and found this place through the app. We came in at about 5:30pm on a Thursday. We were promptly greeted by who I believe was one of the owners. We took advantage of the check in offer which was 50% an 18" pizza and got half Philly Cheesesteak and half Butterfly Shrimp. (AMAZING DEAL. ALWAYS USE IT.) We also got an order of garlic knots. The total was about $18.Garlic knots: Worth the hype. Get these things. They are SOOO GOOD. Think garlic croissant rolls but with fluffy pizza crust and packed full of fresh garlic flavor served with marinara. I believe these things are made to order and come out piping hot. I want more.Philly Steak: Basically a cheesesteak on a pizza. Quite literally you can fold the slice and it's like a sandwich or a taco. Great flavor and I would have to say that this was my favorite between the two.Butterfly shrimp: I was surprised at how good this was. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and wasn't dry. Definitely can taste the garlic and olive oil on this. It was also loaded with a bunch of basil. Try this place out! Forreal, I may have found one of my favorite pizza places in the area. Great service, friendly people and best of all, delicious pizza.

As a reliable yelper pointed out, the salsa has heat!  In a good way...the way where you can still taste all the other flavors. The chips are the perfect thickness/salty/crunch ratio.  Street Tacos: chicken, shredded chicken, and carne asada with onions cilantro and salsa.  My favorite are the shredded chicken and they are only $1.50 each!  Another reliable yelper pointed out that they serve street tacos on weekend nights outside between 8-12am!  Can't get anymore "street taco" than that.Pupusas: The Salvadorian Grilled Cheese.  Corn tortilla filled with that white cheese that is used in Mexican restaurants that I cannot find anywhere!!!  Only $2.50.If you are disenchanted with the rest of the Mexican Food options down town then you should really come and give this place a try!

<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/19/2014,7/16/2014,455,221,5,15,10>Still one of my favorite places to eat in Downtown Berkeley. Can't go wrong with beer and pizza! On a warmer afternoon or night, it's nice to sit in the large patio in the back of the restaurant to avoid the noise inside. They also have heated lamps by some of the tables if it gets a bit chilly. Service is great and fast, which is always a plus! Our waiter the other night gave up good suggestions for the pizzas and even offered to let us try out a couple beers before choosing one. We ended up getting the spinach & artichoke dip and beer & cheese fondue appetizers (our eyes were bigger than our stomachs) which were both warm and creamy. The sourdough bread and foccacia were also a good accompaniment. As for the pizza, my favorites would have to be the Xanthia (thinly-sliced potatoes, bacon, garlic, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, crushed red pepper on an olive oil crust) and the Athena (pesto, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, feta, mozzarella) which is also a good vegetarian option. With a honey wheat beer, it's a great way to end the night!

The sandwich served here, that is!I've been looking for a place that serves deli styled sandwiches besides the well known chains. City Bistro had been undetected by my sights for a very long time. Until, I did some research with the trusty Yelp app. My craving for a patty melt was strong, but until I saw a picture of the Rudy Giuliani sandwich, I decided to pass on the patty melt for another day.I called and placed a to go order and the phone was answered in a couple rings.  While ordering the sandwich, I also added an order of the sweet potato fries. I was quoted that the order will be ready within 10 to 15 minutes.I arrived at the restaurant at the quoted time and the restaurant was empty. This was around the 4pm time frame. I was nicely greeted and I announced that I had a to go order. I paid for my order and headed home.The sandwich and fries were packaged in a clear plastic container. Unfortunately, during my drive home my container slid off my passenger car seat. Although my fries and sandwich were re-arranged, the container was still intact. The make up of the Rudy Giuliani sandwich consisted of: corn beef, pastrami, cole slaw, and swiss cheese. All this goodness was all embedded in between two slices of toasted rye bread. The sweet potato fries had a glaze of lightly harden syrup coating each fry.Although, I slightly damaged my entree on my drive home, everything tasted great. The tenderness of the pastrami and corn beef. The cole slaw was just as crunchy as a side dish alone. The bread was nicely toasted and crispy. As for the fries, sweet and tasty!I will for sure will be back! Patty melt, your next on my list!
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,7/14/2014,535,179,10,15,17>Ypérochos (delicious in Greek)! Yes, I completely used Google translate for this intro...Hopefully you have learned something new today, if nothing else. I haven't been big on Greek and Mediterranean food in the past, my first time here - I wasn't a big fan either. However, after coming back again and again, I've fallen for this place. Just writing this review has me craving a gyro and their rice pilaf. The food is so fresh and tasty. The meats are always so juicy and seasoned to perfection and if you are a vegetarian, they have plenty of options for you. It's also great for people who eat low-carb and can resist the temptation of warm pita bread and rice pilaf.This space is quaint and cozy. I love how the restaurant actually opens up to the street. Fresh air breezing through takes your mind off the chaotic hussle-and-bussle of everyday life. A drink in hand doesn't hurt either. They offer a full bar in the center of the restaurant which has a few TVs usually showing a sports game. It definitely beats the food across the street at Stadium Pub, if you are in a mood to watch the game in a classier environment. This is my kind of spot to come and catch up with old friends and not worry about being rushed out. The staff have always been more than pleasant. If you happen to order something you don't like or misunderstood on the menu, they will take it back and replace it with something else or no charge. Management seems to be doing a fine job of running this place. Even the bathroom is pretty. When I come here, I feel like I'm actually being treated like family. Not in an Olive Garden slogan kind of way but genuinely good, personal service.

Quite literally a hole in the wall, I would have driven past this place a couple hundred more times in my lifetime if some of my buddies on here didn't point out how amazing this place could be. (Speaking of hole in the wall, I love how Google maps got me lost, but I then hopped on Yelp to look at my fellow Yelpers directions and found it in no time. So trust us, not Google!!!)Anyways, me and my friend got seated and out came two bowls of this famous lentil soup that everyone's raving about. Being honest, I don't even know what a lentil is, and here's this big hairy guy plopping a bowl of it in front of me and it kind of smells like armpit but I'm a curious cat so I tried it out anyways and it's so delicious. Probably could have ordered the lentil soup by itself for my meal but I decided on their Chicken Pomegranate plate. Oh my god the portion size is ridiculous. Yeah, that plate is wider than my body. That's not all gonna fit inside me right??? Well with as tasty the chicken is, I sure did try and stuff myself full. The chicken was so juicy and tender, not a hint of dryness. Could have eaten it forever if my physiology would have allowed it.Price was very reasonable all things considered. Being honest, I'm not a huge fan of Mediterranean food at all, and I loved Wally's Cafe. You'll definitely see me back here again!
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,7/12/2014,369,122,6,9,8>So much garlic in their pizza I am pretty sure a slice can be considered medicinal! :) If not, at least the vampires and fleas will leave you alone. #garlicpowerI originally tried Villa Roma because of their AMAZING coupon... the best in town, offering deals with pizza, wings, kabobs, pastas, etc. Love a pizza place that serves more than pizza with edible food (unlike Americana, for example). The pies have a ton of cheese, hearty tomato sauce, and loads of toppings. My favorites:- Vegetarian: tons of veggies! Probably 2 servings worth per slice :)- Hawaiian: Ever had hawaiian with garlic? - Margherita: huge basils leaves, nice size tomato chunksThe chicken salads are huge, lots of chicken and cheese... enough to feed me for 3 nights. Kabobs are amazing too... I just don't order them often enough to write a very detailed review as of now.
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,7/11/2014,732,444,11,18,15>When a place surprises the pants off you (almost literally) with it's food and charm, you go back. And you bring reinforcements. Once again we were astounded by 1. the freshness of the ingredients, 2. the stunning preparation and execution of the dishes, and 3. the kind care and attention of the staff. There are three courses - each with multiple options - and among the four of us, we wanted to try everything. And we very nearly did. We started our meal with appetizers of beef tartare served with quail egg & mustard greens on grilled toast, as well as spinach & artichoke dip on sourdough bread. The beef tartare was perfect, and I've never had artichoke dip that fresh or flavorful - not anywhere, not ever. For our main course(s), we tried the vegetarian dish of wild rice, squash, and mushrooms with a pecan date relish, seared trout with farro, carrots, and fava leaves, the prime rib with roasted onions, garlic, & butterball potatoes, and a side of grits with biscuits. Be still my beating heart. The dishes were so cleanly prepared you could taste - and savor - every single ingredient. Every dish on the menu was stunning. I cannot remember the last time I had prime rib that divine. It was juicy, perfectly salted, and melted on our palates (and I am not someone who typically waxes poetic about beef). The wild rice dish was a flavorful combination of nutty, sweet and savory; and the seared trout was delicious, crispy on the outside, tender and flaky on the inside. Everyone "ooohed and ahhhed" over each dish in sheer delight.Because too much of a good thing is never enough, we followed it up with dessert: a decadent chocolate & salted caramel tart. I could taste the cocoa powder in the chocolate. The salted caramel made me swoon. And all of it was layered over a chocolate cookie crust. Please bury me with that pie when I die.
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2014,7/10/2014,188,238,11,18,15>Uh-oh. Looks like I've found a new hobby. It involves aromatic wines, a beautiful vineyard, and only $10. Is this an AA intervention in the making? Perhaps. All joking aside, I just discovered a newly emerging wine scene...and it's in my own backyard! Did y'all know Livermore is the new Napa? I didn't. Now I can swirl, sniff, and sip all the wine I want, without having to make the trek up to Napa Valley, or fork over $25-$40 for a tasting. Can you see why I'm ecstatic?I visited Concannon with a friend on a Saturday afternoon. A typical tasting consists of one flight with five different wines. However, we were given an extra wine so that was six wines for $10! What a deal! I'm no wine connoisseur, and I might sound like a typical girl (not trying to reinforce stereotypes), but I prefer white wines to reds. We started off with a fruity white wine, Viognier, which I loved. Unfortunately, that was the first and last of our white wines. The next five tastings were all red wines. At least now I know that Zinfandel is a no-no for me, but I'm a fan of Syrah (not to be confused with Petite Sirah). It's pretty obvious that all of this is quite overwhelming for a noobie like me. However, the employees were helpful and friendly, detailing the various histories of each wine. I did feel that we didn't receive as much attention as the other more senior tasters. Probably because we are younger and as you can tell, we don't know much about wine so the employees most likely didn't want to spend too much time on us.Now let's talk about the vineyard. It is gorgeous with a huge gate welcoming you. Vast patches of grape-bearing vines stretch across the land. You can even see plantations dotting the nearby hills. There is a large open grass area that is perfect for a picnic and wine on warm days. You can also reserve tables on their outdoor patio and munch on small bites from their restaurant. Concannon is a wonderful spot to enjoy some classy wine and lovely scenery!
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2014,7/9/2014,164,123,7,11,9>This was my first "legit" bar experience and I love the vibe I got from it. I went on a pretty slow night, but it seems like a pretty intimate bar venue to grab a couple drinks with friends and sit and chat. I'm all for casual, social drinking and this place has the right atmosphere for it.They have a lot of ample seating and a wide selection of craft beers in the fridges at the back. I didn't get to try anything on tap or draft (I'm not the beer connoisseur). But, they do charge you more for the bottle to drink inside rather than taking the bottle to go.Overall, this place has that small, very crafty and hipster vibe which any beer lover would love hanging in. The atmosphere and vibe in the room is a bit grungy with the right amount of space for yourself or for sharing with others. Cool place (if I loved beer more)! And the prices seem to match the beer's rarity, around $10+. I'd come back with some beer-lovers anytime!
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,7/8/2014,2243,356,11,20,20>Two pints and four waffle cones "to go" makes for a happy family!!!  I was the hero tonight for bringing this treat home.  My son is severely allergic to peanuts, so watching it being made and knowing there was no hidden ingredients was a big deal for us.  He rarely eats ice cream for fear of cross contamination--so thank you for being so allergen friendly!  This is a welcome addition to Lafayette and we will be back to try the other flavors very soon!  Salted Caramel, Chocolate and Vanilla--all delicious, all CHECK.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/11/2014,7/7/2014,216,172,5,12,10>Ain't no mountain (of food) high enough! Ain't no river (of Thai tea) wide enough! That's how my ode to the Heavenly food cart would begin. Ramona's, Fifo, and Café Zeb can't compare to the prices, taste, and service that this food cart offers. The lady who serves the food (Anna) is notorious for callin' just about everybody "honey" with her adorable accent. She also loves to joke around and will always serve you a complimentary cup of soup or congee! Sprinkled with crunchy garlic bits too.The bánh mì sandwiches come in 6 varieties (BBQ grilled pork, lemongrass chicken or tofu, among others) and are fairly decent. However, I've long since moved onto Heavenly's rice plates which are stuffed so full with salad, rice, and the main entrée that I've never been able to get the box to close. The entrées are a hodge-podge of different Asian cuisines: kung pao shrimp, teriyaki chicken, fried fish filets, curry beef, and Mongolian tri-tip to name a few. You can also ask for the entrée to be served over a bed of orange coconut rice.Not hungry for a meal but still looking for a snack or drink? Never fear. There's cups of Thai tea or iced coffee in the fridge, and you can have your pick of Vietnamese egg rolls, spam musubi, or even banana tapioca pudding. If you're on the east side of campus and in need of food, definitely stop by this well-named slice of heaven.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2014,7/6/2014,188,138,11,13,4>Wow what an awesome experience! I took my boyfriend here for a couples massage on his birthday and it was completely amazing. The process started with a questionnaire and a quick consultation with our therapists to find our preferred focus areas. My therapist was Leticia (Tisha), and right off the bat I could tell her hands were magic. I had an hour-long heavy-handed Swedish that I never wanted to end. She's got this unbelievable, gradual, understated technique where she starts off with pressure so light that I don't even realize her hands are on me until I'm grunting in complete satisfaction and relaxation. The girl is talented. I can't speak on the bf's deep tissue massage with Madeleine, but let's just say both of us thought there was no way the other could have possibly had a better massage.The front desk staff was extremely friendly as well. I thought I had seen a Yelp review that mentioned 10% off a massage on the week of your birthday, and although I was mistaken I was told that I could check in on Yelp and get my 10% off that way. I really appreciated that; the ladies could have easily skipped that detail but chose to be accommodating instead.My only gripe is that my boyfriend started snoring during the session, and it killed my vibe a bit. Next time I think I'll ditch him and get a solo sesh going. My own birthday isn't for another 6 months but I already know I'll be here, getting rubbed down for 2 hours. And I honestly can't wait.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,7/5/2014,32,230,9,10,7>I can't think of any reason not to give Box and Bells five stars.  This is coming from someone who doesn't eat a ton of meat and usually shies away from anything with visible animal fat on it, including bacon.  I went with 3 others and had a fantastic evening and enjoyed every fatty meaty bite that I had.  The dishes here are all very rich in flavor, but surprisingly not overly salty or greasy.  I mean, don't get me wrong, everything has lard in it, but it didn't feel gross and greasy.  My favorites of the evening were the beef tongue pastrami toast and the country pork rillettes.  The burger with the pretzel bun was absolutely perfect as well.Their non-meat items were also fantastic, especially the deviled eggs and the grilled asparagus with a softegg and mint.  The deviled eggs are definitely pricey at $5 for 2 halves, but well worth the splurge.  They packed quite a kick and were maybe even better than the ones Wayfare Tavern used to serve (2010 -  2014 R.I.P.).The drinks are expertly-made and pretty to look at, but a little on the small side.  I had the Chief Lapu Lapu, which tasted like a really good, less sweet Mai Tai.  For alcohol, I think the shot and beer combo for $8 is the way to go.  Not sure if the items change, but when I went it was a healthy shot of Four Roses bourbon and an 8 oz pour of Linden St. Common Lager.I definitely recommend going with a group so you can try more things.  Every dish is rich so it goes a long way even if it looks small.  I don't recommend going with a vegetarian or vegan friend.  Vegetarians (not sure about vegans) will be able to find something to eat, but it just won't be worth the money.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/6/2014,7/4/2014,356,481,6,11,8>Cannot believe I haven't reviewed the Miz! Missouri Lounge is one of my favorite watering holes. I mean, I have a little nickname for it and everything (see above). I passed by many times and never ventured in, and when I finally did I kicked myself for not coming sooner. Yes, it's a dive, but they've got cheap drinks, food, and an awesome back patio. My personal favorite is the tequila special, which is a shot of tequila and can o'tecate for $6. You can also do the same with whiskey and a PBR for $5. The food is typical bar fare, perfect for when you're drinking. Burgers, hot dogs, nachos, etc. I haven't had a burger here yet, but I've heard they're actually very tasty. Hot dogs are not the cheap oscar meyer links, but Top Dog style franks. They have a large, heated patio, which is perfect for summer nights or if your friends are smokers. There is also a pool table inside with comfy couches, and an area to serve as a dance floor on weekends. They do take credit cards, with a $10 minimum. Service has ranged from great to eh, but I've never encountered bad or rude service here. The bathroom is terrifying, but, it's a dive, what do you expect? They kind of have a parking lot, but street parking is also very easy to find.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2014,7/3/2014,115,414,7,10,5>WOWZA. That was one strong massage. This is no cucumber water & fuzzy robe operation-- these people mean BUSINESS. But it's cheap, clean & the therapists will definitely work out those kinks for you! not for the modest- keep your undies on if you don't want your naughty bits exposed multiple times. a bit hard to communicate with the therapists (at least the 2 we had), but on the plus side you don't get chatted at when you are trying to reeeeeelaaaaax. they have some monthly membership deal- might check that outin addition to the private massages, they have the "foot massage"-- a bunch of reclined chairs in a big room.  focus on your feet, but also includes shoulder, scalp, etc- anywhere they can get to while you are clothed & in a chair.it is a little weird knowing this used to be a party store.

<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2014,7/2/2014,121,1332,,14,5>I will warn you to go here early. We thought we were early but there were already so many people by the time we arrived at 9:30 AM on a Sunday. I suppose everybody is trying to get cherries before they run out of them due to the drought. When we left about half and hour later, the parking lot was completely full and they had run out of buckets to give people. We had never been to this particular farm before for cherry picking and I was a bit worried. Our usual place has never let us down and the one time we went somewhere else, the cherries were disappointing. At first, I thought we were going to be disappointed again as we went by tree after tree absolutely stripped bare (by hordes of people I presume). However, many rows back and over the trees had plenty of cherries. The cherries were a bit less sweet and ripe than in previous years (we were there a week earlier than usual), but they were still very good quality. We picked about 10 pounds. Because of the drought and lack of cherries, prices are $3.50 a pound this year. Still worth every penny especially when I think about how these wonderful trees are supporting these farmers.
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,7/1/2014,146,319,,13,8>Welcome to the neighborhood! Walked by tonight and saw they were doing an undercover soft opening. Had to go in. I think they're going to do well.The old Punchdown space (R.I.P.) has been renovated just enough to create a new theme. It's still a nice narrow but open space, with a huge bar. But now it's a restaurant. And the opening night food selections were great.Cast-iron mussels were the real standout. Haven't seen this dish around the Bay Area in years (used to make it at home sometimes), but here they turn it into a signature, with the smoke and sear, sweet butter, and salt blending into a great appetizer. Braised lamb tacos, sold as a snack, are just awesome. A grilled asparagus salad was cooked and dressed perfectly. Pasta with bacon, cheese, and greens was good, but suffered from niblets and perhaps not enough of the bacon and cheese.The liquor selection was limited due to licenses still in the process, but the wine selection was decent and moderately priced. Opening night service was great, considering that they hadn't done any of this before. I appreciated the earnestness and genuineness of the staff--I think they really want to make something nice here in the neighborhood.Good luck, and I look forward to a return visit.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2014,6/30/2014,406,300,19,16,13>How come no one told me how cool Ippuku is? When I asked my sister how it was she kinda shrugged and said, "Yeah it's cool." No, no no! What she should've done is grab me by the shoulders, shake me a couple of times and scream, "Wendy, you have not had Japanese food in Berkeley until you go to Ippuku! Go and make a reservation right now. I will not release you from my iron grip until you promise to eat there."Then I would've discovered sooner that not only is Ippuku a restaurant with good food and good sake, it is a complete dining experience. When you step in you feel like you've stepped into an alleyway in Japan. While I am not Japanese, everything certainly felt authentic, from the menu I couldn't read to the citrus-y pepper spice in the bamboo jar on the table. Whether it was truly authentic or not, I walked away feeling like I had a very unique and special experience. The sweet egg, grilled chicken shoulder blade, and corn fritters were our favorites. The mochi wrapped in nori had good sauce but was a little sticky and hard to manage. The crab croquettes were good and creamy, but not really worth the $9 for two little croquettes. The sake we had was good and slightly sweet. It was by far the most expensive thing we had. Each of our dishes was $5-9 but the sake was $28. I guess we were expected to drink a lot of sake and try multiple kinds. When we kept asking the server for recommendations she would say something like, "Well, here is a good, light sake to start with." We tried to communicate we would only order one sake for the night. She finally understood and said, "Okay, I'll order the larger size for you." Ha! We definitely ended the night with bright red, happy faces.CORRECTION: I talked to my sister about this review after posting it and it turns out, she did practically shake me by the shoulders and tell me I had to eat at Ippuku. Whoops. I should have listened to her back then. I guess I was playing the role of a dense big sister quite well. Oh well. Moral of the story: Eat at Ippuku!
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/6/2014,6/29/2014,185,670,6,12,9>Beautiful new venue that's part of the Linden Street Brewery complex. While the place can be described as "New American," many of the dishes are internationally inspired, as the Dock name is an homage to the long history of international trade that has taken place at the adjacent Port of Oakland. In fact, the lights at the bar flicker intentionally, so as to create a maritime ambience. Indeed, the menu is quite diverse, and no item is priced more than $15 at the moment.  Offerings range from jerk chicken wings to falafel waffles to curry chicken thighs. The beer and cocktail menus are also extensive. And the staff and crowd is lively, personable, and unpretentious - all what you'd expect from being in a community-oriented place like Oakland. Chalk up another win for the West Oakland / Port / Jack London Square area.
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,6/28/2014,253,127,7,11,7>Japanese soul food..?! It really is as good as it sounds. This spot just opened as a pop-up inside the delicious local lunch locale Garden House. We stopped by for their opening night and they have a pretty great initial offering! You can pick fried chicken in solo, slider, or rice bowl form, and with one of four flavors (sansho-seasalt, ginger agave teriyaki, Japanese honey BBQ, or orange aioli), or for the non-meat-eaters, there are a few vegan options as well. On top of that, they have a bunch of side salads and yaki onigiri. After like ten minutes of deliberation, I went with the rice bowl + orange aioli fried chicken. Gabe B. went the BBQ tofu route plus onigiri. Both were amazing! I devoured my chicken -- the aioli is super flavorful but not too greasy, the chicken is boneless & skinless and then fried, and ends up super juicy and tender with a crunchy exterior (okay not FuseBox crunchy, but still excellent). I would've thought the tofu would be more crunchy too, but it wasn't. We also got to try one of our friend's vegan drumsticks -- pretty interesting! It had more of a smoky flavor to it and was surprisingly delicious (I don't know why I'm always surprised by vegan food, it's proved to be more delicious than not like 90% of the time...).Anyway, can't wait to try more of their menu items and flavors! You should def make this part of your weeknight-out routine!
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,6/27/2014,196,110,2,17,5>COLLEGE BUCKET LIST: Try everything on the menu before I graduate. Thank you for finally bringing good milk tea to Southside. Yes, it is pretty pricey, but you're getting your money worth with fresh tea instead of powder or watered down milk tea. The quality is fresh and the boba is cooked perfectly with just the right amount of chewy/sweetness. Bring a friend, it's kind of lonely standing in the sometimes-ridiculous long line by yourself. They don't call it Sharetea for no reasons :) (+) Matcha Green Tea Creama!  I was very hesitant on getting this one because it's really easy to go wrong with powdered matcha green tea. However, it was perfect! It wasn't bitter at all or overly sweet (80% sweet). I don't get recommend getting the aloe vera topping with this because ....meh. I think the pudding or the boba would be a better fit. (+) Peach Green Tea Creama. The drink is definitely way too sweet at 100% so I recommend getting 80% or 50% sugar depending on how you like your tea. When you get your drink, use the small plastic knife provided to cut two slits on the top and drink it like how they show you instead of using your straw. This way, you can get a balance of both the cream at the top and the tea at the bottom. If you use your straw, you're only getting the tea and leaving the top untouched so it's a little bit bitter. I also prefer the aloe vera with the creama because it adds to the refreshing taste. (+) Mango Green Tea! I expected a watered down mango green tea drink but the mango flavor was surprisingly strong refreshing. I have to say I like the Mango GT BETTER than the Mango Creama. (+/) Strawberry Black Team Creama. Not sure if I love it or hate it but maybe I'm not a strawberry tea kind of person. Personally paid the consequences by forgetting to ask for 80% sugar because it was way too sweet ! At least now I know what the 100% sweet tastes like.(/) Fresh Taro Hot Milk Tea. They weren't kidding when they said fresh taro! I was literally sipping up taro chunks. Overall, the drink was meh. Wasn't amazing and wasn't boring. If you love taro then I think you should try it, especially on a cold day! (-) Regular green milk tea (Jasmine). Nothing too exciting about this drink. The jasmine green milk tea is my first go-to drink at any new store because it's a pretty good baseline. However, I wasn't entirely impressed with it at Sharetea (maybe because I'm also picky). I couldn't really taste the tea in this and it tasted more like watered down milk instead. (/) Happy Family Green Milk Tea. You will definitely get your money worth with this drink because there's literally just so many toppings in it! (without you paying extra for toppings like the other drinks). There's boba, pudding, herb jelly, red beans (?), etc. It might be a turnoff if you prefer your tea over toppings. I personally though it was just too much for me because I was just overwhelmed every time trying to figure out what I was drinking but it was worth a try. (/) Okinawa Milk Tea.  This is one of the drinks where you can't customize your sugar level or else it will taste really bitter. I also wasn't entirely impressed with this drink (only because I prefer light tea flavors instead of heavy ones so it varies from person to person). It's a pretty heavy drink in terms of flavors. Overall, I feel like the milk tea is pretty average but their tea creama is pretty amazing. The hype will die down but I can see this place staying in Berkeley for a long time because of its quality over the other boba places on Southside.

They provide you with optional suits to wear over your clothes, which I recommend so you don't get your clothes dirty or smell of fumes.  They have you watch a 5 min video of the rules and cautionary flags to make sure everyone is safe and has a good time.  You are also given a new helmet sock and they provide helmets and neck braces. It is a big track and the cars go pretty fast (especially if  you tell them its your birthday - they make sure you get a faster car).  They have several people on the track to insure everyone is safe, especially if you race too hard and get slammed into the tire wall where your kart ends up on two tires and you feel as if you might fly out... that was me!  I hit pretty hard and the guys rushed over to make sure I was ok.  I was and continued racing! All in all we had plenty of track time. Everyone LOVED it and said it was so much fun!  We talked and talked about it through dinner and the after party!  Best birthday ever and so glad our group had fun here!

I deserve some epic embarrassment.For years, it's been a struggle for me to pick my favorite Oakland restaurant. I had many I liked, but had difficulty with the best. I understand this is a first world problem, and a nice one at that. I might be done struggling because Cana might top that list. It's so rare for me to enter a restaurant, see a deceptively small menu, and struggle to pick a dish because they all look good. It's more rare to have the opportunity to order and try all. But I did. And I still don't know my favorite dish. Was it the sweet, crispy plantains? Was it the filling, crispy empanadas? Was it the paella? Shoot, did I forget mojitos? See my trouble? I can't decide because I liked all of it. I strongly encourage going in a group and ordering family style. Unless you're good with choices...which I'm not!
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2014,6/23/2014,158,177,6,14,12>Hidden among the rustling old growth trees and quiet homes of Kensington, there is a garden.  This garden hearkens back to the 1960s, when it served as the private residence and land of the President of the University of California.  After 2009, the Blake House was abandoned and the gardens became a teaching ground for the College of Environmental Design at UC Berkeley.  It is now open to the public between the hours of 8:00am and 4:30pm Monday through Friday, and is closed on the weekends and university holidays.As I strolled along the grassy path, I was immediately reminded of my childhood desire to frolic all day in a secret garden.  Admittedly, I got a little giddy and my heart started beating juuust a little faster when I realized this was probably the closest thing to a secret European garden that I've ever been to!  I began my self-tour of the gardens on the sharply sloped side of the Blake House.  Here, the sun was ablaze with a fiery white glow off of the water facing the San Francisco Bay.  My eyes scrunched up into little slits as I shaded my brow with my hand, gazing out to see the barely visible outline of the magnificent Golden Gate Bridge.  Warm, heat-loving plants soaked up the rays with unwavering zeal, while a few leafy bushes below a rocky outcrop provided shade for two foraging warblers. After watching the warblers and snapping some shots of the gorgeous red bark of a Manzanita tree, I wandered over to the more gently sloped, shadier side of the Blake House.  Right outside the front door of the Blake House, there is an Italian-style grotto with bowed staircases leading down to a long, rectangular, mirror-like pool.  Tiny ripples, disguised by the sun-dappled reflections of the gnarled old oaks above, gave away the presence of brightly colored koi.  It was fun watching them lazily swim through the still waters.  Once the koi had dispersed, I peered into the mirror pool and caught a glimpse of my own reflection.  It was like looking into a pensieve!  From this grotto, I found multiple other pathways that wove through other parts of the garden with new plants and meditation pools.  Around 4:25pm, I realized my bucolic dream was about to end, as the gardens were about to close.  I know it's an overused term, but Blake Garden is a true gem.  It's gorgeous, it's not so popular (right now), and it's free.  Come when you can, respect the space, and respect the quiet of the folks around you.  It's totally worth it :)
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/29/2014,6/22/2014,628,530,10,13,9>Authentic Dim Sum with a sprinkle of hipsters who will brave the stoic staff and enter the battle to get Sui Mai (so popular it disappears right away).  They staff are quite tolerant, so noted by the fact that despite looking Chinese, my cousin and I do not speak a single word.  The amount of times we responded in English to Chinese without too many eye rolls was quite impressive.My absolute favorite are their black bean clams.  My cousin thought I was crazy because I kept dipping all of my dim sum in the amazing sauce.  Overall, I find most of their items to be quite good.  I'm not a fan of their egg custard buns though.  I love Dim Sum on carts.  Way more fun.  Best with a large group or a big appetite!
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2014,6/21/2014,200,260,14,23,19>"We gotta get Geta!" I don't know how long I've been wanting to say that, but now that I've finally tried Geta, I can say with certainty that I'll be saying that phrase many, many more times.Literally the epitome of "hole in the wall," Geta houses at most five cramped tables and four small bar seats. Menus are set in each place, but the majority of fare can be found tacked to a board right next to the cash register. More dishes are handwritten on sticky notes and stuck in odd places around each table and bar seat, which oddly gives the place a genuine, naive sort of feel. The stream of to-go orders is endless once the place opens, which is understandable considering waiting for a table can be lengthy and frustrating.Service is friendly if frazzled and somewhat slow, and they try to serve as much of the order together as possible.The food is good, affordable, and unpretentious, but it wouldn't be the ideal spot for an upscale date. Uni nigiri:(yelp.com/biz_photos/geta…)Hamachi nigiri:(yelp.com/biz_photos/geta…)The uni here is one of the most affordable I've had yet, and it was super fresh. I also like that there wasn't too much rice on the bottom; just the right amount, in fact. The hamachi was fresh, but the fish on top was maybe a little thinner than I would've ideally liked. I've found that most of the nigiri here is super reasonably priced, and I'm a huge fan of that.Spicy tuna roll:(yelp.com/biz_photos/geta…)This was probably the best spicy tuna roll I've ever had. The tuna was flavorful, but it wasn't minced or chopped up like the kind other places tend to serve. It lent a good satisfying texture to the roll. I also like the fact that there are options for spicy tuna and avocado, spicy tuna and cucumber, even spicy tuna and wakame. Lobster roll:(yelp.com/biz_photos/geta…)This might have been my least favorite roll of the night, as I couldn't really taste the lobster in here. It was more of a lobster salad, and there was a kick to it that made me believe it had been mixed with wasabi. It wasn't necessarily bad, just not my favorite out of the dishes we ordered.Dragon roll:(yelp.com/biz_photos/geta…)The Dragon roll here didn't have the shrimp tempura in the middle like most other conventional Dragon rolls, but it was still pretty tasty. The unagi, avocado, and shrimp (also somewhat unconventional) on top were really fresh and had good flavor. The slight sweetness from the unagi sauce was palatable, especially because it wasn't slathered on and didn't oversaturate the other flavors.Spider roll (pictured in the middle):(yelp.com/biz_photos/geta…)The soft shell crab tempura was very well done here. It wasn't too battered or overfried, and the innards were quite juicy, just the way I like 'em. I wasn't thrilled with the way the pieces were slightly different sizes and stuck in the middle of the platter like it had been a second thought, but it wasn't too big of a deal considering the flavor was really good. I'll definitely be back, especially for the nigiri. Gotta get more Geta!
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/15/2013,6/20/2014,206,442,7,17,10>Posada...I like you a lotta.I dined here last night thanks to my friend Lamya's birthday.  Five girls, full of opinions and sass, and we all fell in love with this little gem.  Do NOT judge a book by its cover.  It's in a strip mall, next to a tattoo parlor, and to be honest I figured it was another taqueria.  Not even close.  This family has transformed the inside into a warm and cozy spot.We ordered many dishes and loved each one.  We started off with the Three Queso Fundido with Mango Berry Chutney ($7) and the Goat Cheese Truffles Three Ways with Grilled Kale and Sweet Peppers Confetti ($7).  For our entrees we ordered the Cajun Salmon and Crab Meat Salpicon ($17), New Mexico Enchilada with Smoked Vegetables ($12), Tostadas Two Ways ($8), BBQ Duck with Blue Corn Cakes and Red Cabbage Slaw ($9), and sides of the Grilled Corn ($3) and Open Fire Vegetables ($3).  And since it was my friend's birthday, they brought out their utterly scrumptious Dessert Nachos.The wine list was interesting in that the wine is grouped by winery, not varietal.  Fun for Livermorons but could be confusing for out-of-towners.  Also, I felt the price point was a bit too high.The owners are very involved and outgoing and you leave feeling like you just had dinner at a friendly neighbor's house, not a restaurant.  If they keep up the good work, they will be a success.  I implore you to visit Posada!
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/9/2014,6/19/2014,126,1452,18,21,20>Now that I'm a mom to a girl I've caught the girly bug.  Bows and ribbons and tutu's galore is what I say.Before my daughter was born I bought some really cute clip in bows for hair but alas my baby is bald.  They do have headbands but I'm not into those.  All of their hair accessories are really unique.I also found a cute little crown for future photo shoots.  Not to mention the really cute outfits they have.  Their stock is always changing and up to date with seasons.I'm not to sure about their event space but it looks fun.  I try to stop by when I'm in the area to see what she has for my little girl.Their current spring stuff is too cute!
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,6/18/2014,76,363,6,10,8>Quiznos closes and Capriotti's opens. I say that's a fair trade. Located conveniently in Todos Santos plaza Capriotti's is nothing short of amazing. The place had quite a few people in it which is always a good sign. Menu's on the wall as you wait in line, and my mouth dropped when I saw they make a 20 inch sandwich. The menu is a little short. A few signature sandwiches, plus a build your own sandwich and a variety of salads.We got up to the counter and the guy behind the register was really cool. They have a open kitchen so you can watch as they piece together your sandwich creation. Very clean dining room and kitchen. Everything on the inside was perfect. Now the real test, the food. Not only was my sandwich huge, ( I even recieved comments just seconds after leaving the place), but it looks amazing, and tasted even better. My god I can't remember the last time I had a sandwich this good. The pastrami was sliced thin, seasoned perfectly, and just melt in your mouth good. Add the Swiss cheese and the Russian dressing, and it's practically orgasmic. But what really impressed me was the coleslaw. I love coleslaw, and the coleslaw on my sandwich was awesome. Not too much mayo, not to much cabbage, just the right amount of everything. I was close to making a bet with Terri stating that I would save half for lunch tomorrow, and I would have lost that bet in about ten minutes, because I could not put the sandwich down. I'm already dreaming of my next visit.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2014,6/17/2014,151,178,22,33,26>I'll let you in on a secret: it is actually possible (easier, sadly, than one may imagine) to get a crappy bagel in NYC. A good bagel -- crusty on the outside; chewy, fairly dense and moist on the inside -- takes care, time, some boiling, and artisan attention to detail. There's a lot of expectation built by a store named "Authentic Bagel Company." However, the Brothers Scott do more than justice to the idealized symbol of what a good bagel should be. And, incorporate some West-coast sensibilities with their sour dough starter and kiss of honey during boiling. The result is a stand-alone, unique in its hybrid pedigree, yet dutiful to the ideals of an authentic NY bagel. Coaxed initially by a co-Yelper's musings of ABC's bacon egg & cheese bagel sandwich, this first sampling was enough to win my heart and stomach.  Classic American cheese oozing over thick, smokey bacon and the quick-fried egg; each bite wooing more godlike goo from the toasted onion bagel:yelp.com/biz_photos/auth…     yelp.com/biz_photos/auth…Second favorite is the classic poppy seed bagel (CLUSTERED with lots of poppy seeds, as it should be -- I can't believe an early reviewer complained about their abundance), toasted, with an ample schmear of plain cream cheese. Augmenting the tummy-hugging comfort of the bagels is the friendliness of Jason & Mark Scott, and equally cool R.J.  Fun in a genuine way, they believe in the community of Oakland and work and collaborate with other local enterprises. Their small shop is expanding soon to the space next door. That's a good start, lads ... but just keep your Oakland roots intact once that inevitable global domination's been achieved.Six stars if I could.  I like ABC so much, they're my inspiration for a new "Gluten Indulgence" list. If you're curious, or peckish, or looking for a carb-load, may I suggest a visit to Authentic Bagel Company. They're a holely delicious experience.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,6/16/2014,159,118,21,27,21>Your hipster is showing. That's what some of you might have been hoping to be greeted with at the door, right? Or maybe you're of the other mindset and have decided you don't like Philz. Maybe you're tapping your foot impatiently while waiting awkwardly next to the pastry cabinet reading this review and wondering how your friends have managed to convince you to come all the way up Shattuck when there are perfectly good cafes closer to Berkeley proper.Then the barista calls you, not by name but by the awesome shirt you were wearing, because they notice things like that. And asks you to make sure you love your drink before you pay. And is still somehow smiling through the never-ending stream of customers. Then you realize that the seemingly full wall socket is actually connected to a power strip, opening five new outlets just for you (and your neighbor, of course). Then you realize how close Cheeseboard is and in that moment, experience an epiphany - Gourmet Ghetto * (pizza + coffee) = college dining at its finest. It doesn't matter if you're no longer a student, who can say no to that combination?I guess this place isn't so bad after the initial culture shock, eh? :)Philz is the epitome of eclectic. From their diverse drink menu, worldly music (I had SoundHound/Shazam on nearly every other song), hodgepodge of seating, bathroom decorations, and most of all, customers, the Philz atmosphere is suited for pretty much anyone. Which sucks when you're trying to find a seat on the weekends, but patience, young Padawan. Meanwhile, if you're feeling overwhelmed by the drink menu, here's a few starters:- Arabian Treat Tea: sweet and fragrant, perfect with a little honey drizzle. It's dark but not bitter and warms from the inside out.- Mocha Tesora: the lightest, most fulfilling mocha I've ever had. It avoids being too chocolaty and sweet by retaining more of its coffee notes. Heck, I want me one right now. - Philz blend iced coffee: not sure what it's actually called, but this roast has a mixture of several of their famous blends and doesn't have too much coffee flavor if you're trying to enjoy a less bitey drink. They've got two unisex stalls past the Amazon pick-up wall, but I think they're prone to running out of paper towels. I suppose all that liquid has to go somewhere... But anyways, they have endless supplies of thick, high-quality Philz napkins scattered throughout the store so don't be shy and use them!
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2014,6/15/2014,12,50,13,16,10>The first time my boyfriend and I walked into Le Petit Cochon, we were greeted with wide smiles and an enthusiastic, "WELCOME to Le Petit Cochon!"  The gentleman behind the counter politely inquired if it was our first time coming in.  We conceded that it was.  "Well, then," he chortled, waving his hand genially, "May I recommend our rotisserie chicken.  It is the best."  He was chuckling lightly, so we joined in with agreeable laughter.  Upon hearing our merriment, his face got suddenly somber, and his voice became very grave.  "No, seriously, though.  It. Is. The. Best." My boyfriend and I abruptly stopped laughing and exchanged glances.  Whoa.  This guy.  He takes chicken seriously.  OK, Buddy, we get it.  But we did end up taking his advice, and what can I say? The man knows his chicken.   We got it to take-away, and thank goodness-- because we were making all sorts of awkward noises as we tasted how delectable, tender, and perfectly seasoned each bite of chicken was.  Not a single bland piece.  And my boyfriend, who goes crazy for crispy chicken skin, was over the moon.  It may not be the cheapest rotisserie'd bird in town, but by golly, it is--in the words of our chicken guru--the best. We've since been back many a time for, yep, more chicken.  We've also had the vegetarian tart, some of the sandwiches, and salads.  The tart is worth a try, but the sandwiches and salads are a little expensive for what you get.  They also have a refrigerated section with pre-made food items for a quick get-away.  And, they have a small selection of imported French grocery items.  Cookies, crackers, sardines, condiments---and if you need a $69.99 can of black truffles, Le Petit Cochon has got you covered.It's an interesting mix of a deli, a store, and a small-service restaurant.  Mostly, though, this is our go-to take-away spot for rotisserie chicken.  Le Petit Cochon?  More like Le Grand Poulet.  Miam miam!
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,6/14/2014,174,447,9,26,13>I walk my pug Sweet Pea past this location almost daily. Disclaimer - I adore shellfish beyond what is normal.  I could live life without another delicious rib eye steak, but the thought of never again enjoying a sea creature with a shell brings a tear to my eye.   Since I found out that crab would be a signature dish, I have been anxiously waiting and anticipating the opening of this new restaurant in Uptown. My expectations were high and alaMar does not disappoint.  You can feel the love that went into this restaurant that serves New American cuisine.  The service is attentive and top notch.  It was noticeable, authentic and improves the dining experience. Some places leave your feeling like customers are an annoyance.  It takes me to a happy place when I feel like my business is truly valued and appreciated.I love the design; the space is  very comfortable with a modern feel and nautical splashes. Every dish is appropriate to eat with your hands, so the communal sink is a unique and special touch. The dog friendly, outdoor patio was a delightful surprise.  It is on Valdez which is not a busy street and is perfect.  The gorgeous heat lamps come in handy and add to the decor.alaMar  is serious about cocktails and the bar is fantastic. That's All Folks cocktail (5 stars)- vodka, carrot and ginger concoction was delightful. I knew it was the start of a culinary love affair when I saw Gruner Veltliner (5 stars) on the white wine menu. One of my favorite varietals and they serve a good one at a decent price point.Now on to the food.  Its a great place to go with a group because the food is meant for sharing. The fries are a tasty appetizer but they are best described as potato crisps not fries (4 stars). I would suggest they add real pomme frites because they would be a perfect accompaniment to several dishes. The crab poppers are tasty, the crab is really fresh but I do not need to waste stomach space with the thick coating (3.5 stars).  After 2 tastings I will skip them next time.The shrimp boil with romesco butter looks great and tastes better (4.5 stars).  Loved the subtle flavors.   The mussels (4 stars) were also delicious with a creamy saffron and basil sauce.  Delightful.  The signature dish is the chili crab (6.5 stars) which is flavored with lemon verbena and coconut cream.  Good crab is hard to find so I could wax poetic for hours but instead will rate it 6.5 stars.  The crab was so flavorful, delicate and tasty. I did not even need the sauce which was decadent and scrumptious. Would be perfect with the previously mentioned desired french fries. alaMar is a neighborhood hotspot. This place gets a 5 star review because on both my visits,  I was anticipating my next visit while still there. Highly, highly  recommend for any seafood lover who appreciates great food, service and ambiance.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/22/2014,6/13/2014,303,540,7,17,14>So happy that Off The Grid has found a home in Concord - talk about starting your weekend right!We arrived to feast around 11:20 and I definitely recommend that as the crowd was reasonable when we arrived, and swarming as we headed out.  Lots of chairs were set up for diners, so it was all very convenient.  There were 8-9 trucks parked for lunch, some definitely more popular than others.  It wasn't a big surprise that Chinese bbq places had modest lines, I think people are definitely wanting to sample things less easy to come by.  Music played as we dined, which was very pleasant!  And while I was happy to hear the live tunes when the band  started playing originals, ordering food became a lot more difficult - too loud and too close.  There must be a solution!Since this was our first food truck experience, we wanted to really pig out and sample lots of goodies.  Round 1 included the The Mustang and tater tots from Drewski's Hot Rod Kitchen, and the Barbacoa sandwich from Peruvian truck Sanguchon.  I was drawn to the Barbacoa because any BBQ sauce made with cola perks my ears all up.  It was a decent sandwich, sauce and meat flavors were good, and the texture elements of coleslaw and potato chips made it fun to eat.  Nothing on earth could have topped that Mustang sandwich though - EPIC!  Korean BBQ beef, kimchi, daikon, wasabi aioli and cheese, all together to make one insane grilled cheese!  Super flavorful and savory, and their garlic rosemary tater tots were fried to golden perfection and were fabulous! Round 2 was almost nerve-wracking because Round 1 went so well!  We got the beef tacos from Korean truck Seoul on Wheels, and because of its insane reputation and long line, I ordered the steamed bun with spicy chicken from The Chairman.  The tacos were my least favorite of what we tried, they took a very long time to come up and weren't overly flavorful.  The chicken bun from the Chairman was AMAZING!  Delicious chicken with a yummy Thai peanut sauce and pickled veggies on the tasty steamed bun, priced right at only $3.25.  I can't imagine visiting OTG and not getting that delicious sammie!For about $30 bucks 2 of us ate a delicious 4 course meal of yummy eats!  Bring your adventurous foodie friends and enjoy!
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,6/12/2014,654,850,10,15,11>It was a Helluva 2 days. It was brewery, brewery, brewery, tasting room. During that 2 days of rambling beer touring & drinking, the very 1st brewery visited was Sierra Nevada all the way up in Chico. & that's why the end of that 2 day run was right here in the Torpedo Room.It was at Sierra Nevada in Chico where I learned of the existence of the Torpedo Room & its recent opening. It was like manna from Heaven. Out of nowhere, there was now a Sierra Nevada tasting room close to home & just down the street from work.I had to go. It was imperative. Besides, I had an empty Sierra Nevada growler that I had picked up while touring the brewery in Chico. Now, to be clear, Torpedo Room is a tasting room that also fills growlers. It's not a bar or a taproom in the fullest sense & that's an important distinction.4 oz. pours is all you'll get here.* This is not the place to come if you're looking to knock back a pint or 2. But, the 4 oz. tasters are only like a buck or 2 apiece & you can taste as much as you like. It's a fantastic way to get to know Sierra Nevada beers that may not be available anywhere else outside Chico.The room itself is a sleek concrete, glass, wood & steel space with lots of laboratory glassware & brewing ingredients as decorating accents. The bar can get pretty crowded & service does bog down as staff takes the time to describe the beers in tasting flights. But service, overall, isn't really any slower than at a comparably busy bar.Since my 1st visit, I've been back a bunch. Sometimes just for a quick taster or 2 after work. Sometimes to fill a growler. The location is too convenient for me to pass up. After visiting Sierra Nevada in Chico & seeing everything that goes into making these beers, I feel lucky that the Torpedo Room landed where it did. It's like manna from Heaven, only better because it's beer.*Thursdays are cask day. Every Thursday, a different Sierra Nevada beer will be available on cask. With the cask beer, there's the option to get an 8 oz. pour in a Sierra Nevada glass that you get to keep.
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2014,6/11/2014,246,234,13,19,16>Looking for a Japanese date night place or a restaurant that can accommodate a large group? Mika's is your place. Walking distance from Concord/Pleasant Hill BART station, this is a great meet up restaurant regardless of where you are in the bay area. Keep in mind this restaurant is NOT located in the heart of Walnut Creek, near the shopping centers. It's closer to Concord/PH.The ambiance is very nice, consisting of Red walls, booths and sushi bar seating. Several Japanese artifacts adorn the walls. I think what surprised me and my honey was the music. It's not your typical, waterfall or ocean sounds that you hear in most Japanese restaurants. They were actually playing music from today hit stations (example Pit Bull, Justin Timberlake, Katy Perry and etc.)Service is not the greatest, meaning it takes a long time until the waitress takes your order or fills your drink cup. Nonetheless, the wait staff are very friendly, which kind of makes it hard to get upset.This place is great for all eaters (carnivore, pescatarian, omnivores, vegetarians and vegans) they have an extensive menu selection.Our favorite dishes are:VEGETABLE-TOFU CURRY with UDON NOODLE, the curry soup base is what makes this dish, very flavorful.VEGAN GYOZA the crunchy side compliments the steam gyoza. SOBA SUSHI...when I first read this sushi, we were hesitant to order it, but we figured we'll try it out. I am happy we did because the soba noodle actually taste better than sushi rice. We ordered several fried rolls but was not a fan of them. The sauce did not compliment the roll and lacked crunch from the deep fried. I'm definitely a fan of this place for the fact they provide several vegan options. If they work on their service and the sauces for both entrees and rolls, this would be a 5 star for sure.

Arriving at 6:30, we were promptly seated.  The restaurant has a clean feel to it with its wood paneled walled, tiled floors and I liked that the tables were nicely spaced apart. Our order:Lemongrass noodles:  a savory noodle soup cooked with fish, lemongrass and spices with fresh vegetables.  A generous amount of rice vermicelli noodles with julienned carrots and cucumber slices.  A simple yet very tasty bowl of soup. (yelp.com/biz_photos/angk…) (yelp.com/biz_photos/angk…)Scallops and prawns:  sautéed prawns and scallops with asparagus, garlic and mint leaves.  The seafood was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. (yelp.com/biz_photos/angk…)Basil beef: sautéed beef with asparagus, red peppers, basil, and chili sauce. Beef was tender and the dish utilized a sauce similar to the scallop and prawn dish.  (yelp.com/biz_photos/angk…)Sweet basil fried rice with chicken:  fried rice with basil, chili, garlic, almonds and some pineapple chunks.  The slices of chicken looked overcooked, but they were actually very tender and moist. (yelp.com/biz_photos/angk…)Coconut rice:  got bowl to try.  Lots of coconut flavors infused into the rice. (yelp.com/biz_photos/angk…)Deep fried bananas with coconut ice cream.  The ice cream was very good, but felt the deep fried bananas were just ok compared to ones I've had at Vietnamese and Thai restaurants. The batter needed more flavors. (yelp.com/biz_photos/angk…)Overall, a nice experience with Cambodian cuisine at Angkor.   Will be back to try out other items on the menu.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,6/9/2014,142,274,8,12,13>Like everyone else, we came for the 7 courses of beef.  I felt a little shy ordering it since my fiancé told me this is usually served at weddings and other celebrations, so I made up a fake reason to celebrate in my head in case someone asked.Now, I'm mentally preparing for an agonizing sling of beef hitting my stomach like a brick, but it was surprisingly refreshing!  Especially with a lychee martini riding shotgun.  The majority of the meal, at least time-wise, is spent in a make-your-own-spring-roll type of situation.  They start you off with a lovely beef salad and beef carpaccio and before you know it your table is stacked with plates of condiments you have no idea what to do with.  First comes the dried rice paper.  Then the plate of various herbs and veggies.  Finally, a bowl of hot water?  (NOT for cleaning your hands after the carpaccio!  ...I know that now.)  You sit in agonizing suspense, wondering what's coming next.  If the water is not for rinsing, what could it possibly be for?!  Then it comes, rearing around the bend -- the rotund plate of beef rolls.  Grilled beef lot leaf, grilled beef lemongrass, beef sausage...  and everything starts to fall into place.  The rice paper is dipped in the hot water and all your fixin's are wrapped in it.  Duh!  It was tough going at first, but halfway through I found my inner spring roll wrapping master.  Just when you think, "Whew, that was good, I can't eat anymore," you remember the beef meatball still sitting on your plate and the beef porridge that's making its way over to you as you speak.  So you take a deep breath, mumble a few feel-good mantras under your breath, and dig in.  You can do it!  I believe in you!

Kanishka's immediately caught Gayle's attention when they first opened, and finally on an early Sunday evening, we wandered into the WC and gave them a try. Here's what Gayle posted on her Facebook page after we returned home:Just got home from first foray into Kanishka's in Walnut Creek. Indian fusion, small plates, gastropub. My taste buds are in heaven!Plus we got to watch the Academy Awards and meet the owner as a special treat. Another humorous bonus is reading other reviews that seem surprised at the concept of "small plates". Yes, this isn't Midwest comfort food in large portions, and yes the bill can add up quickly if you don't choose strategically. Yet, getting to sample and nibble from a neat variety of Indian-infused choices, was great fun for me and my amazing Wife. A friend of mine once opined that "If she wasn't crying, it wasn't curry". The Kanishka's version did make me head sweat, which was good enough for me. We sampled 4 dishes of which the Lamb Sliders and the Chicken Korma Poutine (served over Paprika Kennebac Fries) were our favorites. As Gayle is still raving about Kanishka's, I'm sure we'll be back, with or without a  Bifsteak Booster before or after.
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,6/7/2014,396,132,7,13,12>I'm so happy this taco truck is located in Fremont! Taco Negris makes some of the most flavorful burritos and tacos I've ever had in my life! In the past 5 years, I have tried sooo much Mexican food and burritos and you really don't get this amount of flavor often. A lot of reviews rave about their asada, shrimp or pastor, but I find that their chicken is just as amazing. Very often, chicken tends to be overcooked and dry when grilled for Mexican food and can lack flavor, but not the chicken at Taco Negris! The flavor is practically grilled into the chicken that is still juicy and soft. Asada can be a little dry, especially if not enjoyed immediately, but still packs a lot of flavor. The chicken super burrito was especially amazing to me, personally. Instead of guacamole, they give you chunks of avocado which can be both good and bad. The good thing is the the flavor is more concentrated and stronger but the bad is that it's not spread throughout the burrito. Their tortilla is not very thick, which allows the flavor to be tasted in every bite. Someone said that the burrito is dry without the sour cream and beans, but I find that the burrito is juicy and PERFECT (the chicken one.) If you like chicken like me, you won't regret getting the chicken super burrito or the chicken taco!! (:
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,6/6/2014,99,208,5,11,8>For at least once in your life, you should have an unforgettable dining experience. One where you feel like your every need is anticipated, where you're waited on hand and foot, where all your senses are stimulated. And most importantly, you get to stuff your face. In a classy way, though, that doesn't involve a mountain of food that sits on a plate in front of you, challenging you until the every last morsel is consumed (but don't get me wrong- I'm not above that at all). Our night consisted of 8 delightful courses, a nice bottle of wine we brought ourselves and impeccable service. 1st course: caramelized onion financier (eat this second) and radish and white sturgeon caviar in shellfish emulsion. One of my favorites! Brought to the table by Chef himself, even though I didn't know it at the time. Love the financier. 2nd course: oyster covered in frozen cider with rosemary and wood smoke. What beautiful presentation! Each ingredient's flavor contributed to the dish in its own way and had its own "moment" to shine. 3rd course: Dungeness crab with anise and celery in fragrant lime bouillon. A very subtle dish. Again, extremely beautifully crafted and presented. 4th course: slow poached egg yolk with sweet and savory spices with warm potato. The warm potato is poured into the bowl right before you break the yolk. I love dishes like this that require some restraint and make you think- wait, how do you eat this? 5th course: cod confit, sabayon of clams with artichoke and young green garlic. How you cook a fish to be so tender it is one degree away from being raw is beyond me. This is why I eat out- to eat things I will never be able to cook myself! The artichoke with the garlic was to-die-for. 6th course: braised oats with pork, mustard, dried blueberries and red beetroot. I was feeling unsatisfied until I got this dish. The sweet and savory flavors were married seamlessly. Totally unexpected and unique. 7th course: tisane of button mushrooms. Hands down one of my favorites. We were trying to guess what kind of mushrooms went into this amazing concoction, only to read the menu afterwards and see... Button?! The taste was so concentrated. My taste buds were looooooving it. A very seemingly simple (and quick) dish but probably took a good amount of time to make. Understated and elegant. 8th course: roast fowl with hen of the wood mushrooms, stinging nettles and crisp millet. My fiancée's favorite. So impossibly tender. Not until this meal did I know about these mushrooms and now I am love! Cheese course: beer washed goat's cheese with golden raisins. Served in between some sort of pastry. I put this entire thing in my mouth and shouldn't have. I'm not a big fan of goat cheese and was overwhelmed by the taste. Should have taken small bites. Desserts: perfumed sour apples with majoram, pistachio and sage caramel; mignardise (aka petit fours). A piece of edible art. There were 2 petit fours I didn't care for too much. The chocolate mint bon-bon was not only beautiful, the creaminess was decadent and a perfect way to end such a wonderful meal. I also have to comment on the staff- because so many different people came over to refill our waters and wine, run the food, give us bread, etc., it didn't seem like we were being overwhelmed. It  felt as if we were being waited on by the entire front-of-house staff. Everyone was so unbelievably professional. My congratulations to the cooks- what wonderfully creative and unique dishes you have made. I will most likely never taste anything remotely close to what you've created. Everything was amazing and we left with not only full bellies, but an experience we will remember. Thank you to everyone who made our anniversary memorable.

<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2014,6/4/2014,384,246,8,19,12>Macaron aficionado here. I love me some Macarons.When I see Macarons, I buy (well, if the macaron size & price match).Chocolate, peach saffron, strawberry balsamic, yuzu, cassis, pistachio, & salt caramel were the flavorflavs ordered @ $1.25 each. Each macaron tasted like the said flavor. Chocolate, peach s, strawberry b, pistachio, and salt c. YUM. Yuzu and cassis on the other hand...were foreign flavors, but they tasted 'licious ;DConsistency? Nice crunchy exterior shell, soft and chewy interior middle. They were on point!Service was topnotch. Friendly lady behind the counter notified us of the most popular flavorflavs and recommended others. When my friend and I sat down to enjoy our macarons from the paper bag, the lady bought over little plates and glasses of water for us (w/o us even asking). Now that is going above and beyond.I would definitely walk here from the Bart station again. Teehee.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2014,6/3/2014,106,154,8,19,15>My experiences here are limited to Sunday Dollar Days, but we've been coming to them for the last few years now. We always sit in the Thoroughbred Club area (middle deck with the large awning) right by the finish line. We've brought our 4 year old daughter in the past too and she's always had a good time. There's a lot going on at this place so I'll start from the beginning. PARKING - Free parking on the street leading up to the track. Parking on the hill can range from $7-$10 for all day parking. The walk from the street isn't bad and there has always been plenty of spots available each time we've gone. ADMISSION - On dollar days admission is only $1 (normally $6) to get into the open stands right by the track. Sitting in the covered Thoroughbred Club area costs $3 on Sundays (normally $8), but its worth it if you want a good view of the whole track and to stay out of the elements. I don't have experience with the Turf Club (the fancy pants area where you can watch the race through the windows and TV screens), but admission is $15 on a Dollar Day and Saturdays, regularly $10. STAFF - The staff we've met and talked to have been friendly. The lady who checks the Thoroughbred Club cards to make sure you're not sneaking in to the area remembers my boyfriend and I each time we've come. It might help that my boyfriend is a 6'4" red headed guy with mutton chops and that we sit in the same area each time too though. The people working the cash out area get us out of there fast. I do wish that there was more than one person working the bar though. She gets slammed and you're left waiting to just talk to her for well over 10 minutes sometimes. While I'm talking about the staff too, the lady working the Cup of Joe coffee hut makes a mean French Vanilla latte. While I was drinking it all I could think of was wanting to stand in a French Vanilla latte waterfall and guzzle down as much as I could. Seriously. Very unexpected awesomeness there!FACILITIES - Okay, so the place could use a coat or two of paint here and there. It could definitely benefit from a face lift during the off season. However though, if you've been to enough racetracks I think I can safely say this isn't likely to be the worst you've gone to. It's kept clean inside except for all the non-winning tickets of the day that litter the floor inside and out (something that's to be expected at any racetrack). The bathrooms are well stocked and maintained throughout the day too. There's several options for food while you're here also (even on a dollar day!). There's a basic cafe kind of deal upstairs where you can get salads, nachos and more. There's a bar as I've mentioned right behind the cafe too. Outdoors you'll find a BBQ stand grilling up all sorts of yumminess for around $8-$10 a pop. The Cup of Joe coffee hut serves up all your iced and hot coffeehouse favorites for an average of $4 a cup. The gift shop also has snacks if $1 hot dogs and beer aren't your thing. If you have kids, check out the paddock area too. They'll be able to get really close to the horses down there. Oh, and did I mention this place has free WiFi too? THE CROWD - You'll see ladies wearing fancy dresses with floppy hats and designer heels as well as people who clearly spend way too much time at the track (and not enough time in the shower). It's all part of the experience. If you don't want to deal with the riff-raff pay the extra money and sit in the Thoroughbred Club area and only venture down for beer and hot-dog seeking missions.If you've never been to the track, make a visit here on a Sunday and check it out without blowing a bunch of money on admission and food. I've had no problem bringing my own snacks and drinks in either, so that's an option too. Overall, if you have kids or just wanna see what all the fuss is about - give it a try! Great way to spend the afternoon!

Now I can just head downtown to satisfy my sweet-tooth : )Any sort of candy that you can imagine! Giant Gummy Bears! Giant Pixy Stix! Giant Lollipops! Oh my!Lining the walls in clear plastic bins or in cute, tin pails; on bookcase-like shelves; and on tables in the middle of the store. Old timey baskets on both the wall and on the floor are filled with lots of different taffy flavors.They have so many different types of candy! There are even shelves of candy specifically for wine pairing, celebrations, and gifts of packaged chocolates.Speaking of gifts, if you can't eat all of the sweet treats yourself, you can get a gift basket or even a card to go along with your gift. They have a large rack full of cards to choose from as well.Many of the candies are marked with prices, but some of the loose candy -- including the rock candy pops -- is not. They use a scale to weigh it to determine the price. Some have a standard price, e.g. 1/4 lb. of taffy is $2.75.And if you're really on a diet, pick up one of their handbags *made from candy wrappers* and imagine the candy that was once inside of said wrappers : )It's a pleasant touch when the owners hand out taffy samples to passers-by to entice them to enter the store : )Welcome to the neighborhood!
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2014,6/1/2014,255,95,5,9,7>When you think South Shore/Town Center in Alameda, you don't think a great date restaurants.  Nestled in the interior portion of South Shore is this beautiful modern restaurant with great food.  The atmosphere is very upscale without the semi formal clothing and white table cloth.  The service was great and they were on top of our every need.  Apparently, the chef is one of the chefs from Il Fornaio that decided to branch off and make his own restaurant.Food was delicious and every bite had great flavor.Calamari: 5/5 lightly battered and can enjoy the flavor of the squid with a hint of lemon juice and dipping sauce.Salad (Invernale):  5/5 mixed greens with different flavors for the palette from bitter greens, bleu cheese to the sweetness from the fruits.  The vinaigrette dressing was delicious and eating all the components at once was like heaven in my mouth.Chitarrine al Cacao: 4.5/5  Cocoa powder pasta with a red sauce and shredded rabbit.  The shredded rabbit had good texture and flavor.  The tomato based sauce was very flavorful but not enough to overpower the taste of the rabbit.  Excellent touch.    This dish did not look like a lot of food but it was very filling.Ravioli con Coda: 4/5 Ravioli with braised ox tail.  Comes with 4 decent sized raviolis but wouldn't be enough for me by itself.   My girlfriend got this dish so the portion size was okay with her.  Like every other dish we tried the flavor was fantastic.  The ox tail was the main flavor from the dish.Pumpkin Creme Brule: 3.5/5 Was a creamy pumpkin filling with light sugar on top.  The sugar was coated unevenly and one side was thicker than the other.Most italian places are as expensive as Trabacoo but not half as good.  I will be coming back here whenever I'm in the mood for some Italian.

No crazy wait times! The casseroles are delicious and can serve up to 4-5 people. They are similar to taste as soon tofu; you eat the soup with rice. They are about $30, which is a great deal considering Casserole House serves side dishes (very fresh and great variety), onion pancake as an appetizer, herbal tea, and the rice drink for dessert. If I am not mistaken, the price of the casserole also includes rice. The waitress and owner were SO sweet and accommodating. They were very attentive and fulfilled all our requests with smiles - whether it be refills on the side dishes, more tea, or questions we had. The owner was very friendly, and she even explained to us how she made some of the dishes. At the end of our meal, they came over and made fried rice for us using the leftover soup. SO good. I will definitely come back time and time again when I crave korean food. No unreasonable wait time (unlike one of their competitors, AND they serve better food), great service, and delicious food at reasonable prices. I love Casserole House!
<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/28/2014,5/30/2014,223,178,5,16,7>One of the more fun places to hike (and climb!) in Fremont and remains my go-to trail  whenever friends want to try something new! If you want a fun twist to the same ol' routine then stop by here and visit Little Yosemite-- a beautiful section along the stream that is lined with boulders that you have to climb up and over with mini waterfalls along the way. If you're feeling more adventurous, walk in the water the entire way up or even, I dare say, jump off a ledge into the ponds! They're not deep so be cautious but it always looks like a lot of fun when others do it! If not, you can bring a bathing suit and take a swim although space is very limited in the swimmable areas or just perch yourself up on a boulder and throw yourself a little picnic! This is an awesome place for a semi-short hike and if you're looking to do a little bit more than just hike. Truly a gem in Fremont!
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/30/2014,5/29/2014,163,180,5,13,6>I've changed my mind about Buddy's and I'm giving them an extra star. Why five stars? Buddy's continues to exceed my expectations each time I go. I'm always happy with my food/drink selections and never leave disappointed. Some of my recent discoveries at Buddy's include:- Red eye fries: I've tried them with the sriracha sauce on the side (less soggy and less spiciness overload) and with added chicken. Crispy, gooey yumminess. - Breaded snapper burger: The fish is fried to perfection and the sauce gives it an unexpected tangy kick. Far from your McDonald's Filet-O-Fish. I never expected a fish sandwich to be so good! Get it with garlic fries, it's well worth the extra $1. - Electric Feel: The combination of strawberry lemonade and soju is refreshing! You can barely taste the alcohol, so keep in mind that this drink can be a creeper. I also recommend trying their fish tacos and brunch menu, especially their bottomless mimosas. Their strawberry mimosa is my favorite, but they also offer pineapple and orange. Buddy's offers many different specials throughout the week which gives you an extra incentive to stop by. I recommend using their app to earn rewards if you're a regular. Buddy's has great food, drinks, music (a cool collection of alternative, rock and old school music, lots of stuff I grew up listening to) and service! Buddy's is a great addition to Hayward.
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/2/2014,5/28/2014,202,466,7,12,12>This is the epitome of local flavor. I give it five stars, not because it is the most amazing modern bar ever, but because it is simply the only one of its kind. It does not even try to be anything but itself, all slanted, historic, cramped, bare-bones, amiable, unassuming, dark parts of itself. This is a great place to chill with a few friends and a strong, no-frills cocktail... and to wonder about all the stories that have inevitably passed through the place  from other lifetimes.  No sugar coating or trendiness here (despite the presence of hipsters); just a single down-to-earth bartender behind a sloped bar and simple drinks in a (very) old itty bitty wooden shack.

And if you're looking for more than just fried chicken and coleslaw between two rolls, this is the place to be. There are enough sandwich options to accommodate most moods and the couple I've had (Pesto and Waffle) were quite good. A tip though: Don't order the Chicken and waffle to-go, that is unless you like your waffles crisp-less.  Oh, and they have best fries on the planet! At least that's what's advertise on the menu, and from my limited time and experience on this earth, I have no reason to try to refute that claim. And on top of the fries being dang good, a single order is less than $2. Service: All my experiences here were pleasant. Really couldn't ask for more.

Sometimes I can't wait and go straight for dessert first! With its ever-changing menu of various seasonal flavors, there's never a wrong time to visit Ici (but I'm the kind of girl who craves ice cream in the middle of winter). And you can try as many samples as you want!Some personal favorite ice cream flavors:+ Earl grey or any type of tea+ Pumpkin creme brulee+ Anything with coffee+ Sorbets for something light and refreshingAnd I highly recommend getting a HANDMADE SUGAR CONE...enjoy your scoop of ice cream and be surprised by chocolate at the very end! (What's not to love?!) You can enjoy your sweet treat inside the shop (there are a few seats along the windows) or I like to take my dessert to-go and window shop down College Ave. And if you're feeling parched, they offer complimentary water and sparkling water in the pitchers on the left.Things to note:- I've never had to wait more than 15 mins...even with a line out the door. However, a good time to come is during summer or winter breaks when the majority of college kids are out of town. If this is your first time, Ici is well worth the wait!

<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/14/2014,5/21/2014,363,125,5,13,11>I went to this restaurant because I heard about their Happy Hour at the bar. After coming in to watch a sports game a couple of times, I can say that it's worth the visit! The Happy Hour is everyday (except for holidays) from 3 pm to 7 pm. There's a cocktail of the day which is $4.00 and all beers are $3.00 each. The daily cocktail is varied enough so that each day will taste different. From Vodka Martinis to Tequila Sunrises, you'll have something new and unique each day for an affordable price. The selection of beers is pretty standard (Shocktop, IPA, etc.) and it's not too expensive. Since this place is classier, they don't offer pitchers of beers which is a bit disappointing but expected.The restaurant also offers Happy Hour food (3pm -7pm daily, except holidays). I ordered the chicken and waffles which was delicious! The chicken wasn't too salty or too crunchy. I thought it was cooked just right and had enough flavor. The waffles were also pretty good and served with butter & maple syrup. The price wasn't too expensive at $8.00 and satisfied my stomach.The bar itself isn't too bad either. There's enough room for a decent crowd and there's three flat screen TVs to show which sports game is on. The decor is pretty fancy and the selection of liquor is decent. The bartenders are also dressed classy and friendly if you want to have conversation. The service was pretty good and I haven't had any problems thus far.     My only complaints are that it can really cramped on weekends because of the small space and it can also get really loud. So if you're expecting a nice quiet evening, you might get disappointed.  This has become my one of my new Happy Hour places. It's a tad bit classier than other bar & restaurants and has a decent-sized bar. Plus, their cocktails of the day are pretty good and cheap. Check this place out if you're in the area!

But Walnut Creek has a solution to this problem: CAFFE LA SCALA! They're open fairly late (midnight) AND they serve classy alcohol; there's nothing quite like a wine-n-whine sesh with your best friends, amirite?! Everyone here talks about the tiramisu, which is good in its own right, don't get me wrong. It's creamy and fatty and rum-y and everything you could want in a slice of cake. But LISTEN TO ME: GET THE LEMON BARS. THEY'RE AMAZING. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. And most importantly, they're never goddamn there so when I see them, you BEST BELIEVE I'm shelling out the $3 for one of those bad boys. They're so unassuming, sitting there next to the monstrous tiramisu. It's just a LEMON BAR, you say with a not-so-subtle eye-roll, how good can it BE? The answer is so, so good. Just trust me on this one (or, you know, don't, that just leaves more for me). They "have wifi" here and outlets abound, but it's often so spotty that I want to throw my laptop out one of their many ceiling-to-floor windows. And if you're anything like me and need a constant and life-sustaining stream of internet connection, you will join me in the laptop-flinging festivities.tl;dr: good for chilling with friends or hardcore studying since the lack of good internet inhibits your ability to properly procrastinate.

Only tried the Topdog (original) but I was convinced of Topdog's greatness already.(+) Topdog ($3.00) Juicy hotdog with a clean snap to it. Soft bun that was toasted to have a crunch. Their dogs are a little on the small side- perfectly fine for someone like me, but guys out there might want to get two if they're hungry.

One of the mustards (the more yellow one) has that kicker horseradish spiciness it, so careful there.
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/31/2014,5/17/2014,340,339,7,15,8>The leaflet I received last week said "cheese zombies." I like cheese. I like zombies. There is no way I would have let anything bar me from checking out a cheese zombie, so off to Patty's I went with the daughter for an afternoon snack.When we went in, it was already a little past their closing time, so their inventory was limited. The guy who helped us was very nice and kindly explained to me that cheese zombies are apparently a big hit for people who went to school in the area (yup, I just betrayed my FOBness...for shame!). When he said this, I was slightly scared because...cafeteria food? But he told me that this is not anything like notorious school cafeteria food, and he did not lie. Now, think of the last delicious croissant you had. Don't be lazy. Just do it. Take a minute or two... Now, do you remember the flakiness? Do you remember the buttery deliciousness that made your taste buds happy? Do you remember how you thought the French are a great people for giving the world the gift that is the croissant? Yes? Then now we can have a proper dialogue of sorts about Patty's cheese zombies.Forget about the flakiness of the croissant, but dwell on the buttery taste. That is how the bread of the cheese zombies taste like. Its texture is more doughy but that is pleasant in itself since it makes for cleaner, less crumb-y eating. The cheese is American, and although I have outgrown the Kraft variety a long time ago, the memories of noshing on my favorite childhood snack that came flooding back brought so much happiness to an already blissful afternoon. Yes, I am a fan of cheese zombies! The daughter and I will be back.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,5/16/2014,291,487,13,21,14>I'm always happy to see a Bay Area brewery success story.  Heretic was just a small brewery in Pittsburg a year or so ago, and now they have expanded to a huge facility in Fairfield.  It's pretty impressive.  Everything is shiny & new & they are making some really great beer.I really wanted to take the brewery tour, so I emailed them (as suggested on their website) to save 2 spots for hubby & I on a recent Saturday.  I never heard back, but we decided to head up there & take our chances.  Well it turns out that it was their Triple IPA release day so they were packed to the gills & not leading tours.  Bummer, but the staff were all so nice & encouraged us to wander around & ask lots of questions.  So we did!  Somehow we managed to get 2 seats at the bar.  The long line was mostly for their triple IPA (Evil3 aka Evil Cubed...awesome name).  Since I'm not a fan of double let alone triple IPA's, I tried a few tasters ($1.50 each) of their other unusual brews.  I really liked Evil Twin, a malty red ale, & Torment, a Belgian dark.  There was another one that was an aged bourbon stout that was quite good, although a bit heavy on the bourbon flavor.  All in all great beer!I'm just sorry that they are located in Fairfield, which isn't far but it's not really a destination city.  I'll stop in again on my way through town.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2014,5/15/2014,330,444,11,20,15>I get all my shoe work done here.  Peter and his team are good!  I have been adding rubber soles to dress shoes when I get them right off the bat, taking my guys shoes in here when his commuter pairs get worn heels, as well as furnishing my shoes with a good pair of insoles every time I get a new pair.  They also have good comfort shoe, OBT brand shoes, lots of comfort flip-flops, and leather goods like belts and wallets. They also do purse repair.  When I got a new V-Day STATUS bag, (Status being taken, or that the purse is expensive, I guess?) I took my old daily purse/handbag in for some repairs- they re-stitched a handle that was starting to come a bit unraveled, and polished and buffed my green Kate Spade to her somewhat tarnished, but well worn leather glory. The prices.....I don't shop around for these services anymore, but when I buy a pricey pair, I'm willing to shell out $25-30 to get heels restored, or soles added.  Last time I was in, I heard a lady say,  'I've had these shoes for 20 years, I need the heel glued on".....Peter quotes $25-and she walked away. Don't underestimate the power of negotiation, either.  Just try it.   Look,  you've had these for 20 years and you don't want to shell out $25 shekels for a repair?! I don't know.  To me, it's worth it.  My feet are worth it.  My big ass handbag is worth it.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2014,5/14/2014,233,174,13,24,14>Dinner at Iyasare is a beautiful thing. Since the shutter of O'Chame, I'd been highly anticipating the next treasure to inhabit the space. My expectations were more than valid, it was truly a thrill to eat here. The interior design is tasteful and modern. So fresh, so clean with an air of elegance. The choice of lighting is seriously stunning. I was taken with the sleek bar, woven fabric panels in shades of sand, the fresh flower arrangements, and the simple chandelier but I can't lie, I was a little sad to be in the space sans the art of Mayumi Oda. Even the design of the bathroom was chic, my friend and I had a good laugh about the "strategically placed" stones in the sink. The eats are inspired by the chef's childhood in rural Northeastern Japan but elevated and plated to wow the clientele. Such meticulous flavors and thoughtful pairings. Instead of going with separate entrees, my friend and I indulged in a selection of their smaller plates -  maguro carpaccio, hamachi crudo, ocean umami, saka mushi, and uni risotto. We ended the meal with the fuyu dessert. If you have an appetite akin to a small army, you may leave this place grouchy, using your Yelp app to scout the nearest burger but the quality of their dishes is undeniable.The saka mushi was so impeccable. Gorgeous clams steamed in sake with chunks of smoky bacon, slices of purple potatoes, shreds of cabbage, a strip of konbu, delicate yuzu zest. Sigh. The hamachi crudo was insanely subtle, adorned with bits of oyster tartare, watercress, and droplets of chili sesame oil. The best bite of the night was whatever type of oyster donned the rich uni risotto. It is something EVERYONE should try. I am gutted that I didn't snap a picture of the menu to revisit it at a later date. I think I literally uttered "oh my god" and my eyes rolled back in my head. Service was stellar. Upon arrival, the host was pleasant, quickly found our reservation, and seated us promptly. Our main waiter was not only eye candy but he was attentive and amiable. The dishes were paced wonderfully, we always had fresh plates, and our water glasses were never empty. If you're into Japanese flavors, incredible seafood, seasonal organic produce, and a seamless dining experience from start to finish, Iyasare is gold.
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,5/13/2014,243,508,6,24,14>East Bay Coffee is the newest addition to Old Town Pinole and it's an absolute gem. This place use to be a sports hobby shop and EBCC has taken over the space and turned it into this open, well spaced, modern rustic, coffee shop. They have lot's of seating and a counter sitting area in front of the window. The tables are not crammed next to each other like Starbucks and Peets. They also have live acoustic music playing on Saturday from 10-12pm and from 6-8pm on Saturdays and 6-8pm again on Sundays. They also serve pastries, desserts, baked goods and specifically select macaroons such as ube, pistachio, and maple bacon macaroons. Soon EBCC will be serving sandwiches, salads and soups. What I think is also awesome is EBCC offers almond milk in their latte's, mocha's and capuccino's. I can't think of another coffee shop that offers almond milk! I've also meet Bill the owner and his son's Trent and Shane who are really nice and down to earth.  Seriously, come check this new and upcoming coffee shop in Old Town Pinole, very easy to get to, street parking available and a great place to walk to anytime of the day. Help support your local business!
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/29/2014,5/12/2014,331,112,11,17,13>This is the restaurant version of the ever-so-popular Brazil Fresh Squeeze Cafe. I can finally satisfy my tri tip cravings at night now without fear of sitting out in the dark or in the brisk Berkeley chill while I'm trying to scarf down my tri tip. Now my friends and I can actually sit down indoors and enjoy a cheap meal of delicious tri tip in comfort! Plus, the tri tip rice bowl actually seemed bigger than the outdoor stand and our waitress was very friendly and chill.AND THEY HAVE DOLE WHIP! If you've ever been to Hawaii or Disneyland, then you know what sorcery I'm talking about!
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2014,5/11/2014,193,290,9,16,12>Berkeley seems fast on it's way to becoming the city with the most pizzarias per capita this side of the Tiber river. Thankfully, the pizza is so excellent that I am embracing this culinary flux, most recently while dining at Silver.Dining is kind of the wrong word: let's say "jamming". If not for Harrison Barnes (#40 on the Golden State Warriors) promoting a playoff viewing party at this spot, it would have taken me longer to find out about Sliver. I don't go downtown much, I'm not a student, and Cheeseboard, Zachary's and Little Star are all moments away from my house. But Sliver makes the case for forsaking the regular haunts, by offering an amazing product and a very fun environment.The Pizza:Daily pizza changes but always let's the cheese take a major role. No tomato sauce to distract from the pungent flavors like lime or fresh corn that accentuate each killer combination. The one-pie-fits-all approach is a great one for my burnt out brain: you can just trust that whatever you eat was figured out long before you became too ravenous to think clearly. Even if you think you don't like asparagus, it is likely to end up surprising you in a great way.The crust is sourdough-ish, sturdy and thin and the ratio of the toppings to the base is perfect. You bite into a great layer of cheese and veggies, not too crispy, definitely needs some chewing and savoring, and never too overloaded with toppings either. The People:I went for a Warriors themed night and the maitre'd was handing out prizes to a slew of Warriors fans, all ages. At one point the kitchen just gave away some free pizzas. This place exudes good, playful vibes. Hip people working behind the counter, busser busting her butt to keep the place comfortable for customers, and chefs in the kitchen who will smile and wave at you as you head out. This is an excellent, non-pretentious, and gourmet restaurant. A great place to feel the Berkeley community and come together for a good meal (and beer, if that is how you roll).
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,5/10/2014,3448,1617,10,18,16>I will gladly admit that I'm addicted to seafood. I could eat oysters, fish, crab and shrimp everyday of my life. I am very happy about the new addition to the neighborhood and already have been here twice. We stopped in for Happy Hour each time, which is Monday through Friday from 4pm to 6pm. They have $1 Oysters during happy hour which were Kusshi. They are some of my favorites and they were very good. What a great deal. Ask for some of their spicy sauce if you are brave or go with the cocktail sauce or vinaigrette.The Chicken Wings are crunchy, big and you can get them mild, medium, spicy or insane. I got some of the insane sauce on the side. It's VERY hot, not recommended for  people who don't like their mouth on fire. You can get a basket during Happy Hour for $5! We ordered a pound of the Spicy Garlic Butter Shrimp and an order of the Garlic Noodles. The shrimp was perfect, spicy, buttery and finger lickin' good. The noodles were so good and buttery and make a perfect combo meal for 2. The very best dish ordered at our table was the King Crab. It's an entire crab at market price, you can add on sides like corn, sausage and potatoes. The dish came out and we all envied Courtney's crab. It was a lot of crab meat for less than $26 and extremely great quality. The drinks specials are pretty great during Happy Hour and the selection of spirits is impressive. They make a spicy margarita and a top shelf margarita that are great. I'm really loving 938 Crawfish and know you will too. Especially if you love seafood boils, fresh oysters, delicious food and cocktails.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,5/9/2014,235,168,4,11,7>One of the best milk teas in the Bay!As an addict constantly on the hunt for unique and high-quality MT, it turns out I had overlooked this great gem right in my tri-city backyard. Located inside Marina Supermarket (I know, how fobby) you will think it's a best-kept secret until you witness the long line of Asian supermoms clamoring for a drink, leaving you to wonder why no one told you about this place. Some must-tries: Almond Milk Tea, Jasmine Green Tea, Lychee Green Tea, Grapefruit Green Tea and Mango Green Tea. All so fresh and you can actually taste the tea. Can't go wrong with any of those.They also have "exotic," or more, just rare Asian fruit tea flavors like Osmanthus. They also serve Ceylon tea, Genmaicha, Hojicha, the list goes on. CASH ONLY so come prepared. If not, the supermarket registers have cash back so simply pick up something, like I did haha. Tea Island? More like TEA HEAVEN in the middle of a friendly, unassuming Asian plaza. I WILL be back.
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/5/2014,5/8/2014,37,45,9,11,10>I'm soooo glad to have finally found this place! I'd been going to a shop in Livermore for all my health items, but shall commute no more!They have Bragg products including a gallon jug of raw apple cider vinegar...oh yeah! Lots of supplements, for those of you who like that sort of thing. And local raw 'hunny' at decent prices. Some health food items such as seasonings, oils, and gluten free things can be found. Also, I was happy to see some aromatherapy oils and beauty soap bars and other bath and beauty products.If you can't find what you're looking for, then guess what, they can order it for you (more than likely)! How awesome is that? Extremely! Seriously, I won't need to commute again for my stuff. I'm so excited about that.They carry my favorite soap brand, Nubian Heritage and can order different scents. Also, I managed to roll out of there with a yummy vegan cookie treat! Woo hoo!The cherry on top is the lovely lady running this outfit, Barbara. She is a gem. And apparently she's run her business in B-wood for 30 years, and I'm just now discovering this little treasure.Oh, and they have this frequent buyer card thing, where you get a punch for a min. purchase of $20. :)If you're looking for a health food store in the greater East Bay, than look no further. It's a small little shop, which may not look like much when you first enter, but has what you're probably looking for. Go check them out!And one more tip, they don't take Amex, so have your handy dandy visa/mc ready!The end.
