<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2011,6/1/2011,287,110,19,18,21>Eating breakfast at Evan's Kitchen reminds me of hanging at my best friend's grandparent's ranch in Winters during my early teenage years. Their home had a very, shall we say, interesting decor. The best way I can describe it is thrift store antique with a splash of Americana. Take from that description what you will, but they made the best down-home breakfasts in that tacky little ranch house. I'm talking fresh made biscuits, bacon cut from the slab, stick to your ass and thighs style gravy, and fresh eggs cooked to perfection. My friendship with my then best friend eventually ended (probably over something petty and ridiculous), and with that friendship went my much anticipated country breakfasts.    What does all this have to do with Evan's you might ask? Well, fast-forward many, many years to my first breakfast at Evan's where as soon as I walked into the restaurant, I felt like I had just stepped out of a time machine. They have the same tacky Americana decor and down-home cooking that I had the pleasure of experiencing at the ranch back in the '90s. What really makes Evan's stand out for me obviously isn't the decor, it's the gravy. God damn what do they put in that gravy? I don't think I've ever had restaurant gravy that compares to what they're serving up. Then there's the rather large selection of Eggs Benedict--shit's so good I could easily have a different one every day of the week and not get bored. Hmmm? I might have to challenge myself to try that this summer! Who's with me?!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2010,5/31/2011,518,148,8,13,11>LOVE gettin' my facials on here! Gabriela is a miracle worker and continues to transform my dull skin into glowing radiance! Seriously. This is the best kept facial secret in town. The Spa is just one little tiny room located on the third floor of Nordstrom at Arden Fair directly across from the women's lounge. Blink and you'll miss it.Her facials are truly amazing as she's been at this location since this Nordstrom opened almost 20 years ago. Since she's a one person shop sometimes it's a little bit of a challenge getting an appointment. If you found out today that you just got invited to a big event tomorrow and you needed that extra little sparkle.....well, that might be tough. But she does get cancellations and is always happy to squeeze you in when she can.Her facials last about an hour give or take and include a short back massage, hand massage and foot moisturizing treatment. The cost is $95.Parking is a breeze with the attached parking garage.I've had a few facials in my day but Gabriela's are the best. I actually had someone comment after one of her treatments that my skin was glowing. Can't get better than that!
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/16/2010,5/30/2011,150,166,12,7,8>Faces. Legend. Hot mess.Best club in Sac (supposedly), and here's why: gays do it better, and this is one of the biggest venues of its kind in this town, and not as trashy as straight ones of similar size. This is fag hag central, which has tended to bring over a flurry of straight dudes (a few years back this was #3 on SN&R's list of "best place to meet straight singles"), but the gays are still in force here. It's not what I'd really consider a meat market though (you'll have to go to Badlands for that); it's basically a crazy-fun time, ranging from innocent to dirty.There's two stories, two separate dance floors (which can get pretty crowded on good nights), karaoke here is pretty fun, the lighting is always interesting, and what Sac Fag experience is complete without making out by that pool? Like it or not, Faces is a Sac icon, for better or worse. Can it compare to SF clubs? Is it something for our culture to be proud of? All I know is I never seem to be here when I'm sober or for more than half an hour...
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2011,5/28/2011,259,248,17,17,12>I just spent an entire evening watching the most graphic porn I have ever seen...food porn that is.     Unlike other fine dining establishments (and trust me I mean FINE) that treat you like they're doing YOU  a favor by just letting you through that door, The Kitchen exudes a familiar and comfortable vibe that is true to it's namesake. The entire staff: servers, chefs, even the general manager are happy to stop by and chat with you about anything whether it be the evening's dishes or about the upcoming Lady Gaga concert.      Feel like taking a stroll in the prep kitchen? Go ahead.      Want to cool down in the walk in fridge? No problem.     Feel like petting one of the fresh Maine Lobsters flown in that morning? Well...yes but any injuries sustained are completely your fault.     This no-boundaries approach to dining definitely puts you more in touch with the amazing ingredients that are being used to construct your food. Whether it be the Ahi Tuna flown in from the Philippines or the Four-year Wasabi gathered in Japan.     Did I mention that EVERY dish that comes out (all EIGHT courses!) makes your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head? Oh yeah. It's that good.     Cheers
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2011,5/27/2011,642,604,11,18,13>There are a lot of Mexican restaurants around just about everywhere you look these days, and most of them serve pretty descent food. Well, Plaza Del Sol is amongst them! My boyfriend and I came here for dinner on a Sunday evening. When I first walked in, I noticed a large, spacious and well lit dining area to my left and a more subdued lighting bar area to the right. Of course, we wanted to sit in one of the more romantic circular booths of the lounge, where four TV screens were featuring baseball, basketball and golf. They have a nice full liquor bar there, but we did not partake in alcohol that night. They offer drink specials during happy hour and half off appetizers from 4-8 PM. During this month of April, one of their dinner specials is fish or shrimp tacos. You get 2 tacos, with the traditional Mexican rice, refried beans, salad and homemade tortillas. All for $9.00! Usually these dinners are $12.00 on the regular menu. Everything passed with flying colors!  Cooked and seasoned just right!  I kind of wished for a little more shredded cheese in the tacos, but not that big of a deal. Our waiter was very nice and pretty quick on his feet. He maintained a steady pace as he waited on the four additional dining couples that were present. No one had to wait long for their food as the waiter moved about from table to table. In other words, he looked pretty busy and had the energy to keep up! I definitely want to come here again and try out their happy hour. Good place to bring friends or maybe a secret rendezvous!
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/29/2011,5/26/2011,247,159,12,18,13>I finally came to eat here to see if the all of the hype was true. Most of it is. Spanikopita was pretty good, a bit too greasy for my liking, but tasted great, light and flaky. The gyro meat was seasoned to perfection. The Greek fries are pretty cool, I liked them. I wasn't sure when I ordered them, but yea they are good. The tsatziki was right on, perfect. Pita was yum! The service, was pretty awesome, and who even calls people love anymore? I loved it. Very clean. The owner(?) I'm guessing was very kind to ask us before her turned up the volume on the TV for the president's speech as Egypt riots. (We are all sensitive to any upheaval to countries near our home lands). But, yea but!!! Why the hell are you serving canned dolma? You have so much going for you. The canned dolma took a star away from you. All in all, I'd recommend it.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2011,5/25/2011,222,180,8,13,13>Kamon is an unexpected find in an unassuming neighborhood visited most often by passers-through, but it's certainly worth getting to know. A shining exemplar of a hole-in-the-wall by its classical definition, there's much more to be found here than meets the eye. The dining room is small, dim, and compartmentalized, with a full-service bar and a few booths for larger parties. Nothing about the atmosphere distinguishes Kamon from its crowded field of competitors, per se, but the prices, value and service set them above the rest. The service is supreme; our waiter quickly heeded our every gesture, popping into our table every now and again without wearing out his welcome. Also, the prices are a bargain for what you get: traditional "waki" (westernized Maki) in large portions, averaging less than ten bucks an entrée.
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2011,5/24/2011,153,70,17,22,22>Since my initial review of Rivers Edge, I've probably been here 100,000 times.. I eat here, or eat food from here at least once a week. I'm so lucky that I live right around the corner, but I can't quite say the same for my waist size.. I think I've officially eaten everything off the breakfast menu at least twice. I know I said I would try to grab lunch here, but I still haven't. However, my boyfriend always orders lunch, and I've had bites (which have all been good so far), so I can say they make a good lunch. My current favorite thing is the smoked salmon scrambler. It is everything you could ever want on a bagel (smoked salmon, onions, capers) all scrambled up with an egg.. On top of a bagel with cream cheese. It is sooo damn good. I can only eat half of it, but I will ask for the half of it to-go, so it won't be soggy later on.Another fun thing (which I have only had under the influence of a green plant) was this waffle sandwich that had egg, sausage and cheese.. It was amazing.. [I just looked at the online menu, and it is no longer there, so they either took it off.. Or I've been dreaming about sandwiches again..]Really though, the best thing about Rivers Edge is the people who work there. I order to-go ALL THE TIME. I'm always busy and on the go, so my food needs to be too, sometimes...  But the minute I walk in to grab my food, I am greeted (by name) and my food is all ready to go out the door.. And in the event someone doesn't know my first name, they definitely have an idea of who I am. I think it is really great that the staff makes such an effort. Everyone is always so nice, and fun to talk to.. And Phyllis is super cool, she always makes everything as convenient as possible for anyone who comes in, which I think is awesome.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2011,5/23/2011,149,373,29,14,16>It was disgusting, absolutely disgusting.  No not the food.  The pathetic way I walked as fast as I could without jostling my bag of indian goody delights as I made it back to the car.  Then the frenetic driving back home (a good 8 minutes away) while trying to keep the speed under 80.  I wanted it THAT bad.  I ran into my home, yanked everything out and went to town.Imagine me, still in my work clothes, sitting on a couch stuffing globs of naan in my mouth while the cats sat next to me whining and scratching at my legs for a good welcome home pat (I'm lying to myself, they really wanted a good welcome home heap of fancy feast in their bowl).  I ignored them and continued to shovel the chana masala (curried garbanzo beans), shahi paneer (butter paneer cheese?), and aloo ghobi (curried potatoes and cauliflower) into my mouth.  The perfectly cooked jasmine rice was so fragrant I nearly choked as I dumped the spicy onion chutney onto my chana masala.  The entire large vegetarian combo with side of naan and chutney was gone within minutes.  The only thing left?  A reusable to go container and sense of guilt that I probably consumed at least 800 calories in less than 10 minutes.  Mind you, I said guilt and not remorse.  I certainly do not regret consuming that delicious meal and I am planning to do an 8 mile run on Wednesday solely for the purpose of eating that same meal again tomorrow.  Damage control.  I don't know what else to tell you.  It cost me $10 and change to get a large veggie combo with a side of naan.  You can't get that anywhere.  If you can, tell me where.  The only way you can get it cheaper is if you cook it yourself.  Honestly, I doubt my cooking skills can recreate Mati's curries.  I can't believe anybody could complain about portion size or price here.  Do you seriously need 1000+ calories in a meal?  Maybe, but probably not.  I am stuffed to the max and i'm no dainty little girl.  Is it more expensive than a Double Bypass "I'd like to supersize it" en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me value meal?  Probably by $4 bucks.  But the trade off is you're getting real food.  You think vegetarian food is "rabbit" food?  Then go for the 5 other meat options that are available.  But trust me, their curries are far more flavorful than any rabbits out there have tasted.  Why are you still reading my mindless drivel?  Go get yourself some Mati's.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/20/2010,5/22/2011,434,368,9,14,8>Freakin love this place! Usually I order the carne asada fries late at night through the 24 hour drive thru when I'm inebriated, however I had the pleasure to dine in during the day last week. The service was quick and the food came out piping hot. I ordered a chicken quesadilla from here for the first time and it was massive. One of the luxuries of dining-in is the endless supply of pico de gallo aka salsa which I smothered all over that quesadilla. It was so big, I took it home to eat for dinner! My friend also got an order of the carne asada fries to share and it was bomb. com. The carne asada here is seasoned hella well and it's so damn tasty! Also love the fact that they use skinny fries that hold it down and don't get all mushy and turn into mashed potatoes at the bottom of the container. I don't know what they put in the food here, but I crave it about once a week. Come during the day and grab a booth early because seating fills up! Come through the drive-thru late at night and watch out for the drunk people who like to "walk-thru" and rub up on your car! (Long story)
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2008,10/1/2008,903,380,9,13,9>Mmmmmm......Savory Fried Chicken!  This place makes me want to invite over tons of relatives I barely know, sing karoake, and relive all of Manny Pacquiao's fights!!  The fried chicken is GOOD.  The grilled chicken is EVEN BETTER. The BBQ sauce on it is....well....savory. You'd think the dipping sauces aren't necessary, BUT they are too good  not to use.  Sweet and sour sauce are usually just OK. This one I wanted to put it on everything.  The gravy that comes with the fried chicken compliments the chicken perfectly.  The fried rice was also surprisingly good.  All the flavor of fried  rice was there,  yet the rice was still as fluffy as steamed rice.  All this and the place is a great value too.  I'd say the best way to do it is order for a group and share some half chicken combos so you can try the different sides.  I'm tempted do that even when I go just by myself!!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/10/2007,9/29/2008,28,66,1,6,5>Paradise Grill is legit! Once again, I thought it was going to be shady because the menu was so extensive and the place was pretty barren, but it turns out that everyone was eating in the bar area to watch Monday Night Football.We started with the hibachi chicken lettuce wraps which I thought to be above average. The hibachi marinade was really good and so was the pineapple slaw that accompanied the lettuce cups. It also came which two dipping sauces and a side of asian noodle salad to thrown in there as well... yummy! For dinner I just got the wedge salad which was excellent as well with tomatoes, gorgonzola crumbles, cucumber, bacon and candided walnuts and I got it with a side of champagne vinagarette... ... really good!! Although I didn't try the burger it looked pretty big and cooked to order. Jimmy D was complaining about the bun which appeared to be a little stale. Another plus to this restaurant is that Mon-Wed is $3 pints, bottles, and well drinks... all day! Pretty legit if you ask me. As for service, it was a little slow and the waitresses seemed a little young and ditsy.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2007,9/28/2008,56,44,,7,6>So much praise, so little time!  I absolutely love this place for breakfast.  I have to say that unlike most of the of the reviewers, I have never had any of their cakes.  However, I have tasted my fair share of their other baked goods, including my personal favorite, the apple danish - ah, to die for!  Location/Ambiance:The perfect location for me as it is located about 10 minutes by foot from my house.  It is a cute place with a real Austrian feel to it.  Service:They only provide counter service which can be a little slow on busy days (Saturday and Sunday mornings from my personal experience).  The staff is nice and friendly and they actually remember what you order if you go there often enough - I really like that.Food:Okay, so let me start with the sweet baked AM pastries.  I love the danish.  I know that I said that already but I really do.  It is so good.  I have tried the cheese, apple, peach and strawberry - all delicious.  The croissants are also tasty - my personal favorite is the chocolate - flaky pastry covered in melted chocolate with white chocolate shavings - again, delicious.  The savory croissants are also good - my personal favorite is the spinach and quark cheese - cold or heated it is really good.  As I mentioned earlier, I love to eat breakfast here.  I always order the same thing - the breakfast pizza.  The foundation is their homemade pizza crust (the best!) topped with ham, turkey, turkey sausage (I think), bacon, egg, cheese and tomato.  I am getting hungry just writing about it.  The crust is brushed with butter as it is cooking in the oven - absolutely heavenly!  My husband always orders the medi pizza which also looks good but I love the breakfast pizza so much that I just can't get myself to order anything else.  On my hungry days (and they come often) I also order a bowl of their homemade soup.  The last time I was there it was cream of asparagus with crumbled bacon, chive and cream on top - it was so good!Value:The patries are fairly priced between $1.50+ and $2 something.  I also had the pastries at Ciocolat (as it is very close to where I work ) and I have to say that it does not compare in taste or value.To Return or Not To Return:Yes - again and again - every weekend in fact!If you haven't had the chance to have breakfast at Konditorei, do yourself a great big favor and wake up a little early and head on over to Davis.  You won't be disappointed.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/28/2007,9/27/2008,156,217,6,6,6>Newly opened, and already on life support? Do they deserve it, I wonder?I've passed Sac City Pizza at least twice everyday since moving five blocks to the east of the cinder-block building that used to be Milano's Pizza on Sutterville. Now that I'm living in a neighborhood that doesn't really have a name (I mean, even the Carleton Tract behind this place has "Carleton" signs welcoming you on 21st Street), I've been looking for something to boost my neighborhood pride, so I'd have been curious about this place even if it was still Milano's. The impending grand opening made me especially interested. That "COMING SOON" sign was up forever, and I'd often see a man in the front patio working the power-tools during their remodel. It was really looking like some kinda big production leading up to a gala event...maybe a live band, one of those big spotlight things in the parking lot...some kinda pizzazz. But then it just sorta opened without any hullabaloo whatsoever.So, for the last few weeks since it opened, I always crane my neck as I drive by to see the parking lot. YIKES! Completely vacant again!?!? Perhaps this stretch of Sutterville is only good for opening up the throttle to power across the overpass. I guess this is a tough location after all.Last night, I was feeling extreme pity for seeing the parking lot empty again, so I split during halftime to pick up a pie. It was 6:30 on the Thursday night...what should be the thick of the dinner rush. I walked into total desolation. The owner/operator was sitting at the counter reading the newspaper, seemingly startled by the sound of the door latching. He excited sprung to his feet and greeted me.I was kinda in a hurry to get back to the second half of a basketball game on TV, so I quickly glanced at the menu. What jumped out immediately was that there were several combinations of what I call "weirdpizza." Surely not NY-style or Chicago-style, but maybe like the more creative combinations you might have eaten at the California Pizza Kitchen (or perhaps you've seen them in the frozen section). Hey, I'm no pizza snob who thinks everything has to aspire for traditional NY-style crispness or Chi-town heaviness. Pizza is an American food, and pizzamakers are endowed with the liberty to bake up anything they damn well please on flat dough. You probably do need to have that attitude at Sac City Pizza. So, don't come here on your strict pizza-traditionalist high horse.I did notice that you can order more ordinary pizzas, but I thought I'd try one of these creative ones, so I got the BBQ chicken pizza which had gouda cheese and cilantro. It was $15.50 for a medium, which was 12" in diameter. An okay deal. I am admittedly leery of pizzas with BBQ sauce on them. Before I gave up my own "What pizza should and shouldn't be" hang-ups, I thought anything other than tomato-based sauce was crossing the line. But y'know what....This was pretty good!The gouda was hiding within the layer of mozzarella, and these were like smoky little flavor bombs. The chicken chunks were liberal enough, and the cilantro was perfectly complimentary. The crust was nothing to complain about...certainly edible enough, but perhaps the least distinguished thing about this pizza.So, I think you and your friends should go try Sac City Pizza and try out the environment. Maybe bring a buncha friends, or else you might feel lonely. Just as I was leaving, three people sat at a table and looked at me like, "Where are you going?" They seemed pretty concerned.There's a handsome-looking salad bar there, but nothing was in it because salad doesn't sit well for long if no one comes out to eat it. So maybe eventually, this place will have a nice salad bar going.The remodel looks pretty good, even with the obviously fake brick walls (which I like!) and the trellissed ceiling (a wonderfully weird touch!). It sure doesn't look like the owner got his ideas watching "Trading Spaces"...That's a plus!!! Beer looked limited to a few bottles of Corona in a fridge. That's all I saw, but there might be more.Delivery is advertised on the sign. I didn't get a sense that anyone was ready to deliver anything, though. Also, if you're looking for a job, they have applications outside by the door.I might suggest to the owner that I hook up some live bands to play a show there. It might bring 40-50 hungry people out. I just feel duty-bound as a walking-distance neighbor to breathe life into that place. It's just so sad and quiet right now.I might upgrade my 3-stars with later pies. I'll keep going back.UPDATE: Their new sign was damaged in the windstorm, and the place has closed earlier than posted hours a couple times since I went. I went there to eat and see a Kings game, and found it closed. Surely the new owner didn't pour all this remodeling effort into nothing, so I suspect some other extenuating circumstances are causing this. Call before going to make sure they're open!
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/25/2008,9/25/2008,37,32,4,10,6>Au Lac Veggie is GREAT. When my meat loving boyfriend suggested we try the vegetarian Vietnamese restaurant by the Colonial, I had my reservations. But much to my surprise, Au Lac was fantastic...much better than Andy Nguyen's on Broadway. The first time we went to Au Lac, we were blown away. The soup is great, the egg rolls are fantastic and the Veggie Chicken and Potato Curry is AMAZING. If the fake meat is too close to the real thing for you, they also have tofu sauteed with fresh veggies and several other non-fake meat dishes to try.Only two people work here so sometimes service is a little slow but they are always nice and accommodating. They also do to-go orders.We now eat here about once a week and encourage all our friends to try it out!
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2007,9/24/2008,40,133,5,9,10>I wanted to hate Dave.  Mainly because I didn't think it was possible to get much better than my last stylist (who I still adore, by the way, no hard feelings there).  I looked at these other reviews and thought, "Well no $hit your hair feels healthier, it always feels like that when you get out of the salon."  Well, here I am, 3 days after Dave colored and cut me.  I've washed my hair twice and taken the deadly flat iron AND curling iron to it and it's as healthy and silky as ever.  WTF did he do to it?  AND.  I got an all-over red color put on it.  Never before have I been able to wash my hair after going red, without it looking like I had killed a small animal in my shower.  But this time - hardly any of the color washed out!  Again, Dave, WTF did you do to my hair?At first, I was a bit worried over the cut.  Thought it was too short, didn't fit my face right.  But after I washed and styled it, I keep checking myself out in the mirror and marveling.  That boy did just what I asked.  For FORTY DOLLARS less than my last stylist.  He also spend a ton of time on my hair, rather than mashing me in with one or two other clients.  That rocks my world.Oh, and he did a tremendous job on the color.  In prior experiences, the stylist didn't take the time to make sure all of my hair was one color (it usually looked lighter red at the roots, even ON the day of the appt).  Dave pulled it off - he picked the exact color to match my skin tone and eyes and the color is consistent and natural-looking.Damn you for being so awesome, Dave.  Can I still come over for a BBQ and to meet your birdies, please?
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2008,9/23/2008,95,282,5,7,7>For me, Middle Eastern food is like alcohol to an alcoholic.  I can't stop eating once I've started.  The Mr and I went here to celebrate his graduation a few months ago, although you would think we were celebrating eating for the first time.  We shared the hummus, which came with olives and it was delicious.  B had kibbe for the first time ever and really enjoyed it.  I had a bite and you could taste all the flavours in the savoury loaf.  I had a chicken pita and we shared the baklava - it was the best thing I ate that month.After dinner we went to Target and shuffled around because we could barely move.  Malouf's is the kind of place where you need to go straight home after so your couch can support your bulging belly instead of your waistband.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2008,9/22/2008,20,35,1,8,6>We stopped by to check out this place after driving by several times.  We had originally gone to get a burger, cause we'll try a new burger anywhere we can find one.  To our great surprise, this place goes WAY beyond burgers. Everything is made to order and they have everything....Burgers, Hot Dogs, Gyros, Chicken Pita, Fries (all types), Nachos, well, you get the idea.  Anyway, after reviewing their extensive (and may I add, well priced) menu. We quickly changed our minds on the Burgers.  We ordered a Gyro, a Chicken Pita, Chili Cheese Fries and a Cheese Dog.  Being Greek, we've had Gyro all over the place..this place is the best one in Sacramento (Their only competition would have been Cafe Europa, but sadly, that is no longer around).  Moving on, the meat was perfectly sliced and cooked. Crispy and delicious, just as it should be.  It comes with Tzatziki, lettuce, tomato and onion.  As a nice surprise, they sprinkle Feta cheese on top as well as giving you some on the side along with Kalamata Olives and some Pepperccinis. My Chicken Pita was great as well. It was served the same way and the meat is strips of marinated chicken breasts.  By the way, the Tzatziki was also really tasty! It was made with thick yogurt, just how it should be, and wasn't over bearing or runny, just perfectly mild and delicious.Now, as some of you may know, its always a risk when ordering a Chili-based item at a new restaurant.  Well, the chili here did not disappoint.  It was flavorful, but not heavy as some chili's can be.  They make their chili fries in a kind of different way.  There is shredded cheddar then the chili and then its topped with Spicy Nacho sauce.  I opted out of the Nacho sauce, and they were still delicious, so really, its what you feel like.Last, but not least, the hot dog....This thing was awesome.  We got the cheese dog. It was a good size steamed beef hot dog topped with cheese, mustard, onions and a couple slices of tomato.  Its served on a poppy seeded bun and was REALLY good.  The service was excellent and friendly.   The place is clean and new. The husband and wife team that own and run this place are native Chicagoans. The wife is a 1st generation greek -american, which could account for the excellent greek treats on the menu. The husband, (really nice guy) was cooking at the grill.  This family has brought the best of Chicago dogs and fast food to Sacramento for our enjoyment. I thank them for it!

Cheese glorious cheese.  I weep for those with serious lactose intolerance.  It is thick and crispy right on the rim.  Have your Lactaid handy, just in case.- the meat: who knows were it is under that orange goodness.- the right amount of lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, and condiments.- Bread.  Sturdy enough to hold all this in.Ah, how I could I forget: the fries.  Cut fresh every day.  Not that shoggy sh*t like In-and-out.  Negatives: - the fact that you have to wait your entire lunch hour. In the middle of nowhere. - Also the fries are never ready until they see your face.  - That parking lot is just a joke too [Fruitridge location].  Maybe one day, there will be a window of opportunity where I drive by and there will be no lines.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/1/2010,4/19/2010,642,604,3,8,7>Here is a secret gem of a business that few may be aware of. If you are a collector of or have an interest in rocks & minerals, this is a fun place to explore for beautiful & unusual items at great prices! This building is actually just a warehouse to store the inventory, but the owner Ron is very happy to invite you in as long as you call ahead. You will often find him working away at making jewelry, wands, incense & candle holders, and other mystical/new age items. The usage of recycled metals such as pewter is his specialty. The building is quite old & dirty. But what would you expect for the storage of geological specimens? He also sells quality used & refurbished tools of all varieties. My boyfriend will think of Ron first for the purchase of a particular tool. Ron always backs his products. If there is any problems with an item, he is happy to exchange or refund us!  If you are a flea marketer, you can usually find him selling his wares at either the Folsom Blvd. Flea Market or at the Galt Flea Market. He is always traveling the states to rock & gem shows looking for bargains to sell to his customers that are still quite a deal for us! It is always fun for me to visit his booth at the flea markets or his warehouse. I end up treating myself to some sort of collectible!  But that's just me - a rock hound!
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/3/2010,4/18/2010,61,181,3,5,5>Where else can you find $5 bottomless Mimosas on a Sunday brunch with great food? I'm not sure, but you can find it here at Capitol Garage. Stopped by on a Sunday around noon and the place was jammin! There was a little line out the door, but we didn't have to wait long. The place really isn't that big, and it helps that there's a heated patio.Ordered the Garage omelet (sausage, cheese, tomato, mushroom), and it came with a side of bread, potatoes, and fruit salad. The omelet was fluffy, moist, and not greasy just the way I prefer. For a $20 brunch, I left happy and full. Ask for a take out box and they'll give you a biodegradable, eco-friendly box. Yeah, the ones that decompose quicker than styrofoam. Environmentalists, rejoice. Our sever was great even with the crowd of hungry people in here.Definitely give Capitol Garage a try, considering the number of bipolar-like reviews they're getting; well, at least try their Sunday brunch.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/20/2010,4/17/2010,45,139,6,8,4>What on earth is the big deal about this place? Yes, the coffee is decent. But every single seat in this coffee shop is ripped with duct tape on it. Tacky. And not comfortable. The outlets are placed in weird spots and people with computers have to drape the cord on you or behind you so they can plug their computers in. "Well, hello there. Yes, of course it's okay if you slide your computer cord under my ass while I'm sitting here. Doesn't bother me at all." As for the employees... why is it that the Naked Lounge restaurants always hire all of these cooler-than-thou people to work at them? I don't particularly want to be made to feel like I'm a loser because I don't have my hair cut into 8 different choppy lengths and draped across my face. Or because I'm not wearing skintight jeans and a ratty shirt that I bought at a flea market. Especially when I'm paying (kind of a lot) for a cup of coffee. I dunno... I just don't get it. I'd rather make my own coffee at home, sit on a couch that doesn't have tears in it and not have to worry about whether my clothes are hipster enough for me to not be judged.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/10/2010,4/16/2010,149,559,6,9,8>Short version: The burgers are really good, but the fries are not - order deep fried mushrooms or japaleno poppers (or a corn dog, if you're feeling particularly gluttonous) as a side, instead of fries. And it's cheap.More detailed version: There are very few places where you can get a good $6 lunch. Not a $6 burger plus $2 for bacon, $1 for cheese, $2 for a soda, and $2.50 for fries... $6 for a double cheeseburger with bacon (cooked perfectly) and onion rings on it, a 16oz drink, and fries. Take a moment to appreciate that. You can't get that at Carl's Jr. You might be able to get it at McDonald's... if you find a deal. The menu at Scott's is extensive - a dining companion reports that their tacos are excellent, but I didn't try them. They have all kinds of burgers, chicken sandwiches (grilled and fried), hot dogs, polish dogs,  corn dogs (for just $1!!!), milkshakes, and deep fried miscellaneous delicousness (the deep fried mushrooms are really good). Scott works there, he's pleasant, and he's happy to see you. It's cheap. I know I already said that.Sit outside on the big, clean tables, and enjoy a crazy cheap lunch.  Service can be slow, because there are only two people working, so go on a nice day.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/25/2009,4/15/2010,418,300,11,6,5>Mahoroba is in our neighborhood. Took a family stroll, with a stroller,  to the new japanese bakery in the octogon building. It should spin around. That'd be cool. Like on Mister Rogers. They had some decadent looking pastries under glass. Kobe Creams? An unfortunate name for a pastry. They looked good, though.  I got one for the morning. I also had a delicious sweet tasting french bread thing. My wife got this unusual hot dog in a bun. Looked like a Buick backed over it. She loved it. She also tried some sort of chocolate pudding in a bun. It was a bun with a chocolate smiley face. Too much chocolate for her. I wasn't interested due to the fact i just changed my baby's diaper. The service was top notch and friendly. Attentive. Good vibe. Affable young ladies serving up some sweet pastries and such. We sat out on the patio and watched the weird on Freeport Blvd. This could be habitual for us. Mahoroba Japanese Bakery is a damn fine addition to the Hollywood Park Neighborhood.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/14/2010,4/14/2010,133,189,6,20,12>(Wo)man, oh (wo)man, you absolutely need to try this place! My boyfriend and I went today for their grand opening and it was simply - fantastic.I loved it for many reasons, but the best reason of them all is that I can eat everything in the restaurant without questioning if it is vegan. I had a difficult time choosing something off of the menu because everything looked like it would taste delicious. My boyfriend and I ended up ordering the plate o'vegan nachos, a "chicken" sandwich (I forget the name), a sunshine smoothie, a chocolate dipped chocolate chip cookie, and the entertainer cupcake. My nachos were amazing and the portion size was huge (could easily be shared by two people). The nachos contained daiya cheese, breaded "chicken", faux sour cream, black beans, avocado,etc. My smoothie tasted like one of those orange and vanilla popsicles that I would have as a child, only so much better. The sandwich and the treats were equally delicious.Other reasons we loved sugar plum vegan included (but not limited to):-Pleasant and attentive staff. Great attitudes and smiling friendly faces.-Plenty of seating, indoor and out.-Bike racks right in front.-Great location and welcoming ambiance.I'm very excited to have another all vegan restaurant in Sacramento and I am definitely going to make it a priority to make sure that this place not only stays open, but thrives from both veggies and omnivores alike. So, please get there as soon as possible and show them your support!
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2010,4/13/2010,78,80,6,11,6>This is my new favorite store in Sacramento.  It's full of gorgeous classic English furniture, crystal, china sets, home decor & curio.  Unlike every other antique store I've been to, it's not full of a bunch of thrift-store crap - I literally liked everything in the shop!  By this, you can tell the owners know what they're doing and have excellent taste.My parents are both English, so naturally a lot of the furniture reminded me of our family's heirlooms.  I was impressed by the condition the furniture here was in - absolutely impeccable pieces! I don't think I saw a single thing I thought was overpriced.  In fact, I think the "$$$" that Yelp has given this place is misguided - I'd say it's "Moderate" or "$$".  Seriously, I saw gorgeous classic walnut bars for $300-400 and massive walnut wardrobes for $600-800.  Crystal bowls and serving plates for $20-30.  Commemorative mugs from the Queen's Silver Jubilee for $25. Great value!I also appreciated that all pieces were clearly marked with prices.  It seems like a little thing, but in fact I am generally deterred from falling in love with something without a price tag - too risky, I suppose!I already can't wait to go back - and next time, I'm bringing my mum. She'll love this place!

<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/14/2009,4/11/2010,79,134,5,8,5>If I could live at Brownies, I probably would.  They have everything you need to survive: awesome bartenders who know all the regulars, dice games, tall cans of pbr, jukebox with huge selection of some pretty amazing music, and on a rare night, one of the regulars may even buy the whole bar a round of drinks.  It has plenty of booth, table and bar seating.  Now for the best part... they throw one of Sacramento's best Saint Patrick's Day parties.  There is live music, dancing, Brownie will sing a song or too (which may actually detour people, but it's worth a mention).  5 stars
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/22/2010,4/10/2010,87,69,7,17,12>Charming and wonderful.  The first thing I noticed about Moxie was its unassuming entrance.  Two beautiful, red, stately front doors nestled in a brick front, and small, frosted glass windows on either side.  Brightly lit sconces welcomed us, and above the door black letters on a small brass plaque read simply, "MOXIE".  We had reservations for 6:00 on Friday night.We walked through the door and were greeted and seated immediately by one of several friendly men dressed in all black.  Turns out it was the owner who greeted us.  He was warm and energetic speaking to us like long- time friends.  After looking over a short but delectable menu he came to tell us the specials; each one sounded amazing making our choices difficult.  I felt more like a guest in someone's home than a restaurant patron.  The owner (also our waiter) kept referring to me as the pretty girl with curly black hair and he affectionately poked fun at me too.  =)  I loved it.  But I won't let flattery influence my review, as endearing as it was.  So here's the rest:The food was very good; I had the scallops and my husband had steak.  His steak was perfectly cooked and his mashed potatoes were smooth and flavorful, but my scallops were slightly underdone and the vegetables were too al dente.  That's really my only complaint and it's a minor one.  My dish was still delicious.  The scallops were drizzled in a wonderful sauce.   Dessert was very good, a white chocolate cake with fresh berry sauce.  Our glasses were never empty, dirty plates left immediately and all used flatware was replaced immediately as well.Last, my bill was handwritten in beautiful script.  How unique.  I even saved it.   A common thread in all of my reviews is the level of service because it's very important to me.  Moxie delivered the best dining service I've ever had!
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/27/2007,5/29/2007,66,86,6,2,2>I have had quite a few encounters with chickens.  I've eaten some.  I took field trips to the local farm.  My mom's family fights cocks.  Never has a chicken leapt onto the table I was eating off of.  That is, until Wednesday.We went here for the BF's birthday.  I was aiming to take him somewhere with nice ambience and decent food that was worthy of the A list without having fallen to its own hype - hopefully somewhere he had never heard of.  Then I found Slocum House... score!The patio is awesome.  We felt like we were in anotehr world in there.  There were chickens walking around, as they say, like it ain't no thang.    A rooster jumped on my table.  That's right - a ROOSTER was in my face and would have bought property there if BF hadn't shooed him away.  It was totally worth the 70 bucks I spent.  My brother-in-law warned me that the house itself "looks like an old lady house" and I'd be better off outside.  I was hoping that when placing the reservation the hostess would gather that a reservation for two for dinner in the middle of the week would be for a special, romantic occasion and would give us the most romantic table they had .  I thought we might have been in it until I saw another couple walk in ten minutes after us and sit in a secluded table at the edge of the patio.  I was bummed out for a while, but BF insisted he liked our table by the fountain better.  Well, he does like the sound of running water....Our appetizer truly shined: Cubed ahi tuna with tobiko relish in a wafer-thin fried cone.  The presentation was fantastic.  The cones were suspended from steel "stairs" over the sesame dip, which was in a scallop shell in a bed of glassy black pebbles in a square, jet black dish.  It was divine.  I [heart] tuna.BF and I mirrored each other with the cream of chicken soup, which was, as BF put it, "pretty good" without being remarkable.  I loved every drop of it nonetheless.Our entrees, while good, were quite short of spectacular.  BF had a basil stuffed chicken with polenta and green beans.  It was pretty good at first, but he later admitted that he got bored with it toward the end.  I had the king salmon with dungeness crab and shrimp.  They were served over a patty of rice accompanied with seasoned shredded carrots and the most perfectly-cooked asparagus I had ever eaten.  It was BF's special day, so I insisted he have a good portion of my spears.  It took me forever and a day to finish because I too, for whatever reason, got bored.For dessert our server recommended the chocolate croissant bread pudding.  It was also very good, but we weren't blown away.  All in all, the food was a notch above good.  We were relaxed and exceptionally happy with the ambience.  I loved sitting there as the sun went down and the little christmas lights lit the garden - it really is a romantic place.  The BF was so amused by the chickens wandering around the patio we took a dozen pictures of them and none of us as a couple.  Oh well - mission accomplished.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2007,5/27/2007,63,181,,6,3>I drive the hour and a half from Oakland to Sacramento to get my hair cut and colored by Dana. I've done this for 2 1/2 years. Prior to living in Oakland I resided in Santa Cruz for 4 years and also gladly made this 3 hour drive for Dana. I've followed Dana from Salon Cuvee to Details to her current home (of 4 years, give or take) at Lush Salon. I make this drive on average, once every 7 weeks. Not so big a deal, especially with a fully loaded iPod, a bunch of new music and some big love for the "open road" (interstate 80) and bridge tolls.  While I'm at it I plan some time with good friends who are still in the area. I make an enjoyable day or weekend of it.I get asked all the time 'round the Bay where I get my hair cut. In week 6 of a grown-out short or midlength cut I still get asked. Usually the inquiries stop at "Sacramento" but I've also watched two people write down her name and the name of the Salon on paper. I've been long(er), mid-length, and very short. With and without bangs, with and without layers. I've been I don't know how many single colors and mixtures of highlights both lighter and darker than my natural dark brown. She does short, textured cuts very well and also gets how to do sexy as opposed to cute mid-length cuts (none of this bob stuff, please). She will advise against when appropriate ("Your hair will fall out" - when one visit I spontaneously suggested a perm -- something I haven't "enjoyed" since 1978) and can also nudge me into switching gears completely. I've never regretted switching gears. But that's partly her skill and my hardwiring. Thank gawd I'm just not one of those females whose world comes crashing down when an extra inch is taken off. If it were done badly, maybe? But that's where Dana's skills come in so guess I'll never know.I'd say she does the best with mid-length and short cuts. If you have, and have always had, really long hair and like to take an inch off every month -- two when feeling emboldened -- don't put the miles on your car. Keep her schedule open for the rest of us.

<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/13/2007,5/25/2007,50,108,6,4,3>So my 13 year old daughter and I are tooling about Elk Grove one Friday night before the show and I ask her where she wants to eat and she says how bout TGI Fridays and I say OK praying to God that they'd be lined up out the door. (Which is to say I could open a garbage dumpster on a Friday night in Elk Grove these days and people would still wait an hour to eat) Sure nuf there's an hour to an hour and a half wait so forgedabouit!     So we head up to Bruceville and I look over (please please don't say "How bout Hometown Buffet Dad? cause we're NOT in Oregon or the deep south) and I see this place with fogged up windows that says Nathan's Chinese. Well being that my son whose 16 is named Nathan and he's not chinese I figured what the heck so Laura and I roll in to the parking lot and go inside.      I must say they finally figured out a way to get Chinatown in SF over to Elk Grove cause everyone looked up and my daugter says Daaaaaad they're ALL chinese. Oh sweet lemon chicken we found it! SO we sits down and the second thing my daughter notices is there's an aquarium on the back wall and look they're netting the fish and (5 minutes later) look there's the fish (THE WHOLE FISH) on a plate on the table next to us. VERY COOL. Well we only end up eating the standard chinese fair but I must say it was some of the best Lemon Chicken (not gloppy sweet, you could actually taste the lemons) and fried rice I've had.      Bummed about the egg foo young though. We used to eat upstairs on Main street in Lodi and they made this egg foo young that was crispy, brown little mountains with a brown sauce that you'd want to pour in your pockets and take home? But alas the owner sold out and the new owners....well I don't eat there anymore, now we go to Nathans....
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/21/2007,5/24/2007,574,469,5,3,2>The difference in this place in the day vs. night is like, er... day and night. Sorry I had to go there. But it really is. The difference is astounding. Really, it's an entirely different restaurant in the day than it is at night, and vice versa. You get it.In the day, my experience has been rather craptastic. I went there by myself first, and it was okay, no fireworks or anything, but edible and OK. blah. Service was equally remarkable. Moaning of mediocrity.then, being the fabulous family member that I am, I brought my Mom and sister there and it was actually awful. The service was non-existent, actually, until I basically communicated to the counter person that I was pissed. I mean, I brought the troop here. Embarrassing. Food was good, not great.However, at night, I brought one of my ex-guy friends there (he's worthy of a whole different kind of review) expecting it to be mediocre (which he's deserving of) and it was actually fantastic. The prices at night are about three times what they are during the day. But, for me, I'd rather pay and get attentive service (check!) and decent meal (double check!)... and free drinks (no way-they'd charge you for a side of salt if they could!). But two out of three is not bad, especially when the third item is totally out of line, but expected nonetheless.I don't know what's wrong with me. I just don't want to pay for fountain drinks. In reality, it costs like .02 cents per glass. So even if Cokezilla comes in and gets twenty refills, they still make over 400% profit when they charge 2 bucks per glass. If that math was wrong I don't care, they're mean bad people to make me pay that much without giving me a souvenir glass or a shot of something to accompany it. (4th St Grille charges an outrageous amount, as does hard rock cafe. Don't buy soft drinks from them. They don't have any decency and they're bad people to charge over 2 bucks for a stupid soda that they barely refill. You have to demand the damn refill to get it. That should go on my things that piss me off list.)Anyway, go here at night. Ex-male friend and I paid, or no, I should say I paid about 48-50 for the two of us, with Ex-male friend drinking enough for both of us and the table next to us. Why shouldn't he, it's free for him...By giving this place three stars though, it doesn't stress how bad my experience was in the daytime. But I like to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. I'm a sweetheart like that.

<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,1.0,4/24/2007,5/22/2007,19,66,,,9>EDIT 7/10/07: As I have now been 86'd from the Rube for a minor infraction for which I apologized profusely (and it wasn't *that* big of a deal, I've done waaaay worse) the Rube and I are no longer friends.  In fact, I'm really hurt.  For the LOVE OF GOD whatever you do never walk in this place with an outside drink....Considering what is smoked out back regularly I hardly found what I did worthy.  Oh well.  Nice knowin' ya Rube. *************************************************The Rube.  Where do I begin?  It's impossible for me to write an objective review in any way shape or form.  Once the dust had settled on my divorce and I had settled into Midtown I decided to take myself out and get a life.  I didn't know a soul in Sactown.  I didn't have a clue (some might argue that is still the case.)  But one Friday I got tired of sitting around staring at 4 beautiful Victorian walls...I walked myself down to the Rubicon.  It looked friendly, a mixed crowd of families, drinkers, people of all ages.  It felt very Midtown, eclectic.  I walked in, sat on a stool, ordered a beer, and got a life handed back to me.  Seriously it was that easy and I still pinch myself...because I was one lonely sad sack.  By the end of the evening I had friends and an invite to a party the next day.  By the end of that party I had my BFF and her BFF to call a posse and it's like we've known each other forever.I love the Rube on a rainy Sunday to drink beer and watch the rain through the big windows; maybe play a round or two of dominos.  Help Carrie grade papers or read a book.  But you never get much done because you always see a friend.  The food isn't my favorite and I don't know why.  Because I can't say I've ever had anything that wasn't good and they certainly try with some cool specials.  The onion rings are a greasy catastrophe of yum (if you like onions, if not why are you ordering them?) and I've always enjoyed the chickie sammie.   Maybe I just feel there are more interesting meals to be had.   The service...indifferent.  Some of the girls are really sweet and great but some could kinda care less, I think it's their shtick and I'm cool with it.   The bartenders however are great!  Even when I forget to pay and return the next day like a loser they're totally cool about it...sadly this has happened a few times. Pint Nite has gotten too crowded for me, but I understand why.   $2 for Rube beer is awesome.  I'm a fan of the Monkey Knife Fight, the red, and the IPA.   For what the Rubicon is...a neighborhood brewpub with food it does it damn well.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2007,5/21/2007,12,20,6,3,2>In a somewhat tucked away area just past all the old McKinley Park houses is this small deli and grocery store.  It sits opposite the old cannery-cum-office park on Elvas/C Street.  As I understand it, the building was originally dedicated to being a butcher shop beginning in the the 1930s.  I think it has been different incarnations of corner store-type markets over many years since that era.  I've always remembered some sort of market there as I've decided to take the "Elvas route" into midtown when traveling in from eastern parts of Sacramento.  I never bothered actually going inside the place until I heard maybe 2 years ago that they started making sandwiches and serving "deli food" there.The place is a pretty basic unassuming white building from the early 20th century small-corner-store-ilk with bare concrete floors.  For some reason, the bare concrete floors thing really impresses me (but so does Etch-A-Sketch technology).   Maybe it adds to the old-time kind of feel of the place.  The grocery store aspect to it really seems more like a liquor store sans the actual liquor.  I think they might have wine and beer, but it doesn't stand out prominently, at least to me.  The Methadonians don't seem to make it out that way to that shop anyhow.  It's mostly the business park folks, families from the adjacent neighborhood, or random tortilla machine repair technicians that you'd see in there.The sandwiches are pretty good.  It's a somewhat standard selection of meats, breads, cheeses, and the other typical "sandwich stuff".  They've got a few really meaty sandwich combinations that I would think of as a standard New York deli sort of thing.  In fact, the guys that make your sandwich usually remind you of somebody from New York City.  Dunno, maybe that's just me - "And what would dis young man like?  Huh?  How 'bout yous, young lady?"  And this is coming from guys in their 20s and 30s.The regular-sized sandwich will probably fill up even most guys, unless they are totally high with the munchies, in which case they might be disappointed.  If that were the situation, they would have probably already cleared out your cupboards of anything immediately edible (remember, no time for prep time!) or be looking to land a side of hippo anyhow.  If this were the case, they can always upgrade to the largest sized sandwich, in which I would recommend wearing a hard hat and elastic-band pants before eating.I think the typical price puts your regular sandwich at around $5.50 to $7.  Snag a drink and a pasta salad, and you still might get out of there for less than $10.  As a bonus, there is a small bench and a pay-phone (!!!!) outside for your convenience.  Or, better yet, you can cruise down to McKinley Park with your sandwich and watch the squirrels mate (with each other, I hope) like I sometimes do.

<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/4/2007,5/19/2007,65,28,2,8,4>I love the old couple that owns this place. They make you feel like you're running around loose in their closet, well, I guess you kind of are. Some of the costumes are a bit beat up and warn out, but if you want to pretend you're in a mariachi band with ten of your best friends, or dress up like some freaky bunnies for Easter; they've got you covered. One Halloween I wanted to be Liza Minnelli circa 1972 from Cabaret and they fixed me right up. Plus it's a nice feeling to support your small business man and woman.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2013,4/12/2014,151,185,10,18,11>I'm not a spa girl.  Let me repeat, I'm not a spa girl.  I hate the idea of going to the spa, I hate the idea of anyone touching me, I tense up, I can't relax, it ends up being more of a chore, so I just don't go.  With that said, 2 years ago my best friend got me a gift certificate for this place.  I honestly thought I lost the gift certificate.  I ended up finding it last week, and I thought what the heck, I'll get a facial, and my brows need some help so why not?I made an appointment online, which was super easy.  When I got there, the receptionist was super nice, she showed me to a locker and gave me a robe and slippers. She told me I will be getting a shoulder massage and at this point I'm freaking out, cause that's not what I scheduled, I just wanted a facial and my brows done, but whatever. Then she showed me to the serenity room where she brought in a warm tub of water to soak my feet in.  At this point I'm impressed.Heather was my aesthetician, she made me feel really comfortable. This was the most relaxing facial I've ever had.  She did massage my shoulders, arms, feet, and legs, not something I was expecting.  Because of Heather, I think I'm transforming into a spa girl!
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2014,4/11/2014,174,424,8,17,15>I like this place a lot-great food and good atmosphere. Mediocre service.I like the a-la-cart concept, I think it's cool. I've enjoyed everything I've tried. Ribs haven't been as good as they were my very first time here, but maybe I drank a lot and have delusions of that night, who knows. I appreciate the different beers they offer and the seasonal selection.Service is just eh. Someone snapped at our group because we were close to the kitchen door. While I understand the safety concerns and don't make a habit of doing this, there was no where else for us to stand and order beer while we waited for a table.There aren't a lot of places to sit inside, so if the heaters aren't working outside, you might have to wait a while.I definitely recommend for the food and beer. Service could be better though.Come for the food.. and talk dirty mac n cheese to me ;)
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,4/10/2014,199,139,8,17,13>What's not to love about this place? I know my wife works hard throughout the day taking care of our four year old son and looks forward to a jolt of  caffeine from time to time. At Java Mama, she can enjoy a cup of coffee or chai tea (in peace) while my energetic son is playing with the other kids in a supervised play area.I am not a coffee drinker, but I felt right at home in this cozy shop. I had a chance to chat with the owner  (Rachel)  , and am hoping that her shop lives up to its enormous potential. She is smart, passionate, and is fantastic in a customer facing role. Her energy and smile is contagious , and it has seemed to rub off on the rest of the staff. As a father, I wouldn't mind taking my son here to play on those rare days when mom just needs a break. However, chances are my wife may already be here enjoying her favorite drink.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2013,4/9/2014,755,162,13,29,22>My 100th review! What better place to review than my now alma mater. I recently graduated after spending 4 1/3rd years as an undergrad.UC Davis has always been in the shadow of its bigger and more prestigious schools, UCLA and Berkeley, but really, the UC system is chalk full of top-notch schools. More recently, the university has been moving up in terms of ranking, matching and even surpassing UCSD in some reviews. It always has been a consistent top public school in the country as well.The campus is HUGE! Unlike other universities where everything is built upwards, Davis is flat and everything is spread out. There's a reason why most students decide to bike or long board. Getting from one end of campus to the other could take up to 30 minutes! The campus is beautiful as well. Davis prides itself on being green, so there are trees and flowers everywhere. The campus is extremely well kept.Professors here are great too! Most professors are engaging and insightful in their lectures. Keep in mind that your experience with professors may vary depending on class and major. Tip for current undergrads: go to office hours! There's always something to do here. The university offers thousands of student jobs and internships. If that's not the thing for you, there are also hundreds of fraternities and clubs for basically every interest possible. If you can't find the club you're looking for, $5 and 5 people is all you need to start your own!There are hundreds of events hosted by UCD all throughout the year from Pajamarino to the famous Picnic Day. People from all over come to these epic events.If you are a prospective student, UC Davis could be your school. The place really grows on you. I made this decision 4 years ago and it was the best decision that I have made! GO AGS!Note: a lot of people think it smells like cow all the time. It does sometimes and only in certain areas of campus. It's honestly not a problem whatsoever.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2013,4/8/2014,519,131,26,23,17>SWORD BOOBS - I'll explain more laterBut now that I've got your attention, let me tell you about one of the best meals I've had in SacYou walk into the dark, sketchy storefront between a liquor store and a Good Will. It's like the tent Harry Potter goes into before the Quidditch world cup - the inside is larger and brighter than the outside would suggest. You immediately notice the intricately carpeted walls/floor and interesting lanterns on the roof. It's exactly like the mobile Turkish war-room tent you saw at the Smithsonian that one formulative summer. You allow yourself to be wordlessly guided by a tall man in a pointy red cap and snazzy Moroccan attire to a low-slung bronze table. Sinking into the incredibly soft cushions, you look around at your fellow dining companions. The billowing tent of a room is rectangular -- forcing you to make eye contact with quite a few of the young to middle aged couples. The place feels more like a lounge than a restaurant - you are refreshed by the format of the place already. The piping, bumping, and pumping Arabic music (Sidi Mansour by Saber El Robaee, Ya Tab Tab by Nancy Ajram, as the Shazzam app helpfully informs you) take you to Morocco (North West Africa, as the red capped waiter helpfully informs you). He brings over a large, intricate cauldron and kettle. "Put these towels on your laps! Like everyone else! Okay, hold out your hands!" Handwashing brought to your table? Nice. Don't look at the menu, there's just no point. You came here for the Sultan's Feast ($25.95 per person): 1) lentil soup - tasted like minestrone2) humous + pickled carrots + pita bread - standard but welcome start3) B'stilla - SO YUMMY. Our favorite part of the dinner. Consists of almonds, egg, flaky pastry, and seasoned chicken, all covered in powdered sugar and honey. It yields the most satisfying crunch on first contact.Your red-capped waiter explains, "B'stilla is traditionally eaten on special occasions like weddings and births. It looks like a dessert with the almonds, honey, and cinnamon, but it is not. You eat it before the main course, because it's special and you can appreciate it more when you're not full already. In Morocco, we make pastilla with pigeon. But these have chicken. Pigeons...you have to go catch them, haha!"NOTE FOR VEGANS/VEGETARIANS - Red-capped friend, "Sometimes we get people who are vegetarian. Or even vegans sometimes! We accommodate them. We can make pastilla without meat or eggs."   4) Honey chicken kabob - perfect, perfect char. Really special honey and yogurt sauce5) Beef tagine - cubed tender beef cooked in a sauce with peas. Decent.6) Vegetable couscous - Unremarkable starch that rounds things out. No accident this plate was in the middle, it was the metaphorical middle child of the meal. "Hm? Couscous? Uh oh, honey, I forgot about it and accidentally spilled honey sauce all over it." Without warning, a pulsing beat goes boots-cats-boots-cats and a red cloud moves across your field of vision. It takes a moment to realize it isn't some sort of embolism, and just a belly dancer in a shroud gyrating across the room. She is clearly good at dancing, it is very obvious. Everyone watches her, especially when the finger cymbals, the whip thing, and a sword come out. She balances the sword on her quivering breasts and all the men pull out cell phones to record this. Girlfriends and wives synchronously stare daggers, as metaphorically sharp as any boob sword could be. 7) Baklava and mint tea - flaccid looking baklava but really liked the tea. The red-capped waiter tells you and the neighboring dinners how green tea used to be mainly grown in China, but now Morocco is the biggest exporter. You aren't sure you believe him, but nod along anyway because you're a few beers in and at the end of a wonderful, surreal meal. At the end, the red-capped man tells you to hold out your hands. He then sprinkles orange blossom water. There is unintelligible mumblings about how this smells nice after kabobs etc etc etc. You think about how nice it would be if there were subtitles in real life sometimes. Tips:-At least once, just pretend it's your birthday here   You will get awesome music and some swaggy moves from the staff   Everyone will be staring at you   I cannot emphasize this sufficiently-Reservations suggested-BYOB - liquor store next door, no corkage fee-Ideally max group 4. Otherwise, group will be sort of split. The low round tables have 2 cushions on the ground and seating for 2 or 3 along a bench on the other side. -Belly dancing: men, don't enjoy the sword boobs too much if your wife/gf are around. One guy was dancing along and taking pictures every 5 seconds, his wife was not amused
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/1/2013,4/7/2014,410,518,15,22,17>Location:  On the corner of Howe and Fair Oaks Blvd.Ambiance:  Low lighting, light music, and spacious/semi private booths made date night just a little more romantic with the fiancé.  The food: We chose the items this place is known for!!1.  The corn bread ($7):  It came out warm.  The outside was crunchy and the middle was soft and of a muffin consistency.  The jalapeños surprisingly did not have a kick, but added to the flavor of the corn bread.  It was really yummy.  I enjoyed it so much that I ate the left overs later that night.  And If you know me, I NEVER eat left overs.  It was that good!  Serving size was huge for two people.  Pretty sure it would have been perfect for 2-3 other people.2.  The corn with chili butter ($5):  The presentation was cute.  It was broken up into three chunks for easier eating.  The chili butter was delicious on the corn. Wish there was more slathered onto the corn, but I guess it was so that it wouldn't over power the actual corn flavor. Definitely drool worthy!3.  The prime rib ($32):  I NEVER order prime rib.  But since prime rib is the star of the restaurant at this place I HAD to try it.  The prime rib was humongous!!  But guess what? It was so delicious/melt in your mouth that I killed the mofo!  Ate the whole thing that there wasn't room for dessert!  LOL.  Between the corn bread and this main entrée I was sitting lopsided since I was so full!The food was good, the service was spot on, and the ambiance was exactly what we were looking for.  We'd definitely come back again!  I have to try their ribs!!
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,4/6/2014,2372,454,13,19,18>Evangeline's might be the coolest place in Old Sac. They have every costume you can think of during costume season, and a bunch in the off-season, too. This is the best place to find unique gifts or crap to put around your house.Things usually seem pretty reasonably priced. Their funny magnets and glass-torch animals are $3.99. The costumes are anywhere from $20-$200 (maybe less for some accessories). The staff is really cool and helpful.They have Hammond's chocolates.They have silk elbow gloves all year round.They have glow-in-the-dark and Dia de los Muertes decorations all year.They carry those cool gadgets by Fred.The only downside is that it gets super packed close to Halloween, so I usually try to ask the staff when it's least busy and then come back during that time.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/26/2013,4/5/2014,324,135,8,16,12>This place has really evolved over its short lifespan and, in my opinion, is growing in the right direction. In less than a year, they've added a patio(a Sac summer must-have,) a regular rotation of food trucks and a brewmaster who has crafted some truly delicious pours. They've also resisted the urge to add TV monitors or overpower their patrons aurally by cranking in music overhead. Instead, they've stuck to their vision of creating a space for friends to converse and for beer-lovers to talk to each other about this brewer's current offerings. It's refreshing to have a space where you don't have to scream across the table.As far as the brews go, they always have a good spectrum of light to dark and hoppy to malty. The latest I tried was the deeply rich and raven-y Edgar Allen Porter. Go ahead and quote me: always more! They also sell flights in either 5 or 2.5 ounce pours, which is an excellent choice to provide for anyone who wants to taste the full range without filling up.Now there are rumors that New Helvetia is going to add its own kitchen and expand its indoor seating area. When that happens, the stars are bound to go from 4 to 5 and the competition for any other local brewpub is going to be stiff.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/23/2013,4/4/2014,574,469,24,30,33>Honestly, I went here on my sister's request, and I was not looking forward to it.Lately I have been less excited about going out to eat. I have a case of the blahs, and I don't want to pay to be blah-ed.However, Bacon and Butter stood out from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out. THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT.The restaurant itself is very comfortable and in an old building. I love old buildings. They are so interesting. The staff was more than willing to entertain my constant questions about the strange rooms and features of the building. There was no attitude, which indicates to me, at least, that the staff is happy. I don't enjoy dejected staff. Attitude is everything when it comes to running any business. No one wants to be around a bunch of depressed people. Seriously, if your job sucks that bad, just quit. Anyway, the host was absolutely... VIBRANT. He was very, very, very happy and almost bubbly. I like that. And he was completely with it and on the level. Cool. The waiter was completely attentive, and did not seem more concerned with his outfit than in serving our table. Down to earth is what I dig. The good attitude must have extended to the back of the house, because all of the plates that landed on our table looked like someone cared before throwing them on the line. Everything looked delicious. See Sunny S.'s pictures. Although I do not eat anything made with flour, the pancakes that Sunny and Zoey had seriously tested my commitment to my gluten-free lifestyle. I mean, that HAD to be a test. They were the fluffiest most yummy-looking breakfast food I have seen in a long time.Luckily for me though, my Brussels sprouts, ham hock sweet potato hash and eggs were so delicious that I didn't have to stare at their plates enviously for too long. And Sunny ordered a side of fruit (which was also delicious) to curb my desire to eat some carbs and to inhale my daughter's pancakes. It is worth noting that Zoey, who really cannot be bothered with leftovers (which I recognize is completely my fault,) ravenously devoured her day old pancakes the following day. It really makes Moms happy to see their child enjoying their food. Way to impress the offspring, B&B!The only constructive criticism I would provide is to cook the Brussels sprouts a little longer. But I would still order this item again with hard sprouts because the whole plate was delicious.And I saved the best for last: unlimited Old Soul Coffee. That with the GREAT service, awesome staff in both the front AND back of the house, along with some  very satisfying AND locally-sourced fare earns an easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy 5 stars from me with absolutely NO hesitation. Orphan is good, but B&B is BETTER. And closer to home! I love this place and I love these people. Feels like home. S.W.A.K.I can't wait to get my tail back up in here. Word to Big Bird! I wonder if they are open on Christmas?
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/15/2013,4/3/2014,127,103,8,15,15>Andy's Candy was recommended to me this morning; I was told that they just opened up next door to Temple coffee (I found out from Andy when I stopped in that today was their 2nd day open) and that they feature candy from around the world. Perfect spot for Christmas gifts and a self-treat! :) I was impressed specifically with their plentiful and unique chocolate selection! To my delight, I won a prize from their grand opening special, random customer drawing - they were just as excited as I was that I won! Andy came across as very friendly, genuine, and excited about his new business and sharing his products with his customers. I am looking forward to sampling the assorted selection of specialty candy I received gradually over the next several months and I'm sure I'll return to continue to support this new, local business and share its deliciousness with friends and family.

<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2009,4/4/2009,323,1092,7,10,12>I was looking for a place for dinner a few nights ago and came across Isabel's.  I assumed, based on the fact that nobody had reviewed it for six months that it must be closed.  No business with great Yelp reviews would go six months without someone new trying and Yelping it, right?  But we needed an "I" restaurant, and In-N-Out didn't sound all that appealing, so we persevered and drove over to Isabel's--not such a huge sacrifice since it's relatively close to our house.  And yup, it was open, though we were two of the very few people there.I ordered a salvadoran tamale and a cheese papusa with rice and beans.  The husband ordered the dinner enchilada plate.  Our total: $17, with drinks. Like others have said, the woman behind the counter is really sweet.  You order there and then take a seat.  After we'd picked our table and I'd convinced my husband that it would be rude of him to go play video games while we waited for our food (actually I just told him I didn't have any quarters--lie), she brought us chips and salsa.  The chips appeared to be homemade in that they were inconsistent--some were really good and others were a bit too tough.  The salsa tasted fresh and was fairly mild.I'd never had a pupusa before and didn't really know what to expect, but after gobbing up my first one, I seriously considered ordering another.  It was doughy, but not undercooked, cheesy, but not in a gross oily way.  Perfect.  My tamale was also very good--though it had a high corn to filling ratio.  But I have to say that my favorite thing was the cabbage salad that came along with my food (though not with my husband's).  It's spicy and vinegary and contains several of my favorite flavors.  I can't wait to go back, and with a dinner price-tag under $20 (and leftovers for lunch the next day) I doubt it will take too long.

I had just got done at Ulta and decided to see what else was in the plaza so I found this little gem and was like hmmm I wonder what their prices look like. So I ran around and found of course expensive shoes I love but I wanted cheap black flats..and what did I find? Steve Martin ballet flats with cute little bows for $20! I was stoked!

<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2009,4/2/2009,87,159,1,5,7>Pesto, feta, and sun-dried tomatoes.... enough said. Pieces is great because for a couple bucks you can get a soda which they have a good variety of from simple grape to ginger ale and a big slice of pizza. They also have pesto sticks if you're not really hungry and day old slices that are half priced if you're really broke. Some other things that are good about Pieces is that it's open late and it's clean. You can watch them make the pizza and they have fast service too. A lot of locals promote their events there and the staff there care about the environment and really try to get all of their customers to recycle which is a plus. I would give them an extra star too for all the options of toppings and hot sauces and seasonings you can put on after your piece of pizza is warmed up in their oven. Also, bravo for the "don't be a napkin hog" sign.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2009,4/1/2009,193,552,5,4,5>I've had several cohorts tell me this is their favorite bar in town. While it's not my favorite, I will say it's quality. If you're looking for a good UK pub, then forget about Streets of London and hike the distance down here. They've got a better beer selection (with an excellent collection of steins to chose from), a tamer crowd and a pair of dart boards that you can actually play on without maiming an angry frat boy. Not as big, but that's usually not a problem.Sunday nights provide a quality trivia night, if that's your bag of tea. If you're also a fan of rugby and futbol, then you won't be disappointed. It's a fine place to grab a pint and discuss all things British.
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2008,3/31/2009,66,70,2,6,3>I've been hearing about this place over the last 2 months from various co-workers raving on and on about this place.... and truth be told, it really lived up to the hype.  We went with another reviewer and his family, and made an outing of it.  We've all heard of how these types of Brazilian buffets are served so we couldn't resist trying it.  We went on a Tuesday mid day, so it was really slow. Service was friendly, and very accommodating (we had 3 kids that needed 2 high chairs and a booster).  I really want to comment on what I ate, but damn it, I really didn't know what I was eating other than what animal it was from....lol Staff members would tell me what it is that I'm eating, but I couldn't hear them above the chewing =).  Needless to say, it was all pretty good.  One fond memory of the place was biting into something pork that came off a sword (as I'm writing this, I'm giggling to myself), and pork fat dripped down the side of my cheek... mmmmm pork fat.....  This place was immaculately clean, a complete contrast to what it looks like on the outside...A prime example to never judge a book by its cover. The only complaint I have is that I'd suggest washing it down well with water or your favorite beverage before leaving, because after awhile, it tastes like you've been sucking on a bar of salt....lolThis was a great intro to Brazilian food for my friends and family
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2008,3/30/2009,21,10,6,8,6>Like Cadbury Eggs, eggnog and conversation hearts, all great things in life--including Osaka Ya shaved ice--come and go with the seasons. I was referred to Osaka Ya after incessantly griping to a friend about the lack of legitimate snow cone options in Sacramento. Growing up in Idaho, shaved ice was a way of life, and Sacramento is at least 500 miles closer to Hawaii, right?--so what gives?! Osaka Ya shaved ice melts on the tip of your tongue like pixie dust, but it lingers in the corners of your brain for much longer...For about $2.50 you get a giant serving of sugary ice, formed neatly into a cone shape for greater odds of cup-to-mouth contact than your average messy heap of snow cone. For a dollar extra you can opt to add ice cream (and, frankly, why wouldn't you?), or you could try an authentic Japanese Kintoki cone with sugar water, azuki beans and powdered green tea--also tasty.Between the 10 or so snow cone flavors and five types of ice cream (I am happy to announce they just added banana ice cream to the lineup), it can be difficult to choose a pairing. My favorites are blue rasperry syrup + vanilla ice cream, rootbeer + vanilla, and watermelon + green tea. Once I got overambitious and tried cherry syrup with chocolate ice cream, but it was weird, so now I advise others to adhere to the "keep it simple" philosophy.Osaka Ya's tiny walk-up window can be a little tricky to find--it's smack dab in the middle of a downtown residential neighborhood. But once you're there, the planets align and the universe smiles as the snow cone makers disappear behind their tiny, secretive window and make the magic happen. It's the end of summer, and Osaka Ya snow cones are only available now on the weekends until 4:30 p.m.. As the weather continues to cool they'll be closing down the snow cone window until next summer (the adjoining shop, full of Japanese goodies and a fantastic selection of rice crackers and snacks, stays open year-round). So, if you haven't been yet, I'd actually advise you not to go until next summer. Otherwise, the cravings will be intolerable. I'm currently trying to wean myself away.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/21/2009,3/29/2009,280,194,,4,3>Know who your bartenders are because they make your drinks strong and cheap! If you come here to dance, you're in the right spot. Occasionally douches come from Whiskey Wild, Old Tavern, or Zebra, but for the most part it's a very social scene. Yeah, it gets really crowded sometimes, but that's because it's the shit. Come before 10 and you get in free and have room to dance all to yourself before it gets hecka crowded. This place has a little bit of everything throughout the week. So check your calendar. 80's music has a home here but they pump the electro stuff on the weekends too.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2009,3/28/2009,67,107,3,5,1>I've been here twice and both times I loved it. Excellent atmosphere and the drinks are on point. Bartenders are really friendly and it is just a laid back atmosphere.First time I came on a Wednesday, seems like this is the spot to go to on that night. The week before we went, Michael Jordan was at Mix, so go figure. We got there a little early, around nine, and at this time there was still plenty of people in suits smoking cigars. I had my long sleeve collared button shirt and felt under dressed. But as the night went on the crowd got better and the DJ was on point. We had a great night out on a Wednesday.The second time, we got a booth on a Thursday. We got a deal on a 20 person double booth, and when we showed up we had a VIP host meet us downstairs and escort us up. We felt very special. On top of our VIP host that took care of us, we had a special cocktail server on top of us, constantly pouring drinks and getting us new bottles when needed. They took really good care of us that night. My only complaint was the DJ(s), they sucked. They were some special DJ or two from I think Brazil, but the music they were spinning was not fitting for this place. I tried to hit the dance floor once but not only was it not crowded, we just couldn't dance to what was being played. So overall, I have had many good experiences with Mix, and I am actually heading back tonight!
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2008,8/14/2008,260,392,4,9,4>Shari's Restaurant is spot-on for a late weekend breakfast.  I would've missed this place driving by, but the architecture is a classic diner octagon.  Upon entering, you are greeted by a clean, well-lit interior and the wafting smell of refrigerated pies.The breakfast choices are impressive.  I chose the Cinnama-sation Platter: eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, potatoes and cinnamon-bun French toast.  I upgraded my homestyle potatoes to "stuffed hashbrowns" (hashbrowns filled with cheese and sour cream and topped with green onions and bacon bits).  It was quite the feast.Nothing but good things to say about the service.  Our waitress was fast, refilled my buddy's soda three times, always checked up on us in case we needed anything.  Also, they provide regular, jalapeno, and chipotle Tabasco if you ask (I love the jalapeno Tabasco with eggs).  And the food was surprisingly less greasy than I expected.The breakfast at Shari's is awesome.  I'll be back to try the rest of the menu someday.  Considering they're open 24 hours, I might just have to make this my late-night post-nightlife stop.  This is what Denny's aspired to be before their food became indistinguishable from frozen microwave dinners.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/5/2008,8/13/2008,6,16,,8,4>I wanted to like this place, no , I wanted to LOVE this place.  I wish I could give this 2 reviews, one based on food, which would get 5 stars and one based on service, which would get one star....This new bistro is quite close to my house, so I was eager to try it.  I love to cook and cook with fresh, local ingredients as often as possible (you won't find tomatoes in my kitchen this time of year!).  So when I heard this restaurant used fresh, local ingredients, I was thrilled.  When I walked into the restaurant last Friday night, I was delighted.  It is cute and small, but the kitchen is open, the chefs are load, moving, talking, calling each other "chef" and everything!  I could tell these guys were chefs too, not just cooks.  They had command of the food, testing meat doneness by feel, for example.  All the ingredients looked fresh and smelled great. . . And, as my husband and I waited (and waited and waited some more) for some attention, and then a table, we saw nearly every menu item come out of the kitchen, and it all looked great.When we walked in, there was no hostess, no list.  A very nice lady told us it would be 15-20 minutes.  Groups came in after us and were sat, I started to get annoyed.  Finally, close to 45 mins later, we were sat, but not given menus.  Our server came, apologized and handed us menus.  A few mins later he came back for our order.  We ordered a glass of wine each, a first course and a main course.  It took nearly 15 mins for our wine to come, the server apologized, blamed it on the bar tender.  It took another 15-20 mins for our first course to come, ugh!  And another 10-15 mins for our entrees.  We were pretty much ignored by all wait staff during that time.  The food, however, is out of this world! I had the beet salad, which was amazing, my husband had the potato-cheddar soup, also great.  For entrees my husband had the quail and I had linguine with clams.  One of the best linguine with clams I've had.  We will go back and give this place another try, but only because the food rocked my world.  If they can't figure out the service part, it will probably be our last visit.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/19/2008,8/10/2008,9,33,1,11,6>A recent kids' birthday party at Young Chef's Academy was one of the better celebratory shindigs my kid has been to for a while. Over the years she's gone to bowling, gymnastics, ceramics, swimming, rock-climbing, Libby Lu, Build-a-Bear, Chuck-E-Cheese (my version of purgatory), princess dress-up, roller skating and bounce house birthday parties, and maybe one or two backyard carnivals (what's up with this whole 'can't-have-a-birthday-party-at-home' thing?). The worst one was a birthday party at Toys R Us which was nothing but a blatant exercise in marketing to 6-year-olds by taking them on a 'treasure hunt' through the store and trying to make them Toys R Us consumers for life. Arghh. But this Young Chef's birthday party was a cut above. An energetic young chef ran the class for eleven little girls about 8- or 9-years-old, and he kept them busy, laughing and good-humored while instructing them in some of the finer points of cooking. The menu for this particular party was homemade pasta, marinara sauce, herb butter and garlic bread, and the girls were walked through each recipe with explanations of cooking processes, tool safety and a bit of history. Each child got a nice tall stool around the central stainless steel table, an apron (had to be returned) and a paper chef's toque they decorated themselves. Everyone helped make the marinara sauce, then the kids were split into two groups, with one half making pasta while the other chopped herbs of their choice and mixed them into butter, then they switched so everyone got to make everything. A nice touch was the addition of food coloring to little cups of butter - not sure if it was natural or not but it was colorful -turning them into brightly colored purple, chartreuse and aquamarine spreads. The kids especially liked this part. Finally they were taught how to use real pasta machines, the proper way to feed the dough through, and voila! Pasta! It was cooked pronto by one of the other two helpers - there were three staff members for this party of eleven -  then dished up for the kids. The kids were well supervised at each step of the way. Throughout the class there was lots of laughing, giggling and cooperation, it was obvious they were all having a marvelous time even as they got more and more covered with flour, sauce and garlic butter (or maybe because of that). A cake provided by the parents was brought out at the end, everyone sang Happy Birthday to the birthday girl, and best of all no one had to do dishes.The interior of YCA is bright and appealing, with cheerful pastel colors inset into clean white cabinet in the enviable kitchens. There are two separate and complete cooking spaces, each with a stove, sink, stainless steel table, microwave, dishwasher and even a Kitchen Aid mixer.I can see a few downsides to the YCA: First, it's a pricey place to have a birthday party. At $25 per kid, with a ten kid minimum, you're talking $250 to start. If you opt for the goodie bag plan, you can add another $5 per head to the total. And then each YCA has a retail component full of racks and shelves where they sell cute-looking kids' cooking utensils and accoutrements including 'Yum-o!' products by Rachel Ray.  According to their website, "Yum-o! products are upscale, state-of-the-art line of children's cooking utensils designed especially for Rachael Ray" for a non-profit foundation that 'empowers kids and their families to develop healthy relationships with food and cooking." I have nothing against Rachel Ray and I guess the money from the sales is going to a good cause, but I'm not sure why kids big enough to cook really need a 'tadpole knife', special oven mitts, or fancy red and green cutting boards. Warning - it's all adorable-looking and kids will crave it. Just say "No-o!"But all-in-all this was a fun kind of party and practical too. The kids had a ball and felt proud about eating food they had prepared by scratch. I'm sure they learned from it because it was so intensely hands-on. I'd love to send my kidlet to one of the regular cooking classes or summer camp if it was only a bit closer. I actually wouldn't mind going myself!
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2008,8/9/2008,122,320,,7,2>i haven't been here in a couple of years, but we used to drive to sacramento to eat here when we lived in san francisco.  now that we've moved back, we can't wait to try it out again.  for full disclosure, this review is based on my last experience there:this is by far one of the best dining experiences in northern california!  it's styled as a demonstration dinner, ala emeril live or something, but much, much, classier and with better food.  before dinner starts, you have the chance to chat with the chefs, walk through the kitchen and watch the staff prep for dinner.although the price of the dinner may seem expensive at first, you get much more than what you pay for. not only is the food absolutely gorgeous, if you like a particular dish, you can ask for 2nds or 3rds. the dinner consists of 5 courses, with an "intermission" after the 2nd course - you are lead out onto the patio where an array of fresh oysters, sushi, and other tantalizing cuisine greet you in a courtyard with twinkling lights and luscious vegetation. throughout your meal, chef randall and his staff provide an entertaining commentary (it's seriously a show). moreover, wine is provided at cost! the kitchen is such a wonderfully delicious experience that it is definitely a CAN'T MISS.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2008,8/7/2008,149,559,15,15,13>I really struggled with my decision to review this place. I'm sitting at the Hilltop as I type (free wireless at a bar beats free wireless at a coffee shop any day) listening to two close friends plead with me not to publicize The Walnut... the one place in town you can always go and not run into anyone you knew in high school. But I do it for the good of the Yelp community...The Walnut is brilliant because...You never know what time it is - there are no windows, the doors are always closed and folks are always drinkin' like it's night.You can come in at 10am any day of the week and not feel bad about yourself.The drinks are stiff and probably the cheapest in town - grey goose and tonic for $4There are two bartenders: Loretta and Rick. Rick is a Hawaiian-shirt-wearing, easy-going, heavy-pouring, low-key kinda guy - always looks sunburned and more than happy to tell you about his new fishing boat. Loretta usually looks like she just came from church - pink striped old-lady suit, or a flowing blue new-agey dress. Foul mouthed, and ready to play dice with you for drinks - they bring the party.You can bring in Chinese food from the place next door - it's really good and totally cheap.Extensive vending machine of processed food intensity.The jukebox is internet-based, so you can grab every song in the world... except Weezer's "El Scorcho" and Amy Dalley's "Men Don't Change" for some reason. This is the perfect bar for country music and classic rock - this is not The Park, and hip hop blaring from the jukebox against the wood paneled walls is just obnoxious - really, there is a place for that, but it's not The Walnut. Also, come ready for a cash-only, no frills, no customer service focus watering hole.... this ain't fancy. Last week, I told a group of fancy-pants young Capitol staffers that I simply couldn't take them there because I have a rep to keep up, and they were likely to say some crap like "This is so divey - I love it!" Please mind your manners if you roll through.
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2008,8/5/2008,38,11,5,2,2>I've gotta admit, I was pretty "stoked" to hear that there was a new place to get dawgs in "The Grid".  I've been waiting for something like this "Fer Days".  I mean, Hot Rods on K street was a HUGE let-down for me.  I wasn't just "bummed" about Hot Rods, I was "Hella Bummed".Here comes Capital Dawg to save the day!  I mean, they automatically get a point for spellin "Dawg" correctly!  Naturally, because I'm a scenester in complete denial, I ordered the Downtown Dawg.  Next, I had the choice of grilled or deep fried.  A scolding oil bath makes everything taste better.  When I got it, it was what I had expected.  A hawt dawg.  And, let's be honest with ourselves folks, there's not many ways to cook a hot dawg.  The skin had a snap, it was juicy, and it tasted like an all beef frank.  That's all it is.  What makes a hot dawg special is the friggin toppings.  That's where it's at!  I think this place did a good job at coordinating toppings for the dawgs.The group I was with had a little trouble with the bill (charged double for fries).  I suppose that's normal for a new place where everyone is nestling into their positions.  Like how a new shoe gives you a blister?  I just made up that analogy.  But, it's a good one.  I'm still adding this joint to my "Hella Good Places To Get A Dawg" list.  It's actually the only place.  You can either hit a street vendor for an over-boiled dawg with minimal toppings.  Or, you can try Capital Dawg with a plethora (that's a good word) of toppings and dawgs that have a SNAP!
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2008,8/4/2008,93,15,3,7,9>Let's begin with this: this place is my spot. You know, my "Cheers" of a sort, though when I come in the astoundingly adorable, brilliant, and attentive young man behind the bar (let's not embarrass anyone) always says not "Norm" but "Professor!" and gives me the questioning nod that means, "Usual glass of the Old Soul red?" Now what girl doesn't like that? I have been here seventy-six times on dates, meeting friends, and family occasions. But last semester I started stopping in Thursday nights late after my Argumentative Composition section out in South Sac's loveliest community college. I'd bring my stack of essays, maybe a few quizzes to mark up with a red pen, and slip on my Prada glasses and slip in to a stool at the long but not too expansive bar. You can't believe how many interesting folk I've run across - a lovely girl who owns a dress shop in Davis, a transsexual (stock) trader originally from San Diego who moved up north to reconnect with family, an Episcopalian minister with the prettiest eyes this side of Curtis Park, and perhaps the world's most troubled attorney. The thing is, whenever I recommend "58" everyone - literally, every time - says "L Wine Bar is better." Yes, L is bigger, sleeker, has a more expansive list. But 58 is the kind of place that they know you, and treat you well. The food is great - the hangar steak and charcuterie are my preferred dishes - and the wine is divine, with a generous pour. It's small, it fills up fast with interesting but never ostentatious people, and it's never too dark or too bright. If you must know, I've penned a few poems here. It's truly the only place in Sacramento that reminds me of an old school French Quarter corner salon, or a neighborhood Parisian Bistro.Go, let them get to know you. Order the steak and the Old Soul red.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2008,8/3/2008,42,25,6,10,5>I get positively giddy thinking about shopping at La Superior. The meat counter is amazing -- the best deal is buying the marinated steak or chicken (carne preparado/pollo preparado). The chicken is often on sale for $1.99 a pound, and the steak is usually $3.99 per pound -- a few minutes on the barbecue and you will sell your soul for seconds. The meat is so tender and flavorful, and did I mention, cheap? They offer queso fresco in bulk, as well as Mexican crema, three varieties of fresh salsas, house made chorizo and guacamole. The produce area is also super fresh and reasonably priced -- 10 limes for 99 cents! They are also one of the only places I've seen poblanos -- you'd think they'd be more widely available. And, as the other reviewers stated, you can get an incredible meal for very reasonable prices. They have the BEST bean and cheese burrito! The staff is super nice and friendly -- the produce manager helped me pick out the perfect watermelon and papaya -- a sort of 'horse whisperer' kind of guy to whom the fruit spoke....
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2008,8/1/2008,148,83,1,12,12>Just six months ago, Lounge ON20 was a mere twinkle in the eye of owner Ali Mackani. Working at warp speed, the restaurant emerged from concept to reality, opening officially in late June. The creative genius behind this upscale addition to the MARRS building bubbles at every level. Mixologists prepare innovative, succulent beverages; the menu boasts nearly 30 kinds of champagne by the glass; and Chef David Boswell, hailing from Napa, provides local, seasonal fare with an elegant sophistication.Mackani's passion for combining fine cuisine in a socially-focused lounge setting stems from his background as an engineer at Intel. In that role, Mackani traveled a great deal. Upon returning home to Sacramento, he would yearn for dining experiences reminiscent of those in cities like San Francisco. Rather than wait around for someone to bring the experience to him, Mackani opened 55 Degrees--and now, Lounge ON20. Mackani beams with passion as he describes his vision for the lounge, a zeal that permeates the experience visitors can expect. I certainly experienced it during a recent chef's tasting with other local food writers. We enjoyed a fun, zestful evening filled with laughter and fine flavors. Bathed in pure white, the lounge is sprinkled with bright red accents and blond wood backgrounds. Seating is arranged in a variety of living-room styles: large, family dining tables for groups, or intimate, leather lounge chairs and coffee tables for smaller gatherings. Mackani wanted to create an atmosphere that invites the feeling of visiting a friend's home for a cocktail party. Yet, I'm guessing your friends can't cook like Chef David Boswell! The lounge offers its delicious fare in a unique small plate menu: a "taste," which serves one or two; a "small plate," which serves about four; or a "platter," for groups. On our visit, we sampled the house roasted olives, which slid easily from their pits in a glistening oil with a hint of herbs. The Roasted & Salted Marcon Almonds came naked in their whiteness, but sufficiently cloaked in a shade of salt. We tasted a sparkling Schramsberg rose--a clean, light bubbly whose color and cool fit perfectly on a warm summer's eve. The Bella Fragola, a cocktail of muddled strawberry, basil and gvori vodka refreshed and amazed simultaneously. With no added sugar, the beverage tasted of pure, sweet summer joy--a cocktail that could as easily been gulped as sipped. Delightful! The Feminine Mystique cocktail was fit to put hair on your chest--a bit heavy on the vodka and missing the pear flavor the menu promised. The Local Strawberry Asian Pear Salad was served in a single, crisp, red endive leave with a blend of fresh herbs and spices, including chicories--a fresh, yet pleasantly biting dish that also whispered with artisan blue cheese. The Arincini "Fried Risotto" with White Truffle Oil sent our group of food writers (an otherwise sophisticated lot) to licking our plates--literally. We couldn't help it! The plating gave the appearance that we were being served spaghetti meatballs--and the smell wafting heavily from them made our mouths instantly water with the scent of melted cheese and tomato sauce. Yet, these were no meat balls--these were crisply crusted risotto with a divinely moist, cheesy middle. The taste was reminiscent of hash brown potatoes, because of the starchy, onion-y, comforting flavor. Move over Grandma! Chef David needs room in my heart for this dish!Next up, a Fennel-Spiced Seared Ahi paired with a lovely Desante Sauv Blanc, California 2006. One sip of this wine sent me immediately back to the Midwestern clover and grass fields of my youth. It paired perfectly with the spicy licorice and bright salt of the tuna, and the subtle sweetness of the heirloom watermelon: all a seasonal charm.Chef David describes his Pan-Seared Diver Scallop as his personal take on "bacon and eggs." The sweet seawater scallop sat under a tiny poached quail egg from local, small farmers, served with a parsnip puree created to taste of cream. What a whimsical dish!--full of that "bacon and eggs" flavor, but scaled to the likes of a tea party. We finished the evening with the mixologists, who were turning out original, inventive concoctions that made my mouth spin. My favorite: Ginger Spice topped with handmade cardamom foam, turning the icy cold beverage into a peppery, five-star chai latte--my new, favorite cocktail. They also served a Sugar Mama, which should bring Carrie Bradshaw running from New York for a taste of this better-than-a-Cosmo pink, tart drink. The lounge also works with small bottlers to provide alcohol not found elsewhere. A straight taste of their vermouth hinted with sweet notes of chocolate, caramel and vanilla--unlike anything imaginable!

Lunch is $12.95.  IF I lived in Davis, I'd probably go back to eat my weight in soft shell crab, veggie and shrimp tempura, seaweed salad, edamame, and California rolls.  And maybe unagi.  Probably some salmon nigiri, and possibly a rainbow roll.  But Fuji's really isn't worth the trip up from the Bay Area anymore.So sad to have such a fond Davis memory shattered to bits.

Thank you for the lovely service!Started off with calamari (delicious!) and the four of us split the special roll party platter (which I highly recommend!) that includes the Titanic, Grasshopper, King's, Cherry Blossom, Volcano, and Crazy Horse for only $55.And yes...

Oh well, 3.5 is still a passing grade, I enjoyed myself and Im sure ill be back.  I guess the only real disappointment is that Ink COULD be totally badass, its just not yet.  So in that sense, Ink is kinda like people who wear 'Ed Hardy' clothes--they WANT to be badass, but they're not quite brave enough to ACTUALLY go the whole way.

Oh well!Bread sticks in a tall beer glass? NICE! , Overpriced but just plain DEVINE appetizer. AMAZINGLY delicious blueberry martini.My meal however was just horrid, I should have figured it out from the dishes name but nope, not my dumb ass!I ordered the Korean steak sandwich , problem was they seemingly cooked it in soy sauce so it was very very soy sauce and salt tasting. Almost forgot about the grease, that may have just been from the HORRIBLE quality rib eye they used, not sure but it wasn't pleasant.So I will be back in hopes of an amazing Kobe burger. *crosses his fingers*

But i do like how they add capers to the plates :) mMm . I would recommend this place to try but its passable.Pros: Service, Ambiance,Cons: Food could be better.Stars: 3.25
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2010,3/1/2010,194,575,5,9,6>This is THE PLACE to go for Southern food, people of Sacramento! I finally went to Sandra Dee's on Friday night. You walk in and there's a bar; past that, the dining seated area. You can choose to eat at either. The walls are adorned with (mostly minor) African-American celebrities, including Ice Cube and Lil Wayne, who have eaten here in the past. There are TVs and the ambiance is lively but not obnoxious.I ordered the mild all-beef links with collard greens, BBQ beans, and a cornbread muffin. Everything arrived piping hot and the ideal temperature. The sausage was nice and crispy on the outside and covered with a great BBQ sauce - spicy, sweet and perfect. The greens, I was warned, are spicy, and I thought as a Thai food fan that would be ok, but let me restate that they are almost painful to the mouth in certain bites! If you like really spicy, go for it! The beans were delicious, the cornbread muffin was the perfect texture of crispy and soft, and went well with the greens.My husband had the fried chicken and waffles - a thin waffle served with butter and syrup, the cornmeal-based fried chicken pieces on a separate plate. The sweetness of the waffle with the saltiness of the fried chicken were a killer combo! Our friend ordered the chopped pork and let me taste a bit. It had a delightfully smoky quality to it that's hard to find in BBQ. There was live music (a free-stylin' piano player called Silent Night) and our waiter was very friendly, helpful and convincing. By that, I mean I went for the Sweet Potato Pie for dessert, which I'd never had before. It had a pleasant flavor, a texture similar to pumpkin but denser. I was glad I tried it!I can't stop recommending this place to people. It's a total diet catastrophe, but so worth it for the occasional comfort-food indulgence.
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2009,2/27/2010,1134,510,6,8,6>After reading the reviews, seeing them spotlighted on the news, and looking over the menu online, I was ready to try out these gourmet bran muffins myself. I got the "eye opener" (personal fave), made with real ginger, the "rumplepumpkin", "wapple apple", "bluenana" & "choco chimp".  I think all of them included walnuts and were made with pieces of real fruit.  They are low carb, low sugar, low fat (0 trans), and packed with good for you ingredients.  Oh...and yummy too!   The friendly guy at the counter gave me a couple freebies.  You know that'll bring me back!  The regular sized muffins( 4oz)  are $2.50, which I thought was a little pricey, but if you include my freebies, it was a good deal.
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/31/2009,2/26/2010,172,21,3,5,4>They would have received 4 stars from me, but it seems as though it was ummmm about 160 people standing outside waiting  this Wednesday to see the smash hit Avatar (which was Amazing by the way), only to be surprised when you enter the theatre to see another  long line for popcorn, preztels, and all the other sugary goodness you could possibly crave before sitting down. And and this doesn't top your popcorn with butter they only about 7 people working behind the concession stand with ONLY ONE cash register open. Yelper's Tip Log: Have someone else wait in line while the other person stands in line at the concession stand.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/25/2009,2/25/2010,154,299,4,5,5>It was day 2 of my venture to my state capitol - the urban expedition to find places of which I can inhabit in the near future was going about as well as can be expected, especially after the incident with the all too friendly Boxer canine. That smell will never come out.Having made my way back from the farm lands, I found myself nearly lost among the series of oneway streets. "Where the heck am I?!" I shouted to myself in the confines of my rented Kia toy car. I needed to find a place to stop, get my barrings, and some coffee. Also some waffles.And 'lo and behold, this place doth appeared. Seating was fairly prompt, and the feeling of this place reminded me of the greasy spoons of my teen years. Breakfast was ordered and it was classic greasy spoon-like - decent scrambled eggs, crisped bacon, juicy sausage, and a nice waffle. A breakfast that could blend itself to the background in a large, busy street. It was delicious, and hit the spot, but did so with no fanfare.The prices were decent from my experience, but as I am a stranger in a strange land, I don't know how the indigenous would compare...Thank you Waffle Square, for being a brief oasis amongst this urban Serengeti
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/10/2010,2/24/2010,354,285,11,13,13>If you know me, then you know I love Sushi. If I love sushi then I have to love Miyagi! Wow, I leave Miyagi thinking about sushi for the next week. Trying to figure out when is the next time I can get back in here for more. Would have to say the freshness of the fish is what I love best about it here! Being able to tell the fish is good is what makes the sushi! My favorite rolls would have to be the M3 and the Osaka Maki, and the Teke roll and also the Jesse. What am I saying I will basically eat anything that is put in front of me. I have practically sampled about everything on the menu and would have to say the calamari, the pot stickers, to the stuffed mushrooms and back to the sushi are all just amazing! My friends and I find ourselves here a few times a week for ether sushi or drinks! Saki Bombs, yes please!!  They have a great bar and an awesome happy hour menu. They also get a good after work crowd in here. This is definitely our top spot for a happy hour during the week. I love coming in here because you can't help but run into about 5 other people that you know!Recently we even had a "private party" here after hours for a friends birhtday (you can see the pictures I posted from it). Jimmy the owner was awesome in helping my friends go about planning the food, letting them decorate the restaurant, and even made special drink specials for them to offer at their party!! Amazing night! If you haven't stopped into Miyagi yet, then you have NO IDEA what you are missing out on!
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/25/2009,2/23/2010,554,328,3,7,4>I came here for my birthday on a Wednesday night. I was glad that my friend made reservations since the restaurant was packed. We also had 9 in our party so we did not want to end up waiting forever for a table.The food was great - the group ended up sharing a few of the different salads and ordered a few pizza's and everything was excellent!If you are getting drinks order the red table wine - it a a yummy blend and very inexpensive. Since it was my birthday they also gave me a free dessert which was very nice.I look forward to eating here again.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/19/2009,3/27/2009,15,31,5,8,5>So this place is a little odd -- you walk through the door and its like you are at the trendiest hospital cafeteria in the county, maybe the state. It's just so white. So very, very white.It's also much too loud to have a decent conversation with a group and lacks the intimacy for a smaller gathering.The pizza is in the Italian style, generally tasty, though the crust is not as flavorful as it could be, but the cheese and toppings are good.For as trendy as it is, it's relatively cheap -- 2 people could eat a full meal for about $20 and beers are only $4 ... not bad.I'm skeptical that the store half will ever sell anything, but it's a nicer area to hang out than the restaurant.I'll go back, since it's right around the corner, but it's not worthy of being a destination ...
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/19/2009,3/26/2009,29,29,8,8,7>Walked in there after a day of hiking, well actually walked into the living quarters section first. then they directed us to the correct door ever so graciously. So we walk in the place and sit down. The waitress comes to take our order and we had to repeat it at least 3 times. You get two sides and cornbread with your meal so I ordered BBQ beef with greens and black eyed peas. (13 bucks) Jim ordered the chicken fried steak with mac & cheese and yams. (10 bucks) Reuben walked by and overheard us and stops to tells us he is out of the chicken fried steak and suggested the smothered pork chops ( 15 bucks) I'm thinking (out loud) hell yea Jim will take that (tee hee). So the waitress takes the order to the kitchen and apparently forgets why she went into the kitchen because 30 minutes go by and  we are still sitting there with no food while a couple that came in after us are eating already.   So I'm giving the waitress the WTF look with an extra dose of evil eyes so she comes over and asks us again what we ordered and again we had to repeat it several times...and I'm thinking really, you can't handle 2 freaking tables of 2? Good Lord! So then another 20 min go by we finally get our food and she gives me (drum roll) Jim's order, whatev, at least we got some good chow in front of us. While we are eating  the waitress comes and puts 5 bucks and change on the table & I tell her very slowly that we have not paid our bill yet.  Reuben realized what happened and took one of the meals off the bill and gave us each a peach cobbler dessert.  The food is bitchen!
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2009,3/25/2009,257,300,8,16,10>AMAZING.  My dog has been transformed.  Now the hubs and me have a lot of  catching up to do!  We spent two hours at Elite today learning how to "proof" the three weeks of intensive training and after spending one afternoon and evening with my transformed puppy and her magical trainer, Rebecca, I am giving this place my highest, highest accolade.  My dog - formerly disobedient, easily entranced by moving objects, obstinate, and unruly, now watches every move I make when we walk.  She listens to me.  She makes eye contact.  She doesn't pull on the leash.  Okay I'm having an afterglow - after all, it's going to take three more weeks of training before I even know how or why or when to use the "come" or "come here" commands, but holy mother, I am beyond impressed.  She doesn't even try to jump on the couch anymore....She also smells delicious, weeks after we picked her up - we had her bathed at Elite before taking her home and I don't know what magic potion they use on dogs, but I can't stop snuffling Bella's ears and neck.  She smells better than I do!*sigh*I am now the official Elite Dogs Training & Boarding spokesmodel.***********Update/edit 3/18 - since I am tired of using the update function -We attended our first one-hour Group Class at Elite last night.  Normally $10 a class, if you enroll your pooch in the intensive training you get two free group classes.  Classes are held every Tuesday night at 6pm, unless it rains.The classes are random - you never know who is going to show up - so it was nice to have just a small group last evening.  One woman brought a black boy dog with a speckled-white chest who looked so much like our dog, but bigger, so GT and I spent the five minutes before class joking about kidnapping him so he and Bella could fall in love and live together forever in the desert.  But I digress.  Other attendees included a gigantic German Shephard whose owner gave him commands in German.   There was a small midget speckle-freckle dog that was adorable and whose owner was a handling pro, another guy with a huge hairy beast of a dog, and us.  We were walked in circles, made to turn right, left, and put our dogs in stay, heel, down, upsit, etc.  Mostly it was GT and me that needed the training; Bella was a consummate professional.  The group trainings are incredibly helpful if your dog has some training but you want to put it in a situation where it MUST obey you while there are other people/dogs in the mix.  Rebecca is remarkable astute when it comes to pup interactions and takes care to place dog/owners strategically near or far from others depending on skill level (humans) and personality type (dogs).  I know I've written three glowing reviews of Elite Dogs, but I cannot overemphasize how remarkably my dog has changed since being trained at Elite.  Our entire relationship with our dog has shifted for the better; she listens and makes eye contact; she understands that we are her people and she is our dog; she is less destructive and more thoughtful; she is more patient...and she's still only a year old.  I'm forever indebted to Elite Boarding and Training, and when we move to Joshua Tree in a month this is the place I am going to miss the most.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/27/2008,3/24/2009,43,21,5,1,6>Sure it was shut down for rats and cleaned up.  At least it wasn't shut down and practically burned to the ground like Tony Roma's.The food is brewery food.  It's far from fancy, and the greatest things I look forward too are the potato chips, mozarella sticks, clam chowder, fish tacos, and the burgers.  If you're looking for a more intimate sit down experience, you'll have to go elsewhere.If you're looking to go somewhere "where everybody knows your name" then this is the place for you.  Sit at the bar, get a beer, order some fried food, watch the game or chat with friends.  That's when this place excels.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2008,3/23/2009,78,78,21,1,7>Son: Dad, what is this place? I want to go to McDonald's!Dad: Son, it's time for you to learn what real food tastes like. I'm not going to let you eat food that was cooked in a factory, then put in a bag, then frozen, then shipped to down the street from us, then deep fried, then microwaved, then served to you. Sorry. No son of mine is going to eat crap like that unless he's in a warzone.Son: But I want a hamburger!Dad: Son, sometimes i wonder whether or not you are actually my child. I've always wondered considering you have blond hair and nobody else in the family has blond hair but the cat.Son: Hamburger!Dad: What the heck is wrong with you? That's just some mystery meat that's ground up and processed into a puck shape and sold to you. It's not wholesome and doesn't really taste good unless you're a prisoner at Guantanamo Bay.Son: But we live in Granite Bay not Guan...Dad: Just shut up already. This place serves real meat that they slice in front of you. And awesome sides. I suggest the pastrami or the corned beef. The prime rib is good too.Son: This tastes like cafeteria food.Dad: Only the best cafeteria known to man! Hey, are you going to finish that corned beef? You should get it heavy next time so Daddy can have more leftovers.Son: I still want to go to McDonald's.Dad: That's because you're ignorant and I'm most likely not your biological father.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2008,3/22/2009,46,149,7,11,7>It's like 2 days before my wedding and I realize the place (on Stockton Blvd, a pretty much kinda run down place but very inexpensive and my mom had gotten her hair permed there and I was like, well they know Asian hair so why not but it's nowhere close to my house nor the church) where I had made an appt for an updo isn't going to work out. So I asked my makeup artist if she can recommend anyone close by where we will be doing our makeup that I can run to right after the makeup and then get on the freeway and get to the church. She recommended this place. I called and Vivian was the lady who answered my call and said they open at 9 and wasn't really willing to come in earlier for one person since they have to work till 7p no matter what time they start working in the morning (understandably). So I begged a little and she said she'd come in at 8:45a for me. So I got my makeup done and rushed over there. Actually she called me at 8:45a exactly to see where I was and I had to tell her my makeup person took a little longer than expected. Anyways, so I get there and I gave her a red envelope ($10) for coming in early and helping me so last minute. So she gets started and she's FAST. I mean, she's pinning hair bobbi pins left and right (I pulled out 47 of them on my wedding night!) and was spraying hairspray like she's dousing out a fire. Anyhow, she did a great job, I really have to give it to her. There were no hot curlers (nor time for them, just a curling iron) and yet she managed to create these nice curls all over the head and it just turned out really good overall. I'm happy with her work. The Salon's menu of services listed updo's as $35 and up, which if it were closer to $35 then it'd be a GREAT deal. But when she was done, she charged me $65 and I think she knew she could b/c I was in a bind and she came through for me and quickly(!) So anyways, the whole thing cost $75 which isn't bad considering she really did do a great job (I'll post a pic of the back of my head later when I go through all the pics to see if there is one)  but I also felt she gouged me a little. So brides, do your homework when you are looking for an updo done. I got quotes anywhere from $30 up to like $175 (wth(eck)?!) and being the bargain-hunter I was, I really wanted to stay around $50 (yes, that's right, I'd rather spend my $ at a good sushi buffet or on some nice prime rib than on my updo for my wedding day! haha...) but since Vivian did a great job at a good pace (she's really a speedy gonzales and obviously knew how to approach my hair right away) I think the money I did spent was well worth it. Finally, I would also suggesting going in previously and picking out the style you want in advance. Some places charge a trial fee (better not be more than 1/2 of the actual updo cost though, otherwise, it'd be like paying twice, right?) so watch out for that. I just went in the day before (remember, I called on 8/6, went in on 8/7 and got married yesterday on 8/8/8, haha) and went through their books and picked out one that I liked. So before this turns into a full dissertation, I think Vivian did a great job and "yay! I'm a fan" although she could smile more and be more friendly and I did feel a little bit like her and the other 2 Vietnamese stylists were talking about me (a little) in Vietnamese some of that time, but a lot of the time they were just speaking in English and made small talk with me and were friendly. They were also analyzing my hair (or they were all looking at Vivian's work of art atop my head) while speaking in Vietnamese so they weren't necessarily talking about me just about the updo. Vivian's a skilled, decisive, and efficient stylist and for that I give her kudos. Since I'm not getting married again, I can't review again but if I happen to need another updo in the future (like if as a bridesmaid), I'd definitely go back (and ask for a return customer discount! haha...). Hope my review helps! Feel free to email me if you want to know more.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2008,3/21/2009,729,145,20,54,16>I just moved up here to Sacramento from Los Angeles a few months ago. Back home, my waxer and I have been BFF's for about 8 years now and she is amazingly awesome. Needless to say,  I've been dreading the day I would have to try a new waxer up here. Hallelujah!Fellow yelpers, you did not let me down! After reading the reviews, and a few reccommendations from classmates, I made my appointment with Victoria. It's summer....and Labor Day was on the horizon, so there was a 3 week wait. She called 2 days before my appointment to confirm and remind me. Last night  was my appointment and oh man, I am absolutely THRILLED with the results! Seriously - people are not kidding when they say that Victoria is the best. She speacializes in Brazillians and it's very evident that she's had lots of practice. The room is spacious, clean, welcoming and very comfortable. She is extremely polite and goes out of her way to make you comfortable. Her technique is FLAWLESS. Very gentle...I feel bad saying this....but it hurt less than my old waxer! It helps that she's easy to talk to as well...you have a conversation on a handful of topics, and before you know it, she's done!Also - I have to point out that when you're there, it's all about you. She has no distractions and she completely focuses on you. When she's done, she gives you a hot towel to calm your skin, and a mirror to inspect. If she missed any hair, she is happy to go back and fix it up.I got a brazillian, with no hair left at all. She got every single last hair, and the skin is so smooth and clean. She is extremely thorough and quick.If the pain thing is scaring you - FEAR NOT! I promise, it is not as bad as you think! Victoria is super gentle and I didnt even flinch once.If it's the privacy thing - FEAR NOT! There's no one else there to judge you, and Victoria is a true professional - she is concerned with the hair and skin and nothing else. Trust me, when you're off that comfy table, she never thinks about your hoo-ha ever again! Bottom line - if you're looking for a low-pain and very thorough bikini wax, you have to go to Victoria. You'll be so happy you did!$85 got me a brazillian and some very good razor bumb/ingrown hair solution. She does have a maintenance plan tho, so every wax after your first is just $45.P.S: For my fellow plus size divas, do not be afraid to do some pubic landscaping either! I'm a pretty hefty girl, and Victoria easily navigated my nether regions and was able to comfortably wax every single hair :)
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2009,3/20/2009,1168,790,3,6,4>My wife's new favorite restaurant is:  ANATOLIAN TABLE in Rocklin!  This was our first visit......we used our Frugal Fridays certificate (so we basically ordered A La Carte off the menu).....They have Lunch Specials for the coupon-less among us.Appetizers:  we sampled the dolma (stuffed grape leaves) and the fried calamari.   My wife really loved the crispyness and the dipping sauce....I wished they could have served the "tentacles" (I wonder what they are doing with all those yummy squid tentacles???).  Nevertheless, a very nice round of appetizers......would order the calamari again for sure!Entrees:  I had shish kebab (skewered lamb) and my wife had another lamb dish with spinach and eggplant.  Both entrees came with a very fresh homemade Turkish flat bread.  My wife remarked about the rice that came with my dish, very unique and flavorful.  I liked the dish my wife ordered, but not as much as my kebab!Dessert:  the Baklava was some of the best I've sampled anywhere......they used crushed pistachios and its got this wonderful syrup that tastes like honey but is made from sugar......not honey.  My wife's conclusion: "We would have to drive to San Francisco to find better food than this.......and it would be a lot more expensive."I asked her:  "Would you come back and pay full price?" Her reply was "Absolutely, yes!" ....she is already planning to take one of her co-workers here for lunch next week.We also found out that there is a private conference room available that seats up to 18 persons, complete with internet hookups & TV monitors.The owner and his wife cook all the food, and they are really proud of their cuisine and their culture.  Lots of nice art work & rugs decorate the walls, beautiful Turkish Tile Floors--- which elevate the decor above typical strip mall ambience.For about an hour and a half....we forgot we were in Rocklin!!!
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2008,3/19/2009,39,85,3,7,4>Tuk Tuk has really raised the bar for the suburban sprawl that is Natomas. Never before has any restaurant in the Natomas area been able to bring in an upscale quality. On Friday, I went to Tuk Tuk for the fourth time. What makes Tuk Tuk very distinctive amongst the throng of Thai restaurants is the ambiance. Many others have decorated their restaurants in classic Thai decor; warm woods, Buddha statues, old photographs, etc.Most importantly, the food is fantastic and they have a great selection of custom cocktails. The drink that stands out the most on their menu is their Kiwi Cilantro Mojito. It is very refreshing with its use of bright green cilantro with a nice touch of tartness from the kiwi and lime. Dan hates cilantro, but loves this drink since it does not overpower it. Large, ripe pieces of kiwi are found throughout the drink and is garnished with strawberry. What is also great about this drink is that it does not give you the air of a TGIF/Chili's/E-Bar/chain restaurant feel. I like that a lot. What is even better about this cocktail is that it helps to cool you down after you take a nice spicy bite.Most importantly is the food -- it has always been on point, great presentation and incredibly flavorful without being heavy. This time, we had ordered the Roasted Duck in Red Curry and Pad Kee Mao (think flat rice noodles). Our server was very sweet and paid just enough attention to us. (Pet peeve: Either way too much attention or not enough...most people probably feel this way) The duck was fantastic although there was just a tad bit too much duck fat (:: gasp ::) attached to the meat. Duck fat is might tasty. The medium spice level was just right, although I added more for myself.The Pad Kee Mao was beautiful. A downside to cooking with rice noodles is that if they are not done well, you end up with a mass of rice noodles stuck together without any seasoning. The noodle would still be white if this happens versus a nice brown color from the seasoning. The veggies that were stir fried with the noodles were nice and tender with a crisp. I realize that the comment that I am about to make is completely subjective, however, I will still make it: Pad Kee Mao trumps Pad Thai.Tuk Tuk has amazing curries. In fact, I would suggest to them to do a "stoplight flight" of curries; red, yellow and green. Each curry is distinctive and so flavorful that it would be great to experience them all together. We had the yellow curry one night and it came out with this flaky, amazing "pancake". When the server brought it over, I thought it was a mistake at first since I have eaten a lot of yellow curry and have never seen said pancake. It was the best pancake of my life. It was very similar to filo dough with tons of flaky, buttery layers. Dipped in the yellow curry, it was heaven. Their green curry is served out of a fresh coconut shell! The curry also flavors the coconut meat which you can pretty easily scrape out and eat. Very tasty.Last, but not least, is the Thom Kha Gai -- my litmus test for any Thai restaurant. This soup is absolute heaven for me. The perfect blend of coconut, lemon grass and the ever so fun, galangal. Their TKG was very good, although my favorite still lies with Thai Bistro in Davis. I really enjoy the tang that hits your palette. I chose to eat mine with rice because I feel that the rice is a great carrier of flavor for the soup.This is a restaurant that everyone who loves Thai food should eat at.

But the icy attitude of our waitress and the blah of the sea steak wouldn't let me!My friend and I came here for lunch and had the AYCE which is normally $19.99, but I managed to find a $10 off coupon online! YAY!Here is my breakdown dish by dish:Standard Miso soup: nothing spectacular, but wasn't bad"Freaky Edamame": I could just sit and eat this all day. From now on this is how I am going to prepare mine at home. It's normal edamame, but must be sprinkled in garlic salt and chili for that extra zing.Sea Steak: ::YAWN:: was SO disappointed. It wasn't bad, but even when we tried to sop up the pieces in the sauce on the place it was STILL bland. Maybe it was a bad day? hmmm....Tempura Stuffed Mushrooms: HOLY MOTHER OF FOODGASMS! SO delish. Creamy, tasty, great consistency..just all around total yum.TNT Roll: At first glance we were a little disappointed with the amount of tuna in there, but that was just a couple pieces. The rest were adequate. It was pleasingly spicy inside the roll and with the sauce on top. Def cleared my sinuses!Gyoza: Some of the best I've had, and the dipping sauce was nothing short of spectacular!M5 Roll: It was really good but kinda heavy on the cream cheese for my taste.This place was pretty busy at lunch time, and now I know why. I totally want to come back here and try one of everything. There literally wasn't anything on the menu (well maybe the soft shelled crab) that didn't sound good.If you don't do the AYCE, all their rolls are 50%... :) :)

Haha, okay maybe not on the streets but online?  Apparently, Lichine's is ranked 10th in California in gross lottery ticket sales.  They've sold lottery tickets to two huge winners; one for $5M and another for $9M.  Maybe I should start "investing" in lottery tickets..hmm.......haha jk.Anyway, OFF TOPIC!  I'm here to review the little sandwich area they've got going on inside Lichine's!  Stopped by for a quick lunch during by break and was feening for a good old fashioned sandwich.  Lichine's provides 22 different sandwiches varying from roast beef to pastrami to turkey!  AND they provide excellent and prompt service!  I think the reason I decided to write this review was because they were so nice!  I got the #1 combo: Ham, Mortadella, Cotto Salami & Cheese Sandwich for $4.75.  Did I really just say $4.75?  That's cheaper than a Subway sandwich!!  HENCE, my 4 star rating ;)There's nothing extraordinary about the sandwiches but I do like that they provide fresh ingredients and a variety of choices.  In addition to sandwiches, they have mac salad, potato salad, and homemade soup.  Homemade is always good in my book!No seriously, I think I'm going to try my luck and grab a lottery ticket tomorrow *crosses fingers*
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2011,4/8/2011,372,323,42,37,34>I'M VERY ANGRY WITH THIS PLACE... for having such addicting sweets!!! Everything that I have tried here has been such a guilty pleasure. I'm about to bill them my dentist bill for all the cavities they've caused!!! (or will cause)Came here for their grand opening and they were having buy one half dozen, get the 2nd half dozen FREE. It was a great deal and I'm glad we stopped by. Their donuts are so tasty!!! Very soft pastry on the inside and the glaze isn't too sweet and not too light, just perfect! They melt in your mouth, and before you know it... you're already on your third doughnut. I hope your diet won't be mad at you after this! But it's all so worth it.Came in here again for Valentine's Day weekend and most of their donuts were made in the shape of HEARTS! How the heck can anyone say no.Their donut holes are only $1.25/dozen!!! AGAIN, how can you say no?!? So my sister and I got three dozen... There's nothing de-masculating about the tears coming down from my eyes for these sweet, delectable heart-shaped donut holes. I swear I inhaled about 27 of them straight to my stomach... I looked into the bag and was like... "AHHH where'd they all go??"Best donuts in town, area, city, EVER!!!
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2010,4/7/2011,574,469,13,8,12>HA! Yet ANOTHER little Citrus Heights gem!I would have NEVER found this hole-in-the-wall without Yelp.All last week, we've been in downtown Sacramento celebrating my birthday, and I've been thinking, man, Citrus Heights SUCKS.I mean, what do I tell my friends from out of town? I'm sorry, we're going to have to spend at least thirty minutes in the car if you want anything worth eating.!Then along came Alonzo's... WHOA! This was NOT what I was expecting. I didn't want to go anywhere because of all the chaos of the past week, so I sent my husband off to get some pizza. After all, it's football season and my man needs some pizza! But in order to keep us out of the dominos-for-dinner-every-weekend-during-football-­season cycle, I sent him for takeout.Don't act like you don't know what the Dominos-for-dinner-every-weekend-during-football-­season cycle turns into. For the goodie-two-shoes that really don't know, it turns into leg-breaking DRUNK all football season. Pre-Zoey, I would approve of such football-related mayhem, but these days, I protect my Zoey from that mayhem. I totally associate Dominos with mayhem. If you disagree, I don't care; you'rewrong. So anyway: enter Alonzo's take-out: huge Chicago-style DEEP DISH, STUFFED CRUST Combo pizza. Man this sucker, size L, IS HUGE. Not missing the Dominos and Guinness so much now, are ya, big guy?I peek in the box, expecting to see a Zelda's-style pizza. Nope. Not in here. But it's OK, man! This is just different, in a great way! I won't lie, I WAS totally missing the buttery, melt-in-our-mouth flakey crust that leaves one in love with Zelda's, despite any verbal lashings that come with it. (I've never had a lashing at Zelda's but I've heard they're pretty outta hand.) But to that, I say this: Next time I'm at Zelda's I'm sure I'll be missing the super cheesy donut pizza that is Alonzo's. Don't forget to get everything on that mother... especially the spinach. Damn!This pizza makes me want to get pregnant again so I have an excuse to order this every three days! But really, you know that ain't true. But it is good! The pizza is definitely just four stars, because at just under 40 bucks, it is expensive. So even pregnant, I couldn't come here very often at that price. We figured that with 12 slices (L), each piece is 3 bucks. It's worth it, because each piece eats like a meal. Don't be silly, TRY THIS, especially if you're in hizzy.Update: I've been thinking about his pizza for the past three days. I think that deserves 5 stars.

Crap.This place is the sauce made of awesome.  AWESOMESHAUCE!!Per previous reviews, I had to, HAD TO try that Blood Orange Burger, which lived up to every single mouthwatering fantasies I had been daydreaming all day when my belly was aching for dinner.  I ordered a salad as my side, sampled some of my friends hot fries dipped in ranch.What can I say?  I'm for once (as a girl who's always talking) rendered speechless!!My burger:  sdjklfhlaskdj fnaiuwehyjb!  ---- it was that good.  The bun lived up to all my dreams... toasted on the inside, soft, buttery... not at all crumbly or stale and perfectly moist and doughy.  The beef was exactly as our server said it would be: the juciest burger I ever tasted.  The bacon: perfect.  Not too much cheese.  Not too much sauce.  Perfect slice of tomato: it didn't do that thing notorious of crappy restaurants... you know, where the tomato act's as a rug pulled out from under your feet and all your left holding is an empty bun while the burger contents topple onto your plate.I will never. ever. eat. another. burger.  Unless my ex boyfriends step mom makes it, thats about the closest thing ;)I went to the website and read that reservations were recommended due to the size of the restaurant.  I made them and we were seated promptly.If the food weren't so perfectly comforting of diner food, I would say this places staff outshines the menu.  But no.  The food is incredible, and the staff was just TOP NOTCH.  Our server was entertaining, funny, told us jokes, and felt more like our friend than our service.  You can tell that the staff must just LOVE WHAT THEY DO because it shows in how much their make their patrons feel welcome.  Bravo, Gatsby's, BRAVO!  You can count on me to stop by many a'time in the future because my socks are over there, you officially rocked them off.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2011,4/5/2011,651,150,10,14,15>Hype and my tendency to over-zealously buy into it have caused me many disappointments in the past.  First it was Reebok Pumps in 6th grade and most recently, it was Disney's ode to raves and spandex, Tron Legacy.  So when the opportunity presented itself to visit the much-hyped Magpie Cafe, I was understandably reluctant.    How could it possibly live up to the hype?All I know, is that it did and then some.  I split the Rib Eye and soon afterwards wished I had ordered one all for myself.  The Niman Natural angus served with smashed potatoes was closer to heaven than the Dubai tower.  It was excellent.The staff was very friendly and constantly checking in on my party.The chef even came out to see how we liked our food.  With Frazey Ford's 'Firecracker' playing in the background and the lack of TVs to distract you from your party, the ambiance is mellow and comfortable.  Give Magpie a try.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/5/2011,4/4/2011,702,960,16,27,22>UPDATE: The farmers market here at Sunrise Mall has re-opened as of today! I believe the hours are the same as before: 8:00 - 12:00. Some of the vendors are the same as the Rancho Cordova ones. How do they do that? Parallel universe theories aside, I guess they have enough workers to straddle both sides of the American River. I was told that this will be a year-round market as well.Since today was the first day, some of the booths weren't sure about demand and had sold out of stuff by 10:00. However, they said that next weekend they will have more stock. Although not as large as the one in Rancho Cordova, you can still find a variety of fresh fruit and veggies. Highlights:* Strawberries * Potted herbs/flowers* Baked goods* Flower booth* Preserves* Free range eggs* Free range beef* Packaged nuts* Mandarins/orangesI prefer the selection at the Rancho Cordova farmers market, but if you are in the area you should check this out. Also, since it is so close to Macy's, I tend to go shopping afterwards. I don't know if this is good or bad, but at least I'm boosting the economy and partaking in retail therapy while supporting local growers.
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2010,4/3/2011,175,211,3,7,4>Erica C. beat me to it! We went here today because my dining partner got a flyer in the mail for a special for the month of September. Your choice of 2 soups or salads, a medium pizza and a pizookie for $20 bucks. We each ordered the salad and decided on the Artichoke & Spinach pizza. The pizza was delicious. Artichoke hearts, spinach, mozzarella & cream cheese (yes, cream cheese) make this a one-slice-and-I'm-full kinda meal.  You know what that means, leftovers!We could barely finish the Triple Chocolate Pizookie. Chocolate heaven for sure :) They don't advertise this in the restaurant but it's a great deal. I may be back before the month is up.

You heard right.  I actually ran across this beautiful truck on my way to the post office.  I made a mad dash to the truck and caught them right as they were closing up.  There were nice enough to take my order before they had to move.  (45 mins per spot?  Really City of Sacramento?)  I had to make it quick so I sampled a 3 pack with the OG, Da Philly, and Cowbell.  After a few seconds, the cook asked if I liked spicy food.  Hell Yeah I DO!!!  So he told me I should swap out the OG for the Ninja.  BEST DECISION EVER!!!  So here is the breakdown of the burgersNinja:  I got this with Angus Beef on a wheat bun.  Just FYI, they offer Bison and Chicken also as your Protein choice.  Also they offer Brioche or lettuce also as bun choices.  (shoulda gone with the brioche but i was in a rush).  This burger was the best by far because to the slaw that was on top of the burger.  The slaw was a mix of Lettuce, Jalapenos, Carrot, and Sesame oil. Then it was topped with Siracha Aoli!!!  How could I resist this baby!!!  Meat was cooked well, seasoned well, and was eaten very well!!!Philly:  Classic burger combo with sauteed mushrooms, onions, and provolone cheese.  This was also done well, but I keep thinking of the NInja burger!Cowbell:  Rodeo time with this baby.  Bacon, pepperjack cheese, onion straws.  Giddity Up~!!!  But once again... That damn NINJA BURGER!!!The truck lives up to its billing as a gourmet Burger truck.  The selection were well thought out and satisfy a wide number of palettes.  They serves soups, salad, fries, tots, and wait for it....COTTON CANDY~!!!!  Yeah I know, this truck totally dropped from heaven!  I kid, but the Sweet Onion soup is also a must try and the cotton candy is just a cool thing to have.  I love this truck and the gourmet food truck scene.  I am just glad its starting to take hold in Sacramento.  This truck is a must try when you can catch it.  Check their twitter feed for locations and times~!!!  I know I will~!!!

They require a 2 dozen order for the mini's  but you can have two different types of 1 dozen each. I got the popular red velvet and a peppermint for the other one. I had to pre-pay at least 1 day ahead of time. OK. I was able to pick up the order any time the next day. They were cute.  I unfortunately pulled out 5 red velvet ones and left them on the table. My Irish Wolfhound ate them paper and all!  The only evidence was a red tint to her water bucket. :)  Oh yeah, the guests also liked them without the paper.
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2011,2/15/2011,141,309,8,14,9>Whaaaaat's the deal with the racism here?? I kept my eyes open but saw none of it. There were 2 lines: one for "people," and the other for "VIP/guestlist." I hate it when people pull the race card for no reason. We came on a Saturday night at 8:30 - early enough, we thought, to avoid any kind of lines, but sure enough, we waited about 15 minutes in the cold street. When we got inside, ALL the couches along the front were empty but had "Reserved" signs on them. That was pretty annoying, since there is absolutely NO seating anywhere else (if you don't count the potties).My gin + tonic was really good - sweet and strong - for only $6. They had awesome music playing and the other people there were well-dressed and well-behaved. The restrooms were clean and very cute.However, I didn't stay long; I'm not one who's big on SHOUTING at my friends just to be heard, and this place is LOUD. We stayed to finish one drink and went to Cosmo Cafe for a quieter place to chat.Since the big draw here is the mermaids, they should make more of an effort to have mermaids in there all the time. There were 15-minute gaps for no reason, which was a bit annoying. Come on! We want scantily clad ladies to stare at :)  One girl was kind of a flop as a mermaid... She could only hold her breath for less than half the tank and was NOT someone I would describe as "graceful." They should hire some of my synchronized swimmer friends :)I'm happy to have a new place like this open in an area that desperately needed some upkeep. I'll be a patron again soon, but perhaps on a weeknight when there are fewer people.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2010,2/14/2011,72,83,11,13,13>I like living in Natomas (really!), but after discovering CF Cheng, I *love* living in Natomas. How did I miss this restaurant? I often visit the Tapioca Express and Wagger's Pet Spa in the same plaza, both of which are cool in their own spots, too.Once upon a time, I had a loyal and loving relationship with San Jose's awesome HK restaurants, showered with affection--all the yummy dim sum I could want, wedding/family styled dinners I could have, etc. However, circumstances tore us apart and I was left wandering the streets of Sacramento, aimlessly looking for substitutes but only finding meaningless one night eats.Then came CF Cheng. Just when things seemed hopeless for me. I could never find another, I thought to myself. I stepped inside with the resolve that it would probably be just another one night eat for me. But CF Cheng was warm--siu mai dim sum was steaming hot and moist; tender--smoked sea bass was deliciously soft and oozing with flavor; sweet--delicious sweet broth filling the xiao long baos. I fell in love.Now, I know this is too soon, but CF Cheng's constantly on my mind--when to go again, what to eat next, should I order two orders of xiao long bao or just one? Sigh. Perhaps I'm just a fool in love, but it's certainly a delicious predicament.Tip: CF Cheng's a little shy. You'll have to prod a little for their authentic Hong Kong menu. Otherwise, you'll get the typical Americanized Chinese food, and I don't think the Chef puts as much heart in those dishes as the authentic ones.
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/4/2010,2/13/2011,361,68,12,11,10>Hands down the best Vietnamese Sandwich place in Sacramento!Huong Lan Sandwiches has been around for many many years and moved a few times as far back as I can remember. But the thing I love about them is that their sandwiches have remained delicious and consistent. My all-time favorite is the BBQ Pork Sandwich, nothing else just compares. Back in the day, sandwiches were only $1.50!! But gas was also only $1.50 too, with inflation, sandwiches run about $3.00 now, but still not too pricey. The place also has some pretty good snacks on the side, but I would stay away from eating their restaurant food and boba tea, as those are quite sub-par. The 4-star rating is based on sandwiches alone, overall, I would give it a 3-star rating. Also, if you are craving a sandwich on a Sunday, forget it. The store is chaos, packed with Asian people on Sunday and you'll have to wait quite some time for your food. Also, this place only takes cash (*Shakes fists*), I'm big on charging everything lol. Who still carries cash nowadays right?? Anyway, if you have tried a Vietnamese Sandwich before, you definitely have to try one here, you'll thank me for it later!
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2010,2/12/2011,194,575,8,10,5>The Bombay Bar & Grill is divided into 2 parts - a florescent aqua bar, and a classy dining area. The service was very good, friendly, and prompt - heads above other Indian places that I have patronized in the past.Now for the food. The  naan was ok, although I prefer mine to be fluffier. My husband felt that his tandoori chicken was a tad bland compared to the same dish at Pooja Grill, our usual haunt. I had the Vindaloo Lamb Thali. I was a huge fan of both the main dish and the veg curry side dish. The thali also came with dal, basmati rice, and naan. No rice pudding like on the thali at Pooja, but the food was solid, if a little pricey.In my opinion, Bombay Grill's strong suit is a) drinks and b) a wide range of vegetarian dishes. As others have mentioned, they have a very impressive list of vegetarian dishes. So if you happen to be a vegetarian alcoholic with a soft spot for Indian food, this is your place. :-D

Well, there are a few less mullets to be seen but that's about it.Dark and dingy surroundings: sameWeathered and hastened servers: sameCrowded and loud atmosphere: sameLong, long wait for your pie: sameDensely crusted, thickly layered, ooey, gooey, rich and chewy pizza: sameI will happily endure the first four to get to number five.

I had bottomed out and had enough, so I checked myself into this carniceria clinic a few months ago after a horrendous binge on Capitol & 19th Street Smack. I swear that shit's laced with some shit man! Gets me strung out more than the pure stuff.Chipotle was (and still is) my opiate. Once an addict, always an addict, and each day is a struggle. You tend to lose your sense of dignity side-stepping your way though that sterile Chipotle restaurant line every other day. Always single file, like a child in an elementary school cafeteria, hovering over the sneeze guard, trying not to shout your demands, pathetically hoping the "lunch lady" accidentally goes a little overboard spooning the marinated chicken onto your tortilla. A silent cry of "YESSSSSSSS" goes off inside your head every time she goes back for that second half-ladle helping of potent poultry....But then I found Oscar's. He is the methadone to my heroine. A guiding light, a hand to hold onto...he's Josh Groban.   You know I've never even tried the Barbacoa at Chipotle? And yet, I've eatin' at Oscar's just 5 times and I've ordered something different each time. My recommendation: The Adovada burrito with sour cream. Tons of flavor. The Pollo Asado burrito also gets high marks. The Carnitas burrito? Well, I bet you it can be good. But I got some gristle in mine which was a turn off. And Jesus Chriminey do these burritos make a mess. So have some Brawny on hand.Also, I like how one of the guys that works there calls me "amigo." Yes, señor, I am your amigo. It's always nice to have friends during a recovery.

I like the take out approach and the place is clean as a whistle. My favorite dish is the Curry Butter Chicken over rice I feel my toes curl every time I eat that stuff. I love that stuff so much I literally have a Curry mustache smile from ear to ear every time I molest that plate of goodness, that's some dang good eaten.

I really wanted a cold drink and a small snack so I had 30 minutes left on my break and took a trip over to Empanadas 'n Buns!What a wonderful experience. I felt at home here! They had a display of fresh empanadas that looked delicious! I went for Lumpias and a Chai tea.Joe & Nora kept me entertained by telling me the history of the place and the type of food they offer. My Chai was really great, Joe even added some coffee to it and that was a great touch. Nora then came out with FRESH Lumpias, omg they smelled as wonderful as they were.I recommend this place to everyone that lives around the area or even if you're just visiting the good ol' Roseville. I can't wait to go back to try their Tamales, be advised if you're looking for mexican tamales you won't be happy but instead you'll be gracious that you tried their tamales. They're Colombian so they're made with a different technique and honestly, they taste A LOT BETTER!!So for about 5 bucks you get 9 Lumpias with house made sweet chili sauce. You can't beat that. Very inexpensive!Talk to the owners whenever you go, they're very friendly and could even recommend a dish that's not on their menu!

<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2007,11/6/2007,6,6,1,2,5>There is no greater fan of fly fishing than the worm.  ~Patrick F. McManus, Never Sniff a Gift Fish, 1979     There is a certain serenity in watching an accomplished fly caster weave his fly line through the warm summer air.  That being said, there are few things as pleasurable as being that angler.  However, learning to tie a proper Albright's Knot has been no easy task for me.  Bear in mind that I'm a left handed girl using right handed instructions (poor excuse, I know).  It's my desire to learn more about angling that takes me to specialty shops.  There are several shops in Sacramento, but my favorite is Kiene's Fly Shop.      Kiene's has graced the Sacramento area with great service, knowledgeable staff and oodles of cool gear since 1984.  The inventory at Kiene's is large and diverse, they stock over 400 fly rods an nearly as many fly reels. Kiene's also has a complete wading department, fishing vests, tackle bags, an extensive library of books, periodicals and DVDs, and one of the largest fly tying departments in Northern California.  In short, Kiene's has nearly 4,000 square feet of shop crammed to the rafters with really cool stuff.  Kiene's also hosts a number of travel and community events, workshops, and classes, you can visit their website at kiene.com for more information.     I've found the  staff at Kiene's to be highly knowledgeable, personable and helpful.  You don't have to be a card carrying member of Trout Unlimited to get the benefit of the staffs knowledge or assistance (though I guess it wouldn't hurt).  You won't be subjected to high pressure sales tactics or ignored because you may not be the most *ahem* experienced angler.  If you're anything like me, you will leave Kiene's with a wealth of information, a longer list of stuff you "must have," and an even stronger resolve not to get tangled in your own fishing line (embarrassing).
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/7/2006,11/5/2007,1800,1375,7,6,5>I had just started off a relaxing evening when I was rifling through my mail and found a letter from my ex, who said, quote:"You have set the bar too high for anyone.  Give me a call."Ya, right, loser.  So, since my evening was already somewhat ruined by being contacted in that way, I agreed to meet up with my good friend Melody, who was in the mood for some cheesecake.  We decided to drive to the Arden Mall to hit the Cheesecake Factory.My first experience at this chain, was actually when it first opened in San Francisco.  I was conducting a shopping tour with a bunch of friends from Japan and since we had just finished a rigorous utilization of credit cards at Macy's, staying in the same building seemed like a great idea.  What I remembered, was the whimsical interior design and the mega large portions of food.So, a quick zip back to now, we walked in around 8:30 and find out it will be about a 15 minute wait.  The lobby was packed with people, mostly young.  I felt a stab of remorse.  What was I doing in here, when I should be at home, getting ready to sleep and rejuvenate myself for work the next day  ;o)We were seated in about the time stated in the alcove to the left of the kitchen.  This gave me a moment to adjust my peripherals and vision to the dim lit setting inside.  Let me put it this way, if you are here on a date, you will look good.  There is no lighting on the tables, so wrinkles and other non-efficiencies will not be on display.  The dimmed lighting even made me feel good, not too fond of my freckles and war scars.  In addition to the lighting, the dark wood tables and booths contrast greatly with the whirled beige/rose walls and up into the mosaic of swirls and plush rounds of art displayed on the ceiling.  It made me feel as if I were sitting in a pseudo touchy feely version of an Americanized Casbah.  Our server was Donald (who was all smiles and cute with his successful communicative abilities) and after a quick perusal of the menu, decided that my large butt did not deserve anything other than the large Market Salad, conglomeration of mixed greens, radicchio, endive, fresh sweet beets, pieces of avocado and Kalamata olives tossed in their house vinaigrette ($8.95) and a signature pizza, the Pesto Chicken with a dash of fresh garlic ordered as an extra topping (I think it was around $10).  They have a large menu here, so be prepared to take your time, or at least have an inkling of what you and your stomach are predisposed to.  In addition to standard American fare {Meatloaf entree, hamburgers, sandwiches, and pastas, are their takes/attempts at Asian fusion choices, which are evident in their appetizers (Vietnamese Shrimp Summer Rolls, Thai Lettuce Wraps) and more.  They even make omelets, for gawd's sake}  Add in another two pages stock filled with every sort of cheesecake imaginable, and your evening is set.I was impressed with my salad.  Huge.  Large.  And the beets were dumped like bombs, red ones, staring at me with an ominous presence.  Everything was fresh, crunchy, and the right texture.  Our pizza was pretty good.  In fact, better than California Pizza Kitchen.  Lots of creamy cheese that strung off my slice as it traveled the perilous journey from the serving plate to my dinner plate.  Pieces of tender marinated chicken, red roasted peppers, and the pesto base was exquisite.  I can't believe I'm saying this about their pizza, it was not expected.  The crust was thin, but not too thin, as the edge had bubbled up perfectly to ensconce the thick topping and slightly sweet.  All the while, Donald was quite attentive, stopping by several times to make sure everything was satisfactory.  At one point, since I was busy pulling the stereotypical Japanese move and fiddling with my new Sureshot camera, we spent several moments talking about picture depth and macro mode.  After we finished, we had only consumed two slices of pizza from a round of 6, which Melody took home.  Our bill, with the two Market Salads, the pizza, two ice teas and her cheesecake, came out to around $43.  Not too bad, considering she used a gift certificate, which brought our total down to $12-15 each.Good reception, good service, and good food.  After rethinking my cruel and unforgiving opinion of chains, I would come back here again.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/24/2007,11/4/2007,177,474,6,5,5>Okay, this is not a 4 star fancy pants restaurant.  It's more along the line of Denny's-Meets-Trails.You can comfortably take your 86 year old grandpa with his O2 tanks, AND your visiting parents AND your fit throwing 2 year old to this place, and you won't feel like you are missing out on eating decently just because you are at a "family restaurant" in the pocket (i.e., f*ck Shari's), in a strip mall.  Not for snoots and snobs.  However, real western lovers will appreciate the ode to Shane over the register, and we were seated in the Clint section.That's because the quality of the meats and the home cooking meat- and-potatoes goodness will make you really satisfied.  It's a new place in our neighborhood, and I have to say, we did not have high hopes (okay, I had high hopes, PF had low ones, and I won.)  I was really craving ribs now that my appetite is back, and was thinking a place with a western theme would have some that would fit the bill.I noticed right off the bat that they did not have ribs on the menu, but that they had a pretty decent assortment of sandwiches and burgers, some even come with bbq.I also noticed the really extensive breakfast menu, and made a mental note to check it out this weekend if possible.What we got:I had a Stagecoach burger.  This is a hand shaped burger on a muzio bun with lettuce, tomato, standard thousand island type special sauce and american cheese.  I kicked out the tomatoes, added red onion and asked for a side of bbq.  The bbq is thin, almost like bbq au jus, but it's got some good flavor.  I normally do not like handshaped burgers because  the meat quality is not usually good, and if they don't season the meat at all, it always just tastes like mushed cooked cow and crumbles all over the place.  This didn't taste like that, they season it, grill it EXACTLY right, and it fit the bun and was NOT crumbly.  I also got a side of potato salad (lots of stuff going on, it had bits of red pepper, pickles, egg, onion, celery) and the only thing was that some of the potatoes were undercooked.  My salad was satisfactory, they carry my favorite ranch dressing (the kind that must come in a generic tub for restaurants only, because I can't get the same one at the grocery store and I've tried all the brands.)PF was going back and forth on whether to get the french dip or the meatloaf.  He ultimately went with the meatloaf.  Holy moly.   They should call it "meal loaf"  That was the biggest thing I have seen in a long time.  It may have been bigger than the giant sandwich that was bigger than my head (I took pictures of it in Chile).  This was bigger than that ridiculous sandwich.  It came with a side of fat green beans cooked with generous bits of bacon.  The meatloaf had a fluffy and meaty consistency, which is something I cannot seem to do at home (mine come out like meat bricks) and was literally smothered in mushroom gravy.  It was 4 giant slices!  And oh yeah, it was ridiculously delicious.Needless to say, I couldn't finish my burger, it was too much for me on a recovering illness (I have been living off of gatorade and chicken noodle soup for 5 days.)  PF ate all but 1.5 slices of his loaf and gave up in defeat.  We were planning on ordering the tapioca dessert, in honor of my grandparent's wedding anniversary today (I think they hit 68 years today) since that's my nana's favorite (not that she can remember her favorite anymore), but we were too stuffed.Stuffed, I tell ya.For 22 bucks.Which is a ridiculously good deal in this day and age.  2 dinners, with sides of salad, and 2 drinks.  Where do you get that for 11 bucks per person average??  Apparently only here.The original Stagecoach is up Florin a ways the other way, and it's family owned and operated.  I laughed when they described their portions are "hardy", and indeed they are.  They can rest on their laurel.I cannot remember if they have collard greens, but they have smother gravy.  If they added ribs, I would go there all the damn time.  And probably end up with two asses, one in the front and one in the back, so maybe I should stay away...I highly recommend for people who wouldn't turn their noses up at the location or the type of meat-and-potatoes fare inside; because they have liver, but it never belonged to a diseased goose.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2007,11/3/2007,130,334,2,13,17>The Old Sacramento Cemetery is one of my favorite places in Sacramento. It's historic, romantic (really!), scenic, and haunted.HAUNTED?!?!?Yes, really. The cemetery is haunted. But we'll get to that later. For now, let's talk about the other reasons this is a great place to spend an afternoon. Being the oldest officially established graveyards in Sacramento, means that pioneers, builders, movers and shakers of Sacramento will probably be buried here. Even if there's no interest in local history, the artwork and craft (not to mention the dates they were made) of many of the gravestones is quite amazing. In addition, there is a little known section in this memorial park that should be pointed out and visited: a division reserved exclusively for firefighters who perished in the line of duty.When people think of romanticism, images of walking on a beach, picnics in the park or other sappy over-abused things come to mind. How about a walk in the bone yard? Believe it or not, an afternoon stroll here can be exciting and quite romantic for a number of reasons: first and foremost, it's quiet. But aside from the stillness in the air, people have found that the departed have been pushing up the daisies- literally! Old Sacramento Cemetery doubles as a wonderful but probably unintended botanical garden, that is filled with an exotic amount of various plants and flowers bloom and grow. During the spring, after the winter rains, it's quite breathtaking. Adding to this, it's been discovered as of late that a species of bumblebee exists and thrives in this particular area, and they are quite friendly. Now we all know the stereotype of cemeteries being haunted. Just about every place you go, there's one or two stories of a haunted necropolis in the area. With Old Sac, it's confirmed and well-documented that three known ghost haunt the grounds. The spirits of  William Brown, the African-American Casey Jones, a little girl who died tragically (can't remember her name right now),, and a friendly dog all claim this to be their own private gated community. While we never did see any of them, we did encounter a strange fog that came out of nowhere on a hot summer day with clear skies (even got photos of it). But who knows? You may find yourself standing shoulder to shoulder with an unexpected apparition! That in itself is more than enough reason to be down with the OCC.

There are piles and piles of books, blocking shelves loaded with books. You don't so much browse as try to manuver your way around the store. My husband and I shopped there over the weekend; we found some great items and spent about $60 on over 6 books. However even though we found some great items I had the feeling that there was more there then what we could find browsing the nearly bursting shelves. Nice bookstore but not very well organized, you can always email the owner and they will find the item your looking for and then call/email you to come in and pick it up. God help me if my apartment ever becomes like this!
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2007,11/1/2007,43,95,8,8,8>As a woman who likes to shake her boo-tay to some fine, fine Chicago blues, I have to say the Torch Club is a super place to do some booty shakin'.  The dance floor is small but it's larger than the floor at the Torch's previous location, so that's a plus.  It quickly gets packed with dancers and never clears out until the music finally stops.  Get to the Torch early if you want a table, because once the band starts they're hard to come by.  Like I said, this place fills up quickly and the crowd only gets more ecstatic as the night goes on.  Dancers have been known to shift off the overcrowded dance floor and shimmy between tables. I especially like the mix of people at the Torch.  All ages and races come to this place for the live blues, and a good time is had by all.  There's Newcastle Brown on tap (yay!) and the bartenders don't mind if you ask for water over and over during the night.  (Well, I'm sure they'd prefer to make some money selling drinks, but this girl can only down so much beer while dancing - after a while, I need constant rehydrating in order to keep shaking my rump - and the bartenders are always pleasant and accommodating.)The ladies' room at the Torch is small (two stalls, one sink) but because the crowd is invariably happy, there's no bitchiness or catfighting while waiting for a stall.  I think I've gotten more compliments on my hair and clothing while waiting in the potty line at the Torch than anywhere else.  The Torch Club is also the site of my first (and only) girl kiss, when a total stranger ran up to me and planted one on me, exclaiming, "You are my dancing hero!"  She gave me a big hug then ran off.  It's nice to know somebody appreciates my booty and its somewhat out-of-control shakin'.

(No, I don't live in the Trailer Park)When I lived in Sac, I frequented this Second Hand Mecca bi-weekly.  And we're talking the twice a week kind, not every-other week.  This is a thrift store that doesn't mess around with prices or quality or other such abstract ideals.  There's tons of crap to sift through, but there are some real gems, and they are totally affordable.  Here are some rough guidelines as to what you might expect: (prices vary on quality of course)shirts - $1-4jackets - $3-7shoes - $3necklace - $2-7couch - $20-150silverware - $ .15 a piecedining sets - $20-30I'd guesstimate that about 68% of my wardrobe, knickknacks, and furniture came from this store.  It's you can find almost anything you need, if you're willing to look and use your imagination.The best day to go is Tuesday, since they restock the store Monday.  By Saturday, it can be pretty picked over.  Sundays are closed.I can't say enough good things about this place.  It makes me want to barf on "vintage" or "consignment" stores that charge $20 for a shirt you could easily find for $3.

It's just a walk up and order kind of place, but they have some nice tables and chairs set up in front so you can certainly stay and enjoy your food too. My beef (short rib) taco was moist and nicely seasoned. Good bit of spice to it in a warm shell. It wasn't fantastic, but based on the fact that it was free and that the staff members are cranking them out like crazy for the line, it was good. Since this place is across the street from my work, I'll have to go back soon to see what the rest of the Korean BBQ menu is like. I have a feeling a higher rating is in order for this place.

(---update- I know now-) K- Review time. Free wifi and freshly made (not free!) panini? BAM. I'm there. Espresso here is fabulous. Shots are always pulled to perfection. I'm not sure what chocolate sauce they use- but the kid (and me, yes) dig the steamers/hot chocolate. From the look on Mia's face- they make a mean chocolate cookie...but the bulging eyes could have been the effect of a sugar high.... Inside, the ceilings are high and the walls are decorated with soulful art. This is somewhere I actually enjoy sitting...there are comfortable/plush couches and leather chairs...even a chess board table. (or two?) Customer service is top notch, and always cheery. As mentioned in previous reviews, they sell gelato- Ill have to give it a try this summer.

The only thing I will change from now on is that I will take the dessert to go as I know I will enjoy it later without feeling overstuffed. The prices are OK, the decor is very pretty, the service is very good and they have always been very sweet to me.

We ordered the sampler appetizers and yeah it was a plate full of fried heaven.  The jalapeno poppers and fried zuke sticks were average-  you can't really make those taste extraordinary or anything.  (Unless you make poppers the way my family does while camping on the coast:  jalapenos wrapped in fresh abalone and bacon, stuffed with spinach and pepperjack and fried.  Mmmmm.)  But I digress.  The fried potstickers were freaking good, not greasy at all and instead of just mozzarella they also used jack and blue in the fried cheese sticks.  Our bartender kicked ass.  She was friendly, talkative, and quick on the refills.  I just recently discovered a drink called the Dirty Palmer and I wasn't sure she'd know about it.  She did AND she busted out the sweet tea vodka to make it.  And then I promptly had to stop by the store on my way home to pick up a bottle because I heart booze.  About $24 for 5 cocktails and a good size sampler platter for two, not bad!  Really chill and laid back bar.  I'd love to come back for dinner and see how the menu has changed since they got new owners.

Plus if you can't finish it all, leftover chinese food... (you know you love it)As far as faux meats go, I personally think it's not my favorite but not bad at all.The service is quick and I'm talking about quick! During the week, it's like a ghostown in that place except for one other table of people being occupied.  So it's normal to only have to wait approximately 10 minutes for most dishes.  It's pretty authentic as far as Chinese food goes and overall the best bang for your buck.

Arrived at 7:20ish and I expected a line out the door like in SJ or OC, but there were a handful of groups waiting and the estimated wait time for 2 was 30-45 min. I think we waited for exactly 45 minutes. Not bad at all! I ordered cajun fries medium spicy, 1 pound of shrimp and 1 pound of crawfish the whole sha-bang medium. Usually I get my stuff mild but the spiciness at BC is always less that promised and it was the same here. Medium spicy is just right. I also got corn on the side for 75 cents in butter. YUM it was super sweet. Everything was delicious but maybe because I've been craving crawfish since I heard BC was coming to Sac. Two bad things: 1.) No beer! A beer would have hit the spot for sure.2.) 25 cents for ice water because they filter it? Lame. I'll be back definitely when the hype dies down and when they serve beer. 3.5 stars.

It's like Eddy's Deluxe with adult beverages. I met up with some fun folks for a UYE on Wednesday night. I thought the place was so cool I brought my wife back the following Saturday Night. Her bangs match the joint. The Hideaway is very roomy. Long bar, table and chairs in the middle and pool tables on the outskirts. They also have booth seating available too. I always like to belly up to the bar. They have all kinds of good beer in a bottle....they even have Moose Drool! Olympia on draft for two bucks. The friendly bartendress was all dolled up in a retro outfit with ample cleavage ready to serve the thirsty patrons. They also have cool pics all over the place....even an ode to Evil Knieval. I like the jukebox. It's not an Internet jukey it's the real thing. Fonzie would love to bang on the jukebox. Plenty of good tunes to sip the suds to. From cool old school country, Johnny Cash, to classic rock like The Who and the Stones. NO Justin Beiber! There's also Amy Winehouse for the ladies. Another thing I like about The Hideaway is the NASCAR pinball machine and the legendary Golden Tee golf game. I didn't play either one of them due to the company I was keeping..."Hey, honey you sit here and look pretty while I go play some video games." But I will play me some Pinball next time I make a getaway to the Hideaway.

The meatballs in marinara are excellent and will probably become a habit for me. The sauce is chunky, rich, and slightly spicy and the meatballs had a great savory flavor.As I was eating, Abe, the owner (who was not the guy I thought was the owner) came over to ask how everything was. I complimented the marinara and I guess it's actually a family recipe from his great grandparents, who moved here from Naples. Neat!As is the case with most new restaurants, they will need to go through some trial and error to determine the best way to have the cashiers set up to avoid confusion and make the line as efficient as possible. I am not going to dock them stars for anything like that though. I was through the line and had my food in less than five minutes.Pro tip: if nothing else, get the green apple gelato. It has little bits of real apple in it.

I think folks from a lot of walks of life feel the same way.  What really pushes a 5 star rating for mile is the Sun-Thurs karaoke.  Rob is the best KJ around.  There's always a few people that are really good, but mostly it's folks with minimal talent and a lot of love for rocking the mic.  Also it seems there is always at least one borderline transient/ misunderstood loner that rolls in by themselves, gets in their one song for the glory, and leaves going about their night. You wonder what's in their head.  Maybe it's our encouragement that keeps them going.  I like to think that.  Judge for yourself- youtube.com/watch?v=7DAVAnyway, drink prices/pours and barkeeps are cool, even the older lady that snapped at because she assumed I was ordering water all night.  It's a good place for times good and bad.  Do it.

It's run by a little old man, Joe Laszlo, who smokes the fish right in the shop. You can smell the sweet barbeque from the sidewalk--intense and inviting. Joe has one, small cooler with only a few trays of smoked fish awaiting your purchase. When you taste it, you'll understand why: it's always fresh.The first time I bought a piece of Laszlo's smoked fish, it was an impulse buy for my husband. He's a big smoked-fish fan. Allow me to set the scene...So, I'm buying my hubby's fish when Joe Laszlo asks if I would like a napkin."A napkin?" I think. Maybe Mr. Laszlo assumes I'm on a picnic in Old Sac, here for a full day of tourism. "No thanks," I reply. He looks at me with wise eyes. "Are you sure? Have you ever tried my fish before?"I can see that he knows something I don't. He seems like such a sweet old man, and he's staring at me with a look of expectance. I don't want to disappoint him, so I reach into the bag of fish and take a bite. My fingers are almost instantly dripping from the sweet, moist nugget I now hold on my tongue. I'm experiencing the softest, meaty morsel wrapped in a bed of smoked honey. Divine.I just returned again from Laszlo's, where I bought two card deck-sized pieces of fat, smoked salmon for $15. This time I took the napkin he offered. There's no waiting till you get home to bite into this juicy goodness!

We had a 7:30 reservation the Saturday night before Christmas because I had the brilliant idea of getting my dad to take the family out and knew he likes Bandera.  We were there about 15 minutes early and it was pretty busy.  The hostess was really friendly and let us know that some of the bigger parties were camping out and apologized for the wait...even though we were a little early....and that we were still waiting on my sister.  We grabbed drinks at the big bar that takes center stage and chatted while we waited.  The hostess came over about 7:35 and again apologized and offered us a free appetizer while we waited so we had the smoked salmon appetizer that is always good and were seated shortly after that.  Everything was great which was no surprise....and how can you not love the free corkage?!?  I tasted my mom's ribs and they were absolutely amazing...the best I've had (with the exception of Berg W.'s) and I'm really not a big ribs person usually.  The server was great and even sent us home with 2 big prime rib bones for my little puppy.  I can't wait to come back!

<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/22/2008,2/18/2009,93,15,6,5,7>Freeport Bakery is one divine little joint. Small, with pretty displays, shiny glass cases, little round tables, and sunlight streaming through the storefront. The fruit tarts hover high above the other offerings . . . and the cakes? I've promised I'll never utter the phrase "to die for" so I'll just say that FB's cakes are worthy of a swift fall from a steep cliff and leave it at that. Try the bee hive (not the hair do, the cake.) I'm sorry to say that the cupcakes fall  disappointingly short - they're obviously fresh and made with good ingredients, but have been - every time we've purchased them - overcooked or under-moistened.  And the cookies don't keep up with other bakeries. Stick to the high ticket items and you'll be in business. What I love best about this place, bar none, (oh dear, something about FB is making me spout cliches) is that the counter girls are often times Sutterville Elementary moms. Go, Stingrays! Can't they make an iced sugar Stingray with silvery-blue icing? Now THAT would be  cookie worth stocking up on!

I really wanna see this place prosper for a long time, or as long as I'm nearby, but I'm afraid of the prognosis if they don't broaden the menu to include something more filling. There are no entrees on the menu of any kind...just sandwiches on the smallish side. But maybe that's the American in me that wants to pig out.Actually, those smallish sandwiches are pretty perfect for a quick lite breakfast. Very tasty, with fresh, quality ingredients (thick-cut bacon with superb smokiness), and enough cheese to usurp the definition of "melty" from Taco Bell. (I don't think Tricon owns that word; you can play it in Scrabulous! (Those "useful" votes are gonna stream in now!)) For $3.50, it was a priced-right pleaser in a comfortable environment (even if a little too "New American Bistro"-style for me) served by very friendly people.Here's to hoping they expand that kitchen to get a grill!

Is there any end to the array of dishes they know how to prepare? Curries, stir fry, appetizers, noodles, salads, BBQ... You want it, they got it (if it's Thai or Laotian food)!2) The "Thai smile" I get from the waiter and his fast service3) The magazines available, I assume for single diners. What a great idea! I would totally come here to eat alone and flip through a Cosmo while I devour some pad thai.4) The posters in the bathroom of nutritional recommendations, encouraging consumption of more veggies. If there's one thing America needs to hear, it's that!5) Cute decorAs far as the food goes, I've tried the Tom Yum Gai soup, the BBQ combo, the green curry, the fried banana with coconut ice cream... All delicious. Great little casual stop for Thai food.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2007,3/11/2007,23,23,8,6,4>Discovering the existence of Chicken and Waffles in Sacramento left me stupendously, spectacularly, moronically excited-- so excited, in fact, that no more than ten seconds passed between me reading Alan's review and me sprinting my jiggly ass out to my car to head to Arden and Howe so I could experience this for myself.First, a little context: I flat out, unequivocally love the combination of chicken and waffles. I have, on more than one occasion driven to Los Angeles for no reason other than to go to Roscoe's House of Chicken 'n' Waffles. I have made excuses to drive to Oakland or Berkeley  to get chicken and waffles. Now that I have an option in Sacramento, I don't have to make those excuses anymore and I couldn't be happier about it.I ordered the Bonnie 'n' Clyde special, which is one succulent breast and one delicious waffle. The chicken was ultra-crispy, the waffle a cloud of syrup-covered joy.Clearly, I can't make a rational judgment about the quality of the food, but I will probably make frequent returns to this joint. If you see an increasingly fatter gentleman with a look of ecstasy (and possibly some chicken skin) on his face, say howdy.

You're seated with a small bowl of miso broth, and whether you're ordering rolls, udon or yosenabe (the traditional meat and veggie stew), the menu is well priced and dishes are well made. Unlike the tacky "rock and roll" sushi nonsense around town where the rolls are as big as tea saucers and have all kinds of deep fried parts and sauces to obscure second rate fish, the menu here is simpler and more traditional and in three visits the fish has been consistently good. Highly recommended for their affordable lunch boxes too.   For those put off by the drab exterior, inside its cozy and comfortable, with lots of natural wood, white paper lanterns and comfortable seating.

<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2007,3/4/2007,6,7,,2,3>Let me just begin by saying that I am by no means a connoisseur of tea.  Being from the south, I have a special place in my heart for what some may consider over-sweetened Lipton ice tea--especially on a hot day.  That said, I am able to appreciate the occasional hot tea.  There is something calming about sipping a warm mug of tea that doesn't come with the desperate attempts at fast caffeination accompanying my morning Java.  Thus, Hina's offered a great way to relax after a long day.  Recently relocated from Folsom, this tea house is sleekly decorated and offers around 400 types of tea.  With helpful staff, it is great for those who, like me, are somewhat interested in tea but wouldn't know how to select from such an overwhelming list.  I believe those who really know tea would be happy here too (as is evidenced by the other reviews).  I had a white tea, the name of which is escaping me at this moment (something with needles in it).  It was good, but not great- I think this is due to my inability to order not to the tea being "bad."  My husband ordered this wonderful herbal tea called "on the waterfront" that was delicious.  Next time I'll try the jasmine pearls- I smelled them after I had my tea and it was like a whole garden in a jar!  They also have coffee for those who are dragged there by their tea-loving friends.  I should also mention that I felt it was slightly pricey- our tab for 2 mugs of tea was over $6- but like I said, I'm no expert on these things.  Overall, our trip to Hina's was a very pleasant experience and we'll definitely be back.  My husband is even considering moving his coffee addiction over to tea, but we'll see how far he gets with that.

Located behind the Alhambra Safeway, this facility is newer and nicer than their other RAS locations.I have been here for many visits with my 93 year old grandmother (and once for myself). The facility itself is aesthetically and architecturally pleasing (warm greens, browns, and other earth tones) plus very easy to navigate. Sparkly and clean. Their intake process is courteous and efficient.Imaging staff are always kind and professional. They took great care in assisting my grandmother during her renal ultrasound today.If you are having a mammogram, I highly recommend this facility over the other RAS sites. Parking is a snap (and you pay for it -- this seems to be a newer trend for most medical offices these days).

This is no Sprinkles, but still a very good cupcakery.      Great flavor selection and beautifully decorated. Please see my pics. Most of the cupcakes are $2.50 each. Kinda steep I know, but Cravings turns eating a cupcake into an event. The flavors are unique, In my opinion the standout flavor is Monkey Mania, banana cake with caramel filling and cream cheese frosting. The S'more Galore is chocolate cake, marshmellow center and chocolate frosting sprinkled w gram crackers. They offer mini cupcakes but you have to ask for them, because they were not in the display case. They even offer some sugar free flavors, made with sorbitol ($3.00). Great service, eager to tell you about the flavors. This is a fun place to take kids. There is no where to sit, So you either take them to go or eat them in the car.     One tiny criticism is that the cupcakes were cold, maybe they were refrigerated at some point. The cupcakes I took home and ate  at room temperature had a much better flavor.    Definitely a place you want to try.

Asian lady can muster up that much strength.  If you get the wrong (pissed off?) lady she will beat your legs up.  I need to look up the Vietnamese word for "gentle".PS.  If you are a guy considering this, please note that getting any type of color, including just gloss will expose you to ample ridicule.
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2007,10/24/2007,78,50,8,2,5>When we rolled into the London bar, I noticed there was a back area open which I thought was pretty cool. I eventually got a beer at the bar and then wandered to the back. At this point everyone was pretty much split up throughout the entire bar and thoroughly WASTED. I notice THE JUDGE at the opposite end of the bar talking to girls! I thought....this can't be, how is Judge actually sitting and talking to a group of girls? I walk up and try to overhear/jump in the conversation and at that moment I see Judge begin to flinch and get a serious look into his eyes. He looks around first at me, then at the girls and finally directs his eyes to the bartender. At that moment he realizes that neither the girls or the bartender are paying attention to him and he turns his head, and begins to vomit all over the floor in front of him. I immediately reacted and thought, "Oh shit we are definitely getting kicked out of the bar now!" I run outside to let everyone know that  Judge just vomited all over the place and we need to bounce ASAP. I found that no one really cared about the news and resumed to their business. I then run back in to check out the scene and verify that everything is okay. I see Judge in the same seat, talking to the same girls and ordering another drink from the same bartender as if nothing had happened. I thought, "WTF did I just imagine that whole thing happening?" I then look down on the ground and see vomit all over the floor, but it's so crowded no one around can really see it. Amazingly enough I was the only person in the bar that actually saw Judge vomit and he completely played it off like nothing had happened. I thought, "Well shit, if he is still talking to these girls, I'm not going to start busting his balls. I mean I just witnessed a miracle happen! How often can you say you puked all over a bar without a sole seeing it and then being able to order another drink and commence with your game upon 2 beautiful girls? I have to hold my tongue and let this man progress with his personal miracle!" Shortly after that I see my other friend Martin, who is pretty much a douche bag, begin to start a fight at the front of the bar. After getting punched like 2 or 3 times until he finally gets thrown out of the bar by the bouncer. I was so stunned by the fact of the miracle that I just saw, and really did not care one bit for the guy that was getting kicked out of the bar, that it just did not even register as something to care about. We spend a good hour or so there and I am able to find a seat at the bar with another friend Damon.   He is BLACKED out and is finishing up his drink when he makes the exact same face as Judge. I think, "Holy shit, not again." He grabs his cup and is able to control himself a bit more and proceeds to vomit in his empty beer cup! Completely fills the cup up with puke, puts it back on the bar and turns to me and signals that it is time to go. Any bar that can go through hell like that is a good bar in my eyes...The story continues : yelp.com/biz/EvuYJ0CiN8F

So anyway, long story short, I walked in and showed my necklace to the guy, he looked at it, weighed it, and 5 minutes later I walked out minus one hideous necklace and carrying 86 dollars in cold, hard cash.

He knew EVERYTHING about the food on the menu. He memorized the specials of the evening so well, describing them to the tee, he made everything sound very appealing and appetizing.  It was like he was telling a story, Ch1 appetizers, Ch2 entrees, Ch3 dessert.  I was loving it.  The soup special was a mushroom bisque with truffle oil drizzled on top...BEST mushroom soup ever. I'm not joking. I had a taste of it and immediately wished that I had ordered it.  I went with fettuccine special with the slowly simmered beef/red wine ragu. Also, amazing, really good. Tasted exactly like what the server described it would be like.For dessert our table shared the white chocolate raspberry swirl gelato and the creme brulee (hazelnut, caramel & chocolate) sampler type thing.  The gelato was thick and creamy and you could taste the freshness of the raspberry puree swirl in it.Everything about my night at Lucca was great.  Super attentive and friendly server, great food and atmosphere.  I really cant believe these are the same people that own Roxy...Roxy could learn a lot from this place.Minus only one star because their waiting area is extremely small. And they ran out of gnocchi which I originally wanted to order.  I suggest you have reservations so you are not stuck being sardined for a while.

Like so many others I come here almost daily.  All the employees know me by name.  Now I usually order Zang (plain yogurt) with strawberries, orange mochi, and dark chocolate chips.  I swear they put "herbs" in this stuff to keep me coming back.  I asked the owner if he was going to expand outside of downtown and he replied back with a smile.  Why?  I've gotten several of my friends addicted to mochii yogurt and they want the owner to open one in Folsom and Roseville where my friends live.  Maybe it's a bit selfish of us to want him to open up more locations but he's responsible for getting us addicted to this stuff.  Anyway.  My two cents worth.  My 5th visit to mochii:Okay, I'm officially a mochii addict.  You know you're an addict when everyone knows you by name and they say "see you tomorrow."  Zang it up!   I now prefer Zang over Blueberry or Blackberry.  Maybe, my taste is changing and now I just want the tang with fruit.  I love the fact they use crushed fruit in the flavoring of their yogurt not high fructose corn syrup like everyone else.  Their attention to detail is incredible.  I learn something new each time I go to mochii.  I  tried out the other yogurt places in town to expand my horizons but I keep coming back to mochii.  Last night, I was fortunate enough to have bumped into the owner.  Mark.  He was kind enough to listen to my recommendations and explained to me how the yogurt is made at mochii.  I was impressed.  He told me that they hand pick their own wild blackberries and crush them to make the Blackberry Crush flavored yogurt.  Amazing.  I never knew that yogurt could become such an art.  I'm loving this place...---First of off I'm not a big yogurt or dessert kind of person.  I just moved from Southern California where the yogurt craze is absolutely ridiculous.  I've tried them all and they all taste almost the same.  No innovation.  Just a bunch of people copying one another.  I expected the same at mochii.  I was wrong.My friend Jen - who's a food snob -  told me about a place called Mochii and some flavor called blueberry crush or something like that.  She also said that their Japanese mochi is handmade.  I had my doubts.I went and I tried it.  OMG!! I was like what?!  This can't be!   I sampled Zang and it's pretty darn good but I'm hooked on their blueberry flavor.  I don't know how they did it but the flavor is a a perfect balance of sweet and tang.  Mochii, did you consciously make it this way?  Or did you just luck out?  OR I'm I giving you way too much credit for this?  Holy mother of Venus.  (gulp)  It's that good.  Try it with the strawberries.  The counter person, I think her name was Thee, was very helpful (and cute) in explaining to me that they use crushed blueberries in their yogurt and that Osaka Ya custom makes all the mochi for mochii.   Anyway back to the yogurt....damn.  It was delicious.   Mochii has got it down.  This is quite possibly the best froyo that i've ever had.  Now I just need a higher paying  job to feed my new habit.  Their prices are a bit high ($4.95 for a medium combo - c'mon!!) and they could use more outside seating, but damn mochii why do you have to taste soo goooood!!??   Oh, and their green tea mochi is delicious!  I swear it kept me up all night.  Mochii, if you're reading this please think of having a frequent customer reward card and a discount for students.  You're breaking me!

I went to visit him for Father's Day and his only request was for me to stop by ABC and pick him up a dozen pork bao. I asked, "Don't you have a close Chinese bakery? After 2 hours on the road, the bao are gonna be cold and my car is going to smell like food." His response, "They have the best bao, even if you have to reheat them in the microwave. No one cares about your car."

Nope, no more brunches. Jim Denny's? Closed Sundays as well. A & I almost end up at (ugh) Zocalo but then remember that we wanted to try some food at Le Petit Paris! YAY, so happy we did.Ce café est très mignon! We needed coffee in a bad way and they had the perfect remedy...French press for two! We split a three cheese quiche & a ham, brie & fig spread toasted on a crunchy yet soft baguette (this was fantastic). What a perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon. To top off our morning meal we had a couple delicious little pistachio macarons. We enjoyed all this in the cute backyard patio (why don't more places have these?) while almost finishing the NY Times crossword puzzle.  The very sweet lady at the counter threw in a raspberry one for us to taste! It's so inviting & everyone is very friendly.We will be back? You'd better believe it! Check it out & while you are there, look around at all the fun items for sale. C'est merveilleux!

Everyone is really friendly and I don't feel out of place in my 9-5 clothes, while other patrons are flashing their full sleeves and metal band t shirts. I'd had a sampling of what their kitchen had to offer at an Elite event and was really impressed at what was coming out of the bar, but thought it might just be a fluke for the event. I've since been back and tried some of their other food and I must say Billy, the chef, is doing his thang. The tuna tartar was really good and refreshing on a summer day. The breakfast sandwich was really tasty, as well as the fingerling potatoes that accompanied them. I think it's a really nice touch that they offer free coffee with a food purchase. As I type I'm trying to see how I can rearrange my schedule so I can get there to try their Juicy Lucy or Peach panini.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2010,9/9/2010,512,236,25,16,18>Good girls don't talk about their dirty business.But I will say, this is the classiest spot in midtown with awesome employees.Was once there making a purchase while a group of drunk kids came in to fool around, the employee very quickly and discreetly wrapped up our purchase as to not cause any attention to the drunks. Yay!They have a great selection of lubricants and all sorts of shinanigans that make me giggle!The employees are very informative, do not be afraid to ask for help! Believe me, about 90% of the gadgets in there confuse me.

<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/2/2010,9/6/2010,88,30,11,6,10>THREE and 1/2 STARSAlacazam! When you walk in, the drab strip mall business transforms into the inside of an exotic tent, complete with people lounging around small tables on the floor. Definitely one of the cooler interior decorating jobs around town.The owner (I think he's the owner) is friendly, and gladly welcomed us into the heart of the tent. We didn't have the same strange experiences with him that are in the other reviews - maybe he was standing in for the owner. Maybe it's because we didn't speak English with him, or he was too busy to linger? The food is as good as it needs to be, but no better. It's tasty enough, but doesn't rise to the heights this cuisine is capable of. The place is romantic, though - the tajines were slightly exotic, but not enough to shock. The pastilla had a heart dusted on it with cinnamon. And sitting in a Berber tent while sucking sauce off your fingers is certainly different. Although sucking it off your date's fingers would certainly be an improvement, and a novel method of foreplay...If you're there on the right night, there may be a belly dancer. She's wearing a lot of veils. This isn't a place where you can see if she's vajazzled. That's a good thing. There really are some things you shouldn't do in front of your partner on a romantic evening. If you're (un)lucky, the dancer may invite you to stand up and jiggle with her. Like virtually every other American guy, I never learned to belly dance, nor figured out exactly what I'm supposed to do when face to face with all that jiggling. If you want a taste of Moroccan food in an exotic atmosphere hidden inside a totally unremarkable strip mall, this is definitely your place!
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2010,9/5/2010,356,378,4,9,8>Bombay absolutely exceeded my expectations. I'm not a huge fan of Indian food, but the Chana Masala and the Baigan Bharta blew my mind! How do those little bowls of food get people so full?! The naan was warm, soft and chewy (thanks Eduardo for sharing, again!). It tasted even better after I piled some of my food on top. Super scrumptious! And the Indian beers. They were so wonderful and refreshing. Hurray for chilled glasses! And lastly the service. All of the staff were so nice, checking to see if we were alright and always keeping our cups full with water. Our lady server was so accommodating, allowing us to split our bills without giving us crap for it. I'm so glad our Vegetarian-Vegan Food Club had our second outing here. Food, beer, service, all superb! No doubt I will be here again really soon!
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2010,9/4/2010,179,181,3,3,5>I have nothing but good things to say about Dr. Malka and the office staff. My boyfriend and I started bringing our two pet rats to see Dr. Malka after they developed respiratory problems, and he was recommended as an exotic pets specialist with knowledge of pets of this stature. Dr. Malka was knowledgeable, friendly and understanding, and we felt comfortable with the treatment he provided. I can't say whether the costs incurred AT the vet were cheap or expensive as far as pet care goes, but I know that they made a conscious effort to save me money on medicine for my pets by sending me to an outside pharmacy for one prescription and combining both rats' medicine into one order in-house to save on costs. As time progressed, one rat became sick enough to be put to sleep, and the entire office was sweet about the whole ordeal, despite Cadbury being "just a rat." A couple weeks later, I received a package of condolences in the mail with a note and a handmade ornament with Cadbury's name and paw prints on it. I wouldn't think twice about taking my next pets to this clinic.
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2013,7/12/2014,179,181,8,15,10>My review of New Helvetia has been a long time coming. Because I live nearby, and coupled with a boyfriend who loves a good craft brew, we often end up here, to hang out with friends, to banter with the staff, and taste their wares. At first I was a tad worried about the consistency of their beer, but they quickly won me over. The staff is awesome, and the beer has long won me over. I'm glad there is such a positive neighborhood resource close by.  They invite different local food trucks to serve food to complement their beer, and even host family friendly and community events. I'm never quite sure what I might find when I go. The impromptu music sessions are the best! I never thought I'd be surrounded by German police officers playing accordions (one random music roundup). So awesome. I appreciate that they're kid and dog friendly, and I never hesitate to bring our wiener dog for a good time with lots of social interaction on the back patio. I've never had an adverse experience with patrons with young children, either, so I'm not sure what the fuss is about. I really can't say enough good things about Dave and his staff. They support the local community while serving good brews. What more can you ask for?
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/21/2014,7/11/2014,591,132,9,15,13>Bag King is the King of Bags. I'm planning to fly out to the Big Easy and I needed 'bigger' and 'easier' to carry duffel bag. I'm a very particular person and I had a couple of name brand bags I had in mind. So with Yelp's help I searched the brands. And the ONLY shop to come up was Bag King located off of I-80 and Northgate. The place had barely any reviews. So I said 'Why Not?' I went in and low and behold this place is STACKED! The amount of bags are ridiculous overwhelming in a rather small space. Mindless to say this was a plus when trying to find my particular bag from all different types of shapes and color. I was greeted by the friendly store manager and she offered help and allowed me to explore all their fine selections. I was shown to a desktop computer in the store where the computers internet browser was pulled up to their website. The store is actually an online based store with this location being it's warehouse. Lucky me, it's  conveniently located right here in Sacramento! Two things that popped into my head. No shipping and I can physically see and try it on before purchasing it thus avoiding the hassle of returning it if it's too big or simply not meeting my expectations.This place has it all from luggage, duffels and many other miscellaneous travel supplies. So I got onto the computer and searched all the bags instock and the store manager was more than happy to bring the bag out, opened it and allowed me to try it on. Eventually I found THE ONE a Herschel all black Walton duffel. I was very pleased to find it and used the President's day discount they offered at the time. An unusual recommendation for this place but if you plan on traveling anytime soon whether road or flight. Check this place out first before going to your local department store. Their selections are absolutely phenomenal! I already know I'm coming back here before my Hawaii trip.Sold.
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2014,7/10/2014,131,153,10,13,12>Rancho lacks ice cream shops (everyone is into the froyo fad still), so when I found out this place serves froyo AND ice cream, I was on it! I walked inside late this past Sunday night and was pleased to see they were still open. The store itself is pretty spacious and very clean (by very clean I mean there weren't any toppings on the ground or scattered around the countertops, as is the usual with most froyo shops.) They had more than half a dozen froyo flavors, along with a handful or more of ice cream flavors that you can get samples of. I tried a sample of their Birthday Cake ice cream and fell in love (literally!) I ordered a scoop of that in a regular cone, which came out to $3.19. I thought it was pretty pricy for a no-name ice cream place but every now and then, I'm okay with splurging.The Birthday Cake ice cream was INCREDIBLE! It had HUGE chunks of birthday cake batter inside and lots of it! If you're a cookie dough ice cream fan and like that kind of doughy consistency, you will love this flavor! I devoured it all within a matter of minutes and was licking my lips for more.I've also tried their Dragon Blood shaved ice before, too, which was up to par. I can't wait to come back here and possibly try more ice cream flavors or revisit my new Birthday Cake favorite!**EDIT: I discovered they serve Gunther's ice cream, which explains why their ice cream is a little on the expensive side. However, after going to this place more than a handful of times, I can vouch for the superb quality of their delicious ice cream! Their  portions are also extremely generous, which makes it well worth the price! They have fantastic customer service, too. For this reason, I've updating my review from 4 to 5 stars.**

Don't let that through you off. This place is pretty delicious.I had the super burrito with chicken. The chicken was juicy and had a great flavor. They lost a star here because like with many burritos it was all chicken, than all sour cream etc. You gotta mix that sish up before you roll. My hub had the beef taco and pork tamales. Holy cow! I've never been a big tamales person but these were flaky but still moist, and the sauce was spicy but not overly so. You could really tell they were freshly prepared. The service is similar to a Jack's- order get a number, have a seat and they will find you. Both our order taker and runner were friendly and smiling. The food also didn't take very long which I liked. Our total only came to about 15 bucks. Not bad when you consider we both had leftovers and shared dessert. We got a cream stuffed churrio as we were leaving. So I would recommended coming here on one of your cheat days! Haha.

Two other Yelp buds were also going, so we all planned to do the same heat.This was my first mud run and it was exactly what I expected. Ok, maybe a little less muddy than I expected, but otherwise exactly what I had in mind. We started off by running until I realized the three fatal errors I had made that morning: I wore shorts instead of capris, which ride up when I run; I wore the WRONG sports bra for running; and I forgot to take my insulin (which causes a fair amount of chest pain and shortness of breath). These three factors pretty much ruled out any running for me- bummer. It was a good day for it.  So instead, we walked. The course itself was located in a really pretty park and it was a great day for a nice walk with friends, so we were able to enjoy that part of it.The color tunnel that started it off was anti-climactic. If you're gonna color me in powder, do that shit! I want to look like an Easter egg when I'm done! But instead I just had some yellow on my wrist and a blue spot on my boob that kept concerning me as it caught my eye throughout the race. Under a wall here, over a wall there, a bit of mud in your shoes... It wasn't bad. The obstacles were easy and kinda fun. Climbing over the mesh rope hill was pretty fun, but still super easy. During one obstacle where you walk through a suspended rope grid, I went to imitate one of my friends to be funny, and immediately caught my foot and fell on my ass. Well, at least I was funny. Lol.Best obstacle: Mud slide, far and away. What's not to love?Worst obstacle: Mud pit at the finish line. Aside from the a-hole who blinded me with mud (who was that again, Jennifer???), the floor was all these tiny rocks, which you had to climb over on your knees.  OWWWWW, my knees were TORE UP.  There goes my social life.Overall, good way to spend a Saturday with friends, and it was super awesome that they let us Yelpers in for free! Thank you Pretty Muddy for breaking me into the mud, and thank you Yelp and Alex for picking us to send in for free!  Lots of fun and I would definitely do it again and recommend it to my friends. Not to mention I have a super cute finisher medal to show off.  :)

TurnAround is staffed entirely by volunteers and Clean & Sober program alumni, who receive job training for their free services. 100% of its proceeds go straight to providing housing for the neediest people in Sacramento. How? All of their sales go to funding Clean & Sober's ten town homes, housing over 60 formerly homeless addicts and alcoholics and giving them employment and education opportunities as a path to recovery.TurnAround serves gourmet coffees using locally grown beans from Capricorn Coffee Roasters out of San Francisco, plus LaBou pastries and sandwiches. At the soft opening we were immediately greeted by a young and friendly staff behind the counter. The interior is modern and industrial with some homey touches. In one corner, a plush rug flanked by cushy couches provide an inviting seating area. A window wall bathes the room in sunlight, giving a peek of the nearby courthouse. To the other side, some barstools and a counter are tucked into a nook, where patrons can connect their devices and work undisturbed.A simple coffee shop with good intentions, their motto is "Change in Every Cup."

<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/31/2013,7/5/2014,324,135,10,13,13>Tapa the World is the best place to go in Sacramento when you want to feel like you're not in Sacramento.There's a great energy here--a mystifying mix of rural peace and urban bustle that's distinctly European. Add to that unique and scrumptious tapas, an addictive sangria, wines, beers and coffees, and an open kitchen where the clean plates are stacked high on the service bar and it's like sitting in a cafe in the heart of Barcelona. Make sure to try the Tortilla Española and both the Croquetas and Empanadas del Día. The two latter bites have varied ingredients from day to day. The last time I had the Croquetas they featured curried duck. Heaven. Another go-to is the Grilled Vegetables, which is a hearty plate of whatever's fresh that day bathed in a mouth-flooding Romesco sauce and clad in Manchego cheese. It could easily be a meal.If you're looking to stuff yourself, go directly to the Paella Mixta. This is a cornucopia of seafood, chicken, chorizo and rice, built for two and perfect for a romantic dinner.And speaking of romance, I'd recommend Tapa the World for 1st dates, anniversary meals and let's-get-in-the-mood snacking. It's got that dim, candled lighting, soft music(live guitarist on the weekends) and plenty of tables for two tucked away from the hustle of the wait staff. It's ideal for conversation--whether you're just getting to know someone or sharing the kind of intimate details only a plate of olives and Spanish meats and cheeses can bring out.This is your escape, Sacramento. Go!
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2014,7/4/2014,206,100,9,13,11>I have come back here a handful of times since my first review and have usually just had a beer and an appetizer. I finally came back to sit down and have another meal, and give it another shot. I recently came in here with the wife to get a quick sit down meal. Our server was a young guy named, I believe, Nick. He was really helpful and very nice. Way better than the service I had received in the past. I wanted something a little different and ordered the shrimp and grits. The shrimp or prawns were large and cooked in a Cajun seasoning. Very tasty. The grits were those really good cheesy grits they served at the Happy tails event a while back for all you Yelpers that were there. If you like shrimp and grits, they were really good. Better than I expected. They were served with vegetables. Even the vegetables were cooked well. I got the cup of soup with the meal. It was Philly cheese steak soup. It sounded interesting so I had to get it. It was so creamy, and cheesy. I really liked this soup. If this is a regular soup, I will be back way more often.I was way more impressed with our server on this visit than in the past. He made sure our drinks were full and that we were happy with our food. He is the main reason I finally am updating my review. Unlike the past visits, he was pretty familiar with the beers and quickly recommended a couple to choose from. I will be back, and hopefully It keeps getting better.

Naturally I fall for each and every way in which the Jelly Belly Candy Company markets to me, and no, the five stars aren't for their sneaky underhanded techniques that transform my money into their money.The five stars are for the way in which a single trip here pretty much wrapped up all the loose ends on my Christmas Gift list, kept Zoey entertained for an hour, and in doing so provided me my first sense of relief during this hectic holiday season. I am so sick of shopping, and I just want to lay on the couch for three days without any Christmas Carols whatsoever and watch every episode of Boardwalk Empire while eating Jelly Beans and potato chips. I am pretty annoyed by all of this Christmas crap at this point. I am tired and whiny now. I need a break from this holiday spirit that disappears in January when everyone goes back to being an asshole. Well, maybe not EVERYONE, but probably most people.Anyway, there is a jukebox thing that the kids like. It costs a quarter a pull, and you can win varying amounts of candy. This helps the kids understand chance and prepare for playing slot machines when they turn 21, which is a skill many can learn rather quickly. Zoey apparently hit the jackpot, but I was honestly unimpressed by the amount of beans awarded in her jackpot. Being the A+ mom that I am, I feigned great shock and awe when she showed me her bounty. "All that for a quarter!!!" She plumb cleaned me right out of quarters. She liked that JB jukebox machine. Oh, hell ya.She was terrified of the balloon thing outside; just absolutely terrified. I asked her if she had a negative experience with it previously to which she answered: "NO MAMA, NOOOOOO! I want to come to Mama, No!!!! NOOOO!" I found her reaction very irrational given that she is willing to sit on anyone's lap who even vaguely looks Santa-ish. All she had to do was walk by the balloon, and she totally flipped. Unbelievable.For making it to the end of this review, you get a reward in the form of inside information. If you have a AAA card, you can get a 20% discount. If you don't have a AAA card when you check out, say it with me: "I left it in my car with my jumper cables, first aid/survival kit, and snow chains." Why the hell would you need your AAA card in the Jelly Belly Store? That's ridiculous. You can't be jumping through hoops all day just to get a 20% discount. You are busy. You are too old for this nonsense. Ya.
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2014,10/21/2014,642,604,15,23,20>There was a time when going out to eat was a common occurrence in my household.  But times have been financially rough and eating out became more of a rare luxury.  During this long, dry spell of only being able to review non-restaurant type businesses, one of our good Yelp friends commented on my absence from the restaurant scene which included several missed Yelp events.  My story of whoa motivated Douglas Y and his lovely wife Kathy Y into inviting my boyfriend and I to join them at one of their favorite sushi restaurants.  We eagerly accepted his thoughtful invitation!  I looked forward to seeing them again after several months of keeping to ourselves as hermit crabs.   Getting to Roseville is somewhat of a drive from my house, but the price of gas getting there was worth it!  The restaurant was already busy when we arrived, so we ended up eating at the sushi bar instead of a table.  This made it a bit harder for us to chat with each other along the bar, but we still managed to enjoy each others company.  Douglas introduced us to the owner of Ninja Sushi who warmly greeted us.  The rest of the wait staff was also friendly and on the ball.  The sushi chefs had no problem whipping up some low sodium dishes for my boyfriend's restricted diet requirements that included the Baked Scallop roll and the Nigeri.  While I was able to order a sushi roll that was cooked.  Prior to our dinners, we were served complimentary cucumber salads as an appetizer, which was a very nice touch. I had the Dragon Roll that consisted of cooked shrimps and some other ingredients rolled in the traditional sticky rice with seaweed, a delicious sauce and wrapped in foil shaped like a dragon.  Then it is lit on fire!  After a few minutes, the fire fizzles out, and the roll is ready to unwrap and enjoy!  I found it to be pretty good, however there were slices of seared tuna placed on top of the roll that was too raw for me to handle.  Douglas offered me some of his left over American River Roll that had deep fried lobster chunks within that were amazingly delicious!  I'll be sure to order this roll again at my next dining experience here!  Our dinner companions also enjoyed a Mucho Caliente roll that looked appetizing as well.  Everyone enjoyed their sushi, but I couldn't help but be even more impressed, when we were served a complimentary dessert afterwards!  An artistic creation of orange slices, whipped cream, cookie sticks and chocolate sauce that became a sweet ending to top off an awesome meal!  Thank you Douglas & Kathy for guiding us out of our shells and exposing us to the wonderful world of fine (and fun) dining again!  I had almost forgotten what it was like!
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,10/20/2014,1211,148,23,23,22>So...Turns out, my first impression of the place didn't scar me for life. Just for like 7 months. I've been back here numerous times in the last month and a half or so and I have to admit that I AM NOW IN LOVE. Best. Mangoneadas. Everrrr. Well, out of ones I've ambitiously hunted down throughout the years anyways. I've tried ones from street carts, Shop$mart, and even ones in the bay area. Sooooo very glad that my favorite one of them all is right here in Sacramento! With that said, this review will mostly be focused on my obsession for this delicious dessert. Don't know what mangoneadas are? This paragraphs for you. For the rest, please skip to the next passage (yeah, I said "passage" because my fellow yelpers knows I don't write reviews. I write novels). Mangoneada is a frozen Mexican treat with the mix of fresh fruits (if you can't already guess, it's mango in particular), fresh fruit juice, with shaved ice or sorbet, topped with this thick sauce called "chamoy" made from pickled fruit so that it's both sweet and sour at the same time, and some Tajin salt to give it a little kick. Strange perhaps, but in a really good way. I've tried a few different types of the delicious "mangoneada" frozen treats from here. There's ones with just mango. Then there's ones with strawberries. Or a combination of the two. Then there's tamarind flavored kinds. Or a combination of that with the mango (my personal favorite). And then you have your choice of having it made with either shaved ice or real Gunther's fruit freeze. ($5-$5.50)OHHH MAH GERRRD. *droools****Helpful tip: Ones with shaved ice are more drinkable. Stick a straw in and you're good to go (until you decide you must have one of them tasty mango chunks). Ones with Gunther's fruit freeze will be a lot less liquidy and you'll definitely need a spoon the whole time. A straw will do nothing. So when I'm just chilling with a friend or going for a stroll, I prefer the delicious fruit freeze. But if I'm going to drive around or just go home right after picking up a cup, I go for the shaved ice. That way, I won't have to fidget with a spoon so much while trying to focus on the road. Ain't nobody got time foe dat.Regardless of what your choice may be, you can't go wrong with either one. Each cup is packed full of bursting fiesta of flavors! They're not stingy on any of their ingredients here either. You get a very good portion for your money and plenty of mango bites. So yeah, a sweet and spicy dessert? What the hell right? I know, I know...It's kinda what I'd call an acquired taste. So if you don't like it, then acquire some taste. I'm kidding. But it really isn't for everyone and that's okay. Which brings me to my next point.I don't want to have to steal your parking spot and make you cry anyways. Or stand behind you in line that can get very long due to how there's usually only one or two people working. Yes, they have this tinyass parking lot for a plaza that has quite a few opened businesses in it, one being a friggin' salon so you know everybody in there is there to stay for at least an hour or so. And don't even try to park in the neighborhood area that's on the side of Oscar's Mexican food. I drive a tinyass Ford Focus and yet. I could barely turn my car around going down that street where I still can't find parking. And I'm almost certain it's not because I'm Asian. And a woman. But because that street is just as bad as their private lot itself. However, since it's not exactly the business' fault, I won't hold it against them. Also, regardless of how long the lines may get at times, I see that the owner (who's usually always there) always takes his time on everyone's order to insure satisfaction. Oh, and they now accept payment by cards, and at no extra cost (that I know of). Very convenient.I'm so glad I finally came back and got to try out their mouth-watering mangoneadas!
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2013,10/19/2014,290,371,9,17,16>When I got engaged two months ago there were 2 bridal stores highly recommended to me and Miosa was one of them.  After just 2 visits to Miosa (and 1 visit at the other store) I found and fell in love, love loveee with my wedding dress. The first time I visited Miosa I came as a walk-in with a friend and my maid of honor. It was my first time shopping for wedding dresses so I was a little nervous and didn't know what I was looking for or what to expect. The lady working at the front desk introduced me to Susan and she was my consultant through the whole process. Susan began by asking me questions about what styles I had in mind and even then I was clueless. So we began with price range and she pulled a couple dresses for me to try on. While the first two were nice they weren't really my style and then after that the fun began. Susan must have picked up on my personality because I was torn between the two dresses I tried after that. I started to get an idea of what I liked as far as cut, material and patterns. I learned a lot about wedding dresses that day and left Miosa happy thinking I found the dress I was going to order.A week later I returned to Miosa after checking out dresses at the other bridal store all morning. Now I had an even better idea of the price range and style I wanted. I let Susan know what I was interested in and she pulled the old dress, a couple new dresses and veils for me to try. I ended up falling in love with a different dress from the previous week and nothing I tried after that compared to the beauty, fit and radiance of THE DRESS. My heart skipped a beat and my Maid of Honor and Bridesmaid agreed it was the one. After some suggestions by Susan and far as changing an accessory and trying the dress with veils I had my heart set on that dress. It was a newer Kathy Ireland dress that had come in some time after my visit the week before so that's why we hadn't seen it earlier. I considered waiting a few days before ordering but with the deal I was offered and my heart stolen I didn't want to wait any longer and ordered my dress! I've met with the owner Michael and he was very knowledgeable, friendly and customer oriented.  We discussed dresses from other shows and around the world. Susan we extremely helpful and made me feel beautiful and comfortable throughout the whole process. My dress will arrive toward the end of this year and I can't wait to try it on again. I know I'll need to have alterations done so I'll have to post an update on how that goes later on. For now congratulations to all the newly engaged and I highly recommend adding Miosa to your list of places to check out for wedding dresses!
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2014,10/18/2014,98,296,14,17,11>Shine is now under new ownership and wow - it's a HUGE difference.The decor has been updated just enough that it doesn't feel as cluttered and chaotic as it used to. High tables with seats near the stage, a dining room table that I swear belonged to my grandma in the middle of the cafe, a few couches & comfy chairs near the door. There's still artwork on display, but behind the stage there's now a wood-and-light piece that gives the room some warmth and depth that wasn't there before.The food and drinks are fantastic. On Saturday night I arrived early to see my friend Laura's band perform (The Soft Offs, google them, they are lots of fun). I figured I'd make an evening of it with a light meal before the show. I had a veggie-hummus sandwich that was so fresh and fabulous, with chunks of cucumber and avocado along with lettuce and tomato on nine grain bread (which I shouldn't be eating because of gluten, but screw it, this is so healthy and makes me feel self righteous and morally superior). It came with a side salad of mixed greens and carrot shreds with a light vinaigrette. Excellent value. For a beverage I had a cup of the chocolate tea, which was super tasty with a dash of half-and-half in it.The menu of beer and wine options is extensive - I saw a couple hard ciders on the list. A friend who arrived later tried their cranberry zest drink and loved it: sparkling wine with cranberry juice and sweet thyme syrup (and probably another ingredient I'm forgetting). They also have a couple kombucha options on tap if that's your thing.The service was excellent - they brought my tea and sandwich out to me and I didn't have to wait long at all. Friendly, upbeat staff who don't make you feel you aren't hipster enough to linger.Lob handles the bookings for musical acts, and we chatted a bit about the new look & feel of the place. I told him what I'd written before and he said "You're gonna write an updated review, right?" So here you go, dude. And bravo, Shine. You are truly shiny and pretty darn awesome now.

<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2014,10/16/2014,47,42,6,32,12>The boyfriend and I had two dates here (LivingSocial Turkish class, and Groupon Italian class). You need to know a few things:1. It's really difficult to actually schedule a class. When you email about class schedules, pick at least two dates, and make sure they are about a month out. Otherwise you will be emailing back and forth for quite a while.2. There's a mandatory tip, but it really is worth it. The staff does all the prep, demonstrates how to cook, helps you along, plates your food, and then cleans everything up for you.3. You will be cooking with strangers. They'll group you into teams of 8 depending on the size of the total attendance of the night (always into 4 teams). Your group will make or break your experience. We had a really, really obnoxious lady during the Italian class, and I hated every minute of it. However, we had an amazing group for the Turkish class, and loved it. 4. Seriously, you are cooking with strangers. They will do a live demonstration, and then send you into the kitchen where you and your team will make the meal. Depending on the size of your group, this may mean that each person makes a course, or it may mean you only get to prepare a small component. It's more about the experience and socializing than it is learning a skill.5. The parking lot can be a bit of a nightmare. You have been warned. 6. It's a fun and relatively inexpensive date night for the price of dinner. Plus you can learn a lot about a partner by watching how they interact with others in a kitchen.
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/10/2013,10/15/2014,268,85,14,19,19>I have waited for years for a local food spot to open in this shopping center!  And a burger joint at that?  YES!  Although they have been open for almost a year, I finally got the chance to check them out.  Location - Willie J's is located in the CVS shopping center.  You cannot see the restaurant from the main road because the shopping center is located in a residential area.  Featured menu items are written with chalk markers on the windows.  Outdoor seating is available and there are a few tables inside.  Since this shopping center has a few stores open, the parking lot is large and typically empty.  The restaurant is very clean.    Coupon - Check out the Natomas Shopper guide for coupons.  I used the $2 off purchase of $15 or more on this visit.  I have seen coupons in the mail for a free soda as well. Menu -   They have a 'professional' menu hanging, with special items written on the whiteboard below.  Because they have such an extensive menu, deciding what to order was overwhelming.  The food is made to order so hooray for homestyle cooking.  Entrees range from burgers to gumbo to breakfast items.  Breakfast is served all day and Gumbo is available every Sunday.  Food - BBQ burger and garlic friesSince Willie J's is known for their burgers, I had to try one on my first visit.  I ordered the BBQ burger which had onion rings, bbq sauce, bacon and cheese.  My burger was overcooked, but it still tasted pretty decent.  Sad face for the garlic fries as they were soggy.  Service - The staff  was very friendly and welcoming.  You can tell they have great teamwork when cooking and preparing the food.  Kid friendly - They have high chairs and no changing tables.  They do not have an official kids menu, but there are several finger food/sides options for the young ones.  Big Willie Challenge - To up the cool factor, Willie J's offers The Big Willie Challenge for $20.  If you can devour 4 patties, 8 pieces of bacon, 3 grilled cheese sandwiches and 4 pieces of cheese, kudos to you!  If you complete the challenge, you get a t-shirt and your picture is added to their wall of fame.Catering and delivery - They deliver in the North Natomas area.  $10 Minimum with a $2 deliver charge and free delivery for orders over $20.   They offer a chicken wing party platter with your choice of 3 sauces.   Would I come back?  Yes.  I will give them another try.  I am interested in checking out their gumbo on Sunday!
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2014,10/14/2014,61,271,10,14,15>Taking into consideration that this new suds and sausage establishment is only having their "soft" opening...I am very optimistic that it will be a successful venture.It's a simple menu of food coupled with an impressive list of draught beverages that they have, here.   ("Bier hier!, indeed!)The formula is simple:  you queue up to the counter to order your food and select your beverage.   They charge you at the register and give you a number to take with you to your picnic table.  There, you relax, enjoy your brew, talk with your friends as you enjoy the fresh air.   Soon, a server appears with  whatever victuals you ordered.   The pretzels are quite good, here.  tasty.   You will want one.   They are odd pretzels in that they resemble a petite bread loaf with big, square salt granules on them.  They come with a cheesy spread that is dynamite good, and a bit of good mustard.   After taking one bite of the pretzel, I didn't care that it wasn't shaped like a traditional pretzel.   The taste is there, which is the main thing.The pork-veal "Thuringer" sausage was delicately flavored and demands to be eaten slowly so that you can enjoy the flavors.    The order came with warm german potato salad, a dollop of coarse, country mustard, and a crisp pickle on a long, white serving dish.It is enough to satisfy a hearty appetite.  Almost too much for me, since I was going to a dance class afterwards.   Next time, I think just a pretzel and a beer would suffice for a light supper.I like that even though this was a soft opening and they were swamped with customers, the staff managed to keep the service efficient and the clean-up tidy.  As soon as people were through with their drinks and food, the server ninjas would appear and clear the tables.We'd arrived a bit after 5PM on Sunday, and there was a short line about 5-8 people long.   As the evening progressed, the lines got longer.    It's a fun place to arrange to meet with friend for tasty bites and a brew before embarking on the evening's activities.   It has a nice, boisterous atmosphere at the tables.  Off to the side, there were people playing some sort of beanbag toss game like I've seen at tailgate patties outside sports stadiums.In short, the food is good and savory, and the selection of beers is likely to have something for everyone's tastes.They seem to have a well-trained and energetic staff in place.
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2013,10/13/2014,364,232,18,19,16>I absolutely SUCK at bowling (I slipped on a lane and fell flat on my booty once, too embarrassing!) so I typically stay BACK and watch my friends bowl and cheer them on. My family and friends bowls for the South Land Park bowling league every Wednesday so I like to go and socialize, drink and be merry AMF is a lot smaller than Alpine - the other bowling alley we used to go to before they closed. Both locations are very similar; as in the restrooms, bar and kitchen areas are old and out dated. This place is just old period so if you're looking for a more upscale bowling alley, do not come here!  Aside from my weekly visits to mingle with the bowling league, I came here for my friend's birthday for a night of glow bowl. $16 gets you shoes and all you can bowl for Saturday and Sunday night. I had so much fun bowling even though I had the lowest score! It was funny because smack in the middle of the lanes is this huge TV playing all the top music videos and you kind of get the feeling you are in club with the lights off and colored lights flashing everywhere, lol. I found myself dancing to Britney and Black Eyed Peas! Haha, you know you would too!The food is your typical bar food. The wings and fries are yummy, always hot with dipping sauce. Suzi the bartender makes the meanest "tooters" ever! She is fun and will always help you with your drinks, she rocks! Totters are $2 each and you can have Suzi make a special drink or you can have crown and coke. My favorite is the fire ball, tastes just like the candy! Staff is always friendly here!I like it here. It's close to home, friendly and I always have a good time here because I'm always with awesome people!
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2014,10/12/2014,200,122,8,12,14>I'm a sucker for their Vegan Chipotle (Grain Protein and Spices...$6.75) on a Pretzel roll with Bier-Cheese and Caramelized Onions. You get a choice of sweet or pretzel roll with your choice of 2 toppings. The reason I choose the Pretzel roll for an additional $.50 is because I server made a great point that the Bier-Cheese won't make it soggy compared to the Sweet roll, plus I love the Pretzel roll. I literally crave this meal every week, but I have to have self control.Today a couple of coworkers decided to attend happy hour (served Monday - Friday, 3pm - 6pm). Unfortunately food is not on that special menu, HH only offers a $1 off draft beer and well drinks. Luckily for me, I love beer!I'm obsessed with the interior. It was beautifully crafted and I enjoy the large family tables. The service is always great; each time I've been in, they are very knowledgeable with the menu. The only thing I can complain about is how busy this place can get. Lunch is more tolerable but when it goes into the evening, it can get a little ridiculous. There are nights where you can't even walk through the space and have conversations with your friends without yelling. Anytime you'll see me there is lunch time or an early dinner.Until next time!
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/1/2007,11/17/2007,108,68,3,18,8>Preface : I find it noteworthy to mention that though this establishment is named Persian Garden, the culinary influence presented is decidedly Afghan in nature. Persia is the ancient culture forming the foundation of modern Iran - apparently a horse of an altogether different color.What an injustice to the culinary tapestry of Sacramento that this shining little jewel remains lost and apparently forgotten in a dowdy suburban strip mall just off Howe Avenue; how else to explain why I am always one of three patrons savoring the succinctly Afghan flavors of their fantastic food, every time I have had the pleasure to patronize this place?One truly cannot judge a book by its cover, nor a restaurant by its facade. Stepping through the doors one's senses are treated to an elegant and peaceful place of respite from the hubbub humdrum world outside. Quality linens and china form each place setting, a single long-stemmed calla lily holding court in the center of plush, traditional dark wooden furnishings. With an abundance of greenery and a lush, lovely palate of colors, the interior feels as tasteful and comforting as a visit to the home of some esteemed colleague.For those with religious dietary restrictions, rest assured knowing that the owners are indeed Muslim, and all of the dishes are prepared with halal ingredients. And such flavors! Afghan cuisine is known for its plethora of spices and seasonings, and Persian Garden is no exception to this tradition. Every sauce is richly imbibed with mint and cardamom, cumin and cinnamon and fresh yogurt. Kabobs are featured in pride of place within the menu, along with a delectable selection of arch typical Persian stews - some of my personal favorites. I encourage readers to sample my own especial choice of chicken with walnut-pomegranate sauce. Rice is cleanly cooked, with proper care to consistency and texture, delicately scented with saffron and clove. Patrons should not miss out from sampling appetizers, possibly some of the choicest treats to be tried. Of particular note are tender, creamy little dumplings of spicy lamb meat, artfully presented as is every dish upon a broad plate with swirls of sauce and careful garnishes.Service has always been for me a warm and gracious experience, with soft-spoken servers always ready with a suggestion or proud description of any dish. Sometimes there is a pause from ordering to receiving ones entree or drink, but I imagine it is not neglect or sloth so much as attention to detail and care in preparation. They are attentive and unobtrusive, present but not looming, swift and skilled in sweeping away plates and empty glasses, polished as should be anyone in this environment.Definitely a place to impress one's date, or sample something not typically found elsewhere in this city, I cannot encourage people enough to pay Persian Garden a visit. It is time well-spent, taking a respite upon a flavorful tour of the old Silk Road.
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2007,11/16/2007,82,143,4,4,7>I possess a strange fascination for Morocco.  I'm like Pennylane in Almost Famous; it's the place I want to go to escape.  So, in preparation for the great escape that will happen one day, I ventured to this utterly ordinary and unprepossessing strip mall.  The restaurant can be a bit difficult to find; it's located in the way back and if you miss the sign, good luck!  Hmmm, maybe it's intended to be that way, in homage to Morocco's air of elusiveness.Though the inside of the restaurants lacks ambience, the graciousness of the servers and the yumminess of the food makes up for it.  The falafels are not as flat as the ones to which I've grown accustomed, but they are quite good, pleasently dense and chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  The lamb I had was perfectly cooked and very tender, drizzled with the remnants of it's own juices and marinade.  The chicken my friends devoured was also uniformly quite delicious. An excellent not too sweet baklava finished off the meal.So, now when I embark upon my epic World Cup tour in 2010 that will include Morocco, I can rest assured that I will not go hungry, at least in Morocco.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2007,11/15/2007,106,184,,8,5>I'm not really a fan of sports themed restaurants or eating spots and the cheesy radio djs and pop stations don't do much for me, but I am not going to knock the Sandwich Spot for it, because the sandwich was good.  I ordered the true test of a sandwich place: chicken salad sandwich.   It's all about the mayo.  And this sandwich was solid, not too much mayo but enough not to be dry.  And it wasn't fake mayo and super sweet.  The chicken was cubed breast, which isn't my preference but it was good.  The specialty sandwiches reminded me of Mr. Pickles and are a little too over the top for me, however, this solid sandwich spot will be added to my sandwich rotation.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/27/2007,11/14/2007,81,98,6,5,7>Let's take it back a few years shall we? It's 1990, May 16th to be exact. I'm in pink leggings, high tops, and a denim jacket. Despite the fact of my youngness, I'm still quite fashionable with my tom boy self. I'm turning 6, and since I'm the birthday girl, I get to pick the restaurant. My standards at this young age are simple, though quite high. There must be video games, preferrably Pac-Man and Street Fighter, so I can pretend that I'm as good as my big brother.There must be sticker machines that have the old school stickers with shiny silver backs so I can put them all over my dresser, only to have my mom yell at me to get them off ten minutes later.The food must have cheese. I was addicted to cheese.And most importantly there must be a jukebox. So what restaurant met all these requirements? Roma's. My parents got a roll of quarters and off we took ourselves. I had a blast that night, though my brother and I squabbled over who got to be the stretchy man in street fighter, and I undoubtedly burned my tongue on the always hot food. I also no doubt annoyed my fellow diners since I kept Paula Abdul on repeat until I ran out of quarters. Opposites Attract was my fave song, mostly due to the cartoon tiger.Roma's will always be a comfort place and comfort food to me. To this day I still eat there, and my order is always the same. Lasagna, an order of raviolis and extra garlic bread. To be honest, I've never eaten the pizza here and I have no desire too. Their lasagna is the *ish, despite the occaisional sauce changes, and as long as there's a Roma's, there will be a six year old standing at the juke box playing her favorite song.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/16/2007,11/12/2007,305,464,6,8,6>Lordy lordy, Loards! 34 flavors of ice cream temptation (yep, imma dork and I did the math). It's a small place with just a few tables, lots of candy for sale, and a selection of toppings to add to your dairy delight. But, before I go onto what I tasted, I have to qualify this review . . .I've been told on numerous occasions that I have a stomach made of steel (yes, I eat strange concoctions, spicy-spicy, and will try anything once, or twice).  Once we placed our orders for some typical ice cream flavors- Cookie Dough, Lemon Chiffon, Cookies N Cream, and Praline Pecan, while all were tasty and very rich and creamy, my wandering, and wondering eyes spied a small hand-written note that stated something like "now offering Quezo Real (yes, with a "z" and yes, it's cheese ice cream) and Macapuno"(sweet coconut strings; a Filipino treat).  So, I was intrigued and just had to sample the cheese ice cream.  It wasn't bad; had small shreds of what seemed to taste and look like cheddar. It had a sweet, nutty flavor.  Then I just HAD to try the avocado . . . yep, it tasted like avocado alright, but had a mild avocado flavor, and slightly sweet . Next, I spotted a scary Day-Glo purple colored ice cream; it was labeled UBE/yam.  Wow! I think I've found my next favorite flavor (next to Birthday Cake from Gunther's). The UBE ice cream reminded me of sweet potato pie, or my mom's candied yams, with a slight taste of cinnamon.  They also have Halo-Halo (another Filipino dessert), a Halo-Halo ice cream and seasonal flavors; currently it's pumpkin.  Maybe my kiddies inherited the "steel tummy" DNA because they also loved all of the new and curious samples we tried . . . and the best thing is that the prices were pretty reasonable; four healthy scoops for 4 = $7.00Avocado, cheese, and yam ice cream . . . hmmm . .  now, I love me some bacon wrapped hot dogs.  If they can come up with a palatable bacon dog flavor, I will be a fan for life!*stupid side note* . . . another server in the strip mall vacinity came in to offer the ice cream man some "garlic fries" and another came in to offer an "awesome plate of carne asada" . . . which, of course made me look at the wall-menu for salty treats . . . alas, they were lacking in the salty treats, but I almost wanted to tackle the carne asada dude . . .. .but, I restrained myself and jealously watched the ice cream man huridly enjoy the treats brought to him by his compratriots. . .   too cool. . . !  Good looking out for your fellow servers.

<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2007,11/10/2007,65,28,29,6,6>When I left the University of Georgia, MA in hand, I was intellectually adrift, spiritually decentered, financially troubled, and morally bankrupt.  Like so many graduate students out there, I lacked the knowledge to move ahead in today's modern world.  Thank goodness for the UC Davis Department of Political Science, which provided me with the useless and thoroughly impractical skills that are absolutely not required by the go-go world of today!It seemed like every time I applied for a job, I wasn't asked about my knowledge of maximum likelihood estimation techniques. No one ever inquired whether I knew how to estimate reliable coefficients even with heteroskedastic residuals.  I was absolutely never  asked a question about what Density Function is appropriate for overdispersed count data.  I don't think I ever got through an interview without failing to talk about fixing first-order autocorrelation.  Man, they NEVER ask that one!  Thanks to the UC Davis Department of Political Science, though, I can parrot back dense mathematical formulae and impenetrable jargon with incredible accuracy!  Do you want to know about two-stage bargaining models?  What about Nash equilibria?  I can drone uselessly on about these things for hours!  Have you ever wondered what the difference between fixed and random effects models is, or whether you should use a one-tailed or two-tailed hypothesis test?  Just ask me: this knowledge haunts my dreams!  Try as I might, I'm actually unable to forget it!I know what you're thinking: "This sounds great and all, but how can all this 'political science' help me find love?"  Here's the good news: UC Davis not only has the latest, state-of-the-art statistical training (which, incidentally, makes for great first date conversation), but also offers an acculturation program so comprehensive and so thoroughly suffocating that it makes Chairman Mao's "re-education" programs look like grade school civics class.  After you've mastered the social norms of academia, you'll have to beat the women back with your dog-eared copy of "The Logic of Collective Action!"If academics are known for anything, it is for being socially well adjusted.  At UC Davis, you'll unlearn all those destructive and indecorous social practices you once thought were "cool," and learn what real coolness is.  Lessons include: ogling undergrads, awkwardly flirting with undergrads, making weird conversation with undergrads, staring at your shoes, mastering the limp handshake, and integrating hopelessly outdated pop culture references into your lectures.  Enroll soon, and you'll have access to the upcoming lecture series on personal hygiene and style.  I am told that "Tie-dyes and Tevas: Hot Styles for Spring" is not to be missed, and that "Sebagos and Braided Belts: Completing the Look" is positively life-changing!If you want to stare blankly at an uncertain and unfulfilling future, or if you're satisfied to wander aimlessly in a Chinese maze of empty technique, or even if you just want to be privy to the degrading and preposterous minutiae of systematic empirical research, then give the UC Davis Department of Political Science a look.  They've got the skills you'll never need for the 21st Century!
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2007,11/9/2007,0,0,1,2,6>I lived right down the block at the Capital Towers for many years and I used to visit the Crocker Museum frequently.  The museum carries many, in my opinion, modern masterpieces.  Most of the displayed works are paintings from the late 19th and early 20th century but there is also other media to view such as sculpture and photography.  Works from Wayne Thiebaud, Irving Norman, and other artists are there for all to view and it still blows my mind.  I know some locals get jaded about the works but I don't subscribe to the notion that once you've seen it, you've seen it.The Crocker will often have special exhibitions and yucks like you and I can attend these shows for the cost of a dinner and a movie.While in college I once covered a exhibition by the artist Christo.  I must have asked the right questions because he gave me a one-on-one interview the next day at the Holiday Inn.  He and his wife were so dynamic and energetic that I still think back to the simple conversations we had about movies and nature when the subject of "what is art" is brought up by a friend or acquaintance.  See, you don't have to be in New York, or Chicago, or even SF to learn about Art.  It's right here at the Crocker.  Take advantage of it.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2007,11/8/2007,32,69,,13,7>I was sick, sick, sick.  After a sleepless night I knew I had to go to a doctor.  I needed a doctor asap, without an appointment and on a Sunday, so I went to the Sutter Express Care inside the Rite-Aid Pharmacy in Greenhaven.  This was a quick and efficient way to get medical care.  My insurance covered the visit as a normal office visit, instead of the typical $59 fee.  You can visit the Sutter Express web site to see what different types of insurance they accept, which is a lot.  The doctor diagnosed me with bronchitis and prescribed me three medications, which I was able to have filled right there at the pharmacy.  No driving from the doctor's office to the pharmacy!  After getting my meds, I felt so much better and finally got a good night's sleep.  They are open on Saturdays and have extended evening hours.  Office visits usually take 20 minutes and you don't need an appointment.  The doctor that treated me was very good.  They have a list of medical services on their web site as well.  Keep this in mind if you need a quick and efficient doctor's visit.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2007,11/7/2007,75,26,6,15,8>Apparently I must be one hairy little beast because this is probably the second or third review I've written about hair or hair removal.  Benefit Cosmetics, located inside Macys at Arden Fair Mall, offer waxing services.  It's called the Brow Bar and the girls do an amazing job.  The prices are fairly reasonable and I usually stop by at the counter for a quick wax job after I'm done with shopping.  The only downside is that the waxing is done in front of EVERYONE, so it can be a little embarrassing.  And just to warn you, some people do watch you as you're getting it done!  And its pretty funny to see people wince as the aesthetician removes the strip of wax from your brow.  Your face will turn red afterwards, but rest assured that they will apply makeup on you so you don't go walking around the mall looking like a lobster. It's been gaining popularity over the years so expect a wait in line to get an appointment.  So sign up ahead of time and do a little shopping around the mall before your appointment.  ***For Asians:  Our eyebrows are a little different as they tend to grow downward.  Most often a lot of non-asians do not do our brows the correct way.  So in this case, I recommend Brooke.  She's a master at trimming eyebrows and does a good job with mine *bats eyelashes*.  Speaking of eyes, our eyelashes tend to grow straight down as well.  In this case, I recommend Shu Uemura eyelash curler and their Basic Mascara, which is basically a dry mascara that does not weigh down your lashes.  Both can be purchased at Sephora, which is also in the mall.

I mean the chips and salsa are "free" so technically speaking we can take the whole bin of chips since its "free" yeah? They always seem to be heating up a new batch in the kitchen anyway so it wouldn't hurt for us to just casually walk out with say, a garbage bag full? Maybe I'll bring my mom here and ask her to help me smuggle out some chips since she has so much experience smuggling napkins, ketchup and mustard from other various restaurants...Until I figure out my master plan to take as many chips as possible without looking like a cheap-ass, I'm just going to give Guadalajara 5 stars for having a huge and tasty veggie burrito (ask for the BLACK BEANS if you're vegetarian because the refried and the whole beans have LARD).

When I started living in Sacramento part-time, I decided I wanted to join a gym that wasn't one of the big chains.  I found Pipeworks.  This is a great climbing gym, with a lot of different levels of difficulty.  The people are all nice and there is some serious eye-canding, with bulging backs and nice pecs everywhere you look.  There is also the occasional "Holy Shit!  I can't believe that person is hanging upside down with his legs over his head and he's only using 1 finger and a toe!" moments.  Unlike a lot of other climbing gyms, this one also has a decent set of weights and a bunch of cardio equipment.  They just added some new ellipticals so there's almost always one open.  They also have yoga, belly dancing and spinning.  Curious George, you ain't going to have anything on me!

<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/23/2007,4/27/2007,41,154,10,5,4>I'm a little stressed out because the quality of the other reviews of the Pancake Circus is amazing.  I highly suggest you read most of the other reviews; they're very entertaining.  I humbly submit my own.I guess I should start out with the hostess.  She reminded me a little bit of Cloris Leachman, except that instead of being born in 1920 like Ms. Leachman, she was probably born in 1820.  And it looks like she spent most of the 1940s as a POW and most of the 1980s in a tanning booth, because she got a whole lotta sun in her life at some point.  She also looks like she's STILL pissed about smoking being banned from restaurants.If she were nicer she would have called me "hon" and offered me coffee; instead, she asked what my friends wanted to drink, walked off, then turned around and yelled "what do you want" to me, as if I should have known that she wanted me to yell my drink order to her as she walked off.The server was a different, yet still venerable woman, who took our order.  I was with two friends.  One, we'll call her "Jane," ordered the tuna melt.  The other, we'll call her "Jean," tried to get the waitress to make her something healthy, like a grilled chicken sandwich with a small green salad on the side.I sensed danger when I realized how much trouble the waitress was having with my picky friend, and decided that "Pancake Circus" meant "please order pancakes because they're easy to make and it's all we know how to do here."  After all, the menu does say in large letters "BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY."I ordered Breakfast #11.  Since it was St. Patrick's day, the pancakes were green and came covered with whipped cream and green sprinkles.  Awesome!  The rest of the breakfast was just fine, standard bacon and eggs and sausage.My silly friends who ordered lunch got what they deserved for not being observant.  They failed to miss the subtle clues from the menu, the waitress's attitude, and the general prevalence of customers around us eating breakfast at 1:30 pm; it wasn't a coincidence that they hadn't ordered lunch.   I mean, come on, what are the chances that 75 sacramentoans simultaneously woke up really late and wanted to go get breakfast and just happened to go to the Pancake Circus?Get a clue people, order breakfast here.  Nothing else.
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2006,4/25/2007,26,18,,7,3>Don't believe that this place has changed since the original owners retired to Laos.  I have eaten there a few times and have been unable to detect any difference.  The flavors are intense and highly concentrated.  The things they can do with pork can make a grown woman cry.  Two standout dishes in the pork arena are the oh-so-lemongrassy Asian sausage (split this dish between a few people because it is rough and homemade and the giant chunks of pig fat within the natural casing make it not very diet friendly) and the garlic pork, which is like chewy, salty, piggy candy.  And the pork-stuffed chicken wings are also not to be missed.  The garlic quail is also great, as are the salads and I recently branched out and tried the whole fried fish with hot red chili sauce on top and I was soon fighting over each last scrap of tender white meat with my dining companions.  And it is cheap! You can feast for ten or fifteen bucks apiece.  Yeah, the teenage kids of the owners do staff the place but they are as nice and attentive as any teenage kids who are roped into helping in their parents restaurants and certainly not surly in any way.  It is a crying shame that this place is usually near empty (and don't think this is because of the food, that's like saying that the Cheesecake Factory is always packed because it's really wonderful).  This is a Thai/Lao place so don't expect much from the boring old Thai standards like drunken noodles.  Try the Loatian specialties and your tastebuds will thank you.
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2006,12/7/2006,54,115,3,4,2>I went to this small bar just last weekend and had a blast. There was easy parking and not to mention it was about six minutes from my place. There was plenty of people who seemed somewhat taken by my costumed appearance (not to mention my really fake irish accent) and stayed away for quite awhile, eventually as the night went on and the drinks flowed we seemed a little less unapproachable.It was really easy to get drinks here and boy did we have drinks! It was super easy on the pocket book as well. Jukebox, pool table and a few chairs on in the front made it kinda fun and relaxed. I think this is my favorite bar right now, in respect to all others that I have visited.Of course, I seem to be rating high stars for any place that will liquor me up as quickly as I would like ;)
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/3/2006,12/6/2006,1800,1375,3,12,10>Friday nights I usually spend with my sister and her boyfriend out in Sacramento attempting to see what fine culinary delights are available to either irk or satisfy our picky palates.So, instead of the usual Hamburger Marys (hey, I do like that place), we opted to try Cafe Morocco, no doubt due to the great reviews my fellow Yelper's had given this establishment.Upon entrance, we were greeted by the hostess and seated immediately.  The place was packed and a little warm.  My sweater came off.  Looking over the menu, they had appetizers ranging from Dolmas, Falafel to the next page which covered dinner entrees.  We asked the hostess what she would recommend.  Chicken Sumac.  Hands down.  My sis and I order the same plate.  Her boyfriend elects for the Casablanca Lamb dish.  In addition, we order the Hibiscus tea.The minute we finish ordering, the music is amped up and a belly dancer appears from the back catching us all off guard.  She slowly walks down the two aisles, shaking her hips, dancing, all the while the little coins make twinkling sounds.  Hey, I'm all for artists so I tuck some dollars into her moving waistband while getting encouraging claps and yells from the rest of the patrons.Our food arrives and I am most happy to say, that the falafel was pretty good.  Crunchy thin crust on the outside to reveal a fluffy slightly dense hummus mixture.  It was not dry at all.Dinner arrives, and immediately we are pretty moved by the rich aroma of spices....needless to say, I'm starving, so I start to munch away.  Wow.  The hummus here was great: creamy, nutty, roasted taste.  I scoop it onto a soft fresh piece of warm pita topped off with a bit of the marinated chicken and add a sprinkling of the parsley/tomato salad.  Mmmm.  Boyfriend's lamb dish was exceptionally good.  Very tender and spicy.  He wiped off the entire plate.  We walked out, round and looking forward to a relaxing evening.  Or so I thought.  Melody called to drag me out for some dancing.........and perhaps burn off the calories I just consumed.Wonderful Morrocan food, quick service, and kudos to the pretty belly dancer (I've seen some bad ones in my time) that definitely made the men a lot happier there tonight.

Yes, I love this place! We were driving up to Truckee last Saturday night and we were really hungry! Cranky hungry. We saw a sign for In-N-Out burger and I suggested that we stop. Husband gave me an odd look. I'm not one to suggest burger joints unless I know they have veggie burgers. I was desperate.Well, this place rocked us! The girl on the intercom could not have been sweeter or more helpful. We asked about veggie options. She happily explained my options: grilled cheese with or without "the produce." I went for the produce. We pulled up and the guy collecting money and handing out food was also a total sweetheart. He was telling us that his soccer team lost their first game of the season earlier in the night.  We both felt genuinely sorry for the kid!  Despite the big loss, he gave us service with a smile.  We caught a glimpse of the other employees inside. It was like something out of a 1950s movie scene. High school kids smiling, laughing, and seemingly enjoying their jobs!  It made me sort of nostalgic for my youth and a more simple life outside the chaos of the city. The best part came when I took a bite of my fresh-looking veggie sandwich. It was so damn good!  Pefectly melted cheese and toasted bun with crisp lettuce, tomato, and pickles, along with delicious thousand island dressing. The best hamburger without the hamburger I've ever had...and I've had a lot of them....have you ever driven cross-country on the 80? Not good, not good. Check this place out on your way to North Tahoe, you won't be disappointed!
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/28/2006,12/4/2006,602,200,3,3,9>I guess I have an affinity for bar tending, because yet again, I was tending bar last night at this ultra cool place.  This seems to be a trend, b/c this is the 2nd time I've been pulled behind a bar (the other time was at AsiaSF).  I really didn't know what I was doing, but I don't think the patrons or owners really cared.  I mean, I was having fun heckling the patrons and selling the crap out of the beers.  A great combination in my book.The decor reminds you of a secret club during Prohibition.  As you wind your way down the stairs, you're greeted by one of the two '41 Ford Pickups that adorn the bar. One the owners, a 6' 6" tall drink of water (oh, YEAH!), was a complete sweetheart because he let me sit and play in one.  At least I let him sit bitch, right?There's a cool outdoor patio for smokers, a dance floor and stage, and a cool motorcycle chill room.  Oh, and did I mention that there's live music mostly on the weekends?  Rock on, people!  ROCK ON!I'm hoping that I get the chance to party here again (and maybe to flirt with the cute owner:)), but if anyone is in Old Sac- definitely hit up this place.
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/12/2006,12/3/2006,177,474,1,9,2>I gave this place 4 stars because I love the concept, but for total review purposes, I give it more of a 3.Still, it's a neat project, so I am upping it again.  Mother's Support Network is a smallish store/community center in an older tract mall over off of El Camino.  Sort of Northern Arden Park, definitely Carmichael.  Not far from El Camino HS.What it is: a very mellow place for moms to hang out.  There is a small store (MOONFAERIES) that sells handmade items created by stay at home moms (SAHM) like slings and cloth diapers etc., and also an inexpensive place to stock up on gently used children's clothes (onesies are a buck each.  Kid and maternity clothes are donated, so you can quit giving your stuff to Goodwill.)What is cool: lecture series on parenting, including less invasive health care options, discipline, etc.  from "experts" in their fields.Other neato things: ~playgroups for moms/SAHDs and their kids!  Get social, check out bouncetown for me.  I have sadly never been.  Yet.  The playgroup meets indoors on rainy days, outdoors on sunny days.  The groups are actually separated by ages.~Support groups: I haven't been, but it would have been nice to go be around nursing moms when I was first starting out.  Free support groups. Chat with new moms, learn from experienced ones.~Toddler play area.So, here's what I didn't like: the one lecture I went to was on vaccinations.  I felt it was a scare tactic program to keep people like me from vaccinating our kid or feeling very guilty about doing it.  I swear, after her chicken pox vaccination, I was very concerned about every little peep.  Even now, when she wakes up in the middle of the night, the front part of my brain says "growth spurt" while the back part of my brain secretly whispers "she's autistic because you vaccinated her against measles you asshole..."  I was really offended by the chiropractor who kept spouting "factoids" like "Measles, mumps and rubella are virtually UNKNOWN in the US in modern day."  and me?  I was thinking "am I in the right place?  Does this guy not understand that the reason we don't have outbreaks is because kids are vaccinated?"  He also said rubella is not necessary because it's not dangerous to kids.  But hello, IF I were 3 months pregnant, and IF I came into contact with a kid who had rubella, my little baby would be born with serious birth defects!  No sir, vaccinate all the 6 month olds and be done with it.Seriously.  That's my biggest beef with the place.  I love it otherwise.My kid got vaccinated, I bought my favorite sling at their store, and I like most of the women I know from the Women's Support Network.I highly recommend it.  Just skip the vaccination lectures because lots of folks there are seriously anti-vaccination.
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/21/2006,12/2/2006,323,1092,2,,10>Late high school/early college I dated a guy who was obsessed with coffee shops.  Once, while visiting family in Sacramento, we came across  True Love.  He loved it and became oddly fixated.  He wore TL shirts on an almost daily basis and while I lived in Santa Cruz and he was from San Jose, we would drive all the way to Sacramento so he could hang out at True Love.He was a little off so we broke up sometime later, but when I found out that True Love was opening back up I knew I'd have to check it out for old time's sake.  I stopped by on Saturday night, around 10:30 pm.  It was crowded inside and the spacious outdoor patios were filling up with hordes of underagers.  I felt old, and I'm young.  But I also felt a bit of happy nostalgia.Four stars.  Maybe more once I indulge in late night waffles.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/31/2006,12/1/2006,19,16,14,6,5>So my date and I go into the co-op to grab some lunch on a Saturday. She's mostly a vegetarian, and my idea of grabbing something at Wing Stop doesn't sound appealing, so we decide to go around the corner and grab something healthy.We enter the nicely lit and quite modern store; there's a huge deli with everything you could possibly think of behind the counter, and one can imagine that it's all organic and good tasting.I ask the man behind the counter what he recommends. "Everything's good here," he replies. I settle on a turkey-bacon-guac sandwich, and my hot date settles on baba ganoush, pita, yams, and some green thing which I've since forgotten.I'm not big on green things, but I don't mind.So we're grab a seat at around the corner, and along comes the most disparate looking couple you've ever seen. There's a lanky older white guy with what appears to be a even older asian woman. My date mentions that they look like a couple that met in Vietnam during the war. I mention that they look like a couple that met in a group home and bonded over the medication that they were taking.The woman rolls up, pulling nothing but an entire shopping cart filled with what appears to be bok choy. It's green and leafy,  but doesn't appear to be exactly lettuce. What she's doing with an entire shopping cart full of this leavy vegetable is beyond us. This couple starts getting ready to sit down and enjoy their meal. What they're eating seems to be simply an entire cooked pork loin on a plate, with nothing else but silverware for each of them. My date and I look over at this bizarre couple, then at each other with jaws hung in disbelief, then back at the couple who proceed to tear through what seems to be six pounds of pork fat that surrounds this giant hunk of meat. After about five minutes of gnawing through nothing but pig flesh, the woman leaves for a bit, then comes back with an entire loaf of wheat bread, which they open and share together along with the pork.They don't use mayonnaise. No mustard, no cheese, no condiments. Just pork and wheat bread. I've been to the co-op several times to shop and I've always found it amenable to my needs. But I suspect that if you're off your meds and de-compensating with your group home girlfriend, then the co-op is the perfect place to eat an entire pork loin.
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/19/2006,11/30/2006,403,1077,3,10,5>We could so easily have been the nightmare table:  3 adults and 4 kids under 3 years old, showing up without a reservation on a Saturday at prime lunchtime.  Yet, they were able to seat us within 10 minutes and brought 4 highchairs, crayons, and kiddie snacks immediately.  The service was friendly and attentive, and the fresh-baked muffins were super yummy.  (The rest of the food was pleasantly average.)  We were out of there before any of the kids melted down and somehow, our bill was less than $50.
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2008,7/3/2008,66,86,4,5,6>I have issues with getting my "hair did" pretty much anywhere.  On a typical day, I spend a good ten minutes on my hair, face, and choosing an outfit, so when I walk into a salon, makeup store, or Bebe, I feel awkwardly inadequate.  Take the above all into account with how I must have felt walking into Strands fifteen minutes late for my appointment.  I had spent those fifteen minutes driving in loops around the 3000-3600 blocks of Folsom Blvd, scanning awning after awning for Strands.  Danielle, my stylist, was waiting at the front desk, pretty un-fazed.  She showed me to her chair while another member of the staff offered me a drink.  I'm too broke to afford massages anymore (the best thing about higher education was spending the loan money) I consider getting my hair washed by another person to be a luxurious spa treatment.  Danielle was awesome; the shampooing included a nice forehead massage (or something) as I slipped into haircutting Zen.  I arrived back at my chair, welcomed by an ice water with lemon in a pretty glass.  Danielle asked me what I wanted; she let me wax philosophical on what my ideal cut would do for me, not what I would do for my ideal cut, and she got to work without even flinching.  We got pretty chatty, practically talking about everything you can think of: our dogs (they're sooo cute!), our boyfriends (they're sooo stupid!), my hair (there's sooo much of it!) and everything in between.  Before I knew it, the hair was covered with my hair and I felt fabulous.  I was in shock for a while after seeing my transformation.  I was so used to looking like a seventeen-year-old, I forgot what it was like to be grown up.  Danielle did a great job of keeping me my own age, rather than aging me further like I had feared.  I think she sensed I was weirded out about the whole thing, because she said I would need a few days to "get over it."  As she was cutting, she realized she had taken off a good 8 inches in some places, and said she might go sorting through what she had cut off to donate.As I walked out, I felt a huge weight off (and not just all my hair I lost.)  I looked and felt great, which is well worth the $45 for a cut.

Nice!Great pesto + cheese pizza. Yummy pepperoni. Solid buffalo wings.Beats Uncle Vito's if you're looking for a by-the-slice pizza place. They've got a deal right now that's 2 slices for $5.00. Big Trouble in Little China (!!!) was playing on one of the flat screens ... on the other was Space Balls!80's movies + cheesy pizza + chill staff  ... really, what more can you ask for? :) Check it out!Edit 03-29-08: Went back a second time today and again we (my bf and I ) were reminded why we like the place so much. Good pizza and super friendly owner ... my boyfriend mentioned that I had written a review and the owner offered to change the movie they were playing since Big Trouble in Little China was on again. BTLC is dope man, keep it on ... hahaha. I like cheese on my pizza and cheese in my movies :)

<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/24/2008,6/26/2008,186,282,4,6,4>Murder Burger.  Red Rum Burger.  Whatever the name is, I've heard all about it during my 4 years in Davis, but anytime I craved a burger, I'd hit up In-N-Out.  I love In-N-Out, the burger is fresh and good, and since I worked there before back in High School, I know the operation well and it's all legit.  Good stuff.  Thus, going to Murder Burger always became an after thought.So...after graduation (a few years back, I'm old), when I was chilling in Davis for the summer before I entered the "real world," I figured it might be a good time to try this local joint where people always tells me about.  So a friend and I checked the place out since I lived close by in Allegre.  I figured, if this is my only time here, I might as well go all out, and I ordered the 1 lb burger with fries and drink.  Not cheap, but hey, why not right??The burger was OK.  Not bad, but not good enough for me to wonder why did I miss this all these years here.  The meal wasn't anything spectacular.  It was OK, enough where I'd go back, but I'd probably just go to In-N-Out across the street.  Maybe I went in with a lot of expectations, but all I got was a burger that fed me for 3 meals.
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2008,6/25/2008,35,17,,11,6>A client of mine called and needed me to stop by to pick up a check ... just my luck, it was near midtown. I had been wanting to try La Bonne Soupe Cafe for months and I finally had the chance. The owner served me up a wonderful bowl of French Onion Soup and a nice little sandwich. Fresh bread, fresh ingredients, and a squirt of a 'secret sauce' of sorts made the sandwich excellent. The soup was great too. Nothing real fancy. But made with pride and care. This is one of those places where the food isn't going to wow you on the menu or the plate ... but once you sink your teeth in, you are gonna' love it.I also shared a good twenty minute conversation with the owner about his motherland, France. My family and I are traveling there with our two small children and he was happy to give me some tips on how to make the most of our trip. Although our conversation slowed his sandwich making pace for the people behind me (sorry everybody!) ... getting an insiders take on France, while eating wonderful homemade french cuisine, made for an even better first experience.
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2008,6/23/2008,44,281,,6,5>Despite claims that Stockton Blvd is "scary" or "ghetto," it is one of my favorite places to eat. There are a zillion pho restaurants, not to mention BBQ, soul food, Thai, etc. One of the newer gems is Oni's.I had the 3-piece wing with one waffle and 2 sides (mac and cheese and red beans and rice). The waffle had a similar flavor to those at Roscoe's - more of a sweet waffle. The fried chicken is all wings; they don't serve legs, thighs, etc, so you aren't getting a ton of meat. The mac and cheese was amazing - hot and cheesy with little pieces of cheese crust. The red beans and rice were pretty good too, with chunks of meat, although not spicy at all (solved with a dash of Crystal hot sauce). They also offer fried fish, greens, yams, peach cobbler, and have a breakfast menu with grits and hash browns. Our server/cook/host seemed to be running the whole place by himself and was super nice and enthusiastic; he talked us into trying oxtails on our next visit.

I think that's awesome.Their menu says on the cover in tiny print : No Split Checks. and they don't take AMX but do other cc's.I ordered the Mushroom and Onion cheeseburger and garlic fries. It made me feel like Mrs. Pacman "awah awah awah awah" I would have eaten everyone's food if they let me lol. It was very delicious.This place is very popular so if you come with a group I'd recommend getting there early or something.. They have indoor and outdoor (covered with a clear plastic to keep out the weather and bugs) seating. In the bar area where we sat it was very dark and noisy :( The acoustics were "terrible" and the service left much to be desired. If not for those things I would grant it one more star. Especially since the host was so very polite and curteous with us.I SHALL be back, and with friends.

You think im crazy? Well, try the delicious new seasonal burger of the month... "The Lil' Shorty". Slow cooked asian spiced short rib meat with an incredible slaw. It was like some kind of heavenly korean pulled pork slider. I also tried the philly for the first time. Again, exceeded the hell out of my expectations. Honestly, If you like burgers and you have yet to try MBT, I demand that you call in sick to work tomorrow and just sit in your car refreshing the facebook/twitter feed until you are able hunt them down. Just a note. I was a little disappointed to see that they streamlined the menu and no longer serve chicken, buffalo, or mushroom as an option for the patty. It was nice while it lasted, but I as long as they keep exceptional quality and seasonal burgers coming... I am happy to continue giving them 5 stars.
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2011,6/9/2011,35,60,8,16,9>Not a bad start to Blue Prynt!This new restaurant and bar took over what use to be Sofias.  Now the brighter colored and more open interior is much more inviting than the once darker earthy restaurant.  The granite bar is still there with all its glory, and lets face it.... sometimes the bar is the only thing that matters.I had lunch here and sat atop this bar.  (One day I will build this in my house!!! QUOTE ME ON IT!!!)  I ordered up an Arnold Palmer and tried the Wild Mushroom Risotto.  Why did I buy risotto at lunch?  It has always been the make or break dish for me at a restaurant.  And you can tell a lot about the cook or chef through this dish instead of a steak sandwich or something.  The lemon-thyme risotto was a honest surprise.  It was cooked well, smooth and creamy without being runny.  This was topped with a generous amount of sauteed wild mushrooms and sweet carmelized roasted garlic cloves, and then finished with some green onion.  I think this is an ideal Spring or Summer dish.  It's a very filling dish that has some substance to it, but still feels very light and refreshing because of the lemon.  I dig it, and hats off to the cook!!!The remainder of the menu offers up some impressive appetizers like crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, and a mushroom basket.  Sandwiches here looked delicious.  At every corner it was some sort of steak sandwich or burger!!!  PRIME RIB SANDWICH ANYONE~!!! Sandwiches and Burgers come with fries and are priced around 8-9 dollars which is reasonable on this side of town.  Salads come it at about 4-8 dollars.  The entrees, which include pasta, flat iron steaks, shrimp scampi, and steelhead, amongst other, are on the high side at about 15 dollars.  Honestly not bad for dinner, but maybe a lunch size edition of these entrees could bring in larger lunch crowd.  Hell, but what do I know.Overall impression of the Grand Opening of this Restaurant is that is shows very high promise.  Blue Prynt offers good food items, a great bar, and a wait staff that seem to be on top of things.  The location could be a bit out of the way, but they do have a parking lot!  I'd say come give it a go.  Grab dinner here then skip across the way to Naked Lounge for some music and coffee after.  (Dating tips from this lone wolf).  HOPE BLUE PRYNT YOU STICK AROUND CUZ I'M PULLING FOR YOU~!!!!
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2011,6/8/2011,476,248,11,15,13>I've got to tell you, getting me to go to Old Sac on a Saturday got my knickers in a knot. I wasn't that excited to walk down cobblestone alley-ways and pretend that taffy is delightful. Ugh...not my cup of tea.So, when my boyfriend's parents wanted to explore the dullest part of town, I put on a smile and said, sounds great!My demeanor changed immediately when I entered this light, airy, contemporary restaurant. I was so impressed with the space, clean lines and modern, warm tones. Then, passing the open kitchen sent me into a tizzy! The presentation of the food was spectacular. I hadn't even sat down yet, and I wanted to give this place high marks. Seated outside, we noticed the patio was draped with lights overhead and there was a long table with a fire display in the middle. I almost felt like I was in the Hamptons. I welcome this environment with open arms. As I had hoped, the food matched the artwork that was flying out of the kitchen. With everyone happy from nibbling on warm bread, sipping on  wine ($10 corkage fee!) and eating the Thai Chicken appetizer, we decided to keep the good times rolling and order some entrees. I chose the fish of the day, the sea bass with asparagus risotto. My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak, and his mom and dad ordered the chicken dish and the tiger prawns. All were delicious, but mine really shined! The bass was delicate, the risotto was creamy, and the roasted tomatoes were killer!I will definitely be coming back. The prices were more than reasonable, and they even offer a $10 bottle of wine! With live music on Saturday nights, this could easily become one of my favorite restaurants in Sacramento. And, it just happens to be in Old Sac, go figure!
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2011,6/7/2011,562,500,16,14,14>While aimlessly strolling down L Street on a beautiful, sunny, spring like day in late winter, I came across Café Roma.  Thanks to an informative review by one of my Yelp friends, I knew they served gelato and it seemed like the perfect time to give them a try.Entering the small café I noticed the gelato counter near the front and immediately was approached by a friendly young man behind the counter that seemed to be fairly knowledgeable about the various flavors and the manufacture (Gelato Classical).After a few minutes of indecision and several free samples, I made my choices of a scoop of strawberry and a scoop of white chocolate raspberry in a medium cup.I proceeded outside to a table basking in the glorious penetrating rays of warm afternoon sunshine to experience this wonderful, life changing encounter with my lush creamy gelato.  After indulging in only a few bites, a man sat down at the table next to me, immediately lighting up a putrid smelling cigarette, the light breeze making it float in my direction, completely engulfing me and my wonderful gelato pleasure in acrid smoke.  Unfortunately this is a rather typical experience with any Sacramento eatery having any kind of patio.Within a minute a rather foul smelling bus (I did not think they had those in Sacramento any longer) came roaring to the curb next to my table, its breaks screaming in an ear splitting screech.  Fortunately it devoured my smoking intruder and rushed away in a large gust of wind leaving me to enjoy the splendidly beautiful day and my delicious gelato.The end.

Not only do they serve mighty good drinks and food, there's usually some great music and mixes to dance to. Everything is reasonably priced so you don't walk out with empty pockets thinking of how you're going to pay for breakfast the next morning. It's very casual and beardy. If you are rocking a beard, you get free admission. Mustaches are also welcome, but a little bit more creepy, just style it for extra points.I like the renovation that they did in the back. It's now fully covered, and lots of seating is available. The bathrooms are no longer single-stall glory holes; they have fancy sinks and two stalls now! I like! The kitchen is open til 9 I am pretty sure. Their flatbread pizzas are really good, the cheeseburger is heaven on a plate, and the other seasonal appetizers I have tried have all been really good.There you have it yelp. My favorite bar in Sacramento!

From the decor to the waiter, you feel as though a small piece of France somehow got lost and found its way in Sacramento. You have to try the foie gras. It is delicious! Once you feel the need to mix it up, try the chicken or duck pate. Those are winners as well.As for the sandwiches, I have yet to be disappointed. I like to try out the specials, but my goto sandwich would have to be Stacy's Favorite. You might as well call me Stacy, because it's my favorite as well! Like beef? Melted brie? Carmelized onions? You've just found what can only be described as perfection on a baguette.Why must Cafe Rolle close on Sundays and Mondays and have such limited hours?

No time for being bashful; I paid good money for you. Let them peer from inside their homes on this quaint neighborhood street. I'm sure a hundred before me have enjoyed you in this same spot whilst they watched snickering at us impatient patrons from behind their curtains. Let the others walk passed us and see- they're just jealous.Y'know, this is my first time here, but I've heard you're quite good. Bad for me, but good. Let's do this discreetly. With wide, curious eyes, I peeled back the layers which kept you from me. Who knew such exquisiteness was beneath all that? Let me position you just right- I've gotta' take a picture. You glistened in the sunlight. Whoever made you was an artist. Was that cliche? Oh well. And, yes, you're going online. Who'd believe me if I didn't post this? *wink*I plunged in.Oh, daaaaaamn.A flurry of flavors and textures engulfed my tongue, bombarding my senses in the most wonderful way. Sweet and savory. Warm and gooey. Juicy and thick. You've got a bit of spice I can handle, too. You're not holding back!  (Breathe, Joy.) Let's be honest, I've had many similar to you, but now... I feel as though I've been cheated out of the true experience. I knew I was right in coming here and asking for you and "the works." I don't think I'll ever quite be the same.Okay, I'm seeing stars and feel restricted, so let's finish off at home. I can let go of inhibition there. I'm only a 5-minute drive away. It won't be long.

As others have mentioned, this place is far larger than it looks on the outside, and filled with every sort of trinket imaginable (including perineal spray, but anyway.) We were looking for some quirky duds, but I quickly tired of the clothes selection (plus, I swear I detected an overwhelming pee smell in that section) and mosied over to the best room in the place: used books. And what a discovery! The young adult books were priced at 25 to 75 cents each! I pretty much bought out the whole section for my classroom library, which I've been working on stocking all school year. We're talking sports books, Shakespeare, Lord of the Rings (ugh, but whatever gets them to read), and even a little Winston Churchill biography treat for myself. That basically made my day. Fourteen dollars for a huge bag of books. Way to warm an English teacher's heart. The ladies volunteering at the cash register were so sweet and had a bit of a Steel Magnolias sensibility to them. For a minute, I forgot I was in midtown Sacramento. I will NEVER, however, try on clothes at this place. The stall doors are about three feet in length. How do I know some tall person isn't going to walk by and check out my business?

It's similar to any other food court you would find in a mall but what sets them apart is the different varieties of food they have available!What mall offers Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Persian, Russian, Mexican, Japanese, Island fare and American food choices? Before shopping at the market, I decided to give this place a try. We wanted to try the Korean food because my daughter and I love Korean food and we were pressed for time. We didn't feel like going to a restaurant and figured we'd kill two birds with one stone. We ordered the beef bulgogi bento box, $9.95 and the Jam Pong (spicy seafood noodle soup) $8.95. After paying at the register, they handed us a pager and we proceeded to find our table. The bento box came out relatively quick but the Jam Pong came out quite a while later. The beef bulgogi was flavorful and abundant. The kimchi was delicious, not sour with the right amount of flavor, the small side of Japchae was mediocre. My Jam Pong came out later and it was a little on the skimpy side as far as seafood goes. There was one ring of calamari and three small shrimps. Two clams and a small part of a soft shell crab. What they didn't skimp on was the noodles. Oodles of Noodle! Endless noodles! The noodle is like any other Jam Pong noodle, with a thicker consistency to your average ramen noodle. The noodles were cooked just right. The soup was not as flavorful as I'm accustomed to, but it was still delicious! Come here with an empty stomach because you could easily spend a day sampling all the different varieties of international dishes. Pro Tip: Sign up for the KP rewards card similar to any other rewards card (free). You accumulate points for the amount of money you spend on your groceries in the market. You can then earn money towards food purchases at the food court! Wink! Wink!

We went on a weekday and it wasn't really busy, but there was only one server. I'm not sure if that's normal, but there were about three small groups that came at the same time and there's only one guy. I think only one chef too. Our food didn't take long, but were distracted and not starving so I wasn't keeping tabs. The food! Mmmmm!! I brought my Afghan friend so we ordered the more traditional stuff...refer to my pics. (His sister went and ordered some BBQ dish she didn't like. Made friends with the couple next to us...they ordered Gyros and loved it!) We ate the eggplant with bread and our hands (traditionally eaten this way) and it was good. The dumplings also really good! I would definitely recommend eating those two things! The dessert. I normally go for baklava. But we tried the Ialah...kind if an creamy bean noodle dish. It isn't overly sweet..the noodle threw me off a little, and the rise water was different. This dessert isn't for the close-minded. I think it's worth a taste though. Will def go back! I thought this was just some weird looking hookah bar. Pleasantly surprised!
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,7/19/2014,640,434,3,17,9>Ok came in here today since I missed some of the other great specials when they opened and didn't find out about this location until someone at farmers market told me. But anyway they still have a great special @$16 for their fabulous foot massages, that are pretty much whole body clothed massages with a foot soaking and reflexology foot massage.  JULIE is FANTASTIC!!! There wasn't one part if me that didn't get a work out. I love the facial massage portion of the experience it's like a mini facial massage. Forehead, between the eyes, chin all if your scalp it's fabulous. So relaxing! She got my lower back and my Glutes and worked out some serious tension in my shoulders. I will be back and be asking for her again and again. I decided with the specials going on to get a mani/spa pedi for only $22 while I was here and lets just say that experience was not part of this review and would have lowered the star rating but since the place is all together I cannot write a separate review for that department.  The space they have is nice and very elegant looking but I had a male manicurist and he was less than personable and both mani and pedi were mediocre at best. I want to take this opportunity to let you all know to stick with the massage services and maybe pass on the nail part.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,7/18/2014,335,135,4,11,7>This tattoo shop is awesome.  Someone I recently was introduced to just started tattooing at this shop and he said he would color a tattoo that is just an outline on my forearm.  Shop minimum is $60.00 (unsure if anyone cares) so for about 45 min and $80.00 (I like to tip people who tattoo me, shoot it is on you forever, right?!) I got the most amazing colorful tattoo!  It looks awesome.  It's been over a week since I got it done and it healed as well as possible.  I am sort of hard on my tattoos ... I still haven't got off of the picking of the scab thing.  I know I am gross, so sue me.Nonetheless, a little bit more info on the shop.  It is SUPER CLEAN.  Like really really clean.  I kept telling them how beautiful it was in there.  They also do piercings there and am considering a dermal here soon.  Also, you cannot make appointments.  I thought that was a bit odd, but maybe that is good, idk, I am not a tattoo artist.  They also have a credit card machine so that's an option if you can't run to get cash first.  But remember, CASH IS KING!ASK FOR JUAN REYES.  Tell him Shelley sent you!
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/14/2014,7/17/2014,348,96,9,18,11>I only came here based on the pictures on yelp. I've been sick and needing a hot bowl of war wonton soup(ancient Chinese secret). I didn't want to be in the car too long because I'm congested and dizzy. So we go in and you order at the counter and pay then Jenny brings the food.  It's a lil family ran restaurant kids included(running around) which is fine with me. They have a pick three deal for family style plates $22 I got :pork chow mein house fried rice beef  broccoli then added the orange chicken war wonton andmy son loves spicy chicken wings. There was only one other table sitting and eating. Our food came out quick and hot!!  My soup had every thing I needed to cure my cold.  My husband barely talked and then said "I can't believe we've lived here this long and never tried this place" Literally we have been in every shop in this shopping center!! The food was amazing !! Jenny and her husband were very nice. I love supporting local family ran businesses.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2014,7/16/2014,280,194,11,21,14>They have parking lot attendants to guide you in and also help you load. You could lose yourself in all these plants they have. Plenty on carts hidden throughout the place. Lots of shade and plenty of trees. The prices are less on some items like smaller seasonal varieties and more on other things. They do carry a vast selection of tomatoes, melons, and such. Much more than the big box stores. Staff is great and really friendly. I wanted to get a couple of Venus Fly traps but they don't have them here but do so at the Folsom nursery. Also the PVC is cheaper here. They carry a large selection of vases, irrigation supplies, and palms. They did carry my ponytail palm but in only one size. I called in advance to inquire about it and was told to come down to see them. When I asked about the sizes, the gentleman on the line had a rather rushed unpleasant tone with me until I stated that I wasn't interested in the price but rather the selection of the palm in question. There is so much color and the prices are so low, I don't know how anyone can walk away without at least 5-6 plants easily. I ended up picking a couple of heirloom tomatoes, thai basils, ghost pepper, and blue ribbon type watermelon. I'll definitely come back for more when I think I'll need something. Their selection is way better and not too far from me.
<review# 246,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,7/15/2014,380,179,13,15,15>This is a great steak house.  Large party of 10 drunks.....they handled us with ease.Beautiful backroom, private waiter & waitress......TOP NOTCH service.  They substituted the wine we wanted for the more expensive bottle because they had ran out and didn't tell us.  Basically, tossing in the $75 dollar bottle in place of the $50 bottle 3 times or more....plus ton's of mixed drinks.  My wife and I were the only ones drinking wine.I had the scallops with wine.  Cooked perfectly melted in my mouth.  My wife had the Rib Eye with wine.  Cooked perfectly.......now I am hungry.  We had salads with wine.  And more wine with wine.  We had a lot of wine.Wish this was a longer review.....it was a FANTASTIC meal.....but I drank a lot of wine.$1500-$2000 later.......went and drank some more!  Here's to great friends and great times.  This is a place to do it at.  Ask for the private back room.......we were loud.....with no issues at all.I would never hesitate to eat here.  If you are disappointed you can personally punch me in the mouth.West Roseville in the house!  Enjoy
<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,7/14/2014,2712,383,9,16,11>This place has been our dog's vet for years now. Earlier this week, I brought in our dog April to catch up on her vaccinations.Yesterday, she'd undergone a scheduled molar extract and had several bad tooth pulled out because they were infected and had caused swelling on the left side of her face. When I dropped her off in the morning we were told that we'd be given a status update over the phone at noon. Sure enough at noon, the phone rang and we were happy to hear that she did well coming out of the anesthesia.We've also decided we might as well get her a chip implant just in case she goes Chi-Poo gone wild around the neighborhood again.After all was said and done, our April no longer had sewer breath, her teeth are as white as they can be, all of her nails trimmed and she's now a walking GPS.Once again I'd like to thank the staff here for always being so compassionate and of course Dr. Jassar, D.V.M. for doing a fantastic job as always...
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/16/2013,7/13/2014,168,200,7,8,8>The sweets at Ginger Elizabeth encapsulate the meaning of decadence. I can usually wax on about stores and products but the chocolates here are indescribably delicious. There truly are no words to describe the emotions (yes, emotions) that flow through you when you take a bite of a truffle, shortbread chocolate chip cookie, or their hot chocolate. Rather than grabbing your loot and dashing home to consume your sweets, grab a coffee or hot chocolate and sit at one of their tables and enjoy a sweet and the enticing aroma of the shop. The major downside of Ginger Elizabeth's is that it ruins you on chocolates for the rest of your life. Once you have tasted heavenly bliss, everything else tastes disappointing. Yes, other premier chocolates don't taste like chocolate anymore, they taste like disappointment. For those of you looking for a gift for a loved one or your most cherished love one, yourself, drive into Midtown and enjoy. It's pricey but it is absolutely legend-wait for it-dary.
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/31/2008,2/12/2008,418,300,6,8,5>The Stagecoach Too is a country western greasy spoon. John Wayne and the Man With No Name would feel comfortable having waffles at The Stagecoach. It's got all the old country Western movie posters on the wall. There also may be photographs of Tonto and the Lone Ranger. What should we order now Kimosabbi? The entire staff wears blue jeans and western shirts. Very Howdy Doody.The booths are comfy and the service is good. They keep the coffee coming while you chow down lil' doggie. I had a waffle, bacon, and scrambled eggs. Decent. But I really enjoyed my wife's chicken fried chicken. I kept begging for bite after bite until it was all gone. Mosy on over to Stagecoach Too pardners...and order the chicken fried chicken. Once we were finished we hopped on our fiery horses with the speed of light, a cloud of dust, and a hearty 'Hi-yo Silver!' and galloped into the sunset with a belly full of Stagecoach grub.

<review# 250,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/22/2008,2/10/2008,323,1092,,10,9>DeeAnn & Robert are saints.  They may never help another nonprofit put on event again after having to deal with me and my broken DVD (a long story, but the film I had to screen was scratched up beyond belief when I got it from the person who had screened it before me).  But, they were extremely easy to work with and went WAY above and beyond what they needed to for our benefit screening, including attempting to repair my busted disk.They are local gems and should get some sort of prize.
<review# 251,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/29/2008,2/9/2008,636,38,16,6,8>I'm surprised to read anyone defending the service. I've never had good service here and I've eaten here LOTS. That'll tell ya just how much I enjoy the food though, to keep returning for more abuse.So what's so bad about it? Well, the waitresses walk away before I'm done ordering, they don't smile, they have argued with me when I asked for a side of sauce, not that they couldn't provide it but rather  that it wasn't a good idea, it goes on and on.But anyone who knows me knows that what I really like is getting punched in the face. I've made it an art form. And yes, I have a Zelda's punched me in the face story. When I was 20 I took two friends from Florida there. They were quite gay and quite displeased with the service. I mention the gay because that may have been what invited the punches, I can't be sure. We had terrible service and my friend Rob decided not to tip. Well, I tip, even when the service is bad, I just tip less sometimes. Anyway, Rob was treating, didn't tip, we left. We get around the corner and down the side street and a guy runs FROM the Zelda's to the sidewalk in front of us, then heads straight towards us. And randomly, punches me in the face, TWICE. He then headed back to Zelda's. My nose still looks different from the rest of my family's thanks to this night of pizza. How good is that pizza? After a couple of years passed I was AMAZED to find myself back at Zelda's. Nothing else would satisfy a Zelda's craving. NOTHING. It's a totally different animal than any other pizza place. I've come to love my distinctive nose and so I'll only take one star off for the punching, especially since I can't be 100% sure that Zelda's had anything to do with it and because, well, who doesn't like to punch me in my face?
<review# 252,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2008,2/7/2008,289,905,11,14,11>Lately, I have been on this penchant to perfect my shooting skills.  Perhaps it is living in Stockton, perhaps it's work.  Maybe it's my plain ol' attitude that's been on a downward spiral.  Folks, I am not about to go postal.  I am just too lazy to hit the gym and I love love love guns.  Stockton used to have a nice range a few years back but it shut down and that's when I had to to find another avenue.  Reluctantly, it has been working out... or eating.  Ironic?  Not to me.This gun range is nice.  The retail shot guns line the walls.  The pistol selection is HUGE!The actual range has 20 maybe 25 lanes.  There were some misbehaving kids (probably in their 20s..... those are kids to me) and misbehaving at a gun range is like walking into a Weight Watchers meeting with a box of Krispee Kremes..... TROUBLE!The staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable.... and the place is clean!I will be back.... probably in a couple of days.Open 10a-10p 7 days a week.  $12 per person to shoot, none of that per hour stuff.Watch out people!  I am on the prowl in Elk Grove!
<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/26/2008,2/6/2008,390,574,7,8,7>The suite setup of this hotel is really practical for families and at $119 (group rate) seemed like a bargain.  We had a king bed and our own little mini-room while our son was on the pullout couch in the main part of the room.  Each bed had its own TV. We didn't take advantage of the full kitchenette complete with two electric burners, dishes, measuring cup, pots, full size microwave and fridge, and even a mini-dishwasher...but all that could come in handy if you're staying more than a night.  The breakfast is decent...muffins, bagels, fruit, yogurt, cereal, juices, coffee, etc.  And warm cookies as we arrived.  The breakfast eating area is really more of a little lobby and lacks in places to sit.  This isn't a fancy hotel..it's more in line with a Best Western but with the added suite configuration of the rooms.  They do have a spot in the lobby with 3 computers and online access.I'd give it 4 stars except that I was ankle-deep in bath water by the time I was done with my shower.  I hate that.  We were humored that they made us sign their Fri/Sat night "no party" policy.  As if.

I want my pita chips and Charles Shaw and a yummy free sample to fill the void!!!!!! Why are these East Sac yuppies in their Subarus such bad drivers? NOOOOO - don't put it in reverse - you passed that spot and you don't get to go back and correct your error. Please, fatty, take the spot in the back - an extra 50 yards of perambulation is not going to kill you! I am inhaling car fumes from sitting here and I hate your tevas and your Greenpeace stickers and your dye-free reusable grocery bags! ARGGGGHHHHH!!!!And then you walk in and it was all worth it. Your frustration and anger and end of the day madness is pushed aside as you walk through the aisles carefully eyeing the new products, the favorites, the offerings you've always wanted to try but haven't gotten around to yet. Who cares that those same bad drivers in the parking lot are now wielding shopping carts with the same ineptitude? I am on Cloud Naan and even busted into a bag, chomping away on my favorite curry version of the Indian Bread. I am planning creative bruschetta pastas and spring green salads. I am in control of my food destiny and I am going to blow $100 bucks but it will be well worth it and I will walk out happy and proud of how well I shopped and how if someone were to survey MY selections they would definitely know how much my taste rules.

Everyone there has always been really nice. One day I went in thinking I was uber-cool with my trendy brand-new cool looking Asian printed T-shirt and the owner started laughing until he got teary and gave me a hug and a pat on the head. So I asked one of the clerks (John), what was up. "It's your shirt. It says 'Shop at Target.'"I love this store.

I'm still kind of new to pho, so I'm trying it out around town.   My favorite thing about pho is all the goodies that come on the side to add to the dish. I get to make it any way I want.   While I was sitting there, two sheriff officers chased some guy and slammed him against the window. They searched him and let him go. Every one in the restaurant just kept on eating like this was nothing new.   I ordered and my food came out in about 5 minutes. I finished my eating. The medium was too big. I'm getting the small next time. I can't imagine eating the extra large.  I didn't know you went to the counter to pay. I sat there like an idiot for 20 minutes waiting for my bill.  now I know.  very satisfying lunch.

I have fond memories of going there with my mother and my brother to get either Nutty Cones (scoop of vanilla dipped in chocolate with chopped nut sprinkles), Mini Nutty Cones or Banana Chips (slices of banana dipped in chocolate). It was always a treat... and still is.They serve food there, but who cares. They serve ice cream! And good ice cream at that.I remember when they used to have another location on the corner of Freeport and Irvine right across the street from where Awesome Video is now. I used to be able to bring in a good report card and get a  free scoop of ice cream. You know fatty HAD to get his free ice cream ANY WAY HE COULD. If that ment getting a good grade or two every once in a while well that's something I would just have to do.They also employ one of the best and craziest delivery drivers I have ever seen in my life. He goes by the psuedoname, Jumpin' Johnny Crasharama. He drives a U-Haul-looking delivery truck like he was being chased by cops on the evening news.P.S. I love all the names carved into the old wood tables. Tradition.

When I think of Sacramento i think of mullet headed Oakley wearing kids driving mustangs racing everyone at every red light.  Thanks to Waterboy I think differently of Sacramento.  I now think of those same Oakley wearing mullet heads enjoying the cheese plate and scallops at Waterboy while pondering where to put their next "bad boy" tattoo.Now I am sure Grace K has the ability to make some guys do certain things they might not want to do.  I for one, was not about to be charmed by her looks or her (excuse the pun) grace.  When she said that I was going to eat the sweetbreads, i said to myself, hell no, she cant make me eat that.  Enter waitress.  She asks if we want an appetizer.  Archie says...SWEETBREADS!!!Caved.  Oh well.  Cmon, it's Grace K.In reality whatever body part we ended up eating was pretty good.  Tasted kind of like a piece of REALLY TENDER chicken.  I highly recommend at least trying it.  I am actually craving a sweetbreads burrito.  For the record, sweetbreads are made from lambs pancreas.  Awesome.I had the skewer sampler which is like crack to carnivores.  Lamb, chicken, sausage, all on a single plate.  It was pretty good.  The cheese platter appetizer was damn good and mixed well with the toast pieces and wine.  Yesterday I thought of Sacramento and had visions of mullet wearing dirt bags in mustangs.  Today, I have visions of spicy Koreans and lamb pancreas.  Name another restaurant that can do that do you.  I dare you.

It's a little more pleasant than going to the mall, especially on a nice cool evening. This one doesn't really compare to the ones I've seen in Southern California or in the Bay Area, but at least it's something. Let's hope that it continues to attract more people into the Roseville area.One "ugh" that I have about this place is the freakin' ROUND-ABOUT. Seriously? The last time I checked, we lived in California, not Great Britain. What's with these things? I'm not confused about it, but %80 of the driving population seems to be.But here are the main reasons why I'm a fan:1) Anthropologie's sale section AND window displays that are easy on the eyes. 2) Happy Hour at Tres Agaves and McCormick & Schmick's3) Tables with cushioned seats and umbrellas4) Beefy security5) Fancy weekend whips such as a Bentley continental GT, vintage Porcshe roadster, Mazarati, and a couple of BMWs, Mercedes Benzes, and Audis sprinkled here and there. 6) And lastly, the atmosphere. "But, Tricia, it's so snooty!" I can see where you folks get that sense, but if you just ignore it, you really can have a relaxing shopping experience here. My favorite times would be in the early weekday evenings in the spring or fall. Come see for yourself

We started off the night with complimentary wine tasting. Then proceeded with the $41 All You Can Eat and Drink. Definitely a great deal! We had a party of 6, and had the long table so we got to try all 4 broths. Miso, Spicy Miso, Tonkatsu and Spicy Tonkatsu. The 'spicy' broths were just perfect! But probably a bit spicy to those who don't like spicy. All the veggies and noodles were fresh! They tasted so delicious, especially the shiitake mushrooms! My fave! The Kobe Beef literally melts in your mouth! Everything was awesome! The staff always made sure we had more than we needed. This was definitely a great dinner experience. I think the staff made it really fun for us. We got to spend some time interacting with them and getting to know them. Great customer service always makes a dinning experience memorable!Word of Advice: If you opt for the All You Can Eat & DRINK, please make sure you have a sober driver to get you home safe!  :)

If you don't mind driving around for a bit, try the nearby streets for parking and then just walk as opposed to paying for parking at the fair. They're gonna take you for all your worth once you're inside, so save while you can! Then, once inside, take advantage of the people watching, fried foods galore (FUNNEL CAKE), beers, games, exhibits (the reptile exhibit and the county booths are my favs), rides, and animals. If you're a little strapped for cash like I am right now, go on a Tuesday. The majority of the rides are only 1 ticket each instead of the usual 5-10. Then, pocket that cash that you would've used and get your booty to a carny game and piss it all away anyway for that impossible to win pink stuffed monkey! Now.... Go!

It's not quite the place for the yogurt and grapefruit or peanut butter on a rice cake crowd. This is hearty, stick to your ribs, crawl under your desk and nap the rest of the workday kind of food.So now that you know, do yourself a favor and order the BBQ Tri-Tip Sandwich.

When I walked in, I was immediately greeted by a nice guy that could tell I had never been there before. He showed me where the menu was and let me take my time to figure out what I wanted. You know how some places, when you order takeout, they just stand there looking at you with those eyes that say hurry the hell up and order lady. This was a nice change. I ended up ordering Honey Walnut Prawns, Chicken Chow Fun, Chicken Fried Rice and Hot and Sour Soup. The HWP was delicious. Nice size shrimp with a nice layer of coating with just the right amount of sauce. And the sauce was great. Sometimes I find the sauce in HWP to be too mayoey. Is that even a word? But this sauce was just right. Nice sweet, but not too sweet flavor. Very good. The CCF was excellent. I loooooove me some CCF. I don't know why I don't ever see it on menus anywhere, but if they can make it for me I will be in love. And I was not let down. It was excellent. The CFR was exceptionally good. For me, it seems that fried rice is either bad or good. There never seems to be a middle. This was beyond good. I almost didn't order HSS because most of the time I don't like it. But I keep ordering it hoping that one day I will like it. I have not liked it in Sacramento until Lam's. Now that I have found a place where I actually like it, I think I will stop searching. There was also a really sweet looking lady behind the counter. She is the one that took my order. Such a sweet smile on her face. While I was there, three other people came in to place orders. The guy I mentioned earlier started chatting with us and we all had an engaging conversation. It is nice to be surrounded by friendly people when you are by yourself. This place was a nice little find for me, and I am rather sad I did not find it sooner. Thank you Yelp. And thank you Lam's.

Yes, they now have people that speak english.The Wizard says; check it out.

Okay but I actually live in Midtown Sacramento and I just really want thee best meatball sandwich............ you'd find me at Roxie's. It's an East Sac neighborhood joint and they had me at the BBQ in the parking lot. Walking in you would think it was a neighborhood liquor store until the guys behind the deli counter shout out, "what can I get 'ya?" Shocked by the depth of the voice ( and the size of the guy's) I say, " I iiiiiii don't know what do you eat?" Out comes 3 great descriptions of their fave meaty menu favorites. I am a huge fan of people that believe so much in their food, they tell you what to eat. Meatball Mafia Style it is............... and oh Mother of Mary the explosions of spicy, meaty in my mouth I could of died, yes mafia style. Their 'fridges are full of new and daring hydration. The door in and out, yes it's a grocery mart, was held open thanking me, sincerely, for business. A+ for service, A+ for menu options, A+ for Delicious toasty mastery of sandwichery.

<review# 268,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/19/2010,8/15/2010,354,195,5,11,9>The BF and I took my little vegetarian sister here tonight for a pre-birthday dinner. I'm so glad that we went here because we had such an enjoyable dinner. The staff was so nice and very helpful. When I couldn't choose between the Ethiopian red wine or the honey wine, she brought out two glasses of both to let me choose which one I preferred the most. The honey wine was the best I have ever had. I know now where I will be getting my gift wines (When I don't know what to get an adult, I get them a bottle of my favorite wine) The boyfriend and I ordered the combo platter for three (OINK OINK) =) I just wanted to experience as much as I could seeing as how I'm trying to cut back on eating out and knew I wouldn't be back for awhile. My little sister ordered the vegetarian combo platter. We also ordered the appetizer (forgot what it was called, but took a pic) They were little fried packages of goodness, stuffed with lentils and spices. When our waitress brought them out to us they were so hot. Hot = FRESH! I love that!When our huge platters of food arrived the waitress explained to us what everything on the platter was. She then explained how, traditionally, you eat the food. You take your Enjera (thin sourdough pancake) and scoop up all the deliciousness before you. They will give you forks if you ask, but being the person I am, I choose to eat with my hands. Everything was scrumptious, flavorful, and damn good! This place made me eat my greens! Only one other place has made tasty greens like this (IL Fornio) I fell in love with the lamb. So tender and full of flavor. I overheard the people at another table raving to each other about their meals as well. 5 star service5 star food5 star honey wine!I walked out with leftovers and a bottle of honey wine in my hand and a smile on my face.
<review# 269,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/10/2008,6/23/2009,50,290,3,4,2>Let me be upfront about this.  I love ramen and I always just assumed that to satiate my quality ramen cravings, I would have to visit SoCal (*spits*).  Bay Area has a few decent joints, and gave up on ever finding a good one in Sac.  I also like super spicy food.  So when people here are raving both about the ramen and, in particular, the heat in the Challenge Ramen... I mean come on... my curiosity was piqued.So my first trip to Edokko, the waitress was incredibly friendly and was all ready to let me start looking when I pretty much said, thanks, but I know I want the Challenge Ramen.  Now, I never want to pre-judge heat at a new restaurant, but just to be safe, I went with the Super Hot (second hottest) instead of (as I normally would) just go with the hottest they have available.  20 minutes later and I get a huge, piping hot bowl of ramen.  It's pretty basic, chicken, bean sprouts, veggies, and those pink and white fish patty things, but everything in the broth was covered in the chili.  Just looking and smelling, I knew it was gonna be good eats.The veggies they used were very fresh, no question.  If anything, I'd say Edokko went lighter than I'd like on the veggies.  The ramen noodles were definitely fresh, but nothing outstanding about them.  The broth was light and very spicy.  Clearly the chilis were taking center stage with the Challenge ramen.On my second trip, I went with the Crazy hot Challenge ramen, and it was pushing me on comfortable heat.  It was completely manageable, but I was definitely breaking a sweat (I think the summer heat didn't help here).  Also, by the point it's at crazy hot, you're losing a lot of the flavors of everything else and just tasting the chilis, so from a flavor perspective, I'd probably bring it back down a notch in the future.I'd say that with the Challenge ramen, Edokko is doing what it set out to do... feature a hot and spicy bowl of ramen.  I'd just like to see the noodles cooked with a little less firmness and a heartier bowl of food.  Seemed to be a bit too much broth to not quite enough noodles and veggies.  Still a huge bowl of food though.  Will definitely be back!
<review# 270,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/15/2008,6/22/2009,21,10,9,6,7>I went to Amarin for the first time tonight on a first date, and my dining experience turned out to be a hilarious comedy of errors.My dining companion had been singing Amarin's praises for quite some time, so I--a self-professed Thai conoisseur--was very much looking forward to the visit. We were promptly greeted by a server wearing a festive yellow shirt with bunny rabbits printed on its border. I took this as a good sign.The menu was extensive and included almost two pages of vegetarian options--fabulous! I decided to veer off my trusty curry course and ordered a stir fry dish with black mushrooms, green and yellow onions, lemongrass and fresh ginger. I'm a pescatarian and I chose calamari as my "meat choice," so you can imagine how surprised I was when, upon receiving my meal (which took about 25 minutes even though the restaurant was empty), the first bite tasted strangely like...chicken?Yup. I ate chicken for the first time in over a year, and, whoa, was it ever fowl-tasting (Ha. Bad attempt at a joke. I'm a nerd). I politely spit the remainders in my napkin and picked at my date's broccoli and tofu, served in a delicious oyster sauce, until my replacement arrived.This was after we were brought an order of meat-filled spring rolls as an appetizer, by the way. Luckily the server realized we wanted the vegetarian spring rolls before our app even hit the table, and the staff was very kind and apologetic despite the fact they were all wearing bunny rabbit shirts.Meat snafus aside, the veggie food was tasty, colorful and fresh, and entrees were reasonably priced--about 10 to 14 dollars apiece. The Thai iced tea was some of the best I've had, and the understated decor and Thai rock music offers a nice reprieve from the often-chintzy, bedazzled interiors of many other Asian restaurants.Because my date swears we just had bad luck, I will be back to give Amarin another try, but next time I'll be sure to wear my best (faux) animal apparel.
<review# 271,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2009,6/21/2009,323,1092,10,20,12>I love how you can drive ten minutes outside of Sacramento City limits and the feed store clerks are wearing rodeo competition shirts tucked into their Wrangers and giving us city-folk good-natured crap about our ability to raise hens. It's really kind of refreshing. Also refreshing is walking into a room and hearing the sound of hundreds of chicks peeping away.  Thursday morning is chick arrival day at Bradshaw Feed and this is the go-to place to get them in the Sacramento area.  They had more varieties than I could keep track of--I'd say at least ten different kinds--including all the big egg layers--Rhode Islands, Buff Orpingtons, Ameracunas, Barred Rocks, and more.  All around $2.50/chick or less.  They are separated hens from roosters, so if you have the need for a rooster you can pick up one of them as well.  Feed seemed to be a bit more expensive here, but other than that, I highly recommend Bradshaw Feed for your poultry needs.
<review# 272,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2009,6/20/2009,8,2,16,15,11>Ok people....To anyone who thinks the space is 'too big' or the food confuses them, just go somewhere else. R15 will be happy to have you. Call me crazy, but I am totally in love with any place that has actual personality in this cookie-cutter town we call home. This is the only place in town where all of us vintage-wearing-old-people-trapped-in-twenty-­something bodies can go to feel loved and appreciated. Where else can you get a fabulous old-man drink like a Rusty Nail, and smoke on a great patio, and listen to great music that you would never hear on the radio, and eat unique and wonderful food all in one place, all the while hanging out with great folks who are REAL people? I just read an incredibly ridiculous 2.5 star review in the SNR and just want to say that giving this place a mediocre review because they don't have standard bar food like fried calamari and stupid uncomfortable modern sofas like every other bar in this town is just plain wrong. Sacramento residents, aren't you sick of predictable, tidy, trendy places by now? I mean we have The Park, The Mixx, Cosmo, L Wine Bar, Lounge on 20....they all have over-priced drinks, obnoxious clientele and practically the same decor.If you are ready for somewhere different, somewhere with attitude, somewhere where the bartenders are smart and a little surly if you're being an ass, but way fabulous if you recognize that tipping is not optional, and servers expect you to be an intelligent and respectful human, this is the place. This is NOT a place for the half-naked chicks...teetering around on the arm whichever bro had the nicest car (though the people watching from their patio of those headed to Empire is TOTALLY worth the price of admission). The owners, regulars, and staff LOVE this place. They have poured their blood, sweat, and tears in to this place, and it shows. They owners are not some restaurant group out to make piles of money on a boring, tired concept, and they are not some faceless investor that thought this would be a good play. These guys are there every day trying to make this the best place in town. I understand writing nit-picky reviews about places that pretend that they are the picture of perfection, overcharge you, and then fall short at every turn, but kicking these guys in the teeth just because you don't 'get it', after not even bothering to visit more than once is just wrong. This is their livelihood. These are local guys making something great happen by shear will. Next time you feel like writing a cranky review at least have the integrity to visit a few times and try more than one or two items.By the way...the Fried Green Tomatoes are incredible, and the Veggie Muffaletta(sp?) is perfect. My bf swears that dreaming about the Cobb Salad has kept him up nights.In closing.....the ten, yes ten hours I managed to spend their one day last weekend with my bf was totally worth the money. The owners are great, the people are chill, the food is awesome, and the drinks definitely don't suck. Can't say I have ever liked a place enough to come for lunch and stay for dinner, and everything in between was just as fab.Oh, and they have one house rule: "Respect the ladies." Ladies- When was the last time the owner of The Park or GV Hurleys threw someone out for smacking your ass?Thanks guys....and that jerk at the SNR can go back to TGIFridays!!!....where he can SUCK IT!!!!
<review# 273,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2008,6/19/2009,2,10,2,6,3>I can't decide what I like about this establishment more.It is the only mochi-like yogurt shop where you can choose as many flavors and toppings as you like, because it's by weight! And the toppings, they are so fresh I want to just buy it by the baulk. The blueberries are the biggest I have ever seen. They also have the fun cereal toppings (fruity pebbles, cap'n crunch, etc...). It is locally owned by the SWEETEST lady! You can find her on the sidewalk talking about her yogurt and handing out fliers. She is so passionate about the healthy aspects and about her business, you can only feel good about patronizing the shop.I mostly love the location! It's on a fantastic corner with an outside eating area (we bring our dog). You can also go out at night to the L Wine Bar, have a little hot chocolate and a bit of yogurt! It's a perfect date corner!
<review# 274,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2008,6/18/2009,43,95,7,16,15>If you're the type who hyperventilates at the sight of gorgeous fabrics, you'll probably pass out here.  I've never seen so many beautiful fabrics in one place.  Triad Plus is tucked into a generic industrial/office complex on a busy Roseville street.  There are no retail shops here, no storefronts, backlit signs, window displays or other evidence that an incredible shopping experience is waiting for you.  Still, customers find their way to this textile nirvana.Triad Plus sells decorator fabrics only.  No cheap novelty prints, no fashion fabrics, no craft supplies and no sewing patterns.  But if you want to sew drapes or recover a chair, Triad Plus is your source.The front room is packed with glorious, expensive, top-quality designer fabrics:  lush embroidered satins, rich velvets, tapestries, brocades, Jacquards, sheers, twills...are you drooling yet?  Wait, it gets better.The middle room contains equally lovely fabrics - at discount prices.  And then, just when you thought it couldn't get any better, wander into the remnant room.  The same kinds of fabrics are priced as low as a dollar a yard!  If you're not looking for anything specific and just want the pleasure of seeing and touching beautiful textiles, buy one of Triad Plus's "grab bags."  For two dollars you'll get seven pounds of luscious "scraps" that range from sample-book pages to half-yard pieces.  One grab bag provides enough material to make several throw pillows, with enough left over for costume embellishments or craft projects.If you do any home sewing or you just appreciate fine fabrics, the only place to shop is Triad Plus.
<review# 275,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/20/2008,6/17/2009,42,177,6,7,6>The wife and I are unabashed carnivores.  She could very easily be a vegetarian, though.  She craves fresh vegetables like plants crave water. I like vegetables, but somethings's wrong with me (or perhaps very right, to some of you) when I go meatless in a meal.  The Sunflower is close to home and extremely popular, so we've tried it twice now.  I feel qualified to review the place, being married to a veggiephile, and having sampled the meatless lifestyle sporadically and unwillingly.  The first time, the wife had a nutburger and  I had a blackberry smoothie. I thought the nutburger tasted pretty good!  Every now and again, I get a craving for a friggin' meatless sandwich of some sort, so I've had a few and Sunflower makes the best one I didn't make myself.  The wife wasn't impressed with it, though.   She thought it was supposed to have "more flavor."  The smoothies are absolutely fantastic.  Eat light enough to save room for one; trust a brotha.The next time, I ordered a regular burrito (refried beans), and the wife ordered the black bean burrito.  Whole wheat tortillas, beans, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, alfalfa sprouts, onions, cheese.  Salsa comes on the side.  I wouldn't call it a burrito; I'd call it a giant soft taco.  The refried beans made mine taste okay.  They were seasoned somewhat.  But the whole effect was dashed to bits by the excessive amount of alfalfa sprouts they put on it.  I'm sorry....alfalfa sprouts make everything they touch taste like dirt. The wife said the black bean burrito really sucked, because it had no flavor whatsoever.  I was saying, "yes dear," but I was crackin' up on the inside.  Veggie Woman was actually upset because her meal was tasteless!  Uh....sweetheart....hello!  You're at a vegetarian restaurant!  What do you expect, girl?  Y'all vegetarians and vegans can get mad if you want to, but you know I'm telling the truth. Service-wise, it's a mixed bag...depends on when you go.  Sometimes the employees are friendly; sometimes they're not.  Evidently much better educated than your average burger joint staff.  Each time we've been there so far, one or two employees are sitting in the corner behind the counter with a book and a highlighter.  Three stars for the smoothies, the nutburger, and the chickens all over the place.  We'll pass on the other stuff.  If you order to go, please take my advice and grab some salt and pepper.  You'll need it for real.

My favorite little neighborhood joint 'Cafe au Creme' appears to be a victim of our financial crisis, and my husband and I decided to take a chance on Rueben's--a chance I'm glad we took. My husband picked up the food and he said the service was great. He brought home the food and it was exactly what I had been craving; down-home grub. The ribs were abundant, and mouthwatering, the mac'n'cheese was to die for, the rice and brown gravy yummy, and potato salad better than my mom's (sorry mom!). I swear they did not ask us to give them a review--I am just doing my part to spread the word about a place that may get looked over from some that think all the best food is in Midtown. Do yourself a favor and try Rueben's--your tastebuds will thank you! :)
<review# 277,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2009,6/15/2009,33,65,8,9,9>I only visit the Torch for three reasons - Aaron King, to watch him have his way on the electric guitar, and the OMB (old-man bar) priced stiff drinks.  Aaron King regularly plays here on Thursdays and occasionally Saturdays. On Thursdays he'll play with Harley White Jr. and on Saturdays or special gigs like the Jazz Festival, it's "Aaron King and the Imperials." The talent of any of the musicians that play with Aaron on stage are equally spectacular. There's blues, rock, jazz, and a whole lot of grit involved.  Aaron and his fellow musicians openly accept tips in the form the CA$H or alcohol from the bar. The drinks are well-priced, cover is super cheap for quality of live music performed, bartenders are friendly, and the crowd is laid-back. It's a dive bar with anyone and everyone walking through the door and I like it that way. No pretentiousness here. Tool Bags Beware when entering the Torch Club. If you make a fool of yourself, you may become a target of shunning and mocking from the musicians on stage AND fellow Torch drinkers.

I was treated to the total privilege of getting to dine at one of Ella's pre-opening trial dining nights. Ella's big opening is Saturday Sept 22. Visually - it is epic-ly beautiful! The design reminds me a little of the sheik Hotel Delano in Miami but with more of an elegant Netherlands inspired style. To make sure everything runs smoothly on opening night friends and family of Ella staff  were treated to a sort of a restaurant dress rehearsal. We got to order anything we wanted on the menu for free (oh yes - it was as heavenly as it sounds). Even better we were seated at one of the big wooden tables near the spanking new kitchen which opens right into the dining room. If you go with a big group request this table. You get to check out the pristine kitchen and watch executive chef David English work a little magic. The menu concept is shared plates. Most of the dishes are served family style. Plenty of variety: you can order from the cold bar, small plates, salads, vegetables, pasta, fish, or meat and of course, desserts. Since we got to try anything we wanted I made it a point to sample any name I didn't recognize. It was so worth it. Oysters on the half shell with Mignonette sauce - yummy! (and for me that's adventurous - I'm still learning to like oysters). Heirloom tomatoes with Burrata cheese - one of the most impressive dishes. Turns out that Burrata cheese is similiar to Buffalo mozzarella but creamier and tastier. The added bonus of the menu is that the bigger plates of fish and meat are a great value. Even though the price is higher than the other menu items you really get good value - nice size shareable portions. I love it when a restaurant helps me learn to appreciate something new. After trying the Crispy Skin Duck I am totally converted. It was amazing. Dessert - you will thank me if you order the Cinnamon Cream Tart. Hands down my favorite of them all. It comes with fresh peaches and mint and whipped cream and it is just heavenly! ************************Summary - Top food recommendations:Cold bar: CevicheOysters on the half shellSalads:Heirloom tomato saladPasta:Pillows filled with ham shanks and marscaponeFish:HalibutMeat: Crispy DuckNY StripDessert:Cinnamon Cream Tart!!!!!!!********************P.S.

This store has everything you could possibly want in an electronics store, hands down. It makes Best Buy look like a taco truck (Actually, I think Best Buy naturally looks like a taco truck, so no stretch there).You can shop for motherboards, CPU's, ram, mice, fiber channel cards, KVM switches, DVD's, video games, popcorn poppers, sewing machines, and yes, porn. The only thing that would could possibly make this store better is if they sold hot wings.My five year old loves this place and knows the layout inside and out. "But Charles," you exclaim. "Why did you only give it three stars?"Well, dear readers, I'll tell you. I gave it three stars because of their return policy and their employees. Their return policy states, and I quote: "We take any returns and put them directly back on the shelf, working or not."I kid you not. Well, okay, only slightly. I stood in the return line one day for twenty minutes trying to return a CPU that quite literally destroyed two motherboards. "Hey, this CPU destroyed two motherboards," I mentioned.The returns cashier looked at the supervisor; the supervisor shook his head, and simply said, "Back on the shelf."Do Not, under any circumstances, buy anything used from this store. It will be clearly marked as used, thankfully, in at least half the cases.My other beef with this chain are the employees. They're notorious for bad service. They all run around looking busy and like they want to be working somewhere else, most likely Best Buy.They will not help you. They cannot help you, as they don't know anything about the product they're trying to sell. Here's an actual conversation that I had with a Fry's Employee.Me: Hey, can you tell me the optimal clock speed for this dual core CPU?Fry's Employee: Ack, Thhhpt.

<review# 284,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2007,9/21/2007,40,38,20,25,15>I know, you never considered North Highlands a hotbed of haute cuisine.   In fact, unless you were making a crack run, there really isn't much reason to enter that part of town.Well, now you have a reason, and it's every bit as addictive as crack.  The Stolichniy Restaurant on Watt Avenue is so good that you'll go back time after time.My first, but not last, visit was last Friday.  I took my husband and ten year old, after having read a positive blurb in our local newspaper.  I'm always up for trying new places and foods.  The ten year old?  Not so much, but once he realized were weren't going to eat Japanese yet again, and I wasn't bringing in pizza, he gave up and off we went.  Located in a strip mall, across from a liquor store (what else?) and near a pizza joint with the menu written outside in Russian, we discovered that Stolichniy Restaurant  was crowded, with only one table left.  The host/owner asked us if we had a reservation, and when we said no and apologized, he waved us over to the remaining table anyway.  The place was small but spotless, with those wavy IKEA mirrors on the walls and a painting or two.  The menu is extensive and full of Russian/Ukranian goodies: borsht, blini, etc.  We ordered an appetizer of a dumpling filled with ground beef and pork.  It came in a little bowl, melting butter on top and sour cream on the side.  I can no longer remember the name of this dish, but it turned my ten year old into a raving Russian food fan.With our appetizer, we had a Russian beer, called Baltica.  The server brought us over the bottles so we could choose - they had a porter and a wheat ale.  We chose the porter.  It was excellent beer, although at $7.99, very expensive.  Given our other choices, (bud, miller, corona) we splurged.I ordered a beef stew thing with potatoes that was out of this world.  Full of creamy potatoes, shredded beef and mushrooms and an amazing sauce seasoned with paprika, it had a depth of flavor you don't often get in a stew.  My husband ordered a pork steak that came with a heart-attack inducing amount of cheese, but which tasted so good we figured he'd die happy, at least.  My ten year old had ordered before the appetizer came, and regretted his shrimp salad.  Not because there was anything wrong with it, but because it wasn't as interesting as what we were eating.  Of course, we shared ours with him.Our meals came with a plate of sliced vegetables on the side: tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and a wonderful homemade buttermilk/dill dressing.  Had I actually been on crack, I probably would have skipped the veggies and just drank the dressing - it was that good.I read in the paper that the woman who owns/cooks in this restaurant was trained in culinary school and ran a restaurant back in her home country.  Her skills are evident as everything we ate tasted wonderful,homemade and fresh.  I can imagine that it is representative of the best of her country.I hate to recommend this restaurant because then a bunch of people will discover it and I'll never get a table without a reservation again.  But, people who cook that good should be shared with the world, so I'll give up my selfish tendencies.  If you are ever curious about what excellent Russian food should taste like, and also enjoy a drive through a crack neighborhood, this is the place for you.
<review# 285,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/9/2007,9/20/2007,690,683,6,7,8>Sacramento's train museum will always hold a special place in my heart for the awe-inspiring afternoons I spent there as a 4-8 year old with my mom (who would make the bi-annual pilgrimage from the Bay Area out here on my behalf).We've taken our own little boys here twice now -- most recently yesterday -- and I am delighted to report that it fully lives up to my memories.  My favorite exhibit is the Governor Stanford locomotive all polished up in its full 1860 glory.  My five year old especially enjoyed the super-sized engine that you can climb into, while my three year old could have spent all day at the Thomas table upstairs.Anyhow, if you or your little one is into trains, you've got to come visit at some point.  And if you are making the trip from the Bay Area, suggestion that you shoot for spring or fall, as it's dern hot up here in the summer.
<review# 286,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2007,9/19/2007,39,65,20,11,26>I'm going to limit my review to the K Street Rite-Aid to pretty much one thing: The guy behind the ice cream counter during the day.I work right across the street from this place, and it's full of all kinds of derelicts and grouchy people who all help make the experience chaotic. I don't think it would be a lot better if most of the staff were closer to the average common perception of sanity, either. The customers can't seem to decide how to form a single line at each register, and the people ringing you up can't seem to put the right words together to help things run smoothly. The overhead page of "I need more casheirs to the front" always comes a little too late and is responded to even later.Pretty much every time I've been there during the day, it's been a zoo.But hey, working there must suck, and it probably takes a certain kind of toughness to be able to do it, lacking as they are in other areas.But on to my main point.The ice cream guy. He appears to have some sort of physical disability that inhibits his walking. He often gets stuck behind that ice cream counter (and we all know that the ice cream at rite-aid is one of the main reasons to go) and yet, he champs that ice cream counter.Now, I'd say he does it without complaining, but he doesn't.Before I go on, let me assure any people in doubt, I am not being sarcastic at all, here. I mean every word.I am so used to everything going horribly wrong at that Rite Aid (keep in mind, it's on K-street mall, so just imagine what half the clientelle must be like...think "dawn of the dead" meets "one flew over the cuckoo's nest") that today when some guy cut in front of me in the ice cream line, I just let it go.But the guy behind the ice cream counter? Nuh-uh, that was not cool with him. He asked me what I wanted, and the guy in front of me started to get mouthy and even, I kid you not, thumped his chest and then flung out his arms.The guy behind the counter responds "Yeah, well, you cut in front of this guy."The guy who cut in front of me said something that I couldn't make out, and then the ice cream guy goes "Yeah, that's right, you don't want to mess with me, I'm crazy, man." or something to that effect.I have seen that guy verbally hand customers their ass on a plate.I am not complaining about it, because you know what, I am a courteous, reasonable customer. I say please and thank you. I wait my turn. I listen. I wait in line and don't cut. I don't complain when the person serving me does what I told them to do rather than what I actually wanted them to do but was too stupid to find the combination of words that would get me what I wanted. Subsequently, I have never had any personal issue with this seemingly volatile ice-cream slanger, this Wyatt Earp with a cylindrical ice cream scoop. K street Rite-Aid is a madhouse, and that guy is like the Judge Roy Bean of the place. Somebody needs to be.If everybody in that place put up with all the crap that the great unwashed inflicted on it, it would be a thousand times worse than it is. Plus, I kinda laugh inside when I see a stupid customer getting their comeuppance from a guy wearing plastic gloves, a nametag, and holding an ice cream scooper, looking very much like he doesn't want to be there at all.Yes, yes. I am familiar with the idea of good customer service, but I'm also familiar with people who abuse it and spoil it for everyone else. People who hold up a line of twenty people who all should have been out the door already by a very cross woman with three to seven miniature snot factories in tow who insists that the totally unidentifiable object she has in her hand is a manufacturer's coupon.The ice cream guy at K Street Rite-Aid liberates reasonable shoppers from obnoxious time hogs. I'm not saying he's always right, but in a world that is so seldom anywhere near sane, and where most people are just trying to get the hell out the door as fast as possible, and the rest of the flustered staff (and bless their dear hearts, honestly) are trying as hard as they can to be polite to every lunatic or just (justifiably) disoriented shopper that comes up to their register, I like that somebody is laying down the law, even if its in a really peculiar and kind of unskillful way. That guy's my hero.

<review# 289,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/24/2007,3/8/2008,34,150,9,7,7>Tips for Current UCD Students:1) Learn to enjoy the slow pace of life in Davis. You'll miss it once you're out in the real world.2) Take advantage of the Study Abroad programs and visit a foreign country on the cheap.3) Take some classes outside your major, I mean WAY outside your major. You never know when Industrial Welding or Psych 101 can come in handy.4) Try to get an internship or a part time job in whatever field you want to work in while you're still a student, even if it means working for free. That experience will give you a leg up against the competition in every job you apply for.5) When you get home from a long night of partying try to remember to drink a lot of water and take a couple multivitamins. You may not be able to avoid that hangover, but you can at least make it less terrible.6) Join a club and find something to be really passionate about. If you can't find a club that interests you, start one of your own. In a campus of over 30,000 students there are sure to be enough like-minded kids to fill even Chem 194.7) Other people are never as scary as you think.
<review# 290,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2008,3/7/2008,50,269,2,6,2>So, I may be a little biased here because Chef Wang is a good friend of ours when we knew him in Napa.  We have eaten here on numerous occasions, and always had an amazing meal.  Even though we live in Portland, Oregon now, I came down to California for my birthday on Wednesday, and Mason's did not disappoint.There were six of us, so we had a pretty large spread of food, and every single bite was exquisite. With the exception of the server forgetting our cheese plate (which really was fine because we were stuffed anyhow), service was top notch.  Great wine selection too.Phil (the chef), let us know that he is moving on after 3 years at Mason's to open a new restaurant in Hawaii.  He's bringing some of his current staff along with him, so you can never tell what will become of Mason's once he leaves at the end of the month.
<review# 291,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2008,3/6/2008,89,170,5,12,9>This review is about the lingerie department at Nordstrom.I have THE MOST DIFFICULT time finding a bra that fits. I had a "bra specialist" at Victoria's Secret tell me that I am a 36 DD. I took her word for it and bought a few of their overpriced bras that day.Turns out, they were wrong. I was told I was a DD because that's the largest size that VS sells in their stores. After a few weeks, there was bruising on my rib cage from the wiring (the bra didn't "sit" right).Fed up, I head into Nordstrom. I head straight for the minimizer bras and start picking up 34 DD (out of force of habit?) ... That's when Rita Keeling came in. She asked if I needed a fitting and I skeptically said yes. Would I be had again? She took me to a dressing room and had me take my sweater off and she went on measuring. Well, whaddayaknow ... I'm definitely not a DD. She pulled at least 10 bras for me to try and adjusted straps for me. She showed me the proper way for a bra to fit. Rita definitely put me at ease (I was kinda shy about having to stand there in a bra with her in the room with me. I got over it though!) and didn't do the hard sell on me, which I greatly appreciated.I walked out with three bras ... a bit pricey ($200) but SO WORTH IT. Rita is amazing :) Her card says that shes a "certified prosthesis fitter."GO SEE HER! She knows her stuff!
<review# 292,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/12/2008,3/5/2008,77,89,10,8,3>I hate buffets... with a passion. I always did and always will.Maybe its because you're picking from food that someone else can easily spit in. Or its just bulk made food that the chefs don't put their 'heart' into. I really think its both. I first tried Mizu because my dad tricked me. He wanted to try this fantastic sushi place, not mentioning it was a buffet.  Food was yummy and at 15 dollars it was a good bargain. Jump to 6 months later and I don't want to go to Mizu ever again. I only went there because my boyfriend loves buffets (opposites attract!).  The table they gave us was so close to another couple it felt we were joining them. I could of smacked the guy with my elbow, NOT my hand. Okay the food. I found a small nasty (nasty = pubic) hair in the tempura. Wtf is wrong with me? I'm very lucky in finding pubic hairs in buffets or something (e.g. Sizzler review). They had sashimi that night. The tuna was horribly nasty looking, it was not even red in color, it was more very pale brown...and people were flocking to it like it was fried bananas or something. I don't know if it was only that night or something, but the customers that night were freakin rude, even the kids!! They were pushing and shoving to get to the food. One customer threw his already packed sushi plate in the chef's face (he was cutting tuna) and ordered to give him some..unbelievable. No wonder the workers there seem rude because the customers themselves are douche bags. Overall, food is a little above average (rolls taste the same at any other Japanese restaruant and the grilled salmon is good too), service, a result of having to withstand stupid customers and price is decent.
<review# 293,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/9/2007,3/4/2008,68,74,7,,12>This... place... is a little too good. i feel like i'm being set up by well educated gangsters every time i go in. The Barristas are nice, its a laid back atmosphere, wireless internet, and the coffee is tasty, but id recommend the Chai over the coffee. I had a Chai one night and sort of got lost in a fantasy world where i was a happy rapping dragon and i got into a Saturday Night Fever dance battle with a vagabond leprechaun that was actually a bum over on 10th street... OK maybe not, but the Chai was so good, that i was worried that 'might' happen, so i drove home. And thats something to brag about. They frightened me with their ruthless comfort. I really appreciate that they didn't rip apart the old look of the previous book store that used to be there, i think it adds to the look of the place and every time i've gone in, its been fairly quiet too.Good game, Temple!
<review# 294,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/30/2007,3/3/2008,80,33,5,10,6>I was fully prepared to not like this place. While I didn't really fall in love with it, it seems like it's a better fit to the neighborhood than I thought it would be. The place is about two-thirds bar and one-third restaurant, with the restaurant specializing in bar food like sliders, hot wings and pulled-pork sandwiches at fairly reasonable prices.For me, the iron test of a greasy-bar-food establishment is what they do with a burger. Service was friendly enough, although the bartender seemed to assume that my glancing around the room reading the pithy "bar advice rules" posted around the room (stuff like "If you owe someone money, pay them back at a bar, preferably during happy hour) meant I was watching the sports game on TV, and he shared a friendly anecdote about some sports guy who was injured. I had no idea what he was talking about, nor am I sure what sport was being played on the TV screen, so I just smiled, nodded and ordered my burger. (I should note that I think the fact that the place has only one TV screen, and not six, is a good thing. Only one more than necessary.)The burger that arrived shortly afterward was this big, irregular-shaped monster patty that was way too big for the bun, which was a decent-sized bun. I think they deliberately want to tell their customer that this burger was pulled from a large wad of hamburger meat, not dispensed from a pre-formed perfectly circular hamburger patty dispensing machine. No weird sauces or spices were added, so one could actually taste the meat and the slightly carcinogenic tang of flame broiling. The fries that came with it were crisp and cooked just right, and there were a whole lot of them. I managed to finish the burger and fries in half an hour of concerted effort.Although it's supposed to be a country-themed bar, the piped-in music varied from Jackson 5 to ZZ Top, probably some satellite-based feed of "Rowdy Bar Music" or something. The place is clean because it's new, but I imagine before long the place will start to have some well-worn character and a growing assortment of knick-knacks on the walls, and its own unique bar funk.Plus point: They're going to be open until 2 AM seven days a week, and supposedly the kitchen will stay open too. Whether or not it's a place I'd actually consider visiting should I decide I want to partake of some dead animal flesh at 1 AM is another matter, but at the very least I'd consider it, and I now know that if I'm going to go I'd better go hungry, if not thirsty.
<review# 295,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/18/2008,3/2/2008,410,351,10,10,4>here's what you need to "survive" a night out at Avalon:1. Large group of locals. Refuse to pay $15 just to get in, folks! Get onto their website or talk to your local Sac friends. Some one knows how to get onto the guest list. Guaranteed.2. Cute shoes with stable heels and ankle support straps (if you must do sandals). Firstly to make it past the fashion brigade and into the place, and secondly to keep you from twisting ankles over the vodka-cranberry-slick floors. DO NOT bring your Very Fines.3. Hand sanitizer. If you're smart, you won't stand in the 15-minute line for the small & sh*tty bathroom... instead, take advantage of the johnny-on-the-spots out back with the smokers. The sanitizer comes in handy because there is no sink to wash up.3. Game. Come prepared to get hit on every time you meet someone's eye, it's always a full moon at Avalon.4. Hockey pads. I only recommend the high-fashion look of full hockey gear to those who STAND IN THE MIDDLE of the dance floor in the salsa room. The unspoken rule of salsa: if you're standing where i'm supposed to be spinning, you can expect an elbow jab, hip check or heel peck. Fair game.5. Designated driver. Folks, you need someone who can get through road blocks and "hot zones" who has not had a drop to drink. If you have no DD to speak of, put the local cab # in your phone (916) 444-2222. thx Yellow Cab of Sacramento...

The biscuit was a little hard and the gravy had very little flavor and a few slices of link sausage in it.(minus 1 star) At other tables I observed Pancakes and Waffles that looked great and the next time i go i will have some of them.I will return.P.S.

<review# 297,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/29/2007,2/29/2008,164,248,,15,7>My sheltie started sneezing on Thursday. I went to work on Friday, feeling extremely guilty, but hoping that my poor furry baby would be better when I got home. Nope. He sneezed on and off all night. Saturday morning (today), I called my regular vet and was told that they were booked solid, but they gave me the number for Arbor View and wished me luck.     I spoke with a very nice lady named Marilyn, who said that they could fit my baby in later this morning. The clinic is on the corner of Foothills and Pleasant Grove in a new shopping center, next to Arbor View Dental. When I walked in, I was greeted by a pleasant, clean smell and two smiling ladies at the front desk. The waiting area is quite large, with two seating areas. It looked kind of fancy-shmancy, and I started worrying about how much this was going to cost me.  After only a couple of minutes, we were called back by the veterinary assistant. She was young and cute, which did not score any points with my sheltie. Before she attempted to take his rectal temperature, she asked if he bites. I answered that he has never bitten anyone. Of course, as soon as she started to insert the thermometer, he snapped at her. Sorry. Honestly, he has never done that before.     Dr. Patricia Colley came in and asked us a few questions and determined that my baby probably had something stuck up his nose. She recommended that he be sedated so that she could scope his nose and remove any foreign objects. She quoted me a cost of $150 to $200. We left my poor baby there and the doctor promised to call us when the procedure was finished. Two hours later she called and told me that they had removed a fox tail from his right nostril. We picked up my sleepy baby, and the bill came to only $83 !!!! Apparently the procedure took  less time than she thought. I am a happy camper, and I'm sure my dog will be too, once he sleeps off the drugs and decides to forgive me.
<review# 298,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/11/2007,2/28/2008,242,141,15,15,8>Rounding off to four stars.This is my second visit. I hadn't been pushing very hard to go back since my last visit when they had just opened. But, given the recent reviews, I was amenable to giving it another try.Granted, before our 7th anniversary dinner, the evening started a bit wacky. Within ten minutes of our reservation time, our five year old peed three gallons on the bathroom floor, our 3.5 year old had a meltdown over her jacket being taken off, and our dog knocked the air pump for our temporary koi pool to the ground, sending sparks flying and screeching "YIPE!" as she stumbled back into the house with her tail between her legs. Once these situations were remedied, we left everyone in the able hands of our babysitter and were looking forward to a nice meal.I settled in with a Grey Goose martini, extra dry with a twist. Well, to be honest, two martinis. I thoroughly enjoyed the Meyer lemon twist.Next, the complimentary vichyssoise with truffle oil. Maybe it was the fact that it was served in shot glasses that was off-putting, but I couldn't help but think "cement mixer." Of course, we quietly made sophomoric nicknames: "vicious-gah" and "viscous snot."After this, we ordered something we felt we could handle: salmon and pumpernickel bread, with all the accoutrements (finely chopped egg, onion, etc.) It was fine, but a bit too salty.I ordered what was touted as "Grilled Ahi tuna  with Yukon potato." What I got, in reality, was Salad Nicoise. Granted, I love Salad Nicoise. This one was quite nice, but I'm not sure it was a $24 Salad Nicoise.My better half's meal was headlined as "Fettucine with prawns and clams" but was, in fact, almost a dead-ringer for a bouillabaise. Luckily, this too was a dish he liked but was equally surprised as I was with what arrived to the table versus the description on the menu.I almost ordered the duck, done "three ways." However, once it was explained that it was the breast + confit + gizzards it conjured visions of a loin-cloth clad Ted Nugent gnawing on a fresh kill.  More like duck, done "freeway." Glad I asked.Our entrees were actually quite worthy of these four stars, just confusingly described on the menu.Dessert? Sure! Oddly, the mandarin sorbet tasted like soap to both of us. Weird. Gratefully, they didn't charge us for it. The Valhrona "Ding Dong" was the only accurately portrayed dish we ate this evening. Kudos to them for this, and it was delicious.In summary, I feel like Captain James T. Kirk about their menu. "For God's sake, Man!" Say what you mean and mean what you say! Why portray perfectly great standards through a distorted lens and offer them as an innovation?I do love the building. The food is rustic to match. On this I do not fault. I love the use of local and organic ingredients. Overall, this would be a five-star place with lower prices and less pretentiousness.I would take my appetite and wallet to Waterboy and Restaurant 55 Degrees over Mulvaney's any day. Well, not to sound like an ingrate: my wonderful husband/best friend brought me here, and that, in and of itself, made for a lovely meal.
<review# 299,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/7/2011,1/11/2012,249,49,23,17,20>Believe it or not,  there was a random chihuahua roaming for food the first night I visited. He was there on his own free will, too. Yo quiero... okay, I'll stop. It was 9:30pm on a Saturday, and a friend and I just finished satisfying our fall shopping urge at the Rack. Where to eat? Chando's was bookmarked in my Yelp app and still open with 30 minutes to spare! Like moths to a flame, we gravitated toward the brightly lit taco stand. Walking up to Chando's, we were delighted to see a grill outside where the meats were freshly cooked! Loooved it. There were only two couples ahead of us. I ordered my three tacos (fish, adobada and chicken) and she, her two tacos and mulita. During our short 5 minute wait, we jokingly plotted on how to snatch the meat off the grill when the cook wasn't looking. (He goes inside to grab something, leaving the meat unattended. We run up and pick several pieces off but end up dropping the piping hot meat on the ground and running away with empty burnt hands... while cackling.)Both being new to the place, we peered into our boxes and frowned at the size of our spoils but rejoiced at the warm aromas. Stay and eat or go to my place? Eating on the balcony while sipping on wine in our comfy sweaters sounds like perfection, right? Although we feared soggy and cold food, we braved the 5-10 minute drive back to my place.  They sent us off with a smile and off we went with my car smelling of spices which made me salivate.Considering Chando's uses fresh ingredients, wine and tacos aren't such an odd pairing. We were both amazed at how flavorful, filling and ridiculously well-priced everything was (not to mention still warm). The size of these tacos were quite deceiving! They don't skimp on meat, people. I didn't feel like my insides were coated in grease, either.  We laughed and talked, sipped and devoured. It was a good night and Chando's Tacos had a huge part in making it that way.Since then, I've also tried the birria and carne asada tacos. Although I really do love 'em all, I'd say my personal top two are the birria and fish (tilapia). I've tried some of my bf's carne asada burrito, and it was so damn good. As others have mentioned, the burrito is filled simply with meat and veggies. The $1 chips and pico is a steal, but although I did like the pico, the chips didn't taste like they were fried in fresh oil. Maybe just a bad batch.During the day, eating on their patio listening to upbeat  music can be a treat, but beware the flies. It was almost difficult to savor my meal when I was being harassed by those pesky things. And seriously, I showered.    But chips and flies are small details when it comes down to it. Its main staples are great and I'll continue to eat and recommend Chando's Tacos time and time again.
<review# 300,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/25/2011,1/10/2012,794,137,7,17,9>This is the type of cute little bistro that would be featured on a Food Network or Cooking Channel show.  No, not the divey ones, the upscale/trendy ones.  Like Unique Eats or something (boom Magpie, you've just been nominated!).First off, they do the fresh, local, seasonal ingredient thing here (which I love!).  One thing that's really great about the Sacramento restaurant scene is because it's small, you can play spot-the-chef at the Sunday morning Farmer's Market and almost always see a handful of local chefs taking in nature's bounty and then see it on your plate on Sunday night.  This also means that the menu here is constantly changing and the chef is trying new recipes, so it's fun for those who like change (don't worry, the chocolate chunk cookie remains the same).We went in for lunch yesterday and I have to say, they do a fast and fairly-priced lunch!  We ordered and paid up front (the usual protocol) and our order was at our table within 10 minutes.  We were in and out in less than 30.  Given the prices and speed, I would count this on my roster of potential to-go or fastfood alternative spots.I tried a special mac n' cheese with some blue cheese, brussel sprouts, cheddar, and smoked bacon.  I know what you're thinking: why in the world are those healthy brussel sprouts contaminating my fatty-delicious mac n' cheese?  Well, surprisingly enough, they really work and cut the richness of the blue cheese and bacon combo.  The sprouts were very fresh, crunchy and sweet, and not bitter at all.  I liked the addition of a little blue cheese, but it does make this dish incredibly rich, so I suggest sharing it with someone.  So then I switched plates with my husband and tried half of the Vietnamese sandwich, made with deliciously tender Niman Ranch beef, and crispy pickled daikon and carrot, with some cilantro and yummy sauce.  That was one VERY tasty sandwich!  It tasted crisp and refreshing after the heavier mac and cheese.  We finished it off with the chocolate chunk cookies (that's a no-brainer).  In case you haven't tried these yet, they're made with a darker less sweet chocolate, dare I say bitter-sweet?  Absolutely delicious.  I'll be coming back for those mussells for dinner soon!  If the dinner is as good as the lunch, then I'm upgrading Magpie to five stars.

It's large, well-equipped, and clean (to "Family W.": I've coached in a handful of gyms myself and the cleaning practices of the staff here are standard. They're not going above-and-beyond dousing mats in hospital-grade antimicrobial spray). I attended the adult class on Mondays which served as a painful reminder (i.e. three consecutive days of soreness to the point of near-immobility) that I CANNOT do what I used to do, but that's OK. I've also had a chance to observe the dynamic among coaches and gymnasts, and I like what I see. The communication, supervision, spotting, and drills are all at-par with other reknown (and expensive) facilities in the area.

Then you have to fight the lines, here you do not.  And you can even pick up a pizza for the family at $9 already hot and cooked with paper plates, while your grabbing it.  My only worry is everyone will read this and I might have people in line more often LOL Hmmmm I'm thinking about deleting this actually now that I say that.

These guys watch the SF Giants chasing well liquor shots with canned  beers before jumping on the  RT home to their overpaid state worker opulent abode in Oak Park or South Sac.  It's my kinda place.  Yes, indeed. Barkeep slash ringleader, Susie, is easily one of my faves in Sacramento and absolutely cool as a cucumber.  The various scoundrels holding down the counter are like her dysfunctional family kept in line and in good spirits.  You will feel welcome here.

<review# 306,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2011,1/4/2012,518,148,6,18,11>What's not to love about a relaxing spa day with the girls?Four of us did the spa thing today which included a 90 minute massage and 45 minute foot massage, mimosas to start, lunch which included wine and then 'hang-out' time in the zen room. From the minute you cross the threshold, you feel instantly relaxed. And then a smiling young lady escorts you into the zen room and offers everyone a mimosa. And then keeps them coming. You change into the softest robes ever and then are whisked off to your first treatment. My massage therapist was Yvonne and she was pretty awesome. Treatment was relaxing and her pressure was perfect. Afterward, Yvonne brought me a glass of water and little treat - a small slice of pineapple dipped in chocolate. I love little touches that make you feel special.Next she took me back to the zen room and had me sit in a massage chair for my foot massage. It was actually a full treatment including a scrub and mask. My feet have never been happier.After that, we noshed on lunch that we had ordered when we first arrived. Everything was plated and served on trays while we sat on over-stuffed couches. And even though we lingered for a couple of hours, we were never rushed out. It was so relaxing, we didn't want to leave!Loved all the girls who work here and the owner's attention to detail. I've been a devotee of another spa for years but I think Serenity Spa is now my new love.
<review# 307,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2011,1/3/2012,40,38,15,10,13>My husband is....oh, how can I put this delicately.....completely incompetent when it comes to home repair.  Sure, he nursed me through cancer and all that, so he's not completely useless, but if a light bulb breaks in the socket, he's lost.  I know it's the new millennium and we women are supposed to be able to do all those hardware-ey things - but,  um, no.  I buy flowers.Which Emigh has, in abundance. Also abundant are employees with real "how to" experience.  Every time one of our sprinklers breaks, a light bulb twists off incorrectly, a door knob goes wonky, water shoots out of something,  or a piece of floor comes up, all we have to do is take a photo of the problem or take the part to Emigh,  and not only do they have what we need to get whatever is broken fixed, they also can give step-by-step instructions on how to do the repair.  They are so good, in fact,, I'm regretting I didn't go to them first when I found out I needed breast reconstruction.  Emigh may be a bit pricier than Home Depot, but you are not walking through a big warehouse looking for stuff without any help.  Emigh is most definitely the place to  go if you have a real problem that needs to be solved and you want personalized attention and advice.Plus, they sell hot dogs outside. And, they have a Koi pond inside.  What's not to like?
<review# 308,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2011,1/2/2012,433,220,13,17,15>I came here for a late night dinner after the Yelp SPARKLE Elite event, what a great way to end the night! This was my first time having Japanese hot pot and I was lucky enough to have a bunch of Asian ladies at my table to make sure I didn't fall in or catch anything on fire. Mind you, this was AFTER the Yelp event that Heat Shabu provided free Sake Mojitos at, so I don't exactly remember what everything I had was called. Anyways, we tried a LOT of appetizers:- The jalapeno popper-like things were phenomenal! Best jalapeno appetizer I have ever had, hands down. Those alone are worth a trip back. - Salt and pepper wings were great, especially with the dipping sauces. - The mussels had a great flavor and weren't too smelly.- The crab-cheese wontons were great, but when are those ever bad?We had the American Kobe beef, Imported Kobe beef, lamb and veggies with the Spicy Tonkatsu and Spicy Miso broths.  Everything was outstanding. The service was wonderful, the food was incredible and the place is gorgeous. This establishment really breathes some life into the area. I can't wait to come back!

I never eat regular ol chow mein, yuck!But the problem with most places is that their HK style gets super soggy super quick.  Probably due to lack of fryage for the proper length of time. Mayflower does it right though! Big plate of fried noodles topped with lots of bok choy, carrots, snow peas chicken and tons of gravy! MMM, gravy....My boyfriend and I also got the Wor Wonton soup. Big pork wontons, chunks of beef, snow peas, baby corn, carrots and a delicious broth that said "Hell no' to extra soy sauce being added. That's my knida place, the type that sends out the food just right, so no extra condiments or flavorings needed. And the porions are HUGE! we split the soup, I had like 3 bites of my chow mein, he had about 4 bites of his eggplant dish, and we took the leftovers home to eat about 2 hours later, after a warm soup belly nap. I can't wait to go back for the egg foo yung!

With their amazing flavors and customizing dishes just has us keep coming back for more! Plus they have an amazing lunch menus with just $6.99 dishes!!My all time favorite is the chicken Pad Thai "Thai Spicy" it's honestly the best Pad Thai I've ever had!

Sure, but then, this is a Brit-style pub, and I have to respect that.Flags. One of my favorite aspects of this pub is the decor, especially the colorful British flags hanging across the ceiling. If, as does occasionally befall a bingeing patron, you've fallen down and cannot get up, you can amuse yourself by guessing the origin of each flag (Hint: you really need to be a historian to know them all; I couldn't even Google em).The brews are a respectable selection, with several new choices rotating in and out. The bar staff is to-the-point but friendly enough, as are the patrons. Come back often and you'll see the same faces.Stop in and enjoy a pour! And if it's your gig, check out trivia night.
<review# 312,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2013,1/8/2014,318,132,23,34,34>VEGAN REVIEW - NO CARNIVORES ALLOWED!This restaurant has improved my relationship with my fiancé! No joke. He likes Mexican food, I hate it, which results in a conflict. He'll throw it out there as a suggestion like I won't notice and will somehow magically say that I'm in. Um, no. I used to pretend I liked it in our early dating phase, hoping to be accommodating, but now the true Danielle O has come out (you know you've done this too)!So, it's been a long time since we've gone south of the border. That is until I heard about El Papagayo thanks to my vegan Yelpers: Matty K, Dominique M, and Rene L. Thanks gals!These days, I'm begging the fiancé to take me to El Papagayo! Oh, how times have changed! This place meets the needs of many (yes, there's tons for the carnivores, but most importantly there's ton for us)!The menu is huge, so any picky eater can find something to satiate them here. The bonus for me is the pages, yes pages, of vegetarian/vegan options. Daiya cheese, check! Chorizo-style soy meat, check! Tofu, check! Plus, they offer many different types of veggies for fajitas and taco-fillings, including cactus, if you want to stay away from the mock meats. I'm very proud to say that I ate cactus for the first time here and it was delicious! I'm such a daredevil these days, living life on edge (and I have the Yelp badge to prove it)! I'm crazy about the soy meat tacos and I've also enjoyed the soy meat burrito. You have a choice of many different beans as a side, including refried, black, and white beans. The star amongst the 3 are the white beans. I recommend you do as I do: nix the rice and get double white beans as your side (with a Gas-X chaser to follow!).Service has been fantastic and friendly. They honor substitutions without hassle. Definitely partake in the extensive salsa bar with chips. You can go up and help yourself as many times as you want. So, my veggie-mates, get on over to Carmichael and veg-out!

Ear wash and cotton balls, a foaming blueberry face wash (will not irritate eyes) a choice of watermelon or hypoallergenic soap, brushes, aprons, towels etc.. All a close enough to walk to. We used the blow dryer a little, but decided the sunny walk home could do the rest.Super friendly and helpful owner, Tony, gave me a hand with my slightly wild puppy ,Tsunami, after bath time. Fenway (the handsome chocolate lab in the photos) liked this place so much, he's willing to forgive Tony for being a Yankees fan ( well, almost) Tony, I would give your place six stars if I could!  The price is great when compared to the amount of cleanup I would have to do if I bathed them at home. Will most definitely be back!**Wednesday evening is buy one, half off second dog self wash :-)
<review# 315,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/2/2013,1/5/2014,149,559,8,24,16>Short version: This new Dad's Kitchen is about to rock the socks off the Fair Oaks / Orangevale / Folsom area. If you live anywhere in the vicinity, this should become your casual dinner and weeknight happy hour and family weekend brunch spot. It's the same food, owners, concept, and vibe of the Freeport location, but bigger, more spacious, and more.... well, suburban. Longer, more meandering version: I don't mean "more suburban" pejoratively. I really think they nailed it with the space, for the clientele they are likely to get. The patio alone is the size of the the entire inside seating area on Freeport. There is a full bar which (would be nice on Freeport, too, but) is necessary when you're competing most closely with Applebee's and the like. That did sound like a slight on the suburbs. Sorry. It's a bad, but totally understandable habit.The decor is like the bigger, fancier brother to the other Dad's Kitchen. Lots of funkiness, vintage beer posters, and great use of color. The bar is spacious, and separated from the general dining room. There are also a bunch of new speciality cocktails they've created, for the $8 and $9 range. They are strong, too.The menu is the same delicious, hearty Dad's food -- thought some items have been tweaked a bit (and I'm not sure if they will also be changed at the original Dad's). We came for lunch today, and it was fantastic.  The food was really fast -- I think the kitchen must  be a lot bigger, and able to deal with greater volume. There is also a private dining room that you can reserve for a large group (up to 20, I think).This is a very exciting exciting development for the area, and also for folks stopping off on the way to Tahoe.
<review# 316,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2013,1/4/2014,582,450,4,17,10>A little hidden treasure tucked into an unsuspecting strip mall.  Today was my first visit to Kabob Gyro Grill but it surely won't be my last!  The food is sooo good and the service was quick and friendly.The place was packed when we arrived, the line was to the door.  There was one man working the grill, a girl putting plates together, and a younger guy taking orders and passing out to-go orders.  I was hesitant to go somewhere else based on how few employees were working and how long the line was.  I'm so glad that I didn't!  I was amazed at how fast the orders were filled.  I think we waited all of 5 minutes before we were headed back to the office with out delicious meals.I ordered the STEAK PLATE, which came with lean, thin sliced steak served over Basmati rice, side salad of cucumbers, tomatoes, and bell peppers, a warm flat bread, yummy cucumber sauce, and a side of hummus... all for $7.99.  The meat is super lean and is packed full of flavor.  You have the option of having your meat cooked mild, medium, or hot.  I went for the medium being that it was my first time.  It was perfect!!!  The rice was a good addition to the meat, the side salad was nice and refreshing, the warm bread was perfect for scooping the yummy meat, and the cucumber sauce was fantastic!  The meal was perfect and it wasn't greasy or heavy.  My friend opted for the Greek salad (no meat), which she said was really good.  I didn't taste it but it looked great and it was good size... all for $4.99.A great place to grab a quick and tasty meal for a reasonable price.  Dine in or carry out, you won't be disappointed!!
<review# 317,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/17/2013,1/3/2014,136,282,11,14,13>I feel this casino is just ok. Its usually crowded probably due to its proximity to Sacramento. I have a somewhat negative memory of this place because I lost a ton of money here. But isn't that how all casinos are? Probably. I just had really bad luck here but the house always wins, right? I didn't eat while I was here. I just played the slots. They have a ton of slot machines so you will be able to find one to your liking. This place is pretty big. Finding this casino can be a little tricky. I had some trouble finding it. I found it eventually though. They have a lot of restaurants and a hotel but I have not experienced any of that. I only came here to play the slots. They have table games too I think but I never play though. As is the case with many casinos, they do have a players card. I didn't think the benefits of it were that great though.
<review# 318,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2013,1/2/2014,209,356,29,30,24>Cheap, convenient, fun to browse, and a great place to find elusive specialty items. I've been here many times and I'm not sure how I haven't already reviewed it. There is plenty of parking out back and the hours are pretty reasonable. The store is cramped and smells like fish, but what do you expect from a place that sells live fish? Despite the amount of things crammed into the shelves and aisles, everything is organized and easy to find. They have a limited produce selection, but everything there always looks very fresh and, for lack of a better term, gorgeous.Love the dish section at the back and the candy selection. This is also a great place to score Fortune Cookie "Belly Flops" from the factory in Midtown. They sell bags of the fortune cookies, but also bags of the cookies that came out wrong (didn't fold right, broke, etc.). My boyfriend and I are pretty into Asian cooking, so this place has been the go-to when we are looking for hard to find ingredients. Unlike other specialty shops, this one won't break your bank and sometimes you can even find the same stuff you see at regular grocery stores, but cheaper.Complaints are few, but based on the service and behavior of some other customers. You will not be greeted or asked if you are finding everything ok. If you don't ask, they won't tell. Don't come in here thinking you'll have someone to hold your hand through getting ingredients for that crazy Chinese recipe. Do your research ahead of time so you know what you're looking for.Also, there is no such thing as personal bubble of space in this store. If you're standing in an aisle looking for something, some customers will almost literally climb on top of you or reach through your armpit to grab something off the shelf. It happens every time I go. It is more amusing than anything.

Hong Kong Milk Tea- My friends, the bitterness that makes this famous was there!  A definite must.  HK style milk tea is my favorite and if you haven't tried it yet, you're missing out.2. Salt & Pepper Spare Ribs- This one came with a helping of white rice.  The ribs weren't too heavy from the drying, and was both crunchy and delicious.  A bit on the dry side, but nothing a little bit of sauce can't help fix.3. Egg Waffles- For a side, we also ordered the honeycomb looking egg waffles.  You HAVE to order this while here.  It's a staple Hong Kong snack, and is delicious.  You'll never look at waffles the same way again!All around I loved this place.  It was homey, affordable, and had a good selection of food.  Like many Chinese places, service won't be amazing, but will be adequate.  If you're feeling for a HK cafe style eatery, this one if a kepper.Parking is available in a private lot outside.  Comes with tree shading!

I am not a huge fan of 'ramen' noodles, so I love how this place gives you the option of turning your bowl of ramen noodles into udon noodles. The broth needs to have a bit of minced garlic and chili oil added to have it tasting just right. The portions are pretty big and definitely full of noodles. I wish they weren't so skimpy on their ingredients though. But overall, It's the perfect bowl of noodles! Prices are decent. All udon noodles are $8.95. Ramen noodles start at $7.95 depending on the size of the bowl. There is also a zero wait time compared to Shoki Ramen! Be sure to check in on Yelp to get 15% off your bill! They also have a frequent diners card. After 8 stamps, get a free bowl of ramen!

I'm sure they're taking tons of business from BC which is good.After you've had a taste of Firehouse Crawfish, you simply can't go anywhere else. I've been here three times already and each time was AMAZING! I rarely say amazing so please admire that. Their crawfish are decent size and the sauce is so tasty. Not too greasy or butter-y but packed with flavor.*BE CAREFUL HOW SPICY YOU GET... 2nd degree spicy was more than enough for most of us. We finally got 1st degree spicy on our third visit and it was bearable. They should have that prescription/medicine warning on the menu "Please consult your waiter before ordering"The clams are crazy, good. It's too bad they're a bit pricy and you end up with not too many clams in the bag. Mainly shells, half-shells, sauce, and some clams here and there. Still so freakin good you can't pass it up.Great service, the girls/guys always take good care of everybody (from what I've seen) and look for our huge group photo on the wall! Whoo hoo, and that fireman pole by the wall... it's fully functioning and multi-purpose. Just kidding, kinda not really.

It had not opened up yet but I couldn't wait to try it.  I was finally able to make time to check this place out. My bf and i ordered 2 orders of Banh Xeo and fried chicken wings.  It was $6 for an order of banh Xeo and $4 for 6 chicken wings.  If you order the chicken wings to go its $6 for 12 wings.  Such a better deal!  Anyway they gave this sauce to dip with the chicken wings and it's so delicious. It tastes like sweet and sour sauce mixed with lime and fish sauce.  You've got to try it.  The wings were ok... The sauce was what made it good! They offer hot tea for free! I would definitely come back!P.S. They accept CASH only.

Maybe it's the capture of Osama that's made me a little more easy going as an ex-NYer. Who knows.I just know I enjoyed my slice and Newcastle from Uncle Vito's. I will be back during happy hour to enjoy a slice and beer for 5 bucks. This time though, I got a combo slice which consisted of olives, mushrooms, pepperoni and cheese I believe. They had Pantera on the jukebox, and just about every song I could think of. I put on some metal, and started to head bang as I enjoyed my slice.They had a bunch of different fries there, like garlic fries and some other exotic choices. I will be hitting that up at some point. With the cost and easy availability to good beer on tap, this may just become my favorite watering hole around here.Ok, Uncle Vito. I guess you can live.

[I been around :)] My girlfriend took me for my birthday and I loved every aspect of this restaurant. The decor is intimate and the ambiance makes you want to make love on the table with your significant other. Just plain romantic. The staff's professionalism and heart warming service makes this place top notch. The food is simply cocaine for your palettes; everything I have tried is AWESOME.Things I tried: Meatball Appetizer: Yum, not what I expected but it was deliciousHalibut: If fish was butter, then this would be butter... mMmmmLamb: This was sooOoo good.Definitely a place to come to.Pros: Just about everythingCons: I have nothing to dislike about this place.Stars: 5!
<review# 325,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2011,3/10/2012,192,54,13,13,11>A couple of weeks ago a group of die-hard HH'ers assembled for one of my favorite UYEs to date. We ventured outside of the comfort of the Grid to visit the West Wind Drive-Ins. It was a warm summer evening and conditions couldn't have been better to spend a night under the stars watching a couple o' flicks.A caravan of Yelp vehicles converged upon this time-tested landmark located in the Rosemont neighborhood. And we came correct! We strategically parked our cars to create an impenetrable fortress designed to keep out the riff-raff...or to keep 'em in! Joe and Ida brought enough food to feed a small army. Ice chests filled to overflowing with everyone's beverages of choice dotted the landscape.  We had enough lawn chairs to seat twice as many Yelpers; Mihn's portable hammock was particularly impressive!Those who were in need of sustenance make a quick jaunt to the snack bar to load up on popcorn, nachos and appropriate mixers. The offerings are drive-in standard; plenty of calories and carbs, but affordable and satisfying just the same.As the sun dipped lazily behind the horizon, we entertained ourselves with tales of CMYEs past, Giants scores and many tearful (Jeff) goodbyes and well-wishes to Tara W, who would soon be leaving us to make her mark on the SoCal Yelp scene.The movie finally started! I wish I could count this as a highlight of the evening but the first movie blew chunks of monumental proportions! Thankfully, this night's crew was lousy with the kind of cynicism that makes watching crappy movies at least a bit more of an enjoyable experience. The matinee wasn't much better...but again, timely catcalls and crude commentary made things tolerable, at least.The crowds were chill on this particular night. No ruffians or hood rats shooting at the screen, no fights in the bathroom and everyone pretty much kept their headlight flashing to a minimum.If this review sounds a little one-sided, that's because it is! You see, I grew up in Rosemont and have many, many fond memories that took place on this very spot. I got to watch some great movie premiers like "the Goonies", "the Return of the Jedi" and "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" on the outdoor, larger-than-life screen, to name a few. I remember sneaking friends in via the trunk of my buddy's '78 Olds Delta 88; I think we jammed six or seven bodies in that time. How about just walking in sans conveyance and meeting up with friends already inside? And I don't mean to brag, but I've had a couple of steamy make-out sessions in the back seat while the world turned around us......but I digress...The wrap-up:Don't come here if you want to watch a dark movie. The al fresco environment doesn't do any favors to movies like "the Matrix", where the lighting of the movie is so dim that much of the film views like a blank screen. Don't come here if you possess a fear of the great outdoors; The only roof you get is the inky heavens above. Don't come here if you are expecting any of the comforts and niceties of an indoor cinema.Do come here if you have a swell group of buds who aren't afraid to yell at the screen or howl at the moon. Do come here if you enjoy the breeze blowing through your hair rather than a stale AC. Do come here if you want to capture the experience of something that has all but gone the way if the Dodo in America. One way or another, it will be an experience to remember!

Unfortunately, I'd be somewhat guilty as charged.Though don't get me wrong, I'm not a high-roller by any gaming means. I'm just your average Joe with fantasies of slot machines hit the jackpot gone wild! Lately, the only thing that's high-rollin' about me are the cuffs on my blue jeans go figure!Now I've seen folks from all walks of life, which included welcomed age groups end up in casinos for a variety of inevitable reasons. May it be to hangout and catchup with friends and loved ones, enjoy the complimentary tunes of a live band, sip a few cold ones over a game, catch a show or a favorite headliner concert, dream big or small and beat the house against all odds, simply go just for the sake of going or you were left with no other option but to go?I'd say I probably have fallen into at least several, if not, all of the noted scenarios above. I guess I must truly dig the overall ambiance, the thrill, the excitement, the relaxation and the nonchalance of possibly emptying the contents of my wallet all in a days work in the name of fun and games? Nah, at the end of the day, I've learned to be thankful and to appreciate the good and the bad of it all, no matter the outcome ... Like Miss Jackson said, "That's the way love goes."Anyhow, Red Hawk Casino was fairly straightforward and easy to find as it boasted its very own "Red Hawk Parkway" off-ramp exit from the main highway. There's plenty of parking. Vegas style casino slots and table gaming options were in effect along with a nonsmoking area for play. Qualify for perks and prizes via free sign-up card membership. Believe it or not, Kids Quest Hourly Child Care available daily with activities for tiny tots and children up to 12 years old. The Cyber Quest Arcade area featured arcade gaming for kids of all ages. Besides The Waterfall Buffet as a dining option, they also have a handful of other restaurants to choose from and watering holes to tickle your fancy.Red Hawk Casino for what you've got to offer I'm a fan! And at times you just look like sunshine sittin' on a waterfall...

You've been there for the best times (prom, first dates, friend hang outs) and the worst of times (breakups, late night depression pig outs, bad days that involved making it better by shoving french fries in my face) and I can't thank you enough!Your fries are delicious, not too salty and not too greasy. They compliment the little cups of ketchup amazingly well. The grilled cheese is alway fabulous, you never leave the cheese cold (like other nameless fast food restaurants...) and the dr. pepper is never flat or too syruppy. Your booths are always the best and you wipe down the tables so it never looks like the two year old tornado-ed their food across it. Your workers never get mad when I lovingly ask for the side of sauce nor do they look at me funny (ie: "Hey porker! slow down!")when I splurge and go back for my second order of fries. Thank you In&Out, I hope we continue our amazing realtionship.
<review# 330,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/30/2007,7/14/2007,39,65,3,8,4>Giant hamburger with fries that you can have seasoned a couple of different ways. Your hamburger gets served to you with a steak knife skewered through it. The weird thing is, for some reason, you actually want to eat it that way. Maybe it's the mattress-like quality of the bun.The interior decor is kinda fantastic, sparkly, and dumb, but I can't say that I entirely hate it. It just looks kinda like a grown-up people's version of undersea barbie (which I might have just made up).The bar? Can't speak for it, really. I've only ever gotten my grub on there. It's an okay burger, more of the gourmet variety, and not too greasy, but a good texture and moderately decent flavor, but there's something sorta wet sawdusty about it. God, that sounds awful. If you ate it, you'd know what I meant, and knowing what I meant, you'd know that it's not disgusting, it's just not Nationwide Freezer Meats.The wait staff usually seem pretty friendly or at least pretty willing to do whatever you ask them to (within the confines of something to do with food service).I almost never go there any more, because the burgers are okay, but a bit too pricey, and their relatively larger size kinda doesn't justify it. If I'm going to pay that much for a burger, it needs to be special, and it's not. It's sorta not like any other burger in town, but it doesn't sing. Different does not mean better.I'd go there again with friends, or just to mix things up, but if ever, probably for the former reason, as if I wanted to mix things up, there are plenty of places in town that I haven't even tried yet.There are better burgers in town, but sadly, not quite enough.They have a private parking lot, but it's small. Depending on how quick on the draw you are, you might have to park on the street.
<review# 331,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2007,7/13/2007,48,27,5,5,6>I've just returned from my third visit to Old Soul. I'm no coffee connoisseur but I know what I like and I'm throughly enjoying my soy mocha. I know real connoisseurs wouldn't use such a frou frou drink to judge an establishment's coffee but I love the combination of espresso and chocolate. I had a carrot pecan pineapple muffin on this visit and a orange cranberry scone on the other two visits. They are both really yummy. Definitely no complaints on the taste. But perhaps they could ease up just a weensy bit on the butter? I dunno...maybe it's just me. But my passenger car seat was left with a mini puddle of grease and the napkin and paper bag were drenched. Don't get me wrong. I like butter..A LOT but this amount is overkill and doesn't add to the overall flavor. But ladies, I suppose a bonus is you won't need to apply lipgloss after you've enjoyed your buttery treat. They still use the honor system centered around the silver urn-like jar. Coffee, lattes and pastries are still $2. But the soy milk and mocha options are now $3. Oops, I didn't ask but I'm assuming if you get both it's still $3? I'll tip big on my next visit.The ambiance is pleasant with an open airy feel, art work and a nice little seating area. You can watch the owners prepare their baked goods and it looked like one of them was teaching a class this morning. The atmosphere definitely beats Starbucks anyday. Oh, and yes..there is a cute guy working behind the counter...extra incentive!
<review# 332,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2007,7/12/2007,260,392,9,8,10>When you encounter a plume of smoke obscuring your path along Stockton Boulevard, what should you do?  Take a deep whiff!  It's bar-be-que grill smoke from the Cafe Au Creme.  I had smelled and spotted smoke coming from a mysterious outside grill in a parking lot on the corner of Stockton and Parker while driving past, but I couldn't figure out where the restaurant was.  Finally, my need for down-home flavor got the better of me and I explored this home-cookin' hideout.I made my way into the Cafe Au Creme, the only logical nearby storefront that would belong to the outside grill.  Sure enough, the place smelled G-O-O-D, and the menu read: "Cafe Au Creme -- Featuring Dave & LaMond's Bar-B-Que".  I doubt if anyone really comes here for the coffee, because the couple seated in front was putting away plates full of grub.  A local guy on a mission made a beeline for the menu and ordered himself some hot links.My rib meal arrived faster than his hot links (which are a cooked-to-order item).  My pork ribs, on the other hand, were infused with love.  Slow-smoked until the meat was permeated and had turned that nice pinkish hue.  And the dry rub applied to them gave a righteous peppery crust which was the perfect counterpunch to the sassy BBQ sauce they were swimming in.  Come to think of it, my shoe would've tasted pretty damn good with that sauce on it!  But the combination of flavors along with the tender slow-cooked smoky meat was a serious barbeque lover's dream come true.For value and flavor, this was a five-star experience.  My rib meal was only nine bucks and change.  The sides (red beans & rice and mac 'n' cheese) were small portions and needed a little seasoning, but this was really about those goddamn ribs!  Amen, brother-man!I'll be back for my baby back and because this baby's GOT back!
<review# 333,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2007,7/10/2007,15,51,1,12,8>UPDATE from the Sacramento Bee, July 17:"In Sacramento, the River Otter is an endangered species.After months of absence from the Sacramento River, the popular River Otter Water taxi service was supposed to restart operations Monday. But now the new owner says the vessels are unsafe and he's unsure when -- if ever -- the taxis will be on the water."About a month ago, I was disappointed to see the little ticket booth next to Rio City Cafe boarded up -- River Otter Water Taxi Company was no more.K and I got that sinking feeling you get when a beloved part of your life passes into history.  Once or twice a year, we would buy our $5 round trip ticket for a pleasant ride to the Virgin Sturgeon in the mini tugboat-shape carrier.  The Otter stopped at a half a dozen waterside eateries, providing a pleasant ride down Sacramento's original highway -- the Sacramento River.  Over the years, levee repairs and tree removals have "uglified" the river, but the Otter chugged through byways that were like the River of old lined with cottonwoods and vegetation.  As you pushed back your hair in the gentle breeze, your head would turn at the occasional splash and you caught a glimpse of a bass as it re-entered the water.A recent article in the Bee told the story.  Formerly managed by the Chamber, the taxi company was sold to a partnership that failed to come up with the promised money to purchase the service.Sacramento is a river town -- sometimes we forget that as we criss cross the American and the Sacramento rivers on one of our numerous bridges -- and I admit poor planning has blocked river access with I-5 and refineries.  But the Otter brought the river up close and personal.  It is a gem that should be restored.My family came to Sacramento by paddle boat; the river played an important part in my family story.  Irrespective of when or how you arrived in Sacramento, the river is a part of our collective culture, history, and identity.  The River Otter reminded us of that fact and was the best example of public transportation in the area.

At last I have found a chalice worthy of serving my insatiable lust for Indian cuisine, these miraculous culinary vessels of naan and curry. I sing like Saraswoti, I groove like Ganesh, when I sup upon the delectable dishes of my sweet Pooja.The restaurant's name means 'ritual', and it is a reverent heart indeed with which I savor every last morsel upon my plate. A wealth of traditional north Indian recipe representation abounds - oh, beloved Chicken Makhni, with your rich redolence of cream and tomato and spice to warm my belly and my soul. I lift you on high, my celebrated Tikka Masala, how you fulfill me for days with your perfectly creamy consistency. My naan, my naan, my God how I love my naan. With keema (delicately spiced tender lamb) or kabuli (cherries and coconut, flavorful and fruity and not too sweet) or even a roti (whole wheat cooked upon a stone), you complete me. You had me at hello.John L. is correct, service is succinct and soft-spoken, gracious and quick and neat. Like temple maidens serving in some great celestial palace of luscious libations, you too will feel like a Maharaja when you select one of their venerable 'feasts'; the table will groan beneath the awesome weight of dish after dish brought for your dining delight.So come on by and hope for an in-house Hindu rave featuring DJ Swami Rub-Rub or whoever it is cranking the Bollywood tuneage in the reception hall next door. Though my heart still mourns for my first lost love Taj Mahal, in Pooja I have found a second wife. Well, if I ever actually would marry a woman. If a restaurant could be even construed as a female, not that I'm sexist, or prejudiced, or .. aah. Never mind. Just eat your dal and matter paneer.

Maybe, its because I'm spoiled by the multitude of cheap places in LA to get my car washed, but I have never been that impressed with this place.  For almost $30, I expect my car to look beautiful and gleaming, just like a movie star on the red carpet.However, $30 doesn't even buy you a real hand wash, they still drive it through the thing with the giant mops.  When I got my car back, there were some visible water spots on it and the windshield still had sticky little specks on it (I think they were leftovers from driving up the 5).  But!  Kiki is much happier with me and she says thank you because she doesn't have to feel like an unloved and redheaded stepchild anymore.

Sure, they threatened me with academic probation once, but every relationship has its ups and downs, right?Like most huge universities, Davis is what you make of it. There are so many opportunities to get involved-- intramural sports, clubs, greek organizations, co-ops, internships. I was almost never bored at this school. As for academics, I has some amazing classes and I had some doozies. Anthropology classes are usually a good bet, especially with McHenry (Human Osteology) and Borgehoff Mulder. History classes are exceptional too. I recommend anything with Materson. If I were to re-do my college education, I would have done my pre-reqs at a community college and bypassed the monster lecture halls. The social sciences hall still gives me nightmares, and that building! My lord!Unlike many I love Davis weather-- the sweltering summers, the crisp falls, water-logged winters (ok, I don't like riding my bike in the rain), and flower-filled spring. Speaking of bikes, Daivs instilled in me a love for bicycle communting, a real-standout in gridlock San Diego, where I now live.Nonetheless, after five years, I could not WAIT to get out. I could not wait to leave the insular little community where you cannot buy a box of condoms without running into someone you know. I could not wait to live somewhere where the whole town doesn't revolve around a single institution. I could not wait to get away from the suburban, liberal, hybrid-driving, Target-hating, Not-In-My-Back-Yard mentality of the townies. If you grew up in a city, you may never get used to Davis, despite its multiple charms.Davis is a great school for 2, 3, even 4 years. But not 5, at least not for me.
<review# 339,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2012,9/21/2012,319,199,3,10,11>Considering this section of town houses both my favorite restaurant (Press Bistro) AND my favorite gelato shop (Devine Geleteria), I would be crazy to give it anything less than 5 stars. You can walk around the block and enjoy everything from budget Chipotle burritos' to  gourmet cheese and wine. The handle also has some great coffee shops, clothing boutiques and antique shops. You could literally dress yourself, furnish your home, and get an amazing meal all in one convenient location. If I could possibly find a complaint, it would be the lack of parking coupled with one way streets that make parking even more challenging at times. I guess it should be expected considering the handle is home to several of the best restaurants and businesses in Sacramento. I suggest you ride a bike, take a cab, or just park a few blocks outside of this main strip.

I realize that was all barely funny. Ok, NOW I'm done.The service was super friendly even though they were totally slammed. We were seated within a few minutes and our waiter was quick with the drinks, taking the orders, and bringing us our food.The food was typical diner fare, but I and my companions enjoyed it.

Plus they expanded to add another room, whee! I love that it's adult clothing shop with a sex shop section, instead of the other way around. (Not that I mind a sex shop, but if I'm there to shop for clothes I prefer to do so without lurker guys and the lingering smell of lube and latex.)They have a great range of women's clothing, lingerie, bikinis, shoes and accessories. They even have a men's clothing corner in the new room. They have a range of clothing for however sexy you're feeling, from cute tops to sexy clubbing wear to lingerie to dancer wear. I particularly like their corsets and waist cinchers selection. They have a room half-full of shoes, from pumps (sexy) to stilettos (sexier) to 7" clear heeled platforms (stripper). Plus I was waited on by an friendly older gentleman who was super nice and chatty without being obstrusive-chatty. Love me some Naughty-N-Nice!!
<review# 342,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2012,9/18/2012,1211,148,41,46,36>Okay, this place barely has any reviews...And with it being an adult store--sorry, SUPERstore, lol, I wouldn't expect there to be many future reviews. People tend to shy away from letting it be known that they have gone to or would like to visit an adult store like Suzie's. (C'mon people. We're all adults here. There should be no shame in wanting to visit your Suzie's store).With that said, I guess I'll volunteer. I feel that it would be important and useful for people to be able to read reviews on these stores since some of us out there would like to know more about it, but are too shy to actually ask around. I personally don't see it as awkward at all if you were to go with a partner (whether they're a friend or your significant other). But if you're going alone and feeling a bit self-conscious about it, rest assure that there are parking spaces BEHIND the building so that none of your friends driving by Florin Road will see your brightass green Ford Focus in the parking lot. I'm also pretty sure you could enter from the back door to if you'd like (yeah, no pun intended there...) lol I went to the one in the front. Also where I parked. I know, shameless. But I mean it. There's nothing to be embarrassed about, damn. I was expecting there to be female employee so that it'd be less awkward for the lady customers, but was instead, greeted by a male employee. Apparently, I look older than 18 to somebody, for once, and he let me in without checking my I.D. even when I offered to. He stayed where he was and just asked me nicely to let him know if I have any questions before I started looking. (I did see a few high schoolers who "forgot their I.D." tries to come in though. Fail.) I was expecting the worse of awkwardness, but was pleasantly surprised when there weren't any moments. I was free to look around for quite some time without being followed or "checked up on". But the moment I came back to him for assistance, he was very helpful and eager to answer all of my questions. He helped me to feel more comfortable by letting me know how some products are in his personal experience or from what others have told him. He just spoke about everything so naturally. I didn't feel like I have to hold back on any questions. Suzie's have like every friggn' thing you could think of that would be in an adult store. I'm confident that you'll find what's right for you (or others). And if you need some help, don't be afraid to ask! They work for this store. They're most certainly not going to judge you for shopping there. If you must, just bullshit and say "WELL...I'm looking for a gift for my friend's bachelorette party..." or something like that as if it would be convincing any way. LOL Hey...whatever gets you through it though!Overall, great store. Good selection. Professional and helpful employees. Opened 24 hours.

It excites me these days to be in a restaurant where you just sit back and marvel at how well everything clicks into place. It takes a lot of attention to detail, passion for your business and care for your clientele to have a machine that's this well-oiled.It starts when you walk in the door. With the most minor of exceptions, there is always someone to greet you when you arrive. Even at 5:30, when the majority of people were just heading straight to the large bar area, the hostess stood her ground at her stand, only briefly walking away to clear a plate or two. This is something a lot of restaurants skimp on. I understand that it's not cost effective to have an employee in a dead zone. But when you're that one person that waits awkwardly for 5 minutes as busy servers ignore your existence, you're off to a very bad start before even being seated.We sat at one of the comfy high tops in the welcoming bar so the BF could watch the Giants on one of the multiple large screen tv's. The small dining room adjacent to the bar is equally inviting with a softly glowing fireplace. On a trip to the restroom, I walked through the main dining room. It's a very large, attractive space that can easily accommodate big groups.We were barely seated before our waitress came by for drink orders and to let us know that place settings were on the way. She was quite a pro. I asked about the favorites on the menu and she didn't miss a beat, offering several suggestions and answering all our questions authoritatively.Love that they offer meals "family style". For a couple of extra bucks, you can opt to have soup AND salad with your entree. Empty bowls are delivered to each person (this threw me for a sec). Then a piping hot bowl of delicious minestrone is brought for everyone to share. And you get steaming, soft, fresh bread with regular and garlic butter.Next comes the same set-up with a mixed Italian salad chock full of roasted red bell, olives, pepperoncinis, carrots and Romaine in a light Italian vinaigrette.If you're still hungry, here comes dinner on a gigantic platter. I went with the veal parmesan after figuring that with as many options for veal as they have on the menu, the kitchen must know how to do it right. It was a solid gamble. Tender and absolutely drenched in melted, gooey cheese, this was a superb dish. So deliciously rich and delicious, I decided my waistline was worth the sacrifice. There are several options for a side or for $2 more, you can have the stuffed ravioli. That was my choice. With a creamy pesto sauce, it was a perfect contrast to the dark, luscious sauce on the veal. The sauteed veggies were simply and perfectly cooked.The BF and I both had plenty to share, so I also got a taste of the meatloaf and mac & cheese special he ordered. Miles away from ordinary, the meatloaf was rich and had just a tinge of spice. The mac & cheese was creamy decadence with a  slightly smoky flavor. So good!It's worth noting that both of these dinners with soup and salad, plus enough leftovers to fill three (!!) large take-home containers totaled about $50. That alone is enough to make me want to make the southbound drive.I'm usually in Elk Grove at least a couple of times a month and have been really impressed with a few of the eateries I've tried recently. It is not an exaggeration however, to say that this was the best of the very best.
<review# 344,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2012,9/16/2012,433,220,31,18,23>I've heard countless times that one of the best things about going to gay bars is that you won't get hit on by a bunch of guys...well I beg to differ greatly on this, my friends. Each time I have visited the Merc, I have been pet (yes, like an animal) by someone or something with a penis. But hey, it's all good! I am a guy that is comfortable with himself and I find no harm in it. Besides, I would rather hang around these people all night than the D-bags you'll find elsewhere. The best part besides the super cool patrons and staff is of course the drinks that are more like high octane gasoline, at low octane prices. I once went here four nights in a row and haven't been back for months. I'll return once my liver says it's okay.
<review# 345,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2012,9/15/2012,324,135,6,10,10>KBar is my favorite of the Paragary binaries. While Bernardo/Monkey Bar and Bernardo/R15 have their place, this coupling feels urban, upscale and comfortable all at the same time. Speaking specifically about KBar, the location is a boon to weekday lunchers(or drinkers) and evening crowds who want suds and sustenance before heading to the Crest or District 30. The patio, seemingly an arms-length away from passing light rail trains, is welcoming and, truly, a necessity in a city rich with California sunshine. Here, you can sip on a drink under a flittering canopy of tree leaves, toss peanut caramel corn in your mouth and watch the denizens stroll by.Inside, you have your choice of booths, pub tables or community-style counters that can fit a hoard. There's a fair selection of monitors at every angle for sports viewing and, in my experience, the staff has always worked to accommodate my team preference. A big plus. I can't speak for others, of course, but I want to emphasize that I've never been let down by the waiters, bartenders or managers since I've been patronizing KBar. They're friendly, talkative and, most importantly, attentive.From the menu, my favorite is the fried chicken wings with maple syrup drizzle. This falls into the category of "can't get enough." Other items have been acceptable but not yet worthy of glory. I need to get back and try the Turkey Reuben.And I will be back. The sun is still high, the trees remain dressed and the patio beckons.
<review# 346,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/29/2012,9/14/2012,372,323,8,8,11>Is there a such thing as all meated out? Sometimes, but this time we couldn't stop eating. No matter how full we were and stuffed with food and tasty meats, we kept going back for more. I think at one point I was going to drop my head onto the table and fall into a meat-induced food coma.I've been to Oz countless times already, especially for AYCE Korean BBQ, but I've never experienced it like this.It's a huge restaurant, tons of tables and seating for all of us. All of the staff at Oz were incredibly welcoming and warm hearted. They smiled so pleasantly and guided us into the different areas. They were so happy to talk to us and tell us what Oz has to offer. We started off with huge pieces of kimchi (which were really tasty), bulgogi (korean bbq beef), chapchae (korean noodles), and sweet spicy chicken wings. They were all really good, I wasn't too fond of the noodles though, too much sesame flavor for me.Now on to the best part. We got to go to the outdoor patio with all the grill tables. We were so ready to stuff ourselves some more.The meats were all so savory and tasted like heaven in our mouths. My favorite was the marinated Chicken!!! Grrrr why does it have to take so long to cook though?!?Once you try this place, you'll be hooked. You will drool during class/work, sometimes have an urge to drive here in a mad road rage to get your fix, or dream of it at night. Can't get enough!
<review# 347,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2012,9/13/2012,305,464,4,5,7>Wow. Cool spot.Have to admit I only stopped in to visit because Wicked Wich was posted up in their parking lot. I had no intentions of partaking in their lovely selections of beer. Unfortunately, I was too late for a Wicked sandwich but, I scoped the place out for Oldman. It's a very interesting spot; micro-brewery/bar full of casual picnic table communal seating, housed in an industrial strip. I don't think we have anything like it in the Sac area right now.With the chilly weather, and this being very open due to the garage doors, bundle up. But, I think the casual friendly atmosphere (and some of the heftier beer selections) will warm you up a bit too.So, I took the Oldman and the dog there on my second visit. We sat a communal picnic table and chatted with strangers, doggie got lots of pets, Oldman tasted a few different brews, bought a T-shirt, and I hoped for a food truck to show up. Keep this in mind... beer and water only, no food unless a food truck shows up. So, I'm going to continue to stalk the food trucks and hope to catch one there soon, and drag the pooch and Oldman back.PS, there's a Crossfit next door so I also got to enjoy a little entertainment... leftover GIANT tires + beerbellied men = delusional efforts in feats of strength.
<review# 348,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2012,9/12/2012,451,541,5,10,9>S2RH is an awesome place.I have had Ramen from all over the area; however, Shoki hits my tongue's  palette for Ramen!  I normally go for the Shoryu or the soy Ramen. I don't have a liken for the tan-tan-men. (10/10) Shoryu is the basic flavor of Ramen broth. its easy and isn't complex.(2/10)Tan-tan-men is spicy (not to me) and weirded me out with weird flavors.(8/10)Soy for me is good and  sometimes awsome. But sometimes, its the wrong day for it. Hit or miss. Mostly hit. Complex flavors of soy milk and broth. Use the sesame oil for an extra hit. Overall, this place is great. I definitely recommend it.Pros: Best Ramen in Sac!Cons: Wait timesStars: 4.5
<review# 349,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2007,1/17/2008,15,60,8,3,1>Sac is a biking town at heart, which one of the few things that makes this place liveable. The folks at the Bike Kitchen provide an invaluable resource, they're totally helpful and what's more- they're super nice. Oh and the Thanksgiving ride they put on every year is. The. Shit. I stopped going to Oregon and visiting family for it.They sell complete bikes for pretty cheap ($40-80), have crates of used parts (for a suggested donation) and they have all kinds of tools. Don't expect them to be doing the work for you. What's more  likely is they'll figure out what you need, hand you the right tools and let you have a go. Some of the regulars just walk in and get to business. I can't wait for the day when I don't have to ask Tom/Sandy or whoever else a million questions. As far as donations go, just ask someone what you owe when you're done. If you want a bike and don't see something you like, come back next week. I originally passed up a Raleigh and blew my wad on a Centurion frame and next week they had a complete Nishiki road bike...oh well. All in good fun. A few months later (after learning the hard way about proper standover height...and I do mean THE HARD WAY) they even let me exchange the Centurion for a properly spec'd, hot fucking pink Specialized...which I can't wait to make into a proper road machine over at the Kitchen.The funnest part is spending an evening getting your hands dirty. I mean, how many of us really do that? Who has a real hobby besides drinking or checking their Myspace these days? One night I spent an hour trying to get a brake onto my bars. It was quickly evident another brake would work better but at that point the end result had lost all relevance. I just didn't want to give up. And that, my friends, is how we will cure cancer. The guy will be up there getting his Nobel prize and he'll be like "Cancer, right....I've just been trying to sequence the DS-5 to the DS-2 for twelve goddamned years." So get your cancer curing practice in right now.I had been to the SF Bike Kitchen and received some attitude, most likely because I was trying to cobble together a fixed gear conversion in the cheapest manner possible. Nevertheless, attitude is attitude and it's not like I being a bitch about it. I said to my friend, "Fuck this shit. I'd rather do it in Sacramento." Now there's a first.
<review# 350,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/13/2007,1/16/2008,6,6,9,3,3>There is nothing like wandering the first circle of hell with a cranky two year old.  Ikea is probably one of the single most stressful shopping experiences I have ever endured.  Next time, I will bring a flask.  The store can best be described as a whole lot of energy going nowhere. Nothing seems to be clearly marked, the store directories make little sense and the arrows that lead you to the exit seem to take you in endless circles.  The employees, while polite, seem every bit as lost as the patrons. I went in the hope of finding fun, practical storage solutions for my sons room.  The children's department was easy enough to locate, It's near the elevator.  However once there, finding anything other than tiny chairs and stuffed animals was nearly impossible.  I would have gladly asked one of the employees for guidance, but alas, I could find none (lost no doubt). Ultimately I left tired, stressed and empty handed.  It wasn't an entirely bad experience, I do like Ikea's textiles, lighting and innovative storage solutions.  And frankly, there is something pretty wonderful about being able to feed your kid for .99 cents.  Having said that, when I go back (and I will, because I'm that kind of crazy) I will go armed with a solid plan of escape, a flask of Makers Mark, and no toddler.
<review# 351,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/7/2008,1/14/2008,305,464,6,11,4>*Update* 1-9-08Went there yesterday with the kiddies - they LOVED it; the burgers were the perfect size for them.  I, on the other hand, was disappointed.  The onion rings were cold, my potentially yummy Chicago dog was lukewarm, and the Lemon Squeezie was mouth-puckering.Cool thing was that I could say "eat your veggies" at a hamburger joint . . . when you dine there, you get a little baggie of pickles and carrots - they took one bite of the carrot, oh well.  Hopefully, they work out the kinks soon.Original review:The crazy parking lot, or lots (as they are somewhat divided by more parked cars where the fuel pumps used to be) frustrated me . . . And seemed to confuse others.  Let's just say that I wouldn't be too happy by the confused customer blocking in my car along the "fuel pump" parking spots.   I'm guessing the cluster fuck parking lot was meant to keep the integrity of the ol' gas station architecture, so I'll forgive.  The interior area where you order and wait for your food is also somewhat of a jammed up mess.  But, once you grab your food you can sit outside or in one of the two spacious interior dining areas -  looks like this is where the garages used to be, complete with garage doors.  My order was taken quickly, but the wait was kinda long.  Especially since they weren't too, too busy and it looked like there were at least 8 guys in the kitchen grilling up the food.  I ordered the regular Suzie burger with cheese ($2.95 - the reg. hamburger was only a buck-something) and an order of fries - came out to $5-something. *Smack, smack, smack* Damn! Those fries are SALTY - and that is saying a lot, since I sprinkle extra salt on damn near everything, and even use seasoning packets with MSG in a few dishes (shh, don't tell).  These are thick-cut and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside kinda fries . . . Almost perfect, except for that salt.I liken the cheeseburger to those old-fashioned yummy hamburger-stand burgers.  Reminded me of Whitey's, but with a thicker patty that seemed to be broiled, rather than fried.  I enjoyed the burger very much, and it was the perfect size for me.  Hungry-man-dinner type folks may wanna double up on the beef.Love, love, love that they have many hot dog options (didn't notice any bacon dogs, though - *sniff*).  I will def. be back for the Chicago-style doggie and maybe check out whatever that Lemon Squeezie thing is. Not looking forward to parking in that lot again, so I'll just not park in certain spots, think happy thoughts, and try not to chuckle too much at the confused (*raises hand*) parking customers . . . Suckas.

<review# 353,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2007,1/11/2008,28,66,3,7,6>Oh, The Long Shot. I remember when you used to be the Shadowbrook, aka "The Shadybrook" back in the day when I was 16 and would come in and have a drink every now and then and not get carded. I thought I was pretty cool. But things have definitely changed a lot since The Shadybrook days.Susie and her husband who passed away about a year and a half ago (don't remember his name), took reign over this dive in the Arden Oaks/ AP neighborhood and made it infamous for being "the most fun you will ever have behind a gas station"- and it really is.This is a great place to come with friends, family or both. Rich and Matt are a great team of bartenders and really engage with the bar goers. Susie bartends too and loves for everyone to have a great time, but won't put up with anyone's S if they are getting out of line. However, since it's popularity has risen so much in the recent 2 years, (probably due to the clientele's convenience of its close proximity to their neighborhood), there have been a lot of fights and drama that have gone down at The Longshot (and NO, it is not Longshots and YES there is a difference). Susie has had to regulate and close the bar early against her will but I don't blame her. The last time I was here with my mom in August there was a fight and it totally killed the mood. Susie threatens, or actually does, shut down the bar and what could have been a fun-filled night is totally killed by a bunch of drunk idiots (In this case it was a 70 yr. old dude against some biker skin heads)- random crowd for sure, but not unlikely at The Shot.I met my bug here so I am little biased when I say how much I love this neighborhood bar, because it really only brings back great memories for me, especially after I turned 21 and could legally enjoy it. The crowd on Fridays can be older and a bit ecclectic as it is Karaoke night, but if you come past 12 you should be safe!Great people, cheap drinks and great times= The Long Shot, it will always have a special place in my heart :-)

<review# 356,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/2/2007,1/8/2008,70,309,2,4,4>After a few years of volunteering to work aid stations along the course (which I really recommend- its a ton of fun- even when its freezing!)- this was the first year I actually got to run in the race. I decided to join a bunch of my friends in running the relay version of the race instead of running the whole 26.2 myself. Basically, in the relay version, teams of 4 people run legs of the race that vary in length. Since my friends and I are just starting to run again after completing the full Nike Marathon in October- this was a perfect option! The marathon course itself is known for being pretty fast Boston qualifier- mainly because there are not a lot of hills. Runners World Magazine puts it in the top 6 marathons in the U.S. They offer relay, half (13.1 miles) and full (26.2) options. The course starts at the Folsom Dam and  ends at the Capitol building. Its a nice course- varied things to look at and bands playing along the course. Plus lots of local support. There are plenty of port-a-potties along the trail, lots of aid stations and cops stopping traffic to keep us runners safe. I always love the CIM. Its not a huge marathon, so as a runner you are not dealing with a ton of crowds. As a spectator, finding your runner on the course is easy- locations are easy to get to. The finish line area is pretty good too- lots of free food and other stuff for the runners. Also- you get a great finishers T-shirt (long sleeved so you can wear it for winter workouts!) and beautiful finishers medal. Cash prizes are awarded to top finishers- but I don't pay much attention to that since I would never be in that category.So, overall a great race. HOWEVER, here is one thing to consider if you plan to run the CIM:They close the race course at 6 hours (a little under a 13.5 minute pace for the whole 26.2 miles), so if you fall behind the CHP car holding up the rear- you will not be able to finish. In fact- many runners who fall behind the 6 hour marker get lost along the trail since there is no longer a course to follow. It always breaks my heart to see them wandering around J St/Alhambra trying to figure out where to go to get to the Capitol. And after 20 miles....that's the last thing you want to be trying to do!!! I mean, your Brain barely works at that point anyways!Last thing: As a runner, it really bugs me when I see a bunch of non-runners eating the free food and stuff at the finish line. These people end up eating the food that should be going to runners/walkers who will end up getting to the food stations only to see its all gone.....ANNOYING!!! If you didn't put in the effort to run the race- don't eat the food!!! Really bad race etiquette! I wish CIM would enforce this more....

Are you with me so far?Look at those three emblemetic women on the painted storefront. With their bandana hair nets in place and their shirt sleeves rolled up to their elbows, they're ready to bake! C'mon, people. We need a plan of action. We can do it!------Made a return trip to Sacramento yesterday to purchase a peach pie (a failed mission) and the coffee table I spotted here the previous Saturday between failed pie mission #1 and dinner with friends. The table was still there and it was still reasonably priced. The wood was still split in several places, too, but I decided that these gave the piece character. The gentleman who helped me (the one who, no doubt, whistled at the three women while they had their group portrait done) assuredly explained WHY the wood had split and suggested a type of wood putty should I grow tired of the gaps. 'Cause just like a big ol' gap in a lover's front teeth, that kinda character can wear thin pretty quickly. In fact, think I'll keep a reserve of wood putty in my bedside armoire in case I chance upon a real special fellow like that.After sweetly correcting me: No that's not an old wooden shell of a mailbox; it's a sewing machine cover (Well, now it's a cat carrier minus the ventillation...not to worry; we'll be taking short trips), the gentleman gave the table a nice oil rub before turning the rag on me (nice extras here!) and then loaded the piece into my car, offering to lay down a shop blanket to protect the finish and our...oh nevermind. Such nice gestures here, including the complimentary cold, bottled water in the vintage ice box. I like this place. I don't frequent the polished antique stores much anymore. Too often I feel ignored or think the prices inflated but I really enjoyed my massage here and so did my table.But for now, the sign above my apartment back in Oakland reads:One Woman, a Coffee Table and No Pie.One Woman, No Pie.

<review# 358,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2007,1/6/2008,43,95,3,16,12>I used to go to the annual Peddlers' Fair in Old Sac and the Collectors' Fair on Sutter Street in Folsom.  I searched for old photos, ephemera, and any odd thing I could use in my artwork.  Jennie Krausse was a regular dealer at these fairs, and I always eagerly searched for her booth.  Her tables were laden with random weird items, and I invariably came away with a bag full of goodies for a very reasonable price.  Eventually I got on Jennie's e-mail list for her estate liquidation service.  Jennie's estate sales are always an adventure.  Unlike some other estate liquidation services, where the emphasis is on expensive furniture in a pristine setting, Jennie holds sales in all kinds of locations - from a fabulous Eichler house to an electrician's shop/warehouse - and she sells everything, right down to the mundane household goods.  Her sales usually begin on a Thursday and end with a half-price sale on Saturday or Sunday, and everything that's left by the last hour or two is free.  I've found some amazing stuff:  glittery turquoise resin '60s cabinet knobs at the Eichler house (free!), a big box full of vintage sewing notions at the midtown apartment of a very old man ($10), and a huge random mix of cool artsy junk at a modest house in South Sac ($15).Now Jennie has opened a small shop to complement her estate liquidation service.  A friend and I went to the grand opening tonight, and it was evident that Jennie has a loyal following because the place was PACKED with friendly, happy people, despite the pouring rain.  I overheard someone say, "I see you at all Jennie's sales but I don't know your name yet..."  I think a cult is forming, or at least a fan club!The shop is tiny and it was so crowded tonight that I'm sure I didn't see everything, but my friend and I managed to score some treasures:  a 1946 erector set and half a dozen antique photos dating back to the late 1800s.  Total price, $10.  Yay!  Jennie is also a huge supporter of local art, and tonight the shop featured the works of at least four artists.  She's "talked up" my artwork to so many people, I should hire her as my agent.  I'm thrilled to see Jennie's business expand and thrive.  Get on her mailing list and go find some unique treasures at her next sale!
<review# 359,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2013,5/10/2013,433,220,16,21,22>If you are in a band and need a practice space, this is one of the most popular options in Sacramento....if paying an ass load of money doesn't bother you (or your parents?). The last time I rented a room from this place on a monthly basis was years ago and one fairly large room cost about the same as an apartment. We shared the room with another band to help with the cost, so it came out to 9 of us each paying $70 a month. Yes, that is very expensive, but there are some upsides:- The building is secure and insured, so your gear is well protected.- It is temperature controlled which is great in the summer. - It is located in the Industrial district so there are never any noise complaints.- Everyone is given a magnetic key card to the building which is accessible 24/7/365. My current band prefers to just rent a room by the hour here, which usually doesn't exceed $30 for a few hours. That is great for pretty much everyone except me, because you have to set up when you get there and tear down when you leave, and I'm the genius that decided to be a drummer.

<review# 361,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2013,5/8/2013,63,204,5,12,10>Surprising. I enjoyed some of the things about Tex Wasabi's, but it didn't wow me. The burger from Johhny Garlic's did just that: it brought the wow factor.Attentive service, free munchies while we waited, and a tremendous, tasty burger with the not-so-nicely named, but very tangy and delicious Donkey Sauce. These are all ingredients to a successful restaurant. The fries were prefectly done as well. I'm very picky about fries, and these were just the right amount of crisp. Not overdone, but not a soggy mess, nor were they over or under seasoned.I work pretty much right on top of this place, so I imagine I'll be back here pretty often. AND, I got to meet Guy Fieri. That = good times.

Who wouldn't love to go to a store with so much California culture and be a baller-on-a-budget! Their flavors cover every time of the month - sweet to savory! They sell them in snack size to bulk size. They even sell little random trinkets and Blue Diamond clothing, if you're hardcore!There are tons of novelty items, gift baskets included, to give or send to anyone you want to impress with your Cali swag. Not only are they good for you, they make the best gifts for non-Californians, best out of towner gift in the area, by far!The staff is always jovial and helpful, almost too helpful...I can't say no to free chocolate covered almond tastings, now that's just rude!I love getting almond wasted...honey roasted almond wasted to be exact :)

I won a certificate for four hours of cleaning at a silent auction benefitting a local rabbit rescue organization fundraiser and was excited to have someone come and professionally clean our home. Jesus was courteous and flexible with appointment times, and his hourly rate is very affordable. On the day of the cleaning, he promptly showed up at our house armed with his own supplies, and after I told him to concentrate on the kitchen and bathroom (the rooms I despise most to clean), he went to work with a amount of detail and meticulousness on could have been just a routine house cleaning that I definitely didn't expect (and some of which I admit I probably hadn't done myself since we moved in four+ years ago). When I returned from work after he had finished and gone, I found the kitchen and bathroom sparkling. It was absolutely beautiful work, and all that was left as evidence of Jesus's hard work was the newfound cleanliness in my home. Let's just say I was so happy that I may have done a little dance around my kitchen.I absolutely will use Jesus again and would recommend him for your cleaning needs.

<review# 365,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/21/2012,5/4/2013,591,132,12,15,15>On a Sunday morning this place can get really busy! Even so, Rivers Edge does not compromise service. I was fortunate to attend my first UYE at the company of other fellow Yelpers while enjoying a delicious Denver Omelet with a side of hashbrowns. The omelet was good but only as good as how I would make it at home. And I'm a pretty decent cook, if I'd say so myself.  I loved the special brown hot sauce they had on the table. Very chunky, flavorful and mildly spicy.There is a check in offer here. I like that it says free gift. Initially I thought they were going to come out with a little box nicely packaged wrapped with a ribbon. Definitely up for interpretation. But we were later told it was a free pen   -____-   The service was excellent and very attentive to our table by coming by frequently to ask if we needed anything. I believe I counted about five different waiters/waitresses total who came by to check up on us throughout our dine-in.I'd like to return to this place to try their lunch plates and many other food they have to offer. Belgium waffle and creme brulee?! challenge accepted.
<review# 366,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/30/2013,5/3/2013,466,199,19,17,18>Oreo Muffudgin' Shake.I could leave it at that.  I could, but I won't.Too bad the seasonal crab cakes were gone for the season but I did try the delicious and crunchy potato "breaded" fish sandwich. Vegetarian friends, never fear - Krush will make their mini-burgs sans burger and the mushroom-filled Philly is a savory and filling veggie treat. I can't say whether I prefer the sweet potato tots or the fries but I don't have to because I got both. If you're dining with someone else, I'd suggest you order one of each and share like good friends do. Sharing is caring, after all.Somehow I still managed to squeeze in a shake. Holy heck that Oreo Shake is legen...wait for it... dairy. (get it? dairy? get it?) I'm going to be dreaming of that sweet, sweet shake tonight. Come on Oreo Shake, you're coming to bed with me.

Imma start just thanking people politely and shutting my mouth when I get compliments on $4 shirts.  It's hard, but I'm going to start doing it.  Thrift Town is big enough that statistically you are going to find something cool.  I always find work appropriate shirts or just something awesome in a novelty type way.  iphoneogram.com/p/285758  Pretty cool, eh?  I've seen cool art and solid furniture I'd buy if I had a truck and 5 dudes to help.  It's clean and fairly well organized as thrift  stores go.  The staff is always friendly too. The half off all clothes days are excessively busy, but the promotion does suck me in on occasion.  Do I really need half off a $5 shirt?  Ayy?!?  Check it out and pop some tags.
<review# 368,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2012,5/1/2013,318,132,13,26,25>I could have cared less about Taylor's about a month ago. I really didn't feel the need to check this place out until I heard they have one of the best brunches in Sac. Thanks to Joe K, and who could forget Alex L and Diane S for clueing me in! Well, I feel dumb for passing this place up for so long! Taylor himself should slap me silly for such behavior! Don't be a fool like me. Get over and meet Taylor and start your love affair! BRUNCHIN':  Brunch is my favorite meal of the day and I only seem to get to eat it on Sunday. So, I want this favorite meal to be spectacular, mind-blowing, downright amazing. It was truly love at first bite at first brunch at Taylor's. I instantly became obsessed. Now, I can't seem to part from this place when it comes to brunch and I find myself here just about every Sunday. The main menu stays static, but they always have specials. And, they have special pastries of the day that come in a basket - such a perfect thing for a group (or yourself, I won't judge!). I love, love, love, the breakfast pizza (a crust you'll recognize if you have frequented OneSpeed), the veggie burrito, the biscuits served with homemade jam, the hashbrowns that have unique seasoning, the fruit...I could go on and on, but my words just won't do this brunch justice. You just have to try it and I guarantee you'll be planning your next trip back before you leave. They also feature Temple coffee (only the best!) and many adult brunch beverages. Last week the special drink was a Cranberry Bellini that knocked my socks off! DINNER:  Because the brunch is extra fabulous, I decided to go try the evening offerings. Holy Moly! Again, another blissful culinary experience. Call and make a reso, but if you don't (like us because we like spontaneity in our dinner choices), you can always find yourself dining at the wine bar or at the bar overlooking the kitchen activities. This menu always features specials and is ever changing. They immediately provide you with warm, pillowy, crusty bread. I then get a great glass of wine based on recommendations from the wine bar. We then find ourselves eating a 4 course meal - it never fails here, we over-order and over-eat because we just are out of control! The gnocchi and burrata with seasonal vegetables have been some favorite starters. The salads have all been refreshing. The homemade pastas and Shepherd's pie have been memorable entrees. Oh, and of course, even if I don't have room for dessert, I make room! They even have homemade ice cream! TAYLOR MADE: Everything that comes out of the kitchen is perfection. I rarely find such quality and perfect execution. They serve local and seasonal food, which is always of the freshest and finest. Taylor sure is something and he's won this gal over!
<review# 369,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2010,6/12/2010,83,184,13,10,5>Ok, so I gave them another try, as it was just getting to be too darn far to drive to Tricks. The owner mentioned my previous review, which she took well, just mentioned sometimes they get busy in the office. My twins are in a Kinder class with Jenni, she is great. This place has more of a serious feel than Tricks, but they seem to really work on strength and training and stamina. There is a filtered review that is pretty negative, I have never noticed any negativity in the staff here, but like anywhere else, getting the right teach is key. Ms. Jenni rocks, and I am thinking about signing up for another class each week. The major negative here would be the lack of morning classes for the lil ones. Not all kids go to preschool or kindergarten in the morning, and the morning classes are pretty minimum here. I also did not receive any information packet or t-shirt or anything when I signed up, but I can deal with that thanks to having a great teacher. But lets talk some positives, mmm k? Even with a few classes going at once, this place is huge. They have couches to sit on, and another HUGE advantage over Tricks is that they add time to the classes to allow the kiddos to get water, and its out of a paper cup so no sharing germs at a yucky drinking fountain. I also REALLY like that they offer the option of coed or single gender classes. I chose a girls only classes for two main reasons: 1. Boys are yucky and need to stay FAR away from my daughters. I have a shovel and am not afraid to go back to prison. 2. Boys and girls have different strengths and weaknesses, and the classes really focus on those. This place is a little rough around the edges, has it pros and cons like anywhere else, but still gets the job done well.

<review# 371,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2010,6/10/2010,180,228,28,7,7>Have you ever had to psyche yourself up to prepare for a shopping trip? Roughly every two months, I stare at myself in the mirror, repeating the mantra: 'You can do this. It'll be over soon. You're going to make it through this...' and shortly thereafter, we're off to WinCo. There's no better value in the area for your dollar. We drive from the Pocket, bypassing FoodMaxx and Wal-Mart, just to take advantage of the deals they have here. And they are great deals. See, you've got to have a game plan going into these high-pressure, high-stress situations. Don't try for a parking space in the front, just take the first available. You've got to have that place mapped out in your mind well ahead of time: we write our list per isle instead of by need, we travel the path of least resistance... hell, we even shop in a manner that allows for our groceries to be bagged with like groceries. We are quick. Efficient. Lethal.But for every two highly trained commando shoppers who come well prepared, there are about four hundred and fifty sloppy cattle blocking the aisles, 'talkin at' their cell phones, letting their putrid children run riot. And that's okay. It's America, innit? Land of the Free, Home of the Morbidly Obese.The best way to shop at WinCo is to accept the fact that these stores are designed for people who have very little money or are on grub stubs (wish I had grub stubs). Understand that sometimes, these folks might not have a million other things to do that day and aren't in a rush like you are. So be prepared, clear your afternoon, and avoid the pizza.
<review# 372,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2010,6/9/2010,190,238,1,5,7>Delicious. greasy. Mexican.  MMM.I love the chicken tacos, burritos, fajitas, and who can resist that delicious cilantro dressing that comes on the complementary salad that whets your appetite for the main course.  I leave so full and satisfied and my appetite is supressed for the rest of the day.The guac here is subpar at best.  Another flavorless avocado-only concoction.  Why is it that the best guac in Sac is at Chevy's or Chipotle?  I'd love for our mom and pop's to step it up w/ some tomatoes, onions, jalapenos, lime.  Come on, guys!
<review# 373,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2010,6/8/2010,80,156,4,7,6>Happy hour at Ink rocks!!!! The best part of it? The food!!!! Wow, I never thought bar food could taste THIS good!!  First of all, hello! They're all $3 and that goes for the beer too. Yes, even imports!I ordered sliders and calamari. The sliders had grilled onions and pickles and really nicely cooked beef patties. The calamari?  OMG!  It was beautifully cooked, breaded & crispy but not at all greasy, and it came with this yummy sauce. All that for $3!!!!! THREE!!!!  A plate of that would easily cost $10 at another restaurant and it wouldn't be 1/4 as good! My friends loved the buffalo wings and cheese quesadilla too.Even after happy hour ended, the place filled up with tons of people. Hat's off to a bar that serves GOOD grub! Make that GREAT grub!
<review# 374,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2010,6/7/2010,97,108,5,7,5>A really solid 4 stars. I ordered the silken organic tofu, seared wagyu beef, long beans, kimchi fried rice and bone marrow. My favorite thing there was the silken organic tofu. UNBELIEVABLY GOOD! Honestly, I decided when I go there next time, I'm just going to get my own order and not have to share with anyone. It's basically a block of tofu loaded with avocado, dried shrimp, and seaweed with a reduction of soy sauce and then sides of wasabi and chili paste. You're supposed to mix it all together and just let it explode in your mouth (that's what she said!... Too inappropriate?). The wagyu beef was also pretty good but the wasabi sauce was a little overpowering for me. Everything else was solid but didn't stand out. I think this place is pretty new so it wasn't very packed on a Saturday which was nice because the service was super fast and attentive. Most dishes were less than $10 with a few reaching into the $15 range but all the food we ordered came out to around $50 so not too bad. Come try this place before it gets packed!
<review# 375,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2010,6/6/2010,562,500,5,10,8>I have been coming to Freeport Bakery on and off since 1973.  They have the best baked goods and the best service of any bakery in Sacramento.  I do not get there often, so it is truly a treat when I do.  This place and its employees are definitely a class act.My last trip was on a very cold Saturday morning before Easter.  I needed to pick up a cake before work so I arrive at Freeport Bakery approximately ten minutes before they opened and there was already eight people waiting for them to open.  The bakery put out a large container of complimentary coffee for people to drink while they waited and everyone waiting was so friendly and nice, making the wait seem pleasant.  The employees were courteous as well, making sure everyone behaved themselves and no one cut in line.  Once the doors were opened for business, they must have had ten employees waiting on people.  There were very large stacks of cakes, sitting behind the counter, waiting to be purchased.  They were definitely prepared for the rush.I purchased a cake that looked just like a giant chocolate Easter egg with beautiful flowers on it.  It looked so awesome.  We had absolutely no choice but to take it out of the box and place it on a glass cake dish in order to flaunt it in front of the other guest. The cake was not only gorgeous but tasted heavenly as well.  It consisted of marbled golden buttermilk and chocolate cake filled with chocolate mousse and covered with chocolate ganashe.  It was so moist and creamy.  It was out of this world, definitely the hit of the party.I also purchased a variety of pastries (as usual, duh, you are at Freeport Bakery) that were heavenly as well.The Wizard says; check it out.

<review# 377,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2010,6/4/2010,439,356,9,11,10>I have eaten here twice this week. That is right. Twice. And it is only Wednesday night. We ended up here Monday by fluke. We originally wanted Southern. Closed. Then we tried Indian. Closed. Then we wanted Russian. (We learned to call/look up hours first) Closed. So we decided on sushi. We must have been on an ethnic kick or something. We got there around 8, and the parking was full. It is small but cozy inside. We were seated at a table. I opened the menu and was immediately overwhelmed. It probably took me a lot longer to choose what  wanted than the people dining with me would have wanted. But when you have like 1,000 different rolls to choose from...that is what happens. The server ended up choosing for me, and he picked out the Fulton. It was delicious. Thanks to Eduardo, Mike and his wife, I was able to try their rolls as well. I particularly liked the Cottage. The Crazy Kim was delish also. When I got home, I immediately told Tylor I had to take him here. That is how I ended up going twice in one week. Tylor is a sushi fanatic, and I think he was very pleased. This time we arrived around 6, and sat at the bar. It was cool watching the sushi chef work his magic. We ordered the Giant Crazy, The Lion King, and Spicy Day. All three were so unique, and equally outstanding. The Lion King was so different. The salmon was torched which gave off a wonderful smell. The flavor made me think of a tuna melt, but with salmon. I loved the Giant Crazy and the subtle spice the wasabi added to the roll. The Spicy Day has just the right amount of crunch. So far, I have tried 6 different rolls..I can't decide which I liked the most..and I am so happy that I have like 994 more rolls to try. I can't wait to go back!
<review# 378,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/3/2010,6/3/2010,354,195,7,14,12>Im not a club person AT ALL! I dont like going to those "young, hip" places where you have to take forever to get ready just to fit in.I dont like going out trying to have fun with friends only to be harassed by some guy who thinks my goal for the night is to make him happy. Even worse when they hit on you and DONT buy you a drink.I do however enjoy coming to the Mushroom because not once have I been hit on. I can come here in jeans and a t-shirt and just relax with whatever drink I choose. The people here are very nice. I have been invited to birthday parties and given a free pitcher of beer by an old fella who simply said "I've been drinking beer all day and its time to switch to the hard stuff" ...This is one of those places where you make a new little drinking buddy, sit back and drink, play a game of pool, shoot some darts or just watch the big screen.Extra Bonus: If you are friends with them on facebook you will be alerted of the daily drink specials. How considerate is that?! =)
<review# 379,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/9/2009,4/9/2010,99,49,3,9,8>What a wonderful addition to the Sacramento food scene!!! The Shady Lady and all of the staff exude a rather non-pretentious coolness.  This place is kind of a throwback to the speakeasy era.  I love that the staff kind of dress the part - but in a more updated, modern way so it doesn't look cheesy.  I'm absolutely in love with the décor with the open brick wall on one side juxtaposed with the velvet wallpaper.    I just have to say that I am very impressed that The Shady Lady is here to up the ante in the Sacramento Restaurant scene.  Now, for the food - it's pretty much high-class Southern comfort food. First with a warning, the "share plates" are kind of smaller than you would expect (share is kind of a re-branding of small plates).  Usually, the connotations of food like Macaroni and Cheese, Fried Chicken, and Meatloaf is really huge heaping piles of food.  Here, you get a minimal amount of food, but it's cooked well.  The cook here shows that size does not always matter (get your head out of the gutter folks).   The presentation of the food was spectacular. Cornflake fried chicken was incredibly crunchy with that nice hint of spices in the background.  Greens were incredibly tasty.  Some of the creamiest mashed potatoes I've ever eaten.  The meatloaf slices were little bits of decadence, and that deep friend macaroni and cheese...phenomenal.  Any food where you sit and try to figure out, "how did they do that?" is pretty much the best food.     I looked at other tables, and the sandwiches seemed pretty big so that might be an alternative for the share plates.  I really see this place as a good place to drink and enjoy the share plates.  This placed just opened up - so there were bits and pieces of growing pains.  They were still binding menus, and the food took a bit long to get to our table.  I'm sure any growing pains will be gone in a couple of weeks so don't let that deter you. Oh yes, this place also gets extra points for an incredibly friendly staff. Bottom line:  This is the kind of place you hope to be a regular at - I definitely intend on coming back.
<review# 380,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2010,4/8/2010,79,170,,5,4>Update: They've put in a bar to the side of the walk-up counter, and GREATLY expanded their beers-on-tap selection.  Most of the focus is on Belgian beers.  The concept is more on getting a crazy-good variety to provide an awesome experience, and less on giving you your normal brew.  This is a good thing.  Go in and get schooled on the fantastic beers they have on tap!  I can just about guarantee you you've never heard of most of these beers, and the flavors and quality will impress you...
<review# 381,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2010,4/6/2010,249,140,4,8,8>Really good lunch spot. The salmon BLT is one of my most favorite sandwiches in the world. A nice grilled piece of salmon, bacon, tomato, lettuce on grilled bread, its heaven in a sandwich. Today I strayed though and got the chicken Cesar salad. It was perfect ( I hope it would be for $10) Chicken was not over dry, just the perfect amount of Cesar dressing and the croutons where freshly made with the same bread as my most favorite sandwich. Once the construction gets done across the street it will be alot nicer to eat outside. Will I be back, yep probably next week. That's my story..
<review# 382,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/6/2010,4/5/2010,356,378,7,19,11>Hi, my name is Diana and I'm a glutton. There, I admit it. I can't help but to think and stuff my face with food. I think about food so much that I had already decided last night that I was going to treat myself to all-you-can-eat sushi at Azukar if I worked my ass off today. So I worked hard, hard enough for the reward and Azukar Sushi definitely didn't disappoint. What an awesome feeling to stuff my face at an all-you-can-eat sushi place that actually tastes great. Like the other Yelpers had previously mentioned, the plate presentation was beautiful for many dishes, and they made only 4 to 5 pieces of each roll every time you ordered. The Firebird Roll was my favorite. I also had yellowtail and albacore nigiri. The fish melted in my mouth. Yum. Mr. Owner Man offered me some seared salmon and tuna carpaccio. It was light and well balanced with the ponzu sauce. I topped it off by washing my meal down with a passionfruit vodka with cranberry from the bar. Monica M had mentioned it recently and I had to try it. Oooo that was nice. Great service, food and presentation. I enjoyed it a lot and would recommend this place if you want a huge selection of sushi for a decent price.
<review# 383,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/24/2009,4/4/2010,98,185,4,5,3>So first off..let me say I am sorry for neglecting my duties as a Yelp-er for the past 9  months. It has been hectic! but I have managed to try a few places in this whole run around crazy time...and one of the first places I went after moving to Sacramento was Jim-Denny's....It was packed...yes..the place is small but still, doesnt make it any less packed! Waited until they changed from breakfast to lunch...I was in the mood for some meat...so while I waited...listened to the chatter of the regulars with the people behind the counter...and enjoyed a very delicious chocolate malt...that magically appeared from the back of the place by a very cheerful man...who obviously..knows what he is doing!! It was a joy to have all that dairy goodness even tho I am totally lactose intolerant! As the crowed cleared and 2 spots opened up at the counter...and lunch time arrived... I went with a burger...my partner in crime went with...something that had a ton of chili on it...since I am not a fan of chili..I didnt even try it.I watched who turned out to be the grandmother of our counter girl, prep the grill and shout for her supplies from the seemingly endless group of people working in the back. She yammered on with everyone at the counter...our counter girl bitched and moaned as a teenager does...not in any sort of annoying way...I too was a teenage girl at some point...The argument escalated as I chomped on my way to huge burger...to a point where our counter girl..ended up walking out!! She threw down her stuff and quit...right then and there!!The grandmother then tells us that this happens a lot..and that she will be back when she needs money again...hahaThe feeling of being in someones home...with their drama...their food...able to forget your own...is a really nice experience...I would eat there any time..and all of them are more than welcome in my home...The burger was huge...juicy and covered with all the fixins... they even let me taste the soup of the day which was a stew actually..and it was amazing. Never been much into stew but this one was mmmmmSo if you are in the mood...to feel like you are in someones home. Get some news from some locals and leave with about 10lbs added to your waistline... then you need to end up at Jim-Denny's ... Pay attention to their hours tho.. if you want breakfast...you gotta be there.. if you want lunch..you might have to wait.. its one or the other...never both =)
<review# 384,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2010,4/3/2010,45,96,3,5,4>The only reason I can think of for not having reviewed the Weatherstone earlier is that I consider it my second living room, and who would review their living room? That's just weird. That aside, I'd like to give a few Weatherstone-based anecdotes that exemplify my experience there.I have met several of my closest friends out on the patio of the Weatherstone. They were either reading something interesting, doing a crossword or talking about something awesome and we just *poof* became friends. My people, it turns out, hang at the Weatherstone.Both times I've been unemployed, I mostly conduct my online job search at the Weatherstone. It's a great place to commiserate with other unemployed people (particularly those who also happen to be coffee snobs). It also has decent wi-fi.Need a coffee? Great quality coffee (and tea) here. Hungry? The food's fab (I especially love the grilled cheese). Bored? Somebody interesting will be there. Want quiet time with your book? It's quiet. Learning to knit? There will be a knitter. Computer problems? There's a computer person probably right next to you. Weatherstone good.
<review# 385,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2010,4/2/2010,120,29,8,13,13>The Mister, our little monsters and I have been going here for quite sometime. They have literally seen our family grow. We started going there when our 6 year old was the only child. We continued to go pregnant girl craving after pregnant girl craving, while I was an emotional pregnant roller coaster passed monster number 2 and now with monster number 3, and times in between and there after. YOKO SUSHI is our best friend! It's definitely great atmosphere, clean, child friendly (trust me with my monsters running amok and still be welcome I KNOW they are child friendly), I would recommend them HIGHLY. Aside from being friendly and attentive the service is phenomenal. They always have our meals memorized and a high chair ready. woooo if only they had a day care service.... lol.Seriously though, hands down best sushi spot in town. go!

<review# 387,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2010,3/31/2010,148,83,1,7,6>That glistening slice of pizza you see will make you cry when you bite it. It's that good! What a wonderful, simple idea by Hot Italian, known for their seasonal creations. This pear, gorgonzola, honey pie hits all the right notes for winter. The chewy, gooey cheese forms the salty base to ground your mouth. Next, prepare for bold punches of that wonderfully raw, pungent blue cheese--not too much; just a sneak. All the while, the honey is dashing along behind, coating your tongue in golden, sweet rain. The crispy sweet pear is just a bonus of sugared delight. The happy medium of these salty, sweet, and bitter flavors makes for the perfect experience. Oh yeah--and did I mention this is pizza? Just one more reason to rejoice!
<review# 388,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2009,3/30/2010,110,199,7,17,9>I LOVE this store! Not only do they have a lot of awesome (designer too!) clothing, the proceeds go to a good cause.I bought a Quicksilver shirt and Billabong shorts for my boyfriend and a couple items from Abercrombie for myself. I got five clothing items for $17.99. YOU do the math.Also - the staff was really nice. Yes, they were having their own conversation while I was shopping around but in no way did I feel like I was being ignored (I didn't need help) or sneered at (are you kidding me? They work at a thrift store. You're shopping there. SO WHAT). The place doesn't stink either. It's a thrift store. It's got a thrift store smell but no stink. Common.
<review# 389,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/12/2012,1/4/2013,154,94,24,11,18>I was drunk.  Really drunk.  Ernest Hemingway drunk. Three sheets to the venerable wind....  I was welcomed into this labyrinth of a bar only to be accosted by leprechauns and knifed by a pirate.  I ordered drinks from a lovely woman who smiled at me despite my salubrious state.  She made me and my imaginary girlfriend a drink and then went back to the monsters at the other end of the bar.  I was sweating.  My skin was boiling and my head was pounding. The esoteric lights and glares coming from  behind the bar drove me outside for some fresh air. "Thanks for not kicking me out!" I said to the nice lady bartender.  "Well...The next place will. Be careful," she replied.  She was right.
<review# 390,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/29/2012,1/3/2013,372,323,20,20,16>Small, but extremely tidy and clean! Perfect place to go if your shopping list is Japanese specific items. You should find all your Japanese cuisine based items here for a fairly cheaper price than other Asian markets.They carry the famous Kewpie Japanese Mayo here, you can find it on sale for about $2.99! I had to buy mine at Ranch 99 for $5.99, yikes. Who the hell pays $6 for mayo... sadly, that was me!Also a great section of fresh (sometimes previously frozen) fish including tuna, yellowfin, salmon, masago (fish eggs/roe), and if you come early enough... you can get freshly made mixed poke! They say there are different grades of fish such as sushi grade and etc. Ignore that BS! There are no government or FDA regulations as what qualifies as "sushi grade". Those are only labels placed onto higher priced fish for consumers.They have a small "daiso" section which is like a Japanese dollar tree.I'll be back soon for some more goodies. Oh yeah, most important thing of all... this is the only place that carries GREEN TEA KIT KAT BARS!!!!!!!!!!! You can buy them in bags, buy them in bulk, just don't buy them all. Don't be a selfish shelf sweeper!!!!
<review# 391,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2012,1/2/2013,48,51,10,18,16>This is my mother's favorite steakhouse. We booked her 63rd birthday here for 10 guests last Saturday night; October 27, 2012.Our reservation was for 7:30PM. We arrived around 7:15PM but they were not ready for our party. That was fine with us because we went to the bar and watched Game 3 of the World Series and ordered some drinks. The bar is decorated with taxidermy of different animals such as bucks, wild boar, deer, bobcats, and other native and non-native species. This kind of freaked my sister out but I thought it was pretty cool. I believe there is only one TV in the back corner which isn't the best placement of the TV if you are sitting at the bar. My step father ordered my mom her favorite cocktail, a lemon-drop martini. She said the bartender made it well. Not sure how much it cost because I didn't buy an alcoholic drink.After 10-15 minutes, our table still wasn't ready. I started to get restless so I decided to take a stroll down Main Street. That night, Winters shut down a small section of Main Street for a small fair. There were different vendors and live music. I saw that Buckhorn set up a small buffet style booth in front of their restaurant. I asked what it was all about and he replied that for $5.00, you get to fill a plastic boat with as much food as you could fit in it. This included the meat they were barbequing on site and different side dishes. WHAT!? That is golden. I am going to get some of that A$$ next time 'round. I entered back into the bar and our table was ready. We were seated in the back room. Our server, Dominick, promptly delivered the house bread with extra butters as requested by members of our party. My mom inhaled that bread. One of the members of my party dropped a whole side cup of butter on the ground with the butter clearly lying against the carpet. She picked it up and determined that "it was still good" and proceeded to slather the dropped butter liberally all over her bread. This made me laugh. I didn't try the bread but everyone in my party agreed that it was good. We were given ample time to look over the menu. Dominick answered our questions sufficiently and took our orders promptly. I ordered the buffalo steak medium-rare with baked potato. The soup of the day was cream of mushroom but I opted for the salad with Italian. My mom ordered the rack of lamb and other members ordered the salmon, some steak dishes, and shrimp dishes. The salads and soups were prepared and delivered about 10 minutes after we ordered. The salad was your typical garden salad; nothing too special there. I tried the mushroom soup. I thought it was fantastic. And they give you a huge portion of it. However, it is very "buttery." About 10 minutes after we finished our salads/soups our entrees were served. You can see a picture of what I ordered. It is an 8oz buffalo (technically bison) sirloin with a cranberry reduction, baked potato, and butternut squash. The rule for cooking or ordering bison is not to overcook it over medium. When it gets over 140 degrees, it becomes dry because it is so lean. Bison is leaner than beef yet has more protein. Big fan of it. However, it has a lighter taste than beef; not as pronounced. Do not order this if you are scared of red or pink in your meat. The bison was cooked perfectly. Nice and red inside like I like it. The cranberry reduction gave it nice balance. The baked potato was just like any other and the butternut squash tasted nice as well.My mom RAVED about the rack of lamb. However, she ate so much bread that she could barely eat any of it. She gave me a piece and I concurred that it tasted great. I also got to sample the salmon dish. Very flavorful! The salmon just melts in your mouth. Members of my party who ordered the steaks found them tasty and cooked perfectly. The member who ordered the shrimp dish was disappointed.  But that is what happens when you just order shrimp at a place that specializes in red meat. As it was my mom's birthday, cake was served. Dominick did a great job of cutting and serving cake. Actually, he had to cut and serve 2 cakes. My sister brought one cake and my mom brought another cake, for her own birthday! There was so much cake that we cut off a HUGE piece and gave it to Dominick. Hope you enjoyed it, Dommy. I guess they are not supposed to split checks but Dom gave us the breakdown of what each person owed. That was so nice of him and convenient for us. Each of us graciously paid our portion with tip. It was a good experience. But MAN is it expensive. You gotta save this place for special occasions only. Great service and food. Next time, I will try that $5 boat deal. Or maybe the baseball cut steak.
<review# 392,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/26/2012,1/1/2013,410,518,9,8,10>The BEST wedding dress shopping experience!  My girls actually got to sit down and take a break.  They did not have to lift a finger (except to take some pictures)!  Which was nice, especially since every other place had them help put on and take dresses off of me.  I tried so many dresses on that it broke my underwear.  lol.  Carla was my consultant.  She was very knowledgeable and helpful.  She asked me if I had a budget and I told her that I just wanted to "fall in love" and that I'd make my decision after.  She was totally OK with that idea.  She pulled different dresses from the rack for me to try on, put them in the fitting room, closed the curtain, and helped me in the dress.  She is the clipping queen!  She clipped me into huge dresses that I was certain were not worth even trying on.  She pulled back the curtain and the gfs "ohhed" and "awwed"  at almost every dress!  Yes, every dress.  Which totally made narrowing down a favorite difficult.   Good thing this place lets you take pictures.  After a while all the dresses started to look the same.  And we were all hungry to the point of hangry (hungry and angry at the same time).  The pictures really helped with the decision making process.  After a long day of shopping I was totally unsure of which dress I truly loved the most.  Thanks to the pictures, I fell in love with a dress at this boutique.   The next day I brought the parents to help make the final decision.  I didn't think I'd get this dress because of the ridiculous price tag, but my parents were sold once they saw me in it.  The dress was really well made and  the material was top notch.    I can't wait to wear this dress!!!
<review# 393,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/27/2012,12/31/2012,266,332,4,15,10>I used to come here when they were formerly known as, "Koreana." Wow! The remodelization is fantastic, look out, Ranch 99! This store has everything you could think of. Lots, of Asian, Mexican, Indian, and European groceries. They have a bigger inventory so there isn't such a mark up on their items. Their produce department is phenomenal, lots of different and hard to find produce you wouldn't find at your local chain grocer and they are reasonably priced. If you don't like to walk when you shop, this isn't the place for you, this place is Massive! If you're not a good cook, you can pick up ready made sushi, marinated Korean BBQ, various banchan (Korean side dishes), and pick up dessert at their European bakery, and then have a party!
<review# 394,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/27/2012,12/30/2012,198,267,7,8,7>This is my boyfriend's favorite thai place and I can see why.The people are really nice. They provide excellent service. They always made sure we were okay and made sure to refill our cups as needed. Came here on a weeknight, so it wasn't busy. We ordered several dishes. Brown rice, red curry with chicken, pad thai with chicken, and a noodle dish. Every dish was cooked fresh and looked fantastic. The food was also very good from what I remember given the first couple of bites.My boyfriend decided to order thai hot. Don't do it. Just order it hot. Like American hot. If you order thai hot be prepared to breathe fire out of your nose. I suffered all night. I wish he hadn't ordered it that spicy because I really wanted to enjoy the food. The food was good despite it burning my insides out. I'm going to come back. Generous portions, decently priced, great service, fresh food, and great smiles. Remember don't order it thai hot unless you want to be a dragon breathing out fire from your nostrils and mouth!Shoutout to the owners and the staff. You remembered us, well at least me because I was the fire breathing dragon girl! Thank you for always providing great food and awesome service!
<review# 395,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/15/2012,12/29/2012,257,251,10,11,11>Chicago style pizza virgin alert!!I'm so used to having thin crust (which I love) that when we walked in here I was leery.  I imagined a super thick regular style crust, which did not appeal to me AT ALL.    Our server explained it all for me and once she said that the crust was not just regular dough, I was intrigued.Holy balls, I LOVE me some pizza pie.  We ordered a combo, and the ingredients were fresh and hot and delicious.  I'm no pizza snob, I don't care if I have to eat with knife and fork.  That crust... oh man... so perfectly dense and the outside had a golden crunch, and... and... I ate one piece and was full.  WTF?  You bet your ass I ate one more small slice and waddled to the car.  So what?  So worth it.I cannot wait to go back and take friends!Ps.  Linda's is in the old Taco Bell on Greenback/Sunrise.  The only thing that makes it still feel like a Taco Hell is the cartoonish art on the windows, but other than that I love how they transformed the decor!
<review# 396,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2012,12/28/2012,192,54,9,17,15>I am a fervent supporter of good BBQ. I love cooking it, eating it, talking about it and plotting my own BBQ successes. On my drive to work, I often see this dreadlocked dude firing up the grills in a strip mall parking lot on Broadway and I become intrigued every time. I've heard rave reviews about this little spot and while I've been trying to get to Mo Mo's for what seems like ages but the timing was never quite right. They do seem to have abbreviated hours and are closed on Sunday and Monday. My intent to formulate my own opinion, however, was resolute! The opportunity finally revealed itself in the form of a lazy Tuesday afternoon and a free day with my gal. In our mini-vacay induced zombie state, we dragged ourselves out of the house and made tracks for Mo Mo's.The establishment itself is spartain, to say the least: A few cosy tables near the entrance and along one wall. The decor is butcher shop appropriate with cut charts of the various animals I was hoping to eat that day and little else on the walls. A long counter acts as a shield wall for the preparation area.No sooner had I taken stock of my surroundings when I was pleasantly welcomed by the woman behind the counter."Hello! I'm Sharon," said this ravishing woman with a tone of genuine warmth. "Is this your first time here?"Now, I can only imagine how wide-eyed with anticipation I must have looked at that point as I slavered over the simple yet enticing menu on the opposite wall."Yep. First time."Without missing a beat, Sharon spun around and began preparing a BBQ sampler for each of us which consists of a portion of tri-tip, chicken, pork rib and hot link. I worked my way around the paper tray nibbling at one then another, each morsel more fantastic than the last. I've got to choose?!? Eventually I did: Tri-tip and ribs with a side of baked beans and greens. While our order was being prepared, the gentleman working the outdoor grill stepped in looking as cool as a cucumber. "Hi! I'm Glen. What're your names?" We introduced ourselves, made a generic comment about the stifling heat, (to which he politely agreed) and whisked away to tend to the cooking.After selecting some beverages from the cooler (soda, iced teas and water only), we picked a seat near the window, eager to dig in. Once again, I deftly worked my way amongst the offerings, never taking more than a few bites before moving on to the next bite of delicious. And boy was it delicious. The Tri-tip was tender, moist and shredded across the grain. My ribs literally melted off of the bone. I opted for the spicy BBQ sauce, and while it was delicious and held well-balanced flavors, it could there could have been a bit more heat for my tastes. The sides were tasty but took little from the carnivorous delights that remained center stage.Suffice to say, that was not a moment of great dining conversation...It was all I could do to remember to breathe in between bites!After finishing as much of the delectible fair as I dared, I looked down at my leftovers and realized I had enough food for one more satisfying dose of deliciousness. Glen insisted we take a bag for our extra helpings, engouraged us to come back soon and wished us well as we staggered out the door.Now, I'm not one top throw five-star reviews around all willy-nilly style, but Mo Mo's delivered on all of my expectations for top marks. Simple menu options, gracious and courteous service and, most of all, some of the best BBQ I have been fortunate enough to savor in quite a while. On my next visit I plan on cranking up the charm and picking Glen's brain for a few of his BBQing secrets!

If you've looked upon it, you probably think I spend entire paychecks on hair products and a dedicated, professional stylist. Maybe even a team of stylists. Don't feel bad. It's a common mistake. The truth is this:My hair is magical. And the point of this review is that it doesn't matter where I go to have my hair cut. My hair astonishingly becomes its glorious, striking, breathtaking self by virtue of some metaphysical force. But you? You need Great Clips.They're friendly, consummate professionals who are committed to the cause. They listen, they perform and they enthusiastically hold that giant hand mirror behind you so you can see your neck. They don't charge outrageous fees for services rendered and they rarely make you wait. Best of all, they may fit you with your own magical mane. Well, not magical like my locks--c'mon, be realistic--but perhaps something just slightly less than divine.
<review# 398,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2012,12/26/2012,79,170,2,8,7>As a 5-star fan of Magpie, I have been anxious to see Yellowbill open.  I'm happy to report that the staff, the coffee, and most importantly the food, is all excellent.Went in on a Saturday morning for a mocha and a breakfast sandwich.  The mocha had a great flavor, with whipped cream and come cocoa nibs on top.  And when I say whipped cream, I mean the two words, like, the cream has been whipped.  Not the cream substitute has been sprayed on your coffee.  And the breakfast sandwich?  Holy crap it's good.  Don't let the size fool you, it's a good meal.Decided to come back during the week for lunch, and that was just as good.  I had a foccaccia with oven-dried tomatoes, bacon and basil - very tasty and full of flavor.  Also had a couple of cookies and they are just like they were at Magpie.  Finished it off with a Coke in the bottle - that's a good lunch.Don't expect a full lunch menu here, but if you just want a quick sandwich or foccaccia, this is the place to do it.
<review# 399,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/16/2013,8/11/2013,466,199,9,14,12>I really enjoyed the Sebze Hunkar (sauteed vegetables on eggplant sauce). The veggies were nicely seasoned and served on top of a very tasty eggplant sauce. The service, while friendly, was not very attentive. When we arrived on this blazing hot night, water was not offered and we had to request it. I was about ready to go into the bathroom and drink out of the sink. Some other service pitfalls included timing of the food, as well as not checking on the table as often as I would have liked. With that said, I'm absolutely going back because the food was great and I feel confident that the service will get ironed out once this location has been open a little while longer.
<review# 400,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2013,8/10/2013,144,58,9,15,14>Sometimes you've got to hit up the "hood" to get really good food. This is one of those places! It's located on the corner of Florin Rd and 24th in a pretty run down strip mall. From the outside, it doesn't look so good but trust me, give this place a try and you will be back! =)The restaurant itself is small and seats about 40 so you can definitely dine in but I usually do take out when I come. Always plenty of parking and they have a security guard to make you feel a little bit better. Customer service here is pretty much to the point. They give you prices over the phone with the tax already included! Oh and they are fast! I usually call them when I'm already on my way, it's always 15 minutes! And almost all the dishes are about $6-$8 only!-BBQ Pork Chow Mein is the reason why I come here. Hands down, they have the best Chow Mein in Sac! I love the taste- salty but not overly soy sauced, the crunch of the cabbage, the dark color of the noodles and the huge slices of sweet bbq pork. This dish alone is fantastic! -The Sweet and Sour Chicken is also great! I always get the sauce on the side so when I get home, the chicken pieces are still crispy! They are always fried golden to perfection. -Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings- HUGE! Salty and on point every time!-Honey Walnut Shrimp- Not bad but not the greatest either. The sauce is thick but has a light taste to it. The batter could be better. -Salt and Pepper Spare Ribs- Anything salt and pepper is good if you ask me! This dish is always a good choice!-Kung Pao Chicken- Good spicy flavor, I wish the vegetables were cut a little bigger but overall a good dish.-Four Seasons- Vegetable and meat lovers dream come true. You get a little bit of everything in this one. So I'm giving them 4 stars for having the best Chow Mein in town, for their quick service and for being easy on the wallet! Take your Chow Mein cravings here, and I bet it'll be your "go to" place for it! =)
<review# 401,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/24/2013,8/9/2013,317,342,15,22,18>Folks in the Richard's Blvd area have been in pain-staking anticipation of Linda Taqueria to open ever since the bright orange paint was put on the former Awful Wally's burger joint location, and it is FINALLY HERE!!!! I dropped in for a breakfast burrito and bumped into a coworker and he asked if I had any of that, and he pointed to a large chunk of red meat that was basking on a hook and I said no.  He said ooooh my gawd, the el pastor is DE-LI-CIOUS!  We both quickly ordered that in a breakfast burrito and raced (I mean drove safely) back to the office to nosh on our eagerly awaiting prize.  He was not lying, the meat was oh so flavorful, sliced nice and fully engaged with the beans, scrambled eggs, and potatoe in a flour torilla.My coworker said he came yesterday for lunch and they were swamped, so call ahead for the lunch crowd.  They offer all the mexcian food a taqueria would normally sell, including menudo on weekends.  My only disappointment was they did not have a salsa bar, but the salsa that was put in my order was delicious! Now excuse me while I go take a nap at my desk from my food coma enducing burritooooo ZZZZZZZ
<review# 402,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2013,8/8/2013,1137,179,12,16,14>Sarang Bang shot me in the mouth and in the stomach making me weak and wanting more. First things first, this place has horrible service, but I think the food here definitely makes up for it a lot. My friend and I came here around 7:00pm on a Friday night and we had to wait for about 45-50 minutes for a seat for two. It sucks that this place is really small and I think if this place were a bit bigger then service would be much quicker. But it might be because of the fact that the only waitress/server that night was an Asian lady who might be the owner of the place as well. I felt pretty bad for her and I give her props for serving everyone by herself, though there were a few times throughout the night where she didn't check up on us at all/forgot to get us the things we asked for. But enough with the bad service and onto the food. Looking at what the Yelpers recommended through the tips, reviews, and pictures, my friend and I ended up ordering three dishes: spicy chicken, seafood pancake, and the bulgogi. Our meal also came with 4 side dishes and purple rice. Spicy Chicken (12)- Oh god...these wings were de-li-cious! Juicy and a blast full of flavor; this is by far my favorite dish. My friend doesn't like spicy food at all but these wings weren't spicy and she ended up loving the chicken. Seafood Pancake ($13)- A different type of pancake than what I usually have because it was very crispy but I enjoyed it a lot. Definitely the right amount of flavor; crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. The sauce that comes with the pancake compliments it really well. Bulgogi ($12)- Tender meat and marinated in the right amount of sauce; not too much and not too little. Another dish I really recommend to have at Sarang Bang. Though service is terrible here, I think it was worth the wait but probably not worth it if you are literally starving and are impatient. My cravings for Korean food were satisfied more than I expected and I'm glad I came here.I recommend this place for those who haven't been here or if you just want some good Korean food. I just hope you are ready to be willing to wait for a seat for a while. I actually suggest you come here for a very late dinner since it got less crowded after 8:00pm on Friday. Good thing this place is open til 2:00am from Monday to Saturday and 12:00am on Sundays!TLDR; horrible service but great Korean food. Get the spicy chicken!! It's to die for!
<review# 403,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/24/2013,8/7/2013,383,246,14,16,15>So, I promised my best friend that if she sang in RHS idol (HS version of American idol) in front of our school, I would treat her out to The Melting pot...fast forward 4 years, we finally go, lol. So yeah, been wanting to come here for quite some time now...Made reservations for their "Girls night out" event. $38 per person (including tax and tip)-- 4-course meal deal. Not bad, not bad...Started off with the spinach artichoke cheese fondue w/ bread, veggies and granny smith apples for dipping. Ermahgerd, it was quite delish.Next, choice of salads--Melting pot house salad or California salad. My bestie got the house, I had the Cali. Went nom, nom, nom on them.For the entrees-- Bite size pieces of Teriyaki-marinated sirloin, chicken breast, white shrimp, filet Mignon and ravioli, more veggies on the side w/ plenty of different sauces to compliment the meats. Court Bouillon cooking style. Aw yeah! *insert delicious emoji hand gesture here.After a good rest from the delicious food, we were ready for the dessert. Requested for the yin yang (dark/white chocolate) fondue w/ cut up strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, rice krispies, marshmallows, pound cake, red velvet bites and brownies for dunking. Golly gee wilikers! It was so gooood, it was bad. Just scrumdiddlyumptious.The food was enjoyable and service was awesome. Our waitress helped us through the whole course (gosh, we were such newbs) and checked up on us every once in a while. The ambience was cool. I'd have to say this is the nicest/fanciest restaurant I've been to. We spend 3 hrs there, lol. Bill was under $84 for the 4-course and 2 non-alcoholic fruity drinks. If you plan on coming here, check out their website before hand to see what specials & events are going down (or coming up), you just might save some $$...  I'm so glad I checked! And when you come, make sure you have plenty of time because the courses are not something you should rush. Definitely going to make melting pot an annual Bestie day thang :)
<review# 404,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2013,8/6/2013,50,67,19,21,14>Ok, here is the deal. You NEED to eat here at least once before the rest of the world figures out what they are missing. I GUARANTEE, in a year, there will be a line out the door.As a long time yelper I've seen it happen time and again. This man is doing most everything right. He does burgers and fries and he does them well.There is no foo-foo here so if you expect portabello, blue cheese bullshit, take a U turn and head back to midtown hippie, cause this ain't your scene. But if you want a GOOD burger and handmade fries from a local business. Do yourself a favor and check out Stevieboy. You will be glad you did!
<review# 405,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2013,8/5/2013,523,171,11,17,10>As an Indian person, I tend to be seriously picky when it comes to restaurants. This place is HUGE inside, and pretty nicely decorated. There are some cheesy, weird, neon IKEA lamps that don't quite go with the decor though.They have a banquet room that seats 100 with a stage, and the owner told us he plans to expand it to be able to hold more.I came here with 7 other family members. I called earlier in the day to make a reservation and was greeted warmly over the phone, and was easily accommodated for 8.The mango lassi I ordered was the biggest one I think i have ever seen in my entire life. It was pretty damn delicious too, as I inhaled it in like 5 minutes. Oops.We ordered the meat appetizer platter which came with chicken dumplings (which kind of had an odd taste to them, and the wrapper was really hard to cut into), fish fingers (surprisingly good!), naan, and only one samosa. I personally think they need to add maybe one more samosa to the platter.The naan basket had three different varieties of naan, and we also ordered the garlic cilantro naan. I loved their naan. Most Indian places make theirs really small, and far too oily. Not here though!There was a mix up with the butter chicken, as we ordered it mild, and it came medium, and my poor 6 year old nephew thought it was mild and spit it out because it was way too hot. They did give us new butter chicken (even though we ate half of the spicier one already) within 5 minutes, at no charge. The Namaste chicken was probably my favorite dish of the night. I highly suggest it! We also ordered the Tandoori platter which came with chicken, salmon, shrimp and lamb, all of which were very good.They were semi-busy, considering it was a Saturday evening. The staff was a little inattentive as we had to flag them down on several occasions just to pay the bill.The food was cooked very healthy, not a lot of cream, or oil in their foods, which my family loved. We will definitely be coming back here and I suggest you check them out too!They have lunch buffets, and a dinner buffet every Wednesday too. Seniors get 10% off the buffets :)There were quite a few other Indian families eating there, which is always a good sign! The prices are very fair also.... you can get a lot of food for relatively cheap!
<review# 406,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2013,8/4/2013,116,75,10,14,13>Temple Garden, how I love thee. Let me count the ways...1. Always always always friendly customer service. Whether it's delivery (love this!!), over the phone (and you're placing an order 30 minutes before they close), or in person (and you're picking up your order 15 minutes before they close). Always a hello, a smile, a thank you. People are happy there and happy people do their best at work.2. The food: all the basics, plus a few special things. If you don't see something you were hoping to find, ask. The food is always great (well, although the "spicy" items noted on the menu aren't actually spicy, but I keep forgetting to mention this when I order. Not a big deal). 3. The prices are very fair. For a very reasonable price, you're getting pretty much whatever the hell you want, it's going to be good, and the service is stellar.4. They deliver. For those days or nights when you're just not equipped to brave the public (AKA your brothers are in town and the whole house is hung over & starving & there's a Giants game on in 10 minutes), delivery is just what the doctor ordered. Temple Garden, you are tops in my book.
<review# 407,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2013,8/3/2013,161,58,7,17,8>NOTE:  This review is about the shaved ice. Not about the waterFew warm weather treats hit the spot the way shaved ice can so when I heard there was a place in Sac I was gonna make it a point to check it out. In the bay area there's a place with a similar setup.  I really liked it so i already have a set of expectations going into the place.The location is little hard to find at first. Its tucked away in a corner of a strip mall. The address on Yelp is correct but the map on Yelp is wrong.  The address on the website is wrong but the map on it is right.  So here's the low down.  The address on the door is 3069a. Its in the Country West Shopping Center at the corner of Harbor and W Capitol Ave. If you map the address on yelp then you'll be OK.  Also the business name is Alka Pure Water but the sign above the shop says Crystal Pure Water.  The parking there is pretty sucky.  There are way too many shops for the the amount of parking available.  The parking in front of it has a sign saying its reserved for the store next to it so chances are that you have to park kinda far from it.  OK now to the food.  They of course sell super filtered water.  Other than that they have ice cream, shaved ice, and the also have Merlino's freeze.  If you want to know the flavors check out the website.  I ordered the Hawaiian style shaved ice.  A scoop of ice cream topped with shaved ice in the flavors you want, rainbow mochi, and a little bit of condensed milk.  I got mine with vanilla ice cream with watermelon and blue Hawaiian syrup.  The taste is what i expected from it which is good.  I wish they would have put more condensed milk on it not just a "drizzle".  I'm sure you could ask for more but i wanted to have it how they would make it.  This is what i recommend: if you want ice cream in it, get a neutral flavor cuz the flavors of the shaved ice will mix with it and some flavor just don't mix well.  I'll prolly just get only shaved ice topped with whatever flavors and extra condensed milk.  Here's the not so good.  The shop seemed a little run down.  The floor looked a little dirty and overall felt kinda old considering its been around for a couple of years.  The parking is ridonkulous here.  All these other shops around it has spots reserved for them.  Can't they get like 1?!  Actually despite these things, which doesn't bother me, the only thing i find fault is the shaved ice.  Its not exactly the "authentic" Hawaiian shave ice.  Its not pillowy soft like fresh fallen snow.  There were sometimes chunks of unshaven ice.  I think it may be due to the fact they shave ice cubes not a giant ice block like they do in other shave ice places. using cubes causes crushed ice pieces which doesnt cut it cuz we're not making sno-cones. When doing shaved ice, obviously the shaved ice is paramount to making it good.  This place is a 3.5 stars. I gave it the extra 1/2 star for the rarity of shaved ice in the area and the fact that there is a lot of potential for it to be really good.  Overall though the shaved ice was pretty good.  The taste is right on but texturally tho was not.  I think the only thing stopping this place from being the bomb dot com is the quality of the shaved ice.  Not the water quality but the shave quality.  I would still come back tho if i get a shaved ice craving but its not gonna be a foodie stop for me until the type of shaved ice changes.
<review# 408,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2013,8/2/2013,354,195,14,16,15>Let the comparison begin!So I was craving some Chipotle, however, the line was ridiculously long, wrapped around the seating area of the place and although I may be a little piggy, I have my limits, so I yelped around and saw that Freebirds was nearby and similar to Chipotle.Off we went, right down the street where there wasn't more than one person in line! Looking at the menu you can see why people compare Chipotle and Freebirds, fresh ingredients being either wrapped in a burrito, thrown in a bowl, or crammed into a taco shell. But, Freebirds has NACHOS! And I am a sucker for nachos! They also have a few different options for toppings. Spinage wraps, pickled jalapenos, and various BBQ and hot sauces that they bottle up to sell, are just a few options that you have here versus Chipotle. My favorite is the cheese that they put on their nachos. It's not real shredded cheese and its not the fake cheese sauce that comes from a can, it's sort of like a bechamel sauce of sorts made with gooey, yummy cheese. That is the thing that has got the boyfriend and I coming here over Chipotle. The employees here are also really nice and friendly. The prices are also about the same as Chipotle.To wrap it up, I won't say that one eatery is better than the other, instead I will say that you be the judge, but might I suggest you order some nachos!
<review# 409,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/2/2014,9/11/2014,337,422,10,11,13>Sacramento has a SOCCER team!I mean, it's not a MLS team, but it'll do! That being said, the new Bonney field isn't too shabby!It doesn't hold as much as it's predecessor and they ALSO charge $10 for parking. I guess it's a good thing the tickets aren't too expensive, unless you find yourself paying $75/ticket on StubHub!I didn't buy any food, but I did survey the food situation. there were over 5 food trucks, one food station that looked more permanent, and also a SRFC pop-up store. They pretty much have all you could ask for - soccer, food, and booze.I've only been once and sat in section 108, but it doesn't seem like there could really be a bad seat in the house. Unless you don't want to be offended by the Tower Bridge Battalion - these are the crazies that are die hard fans for our hometown team. I've also heard the VIP section is pretty awesome, but I have yet to be privy to that part of Bonney Field. Although we're moving up in the soccer world, this field does give the team/games a lesser of a feel. I almost feel like some of the local high schools have better facilities than our team. But, you have to start somewhere. So I'll obligingly pay $10 to park and sit on a bench without a back...libations probably would cure this in a heartbeat!Glory, glory Sacramento!
<review# 410,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/14/2014,9/10/2014,231,436,12,12,16>There's a deal for Clay Oven Grill & Bar on Groupon.  I've scrolled by it a few times while waiting for time to pass.  I was hesitant at first, especially since the last time I visited (reference previous review) and a little worried that the workers would spit in my food since the owner sent me a mess. about my incident that occurred a few years ago.  The owner offered a free meal but I never took it - I was afraid it was a ploy to give me rabies or something.  Any who, I got the Groupon for two so I could proposition a girlfriend of mine into a plan that I've had for a while.  I needed a place that was clean and classy.  She and I went there the first time I went so I knew she'd be in for a free lunch with me.Our servers name was Nicole (I believe) and she was friendly.  She gave great suggestions and was very attentive with our needs.  I ordered my butter chicken a little too spicy so she gave us an insight of some type of yogurt to help minimize the burning hell that was flaming on my taste buds.  Overall, I really did appreciate the service.  Nicole was great and very easy to talk to.  The food was a bit too spicy then the  last time I remembered it to be but it was satisfying nonetheless.  I was going starstruck with their free wifi... however, my service was limited at that location and their wifi is a bit slow.
<review# 411,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,9/9/2014,1934,564,32,35,30>A great example of what a 5 star local restaurant should be...great owner, friendly attentive staff, good prices and damn good food.Richplate is right on Main Street smack dab in the middle of downtown Lockeford. This used to be Country Cafe and apparently before that 15 years ago it was owned by George who owns it again now. We got to talk with him and he's made lots of improvements to the place, and inside looks absolutely great. The menu is very extensive, everything from breakfast to desert and just about everything in between. I ordered the meat-lovers omelette with hash-browns. Seriously I was hungry but I couldn't finish the whole thing, I have enough for breakfast for tomorrow! I live in Stockton but I wouldn't mind making the 15 minute drive out to Lockeford to get myself some good home style food! I know for fact if I happen to be driving through this will be the one place I want to stop.As for now they are only open till 3pm...I hope thy expand their hours in the future.You can be sure I will return.:0)
<review# 412,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2014,9/8/2014,1214,515,8,15,15>3.5 stars - but I'm posting 4 stars because of their "honest pint policy!"Rubicon Brewing is a midtown Sac brewpub serving casual bar food and some respectable house brews. If you like HH beers, you'll love their $2.50 pint prices all day every Tuesday (those, and Fox & Goose, are the BIGGEST pints in town, trust me). Several TV screens carry sports. Seating is non-hosted and there's a patio that fills quickly when the weather's good.The food? If you're not too picky, it's just fine. This is not a foodie haven, but if you enjoy craft beers and some pub-style eats to go along, you'll do just fine.Roundup:    Beer: 4 - House brewed, big pours - up to 30% more (except goblets).    Food: 2-3. Wash it down with 4-star beer!    Service: 4 - It's best at the bar!    Setting: 3 - There's a front patio that's usually packed.    Value: 4 - Honest pints! Check their HH deals.    Date worthy: 3 - Walkability score is high...Check out the hood!    Bring your dog: Front patio OK.
<review# 413,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/14/2014,9/7/2014,129,149,9,13,11>I have been frequenting the Laundromat next door for years now and was delighted to see this little restaurant open up next door. It was also nice to see that it was under common ownership. It's a nice little spot to hang out and have a bite to eat or an adult beverage while I am waiting for my laundry to finish (take all my money!). They definitely spent a LOT of time getting the place remodeled as it looks completely and utterly different than the previous space. So far, I really like what they have done- the sort of vintage-industrial-Brooklyn look that's popular right now (and, honestly, I'm okay with that- it's a cool style). I think they still have a lot planned for the overall ambiance as the chairs are, well, they seem like the kind you rent for a wedding reception, but I'm sure that's temporary. I don't think they have a cash register yet either...so, baby steps. You know what matters though? The people and the food. Let me just say, the Adamo's burger has to be one of the best burgers I have ever had. It was prepared medium for me and was amazing juicy-delicious. I loved that they used white cheese instead of cheddar, that it was served on a brioche bun, and that, instead of ketchup or mayo, it was jalapeno aioli. I know aioli is basically just fancy mayonnaise, but you know, it really means something that they take the time to make it themselves. Speaking of homemade, they also have house pickles. I hate pickles...or I thought I did. I actually ate the damned thing, and liked it. Oh! The fries! So crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I might become a weekly beer and fries guy while I'm doing my laundry...Now, the wait staff. For full disclosure, the person serving us was the same person who worked every time I went to the laundromat, so I already had a sort of rapport with her, but you can tell she's just the kind of person who is nice and warm with everybody. She brought us some of their Sucio fries to sample. Very tasty! It was sort of like having fry-nachos since they were topped with cheese, sour cream, onions, and pablano sauce (I may be missing an ingredient or two). That pablano sauce though! So good. If I hadn't just devoured the burger, I would have demolished that plate of fries! I think they would have done better without the grilled onions, but I'm not the chef!So, you gotta cut them some slack on a couple things considering they just opened and are still in progress on a couple things (seating, getting beers on tap, a cash register, and maybe even a few more menu items). Seriously, though, I am going back, for sure. I need to try all their other sandwiches! I even heard they are going to (long term) try and figure out an outdoor seating scenario...that would be very cool as they are starting out as and, I hope hope hope, remain a great lunch spot. I wonder if they'll eventually have dinner service! I can see this place getting really popular if they keep up their ambition to make tasty food and have a great, affordable drink menu. I'm looking forward to seeing them evolve and be successful as a new Sacramento business!
<review# 414,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,9/6/2014,519,131,9,15,17>When I went to Shoki II, I had thought "Wow, this is like a good bowl of ramen with all the fun sucked out of it" And I was right, though on this trip I finally understood why. Today I had a few minutes to read the short bio of the owner/founder of Shoki. Turns out he was a nutritionist by training, so he prioritized making a healthy bowl of ramen. I can finally understand the food here, and I can now respect as well as appreciate what Shoki is trying to do. The bowl that will be placed before you ostensibly contains fresh, carefully selected ingredients. It seems like something a family member would have whipped up for you. This is a big shift that I think is worth rewarding with more business. Most restaurants try to make their food taste as addictively good as possible, and the customers' health be damned (think liberal use of butter, oil, sugar, and so on). The audacity to make such a mediocre tasting but healthy meal is impressive.To further underscore how different Shoki is from other ramen places, the waiter had said, "Would you like to add any toppings? We have some especially fresh shiitake mushrooms tonight." When was the last time you heard something like that from one of those mega-factory blockbuster superstar ramen places?
<review# 415,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,9/5/2014,899,839,11,14,14>If you could take happiness and transform it into a baked good, you'd end up with one of their pies. Food: Excuse me while I wipe the drool from my mouth. It's hard writing about this without wishing I could smush my face into one of those packets of pure heaven and just inhale. Z Pie bakes up scrumptious pot pies, both of the savory and sweet variety. One glance at the menu and you'll realize that they offer some mindblowing combinations like the rosemary lamb, Thai chicken, and steak cabernet (yelp.com/biz_photos/z-pi). After a lengthy wrestle with indecision, I chose the rosemary lamb (yelp.com/biz_photos/z-pi). The crust was baked to flaky perfection and the guts of the pie were oozing with intensely flavored and succulent lamb, carrot, potato, pearl onions, and green beans (yelp.com/biz_photos/z-pi). The complexity of the flavor probably comes from hints of a balsamic reduction, rosemary, and mint. No skimping on quality ingredients in these pies! I had a sample of the Southwest Chicken, which was really tasty, especially if you're craving something spicy, but I definitely preferred the lamb. For dessert, I split the berry and apple dessert pies (yelp.com/biz_photos/z-pi). These puppies tasted equally amazing as my lamb. My only regret was that I had to share. Did I mention that they give you a nice full, free glass of Z red or white wine if you check in on Yelp (yelp.com/biz_photos/z-pi)? It doesn't get much better than this!Atmosphere: When you enter the door, one of the first things you see is the giant display case full of pies (yelp.com/biz_photos/z-pi). It's not much to look at, but with pot pies (and most things in life) it's what's on the inside that counts. The seating area is pretty cozy, but decorated with lots of wooden accents and lights. There's a large parking garage right outside. Pretty convenient if you're just stopping by on your way to the mountains. Service: Everyone here is so nice. They make dining in a wonderful experience, especially with that free glass of wine. They were even thoughtful enough to cater to distant customers. If you're nowhere near Placerville (or the other location in Reno) and have an insatiable craving that needs satisfying or else, you can have the pies shipped to you.Synopsis: If you're on your way to Tahoe on 50, you should probably stop here and check this place out. You won't be disappointed!
<review# 416,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,9/4/2014,100,165,20,20,19>Take this review with a grain of salt because in all honesty I am oddly (and naturally) HIGH from how ridiculously amazing that sandwich that I just threw down was.  I walked in and the Sandwich Spot had a good vibe and energy to it.  It was very neat and clean.  Not even noon and quite a few tables were already occupied with happy customers.  I am sure the place goes off during lunch rush.  I am fairly certain I had that "first-timer" glazed over look, mouth agape as I scanned the large menu on the back wall, but sweet baby jeebis how am I expected to pick something(s) from this menu, when everything sounds so mouth watering?  For a split second I was kicking myself for not doing some research (even from the car) before walking in.  The owner Mike was walking around greeting his customers and everyone who entered the front door.  A genuinely friendly and mellow guy, I started to pick his brain about the most popular sandwiches.  I settled on the #2 and the #4 (award winning decisions btw).  Got called up to the counter by a sweet gal who's name tag read "Ju-Ju" much like the finer things in life like Jujubes candy and Brazilian Ju-Jitsu.  She was smiling, helpful and patient as I asked questions about the different options.I paid the bill with Mike's gorgeous wife Charisse and just like Mike, she was super friendly and welcoming.  Legit and awesome business owners, ones you feel should be modeled by everyone.  It is no wonder that this business seems to be thriving in this community (as well as in the Yelp community).Not to mention, anyone who has me sample a Double IPA before noon-fifteen is A-OK in my book.  Will I be back?  Does a monk seek enlightenment?

Prices are a little higher than say Home Depot, but I feel like the quality of plants are better here. . .I could be wrong but we will see.Customer Service was great, we were caught looking lost and an employee found us and helped us as if her life goal was to help us find a cool house plant.We got a nice group of herbs stared, a few other pretty plants, and a cactus, we also bought our pots there. potting mix and plant food. . . no indoor plant though :/Good stuff, this is by far the best looking and the one with the biggest selection to go to.

<review# 418,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2014,9/2/2014,387,268,22,30,24>My 200th REVIEW!!!! Why not review one of my favorite restaurants in Elk Grove?!Over the last five years, our need to be in the downtown scene every weekend or even every chance we could get has been dwindling.  I guess the main factors are kids, life, laziness and of course aging!  LOL yes, ageing. Friday nights I'm exhausted thus means no partying and dancing, I feel the same way on Saturday nights and Sunday nights are out of the question!  So, that leaves; Friday evenings for a close by dinner, and Saturday and Sundays mornings or early afternoons for brunch or early dinner.  Wow, when I map that out we sound like an old married couple! What does all this mean??? It means Brick House baby!!!!Brick House has become our go-to Elk Grove hang out.  Brick House is located in the old Elk Grove near the railroad tracks, and as I noted previously I NEVER went out that way but I'm so glad we have.  We go for Happy Hour, Brunch, Dinner and even Lunch.Dinner:The dinner menu includes nightly specials such as primerib, lamb chops but also includes lots and lots of Italian meals to dine on.  Pastas, soups, salads, fish, short ribs, and much more.  We love the primerib, lamb chops, pesto pasta, and the calamari.  The menu is so large we still have much more to give a try. Not only is the menu large but the meals are hearty and large in size!Brunch:Brick House has an amazing Sunday Brunch.  Pancakes larger than anything I have seen, wonderful Louie Salad full of fresh prawns and crab meat, Garlic wings to die for, $2 mimosas (90% champagne and 10% OJ) and like the dinner menu much much more.  Brunch being the combo between breakfast and lunch this menu is a great mixture for me, hubby and the family.  I enjoy salads, wings with my mimosas but on the other hand, Hubby enjoys pancakes and eggs with this Irish coffee.  Brickhouse continues to blow us away and meet all of our needs.Lunch:The lunch menu is simple, full of large, wonderful and filling sandwiches and burgers!  Who does not like a Prime rib sandwich? Or BLT?  Or Burger?  We do!!!  As an added bonus, sometimes during lunch Brickhouse has Happy Hour drink prices, which our wallet looooveeesss!!!This family run restaurant works very hard to maintain great food, wonderful service with consistency.  We have never had a bad meal or horrible service; actually it has always been the opposite.  So now that we are an old married couple, we are happy to have a great establishment to dine at! Five Cheers to Brick House!

I drove by twice.Coming here, I received great food and great service; moreover, there was live music playing during brunch time! Awesome! The waiter [Alex] was awesome in helping us order and the staff was awesome in refilling water ever so efficiently. The food selection was intense but take your time and enjoy the scene. My girlfriend and I shared the following:1) Biscuits and Gravy - 7.5/10 Deep in flavor, the gravy complimented the Biscuits like they were twins. One of the best BnG I have ever had. Definitely try this.2) Tommy's Southwestern Benny - 7Hollandaise sauce with Egg Benedict! A Great flavor to compliment the Eggs! Very delicious but not very portion-ate. 3) French Toast - 6/10Great taste of four large trianlged bread pieces. Expect to share.Overall, this place is a must try! Check out their menu only!Pros: Food, Service, AmbianceCons: Booth Seats are not as comfortable as they could beStars: 4.5!
<review# 420,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/19/2012,6/9/2012,356,378,2,9,5>On the rare occasion I'm in South Sac these days, it's only right to hit up one of the cajun seafood places. Even though The Boiling Crab is a solid choice as a seafood haven, my sister suggested that our group try one of the others, and since many of my Yelp friends seem to agree Firehouse is legit, we had to give this place a go. We came for an early dinner MLK day and were able to be seated immediately. We had the cajun garlic fries to start and several beers since it was $1 off during happy hour from 3-6. The fries were a little too oily for me but the four of us devoured it anyhow. We ordered shrimp, clams, mussels with the various sauces and my friend, the daredevil, got one pound of the mussels in 5th degree spiciness.I think the sauces are good, but I prefer the ones over at The Boiling Crab more. And while my two bags were made in 2nd degree, I could have done it in 3rd. Of course, everyone's spice level is different. This is coming from someone who can take a little bit of heat, but I warn you, 5th degree is basically torture. Once you put the 5th degree piece of seafood in your mouth, the area of contact will first feel numb then ultra-hot that you'll tear up. It seriously took me at least 5 minutes of cooling my mouth with ice water before I could even attempt to eat another piece of anything. And worse, the more the seafood sits in the 5th degree bag, the more spiciness will get soaked through the meat and it'll just get hotter. I think the third and last 5th degree piece of mussel I had was by far the spiciest. Our server, Joe, was extremely helpful during our entire time there. He gave us the lowdown on how to choose things on the menu and was always available to fill our cups with ice water when we needed it the most. I'm liking Firehouse and would definitely come by again.
<review# 421,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2012,6/8/2012,667,245,6,10,7>This is definitely an upscale place for Indian food. I used to go to Mati's all the time, but after eating here, I'm pretty sure I'll start coming here more often. I had a $20 voucher from Deal Ticket which I used for dinner and I also used the Yelp check in offer for a free order of samosas. Unfortunately, the waiter didn't tell us that we can't use both offers together until after he brought out the samosas...so I ended up paying for the samosas. No biggie though, the samosas tasted awesome so I didn't mind paying for it! The food was very flavorful and it all came out pretty fast.  Definitely some good quality Indian food! Between two people, we shared two orders of Garlic Naan, the Beef Madras, side of steamed rice and an order of samosas. Everything came out to be around $27.00. The portions were a good size! We even had leftovers to take home.
<review# 422,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2012,6/7/2012,582,450,7,9,9>What a great time by all!!Arrived to find our Yelp friends gathered around a private table in the back of the restaurant.  So happy to meet everyone, so glad to catch up.Marina was a fantastic waitress!!  Funny, witty and attentive.  We started off with a mimosa (or two) and decided on the Greek salad and tri-tip sandwich for lunch.  My Greek salad was huge!  Tons of mixed greens, various veggies, kalamata olives and feta.  The dressing that the salad was served with was fantastic!  I Greek dressing with a slight hint of pesto.  Shoe leather could have tasted good dipped in that stuff!  My husband had the tri-tip and asparagus sandwich, which came with chips, potato salad or fries (for an additional fee).  He loved the sandwich!A few people in our group tried the mixed berry pie and the apple-rhubarb pie served with vanilla ice cream.  Both pies were raved about and everyone who sampled them seemed to love them!We moved outside to sample a few of the wineries wines, a couple of whites and a few reds.  Jennifer was kind to offer information about the winery and about the wines.  A few of us moved inside to avoid the heat and to sample wines, while others moved to the bocce ball courts for a friendly game.  What a fun UYE!!  A great turnout, fun friends and good connections.Looking forward to the next time!!
<review# 423,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2012,6/6/2012,1059,313,7,18,13>I didn't read anyone elses reviews but I did look at the way most rated this place and I almost feel like I must be reviewing a completely different restaurant. I also feel so bad for most of you because my experience was definitely one worthy of a much higher rating. I was taken here for lunch and the place was not crowded at all. When I walked up to fix myself a plate I was super impressed with the huge variety and the fact that the food was presented so nicely at the buffet tables.  Stuffed crabs, tiny octopus which I found super interesting, crab meat, pork, fish, dumplings, rice, noodles, soups, salads... the list goes on and on. They even had sushi rolls which I normally don't  go anywhere near at a buffet but it looked so pretty that I just had to try it. It was ALL delicious. Whatever was supposed to be hot was hot, whatever was supposed to be fresh was fresh.  The food I had could have very easily been served to me by a waiter and I would not have known this was "buffet food".  This does not mean I don't know good food... it just means I know when something is better than I would have ever expected it to be.The plates that were used were promptly removed from our table, refills were immediately offered and I saw someone bringing out food all the time. I was really surprised that they served such nice food at a buffet place for such a great price and it is definitely a place I will continue to visit at lunch. So as far as buffets go this IS as good as it gets. Yeah, I said it! 5 stars good!
<review# 424,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/22/2012,6/5/2012,280,194,5,20,16>The new game in town for Banh Xeo, Vietnamese crepe. It's served with a very home made authentic dipping sauce and plenty of greens. The catch to this dish is that it's served with rice paper, like spring rolls, so you can eat it without the mess, when you roll and enjoy it. I love the Baby Clams appetizer with sesame seed chips.  They also serve a host of authentic vietnamese dishes sans pho and bun (wet noodles). Vietnamese coffee, shakes, beer, wine, and other desserts like flan are served here. The interior is clean and usually full. They do to-go orders. There are several large LCD screens playing Vietnamese music and videos through out the day. Service is better here than what you will expect of "most" Vietnamese restaurants. The chef behind the kitchen is originally from Ca Dao, which was my second favorite place to eat.  It's located off the Little Saigon grid, but not too far away. It hosts outside seating with tables and umbrellas.
<review# 425,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2012,6/4/2012,324,135,11,16,17>Elixir is full of surprises. First of all, if you don't have a keen eye, you're likely to miss it. It's not a hole in the wall, per se. More like a hole in a...parking lot. But of all the holy holes in the whole world, it's hole-acious!Erm. Let's try again.You'll find Elixir nestled in the cleavage formed by Old Ironside and Fox and Goose. While it may be small and dark and odd, it pleases. And surprises. Not necessarily by the set of beers offered on tap or bottled, or the traditional well, or the casual service. What really makes you take notice?The food.Yup. Late night grub, lunch and especially the weekend brunch. Someone back behind the swinging door knows what they're doing. From burgers and fries to eggs benny to something called "breakfast fried rice," all morsels have been tasty and satisfying. The home fries you get with morning fare--crispy potatoes mingling with green onion and red and green bell peppers--are particularly good.So check out Elixir. It may not look like much but it's a great little place to eat, drink and be surprised.
<review# 426,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2012,6/2/2012,193,225,54,24,21>Let me start this review with a lecture. Women, please don't "augment" your breasts. All breasts are beautiful. Small ones, large ones, medium ones. As a true lover of breasts, I would rather see God's creation than a doctors.That being said, there were a lot of doctor creations at City Limits Showgirls. Sigh.There were a few really amazing looking women there as well. The cover was 15 dollars on a Friday night when admittedly I had a few too many.That was good because they don't serve alcohol in there. You can however come in and out as you please, so make sure to stock your car with your favorite vice.They wanted 10 dollars for a lap dance, but most girls weren't working that angle. They wanted you to pay 50 dollars to go in the VIP room. The distinction is the VIP is fully nude + a lap dance.What do I look like, a mark?They run a special from time to time for 30 for two dances in the VIP room. While that was almost tempting, it seemed all the smoking hot non augmented girls were always taken first!See I told you girls! I'm apparently not the only one who feels this way.My friend and I spent a couple of his singles. I gave a girl with nice honest breasts a fiver and we called it a night.The best thing about it is I left a strip club with only spending 20 bucks.Not bad at all. The DJ also gave me a coupon for 5 off my next visit.Next time I'm wearing a shirt that says "I love real boobies"
<review# 427,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2011,6/1/2012,474,133,46,41,50>If the phone rang and it was the Secret Service on the other end of the line asking me to take Obama to lunch, I would take him for a BLT at The Shack. If I would have been left in charge of settling this summer's NFL players/ owners dispute, I would of have settled it over sandwiches at The Shack.If you told me you are Amish and on the last day of your rumspringa, I would take you to The Shack for one last sinful indulgence of a BLT with a side of steak fries. Unfortunately the Amish community has been a little slow to embrace Yelp as of yet so this scenario may be a little more far fetched than the previous two. I've enjoyed The Shack on quite a few occasions now, but realized a review is well overdue. Though almost everything on The Shack's menu sounds enticing, I just cannot seem to wean myself away from the BLT. On that note, the BLT is not on the weekend menu; hard to believe I know, but if you request it, The Shack will accommodate. What exactly is it that makes this BLT so special?1) The bread, a toasted "Shack Roll" that is pretty incredible in it's own right. 2) The bacon - always crispy and full of flavor3) The pickles - who ever heard of putting pickles on a BLT?  I now have trouble      accepting a BLT that doesn't have pickles on it. I've had a few strange looks      when making the pickle request at Beach Hut. 4) The steak fries - all the other sandwiches in this town want to offer you a bags of     Lays with your sandwich.  And we're not talking about typical shoe string type fries,     we're talking about thick and crisp steak fries that I cannot seem to get enough of.The Shack is hands down doing the best BLT ever. One could easily say a BLT is pretty basic so what separates one from another.  To that I acknowledge the simplicity of this sandwich and would say I am not exactly sure what the differences are, but the margin between The Shack's and the next guy's is quite substantial. Beyond the food, the crowds are interesting, the atmosphere is laid back and the old black and white photos of the East Sac from years ago are always interesting to look at. The only negative thing I could say about The Shack is that the arrival of the food can be quite slow. This place doesn't work very well if you have a limited lunch time and is best suited for a casual meal with an unlimited amount of time available.
<review# 428,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2012,5/31/2012,147,109,8,9,8>100th Review for you, 100th Review for me.  We were just meant to be!I recently moved around the area and I couldn't be happier with my new local Chinese food spot!  Now, I'm not a Chinese food snob- actually, the less authentic, the better.  If you told me PF Chang's was around every corner in Beijing or Shanghai, I'd be on board a non-stop flight by the morning.  Gosh, it's almost absurd how much I LOOOOVE American-Chinese food (Chinese-American?  Hardly). The lunch and dinner combo is just about as close as you'll get to dine-n-dash (without the thrill).  For less than $10, you get an egg roll, deep fried shrimp, fried rice, chow mein, choice of entree, and fortune cookie.  Are you freaking serious?  This combo can easily be split between 2 people; unless you're like me, I'll just eat the whole thing in one sitting and loathe myself afterwards.General Chicken and Mongolian Beef are my favorites.  Occasionally something in the General Chicken gives a gritty texture- it's not pleasant; and I wonder if it's corn starch or MSG or just something else.  Either way, I always specify "No MSG" whether I think they use it or not, and even then I've tasted that grit again.  Oh well, I guess you never know with these places.  All in all, I would recommend Golden Dragon for those random days you just want to lounge in front of the TV while stuffing your face with pan fried noodles~
<review# 429,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/31/2014,6/22/2014,450,173,20,30,27>Baagan - you make my heart happy, literally and figuratively!I don't know how I have managed to live in this town as long as I have and NEVER been to this joint!  That.stops.now.  The Sacramento area has a limited selection of strictly vegan/vegetarian restaurants so I try my best to patronize the ones we do have.  Baagan has been on my radar for a while, I just never made the time to trek out to Roseville and see what they had to offer.  That was a mistake.  Yes, I am admitting to a mistake, don't get used to it.First off, I absolutely love how welcoming this place is.  The atmosphere, the music, the staff.  Everything is so... vegan.  Not vegan as in, "I know something you don't know."  (snubs nose in the air)  More like vegan as in, "Love is life and life is fun.  Welcome to the playground."  (Bear hugs for all)There is plenty of seating.  Tables, chairs, comfy couches with books all about vegan stuff.  Oh, and free wifi btw.  The food appears to be mostly local and seasonal.  The menu changes according to the season, with a few staples.  They also have a nice selection of teas and other vegan treasures for sale.The food - oooh the food!  I couldn't decide what to get!  Sammich, wrap, soup, ice cream!?!?  I finally settled on a cup of Kitchari, which was perfectly spiced with Indian curry.  The Quinoa wrap, which was full of veggie goodies.  What a brilliant idea to add quinoa to a spicy chipotle spread for texture!  My sister ordered the Chana wrap, which I must try next time.  I have never heard of Chana beans before but they look tasty.  She confirmed, it was pretty much amazing.  Of course, I had to try something sweet, so I also ordered the Peanut Butter Cup smoothie.  Oh my... in my mouth.  The sunflower seeds... what a great finish they add to this already heavenly concoction of goodies.There is so much to say about this place, but I will try to limit my excitement and just say that I think I found a new favorite dining destination!  Yum yum yum!
<review# 430,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/21/2014,6/21/2014,317,342,15,14,16>Slap yo' money down and get that senorita bread!  Is it weird that you HAVE to order a minimum of 15 of these?  Yes, but have you HAD THEM???  They are a little bit bigger than pillsbury crescent rolls, so that means they are devoured in 3 bites.  Even if you only eat one (I don't know how that is humanly possible), share with your friends, family, coworkers, or neighbors.  Or even just set them aside, and throw them in the microwave the next day, they taste just as good.  Best way to describe it is they are soft, buttery, sweet, and slightly salty on the top.They have other items too, of which I can't remember all of them that my fiancee bought.  We would look at the case and ask what's that?  That's a pork empanada.  SOLD!!!  Chicken too?  SOLD!  What's that?  Fried banana rolls, SOLD!!!If you need to carb up for a race, Starbread will help.  If not, be the cool guy or cool girl that everybody likes in the office for bringing awesome treats like this.
<review# 431,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2013,6/20/2014,903,380,19,23,20>One of Sacramento's great parks!It's expansive and varying in amenities from the zoo, to softball fields, to a golf course.   I like running around it as the main park is just over 2 miles.  There are also various apparatuses for pull ups, dips, and who knows what exercise you can do to make it interesting.   Also interesting- bums do not make it down Freeport or Riverside from downtown to the park.  Clint Eastwood in Gran Turino ain't got nothing on encounters between Land Park get off my lawn folks  and bums.  Once a transient made it to about 6th Ave before an older lady came out of her house and shouted, "You don't belong here!!  What are you doing here?!? I am calling the police!", at him.  It's kind of like the sphinxes in Neverending Story.  If you have doubt whether you're a bum or not, travel down Riverside toward the park and see if the sphinxes open their eyes.  Basically, you have to be the Atreyu of bums to get to the park.  They are there, but they blend in and don't ask for money.  Did Atreyu ever ask for money?  No, I don't think so.  I wish to better utilize this park as I live very near.  I wish I had a dog to run around with this fantastic park.  Perhaps pick up golf.  Perhaps have happy hour at Mullgians.  Maybe someday.  Well, maybe not that last one.........OUT
<review# 432,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/2/2014,6/19/2014,433,220,20,25,20>I've been to Pronto enough times to say that I love them and they are one of my favorite eateries in town. When you go to a popular restaurant on the grid that offers inexpensive and good food, you can expect that there will rarely be an open table available and you'll have to take your meal to-go and eat, alone, in your sad little workstation that lunch breaks are meant to provide relief from. Not at Pronto; there is plenty of seating inside and out. Order at the counter and grab a table. On to the food then - my recommendations:Tuna Melt - I ordered this during my first visit, I don't know why, but I'm glad I did. If you like tuna melts you should give it a try. If you don't like tuna melts well then you're not a very fun person, are you?Palermo Beef Ragu - beef simmered with vegetables, Italian herbs and red wine demi glaze, served with soft herbed polenta and garlic bread. Perfect for dinner,  they also give you vinaigrette and olive oil at dinner with the softest bread. It's like pillows for your teeth. Farmers Market Salad - as you have probably already surmised from the other reviews, this is basically the best salad in the entire goddamn universe. I mean this thing is loaded. I love a good salad, but usually won't ever order one as an entree because I'd be starving within an hour, but a large FM salad is quite filling. Homemade cornbread croutons, dates, toasted almonds, avocado, tarragon dressing etc., etc,...come on. Breakfast - they serve it, and the coffee (Java City) is self-serve. I happen to like that because I'm usually waiting around for a refill everywhere else. Pro tip: right when you walk in, you will find laminated menus to your left; if there is a line, take this opportunity to decide on what you want before you get to the counter.
<review# 433,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/12/2013,6/18/2014,390,173,15,26,22>I keep hoping to find a Chinese restaurant that surprises me with it's dynamic flavors and quality product. The first time I ate at Blue Sky, I thought I'd found it. Ordering a phenomenal Mongolian beef lunch special, I couldn't believe the tender beef and richly flavored sauce. Served up with some crispy little wonton strips, a cup of soup, rice, and a small salad for only $6.50...what a steal!Maybe it's not such a great thing to have the bar set so high with the first meal. Our next few experiences would not live up to the hype. Finding the wonton soup to be very bland, I upgraded to wor wonton only to be disappointed again. A dim sum order of shrimp dumplings were absolutely disgusting with shrimp that had not been deveined and wrappers that had the texture and flavor of firm petroleum jelly.The Kung Pao Triple Delight was flavorful, but heavy on chicken and very light on shrimp. Scallops in White Wine Sauce sounded very promising, but also didn't deliver in the flavor department. I didn't feel that either of these dishes lived up to their $12 price tags. Plus they charged an extra $2 to add half a handful of mushrooms to the Kung Pao. Felt like I was being nickel & dimed on that one, but maybe I've been spoiled by my other Natomas spot where they never charge me to add the flavor punch of a few 'shrooms.On the bright side, the fried rice has always been very good, with more seasoning than most places. Egg foo young was better than average. A dish that was new to me and that I would recommend to lovers of spicy dishes is the Shredded Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce. My mouth was on fire, but it was tender and tasty. Or just stick with the Mongolian beef. It still impresses me and I'll keep going back for that.
<review# 434,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2014,6/17/2014,319,199,12,24,25>I tried the spicy tuna burrito and it was pretty damn great (albeit super messy). For $9 I got what looks like a gigantic sushi torpedo loaded with very large chunks of Tuna, lots of great crisp veggies and tempura shrimp along with some super spicy sauces. I like the concept here.... a mega sushi burrito that takes everything you love about sushi and turns it into a massive hand held meal, but the actual execution is a little bit rough. I don't think I saw a single person in the restaurant who wasn't finishing their meal with a fork. A burrito, no matter how messy should at least hold together. At the end of the day, I think this place is a great fit for midtown. I think most folks will agree that the quality and value of Wrap N' Roll blows traditional sushi out of the water (pun intended).
<review# 435,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2014,6/16/2014,489,900,19,28,24>I like it...I do. And, more importantly as far as lunch-time options go, Hubby likes it. This is important because he's the one who does the driving, and has to be motivated to drive beyond Natomas boundaries for lunch. Luckily for Giant Orange, due to a combination of an Amazon Local deal of $10-for-$20 and the fact that they have other choices (read: chicken sandwiches) besides burgers, Hubby doesn't mind having to drive allllllll the way from Natomas for lunch. I have to say, I look forward to lunch at Giant Orange for one reason; the ability to order their awesomely awesome Orange Creamsicle shake...hot damn, I love that thing. I'd be happy with just that concoction. But, I figure I'll add in some protein, and this time 'round I got the "Hangover" burger (and, no, not because I was hungover). That's just the moniker Giant Orange has given their burger that has a fried egg, grilled onions, and bacon atop it. Yummers!! Hubby looooved his "Mother Clucker" chicken sandwich, BTW. Anyway, we'll keep coming back. Good stuff :)
<review# 436,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/23/2013,6/15/2014,642,604,16,27,24>I enjoy trying new and different places.  The first time I had heard about the "Root of Happiness" was after reading Tiffany K's review.  Since then, I had kept it in the back of my mind and mentally book marked it as a "must try."   Then when Yelp friend Jim A. posted a UYE at this place, well, Joe K & I just had to set aside some time to make it out here!  It's a bit of a drive from where we live, but turned out to be well worth the trip!  When we first arrived, I noticed that the entrance was pretty unassuming; kind of like going to a dive bar in a strip mall.  The windows were tinted almost black, so the place looked closed, except for the fluorescent "open" sign out front.  But as soon as we opened the door, I could see that the interior was quite attractive, cozy, and well thought out in how it was decorated in an island/Polynesian theme.  The back ground music was sort of a mixture of new age and dance club.  Not that relaxing, but stimulating in an up beat way.  As we walked in, we were warmly greeted by the friendly owner who introduced himself and shook our hands!  He asked if this was our first time here, which it was, and proceeded to explain the concept of what this interesting lounge revolves around - the kava kava root!Instead of the usual bar scene, this distinctly new business offers a place to hang out, meet friends and enjoy stimulating beverages invoking alertness, yet relaxation with possibly feelings of euphoria.  While Kava is the star here, there are also a number of unique teas such as Kombocha, kava pastes, coffees and hot chocolate.  The owner recommended trying "The Sledgehammer" as a beginners drink as a way of getting used to it's taste and effects.  For $9.00, it is served in a bowl that looked a lot like miso soup, but the flavor was very different.  I found it to be an acquired taste and hard to describe.  After that first sip, I felt a mild numbing sensation on my tongue and throat.  Followed by a feeling of mellowness that actually alleviated some of the stress I was carrying from a long day at work.  Besides the two flat screen TV's over the bar area, there are also games like giant chess, giant Jenga, cards and even some musical instruments to keep any active minds stimulated and amused.  Otherwise, just sit back and relax in one of the bar stools, booths, or comfy sofas as our fellow Yelpers all enjoyed.  Joe and I were really impressed with this place, and plan to return very soon!  A big thank you goes out to Jim A, for planning this event and introducing us to the ways of the kava!  youtube.com/watch?v=NH8l
<review# 437,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/8/2014,6/14/2014,29,211,5,15,6>Land Park has been waiting for Vic's to open it's cafe for a while, and yesterday, February 7, 2014 was it's first day!  We strolled over to try it out this morning, a Saturday, and were surprised by how busy it was.  Kudos to them.Pour over coffee: 5 stars! Delicious, hand made coffee right in front of you. They use Temple coffee and are professionally trained to do it by the Temple staff.  They only offered the Guatemala beans today; it would be cool to see more than one option in the future!Latte: 1 star.  Sadly, it was a poor quality latte.  They have an excellent espresso machine, but this is proof that the machine doesn't make the drink.  See my posted photo; it looked bad and tasted worse, sorry!  The foam was lumpy and unattractive, the "latte art" concept was completely lost.  I've seen better presentations in lattes out of the back of pickup trucks in Kiev, Ukraine.  The espresso was definitely pulled poorly- it just tasted wrong.  Ok ok, it was day 2 of their operation, so I'll cut them some slack; they have some serious room to improve, and they probably will.  Good espresso certainly comes with practice, and they just don't have it down quite yet.Location: 5 stars! Land Park needed a quality coffee place.  It's walkable from the park itself, and easy to get to from Downtown or Midtown. Parking is plentiful on any of the residential streets surrounding.Decor: 4 stars.  The coffee bar is beautiful wood, well lit with nice tables and whatnot.  I don't mean to offend a local artist here, but the artwork on the walls looked like it was taken from an early '90s-era Motel 6.  Also, and this may be above their budget, but they have quite a unique space in this great building, let's see some of that awesome exposed brick hiding behind the drywall!!!  Baked good: 5 stars! Delivered fresh from Old Soul, I loved the oatmeal chocolate scone, and the pumpkin muffin was moist and dense.  So to sum it up, I recommend the pour-over, I would steer clear of the espresso for a while until they master it, and I love the space.
<review# 438,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/10/2014,6/13/2014,121,85,10,13,11>Ok so I'm not a Korean food expert, but this place was delicious.  My date was REALLY craving Korean food and she knows her Asian food too.  She gave this the legit "instagram post" thumbs up.  It's kind of out in a little complex, very quiet at night, but don't sleep on this little gem!  Ambiance:Very quiet, personal areas with tables in them kind of closed off keeping the personal vibe.  It was actually a nice place for a date.  The lighting was bright enough, the place felt clean, and temperature was perfect. Service:There was only one lady working and she was the cutest, sweetest Korean woman ever.  I'll come back just to see her, honestly, sorry mom, you got some competition!  Though she was the only one on the floor, she was very attentive to us an the other tables!  She gave ample time to order, refilled water, checked up on us and brought food out fast!Food:Like I said, I'm not a Korean food expert, but everything was delicious!  I let let my date order for us because I didn't know anything and she and the place didn't let me down!  PLENTY OF FOOD and variety.  Oh and let me say it not just Korean food on the menu, but it's definitely what they do.  Our table was full of little plates and our main dishes with an appetizer.  Yum!  My date was satisfied and got her Korean fix. Cost:Not too bad considering all that we ordered.  We also ordered a bottle of Soju (have too!).  Definitely was worth it (the food and the date! :P)Overall I would love to come back. It was definitely pleasurable experience with great food. Thank you!  I hope to see you again soon!
<review# 439,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2013,1/1/2014,562,500,47,51,48>With a name like Vampire Penguin I was kind of expecting to be served by people dressed as Vampire Penguins but was happily greeted by a couple of cute little snow angels instead.  One of the cute little snow angels immediately waited on us.  She was extremely patient and took her time explaining the whole ordering process to us since my girl friend and I just happened to be shaved snow virgins.I ordered a small mango shaved snow with condensed milk and topped with small chunks of strawberries.  Ida ordered honeydew with small chunks of watermelon for her fruit topping.  Since it was on a weekday and there was plenty of seating, we were able to order our shaved snow on plates rather than in styrofoam cups.The presentation was gorgeous.  They start with a bit of class by using these really nice looking square white plates with the corners curved up. The way my shaved snow was delicately stacked up in a large fluffy orange pink mound, the syrup was artfully applied across my plate, and the fruit was beautifully placed around the base of my most shapely mound of shaved snow made the incredibly wonderful flavors of this most delectable desert stand out even more.It was truly life changing.  I am no longer a virgin.
<review# 440,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2013,12/23/2013,195,127,9,12,11>This place to me is a friendly, long established neighborhood eatery in East Sac with a casual setting, It's a good place to go to if you're looking for a large selection of beers and for great affordable food. Most of my trips here have been during breakfast. Weekend breakfast is usually a busy time because it's so popular but I haven't had much trouble finding a table in the shaded patio where I can have my dogs with me. They are very dog-friendly and offer water bowls for the pooches. They are also kid-friendly and have buckets of chalk for the kids to doodle on the concrete. Food (Breakfast)-The food has been consistently delicious! They make great carnitas and twice now I have ordered a carnitas special - so fantastic. They smoke the pork then they cook it giving it a wonderful flavor. I recently ordered their special "Carnitas Benedict" served on a Telera roll ((bread that is soft, a lot like the Bolillo and used for tortas (Mexican sandwich)), with poached egg and Hollandaise sauce. My only complaint about it is that it disappeared too fast. The dish also came with a side of potatoes (cubed potatoes with a crispiness to them) that was one of the best I've eaten anywhere. Their coffee is good too- a bonus to go with my tasty breakfast!Service-Staff is attentive, helpful and friendly. We asked our waitress to pose in a picture serving our food and she accommodated us with a smile and no complaints. We were helped by several different staff members and they all had a good attitude.Tips-Parking is difficult. It's easier to find parking on the streets nearby then to park in the tiny parking lot. They have a bike rack with plenty of space to lock up your bike but it's pretty crowded during the weekends for breakfast. There's a menu item called "BBB" known as the hangover helper that comes with a red beer for only $8.95!! I haven't tried it because it's too early to have a beer for breakfast but it's a great deal.I love this place for breakfast and especially because of the wonderful patio where I can have my dogs with me.
<review# 441,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2013,12/22/2013,434,368,9,17,13>Hell yes! I fell in love with the cream puffs from Beard Papa's years ago in San Francisco and I am so excited that these puffs are finally available in Roseville. Located downstairs in the mall near Cinnabon, these cream puffs are a welcome addition to that mini food court area. Though a little on the pricey side at about $3 per puff, they're made fresh on the daily. In fact the puffs aren't filled with cream until you order it. The cream flavors also change daily, but chocolate and vanilla are always available. My favorite combos are:-regular puff with vanilla cream-chocolate puff with cookies and cream -cookie puff with chocolate creamService is a little on the slow side but they're new and probably working out kinks. These cream puffs are going to be the death of my diet!
<review# 442,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2013,12/21/2013,58,228,7,13,11>I had a good time at the Root of Happiness because I enjoy kava and a relaxed atmosphere, but a few additions could make this place stellar at all times (3.5 stars).I came out from downtown on a Friday night around 10pm and it was busy. I hate that drive and have no idea why this place is all the way in RC, seems way more like a midtown type of place (without the bro's). That said, it is easy to find on the south side of Zindandel with plenty of parking and a few signs in front. They are very welcoming, the server greeted me outside and opened the door. They can tell you everything you want to know about it, or you can read their menu. They have seating out front, diner-like booths, a few couches and a bar. The lighting is limited and focused, but I could easily read my paper at the bar. Relaxing downtempo music was welcome, but I'd have appreciated a few more island tunes/vibes. I loved the decor, south pacific without the tiki. The framed posters about various islands made me want to ask people to move so I could read them (I didn't).The price is right here, as Kava takes some time to make. I would have liked it stronger though, what I make at home puts it to shame. There were too many chairs at the bar, and these very rude, kardashian-drama filled ladies crowded me into a corner. Overall, there was plenty of space for the groups, but more interaction would be great, since Kava is a very social drink (more-so than alcohol). The giant jenga is cool, but was taken by the larger group on the couches.My service started out quick as the bartender got me a bowl. There were too many people for the two guys to handle all at once though. I'm sure staffing isn't an issue outside of weekends, but I just wanted to get out of there and had to wait 10 mins after I was ready (needed change). If I had wanted a refill (lightweight with the drive), that offer was 10 mins late as well.Overall, the Root is a sweet addition to our region. Go with some friends and check it out and try for a weeknight. You will really appreciate you went, as most everyone here has noted.
<review# 443,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2013,12/20/2013,1594,134,9,21,22>When the Sports Club of EDH first opened, about 8 years ago, we signed up and were faithful members for 2 years, then we "slacked-off" and stopped our membership. Fast forward to October 2013 and the opportunity came around to be selected for their "lean-up" program through my wife's job.  This was an 8 week intensive program that included intense workouts and weekly sessions to cover topics like nutrition, good eating habits, and various health related topics. I was in terrible physical shape, morbidly overweight and generally in poor health. So I looked at this program as a life changing opportunity. I sensed a genuine care and interest in my progress from everyone we came in contact with at the club. The trainers (Bridgette / Bryan) worked within my physical limitations but still challenged me through custom designed workouts, 3 days a week, and boot-camp type sessions twice a week. Once the program finished I was 25 lbs lighter and 12 inches thinner, and more importantly I feel better. Since then we've re-joined the club "officially" so we can continue our progress. I have a long way still to go, but I feel that this "lean-up" program was an awesome kick-start to a healthier lifestyle.
<review# 444,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2013,12/19/2013,206,100,15,16,16>Piatti is a great Italian restaurant, using local ingredients to make fantastic food, with amazing flavor. I have been here a few times since they had remodeled, and each time it gets better. On my most recent visit (and what really made this a 5 star review), I was with a group of 11 Yelpers. We all slowly showed up and met at the bar. I ordered a really spicy, nontraditional Bloody Mary that was made with fresh garlic, crushed red pepper, and olive juice. It was like a Martini/Bloody Mary. Different, but good.Once we all arrived, we sat at the table and the server Christopher went over the entire menu in detail, and answered any questions we had, along with being witty enough to keep up with Priya R.. Brian B. and I started off with a couple appetizers to split because they both sounded good. We ordered the fritto misto, and the pork and ricotta meatballs. The fritto misto had a semolina breading and a great dipping sauce. It also came with fried lemon wedges. Sounds funny but were super good. Like little mini tartlettes. The meatballs were also really tasty. They were served in a marinara sauce with melted mozzarella cheese on top. Both worth eating again. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich for my meal. It was really good! The espresso bbq sauce had amazing flavor, and the picked cabbage, jalapeno, and onion complimented it perfectly. This may be my new favorite sandwich. Christopher did an awesome job at managing our table. He was very knowledgeable, funny, and very proficient at keeping a group of 11 picky Yelpers satisfied. The manager, hostess, and bartender were all great at making us feel comfortable and welcome. I will be back again soon.
<review# 445,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2013,12/18/2013,410,518,9,17,13>Relaxing in the front patio for one of Sacramento's first HOT summer nights of 2013 for a friend's birthday.  It was 7:30 pm and the heat was not letting up.  We quenched our thirst with several bottles of Chardonnay and snacked on several small plates.  The wait staff was patient with our growing group of Friends.  Very accommodating as well.  They made sure everyone had waters and a seat at the long table. I felt like we were well attended too and never ignored. And they didn't kick us out immediately at the close.  They made sure we had waters and sobered up a bit.  The different bruchettas and flat breads were tasty, but pricey.  Since the fiance and I weren't able to drive anywhere, we ordered dinner here as well.  I had the mussels and he had the 3 chicken breast sliders.  Both dishes were well made and yummy.  Definitely a great experience with friends.  My only suggestion is that misters be put up or turned on when the Sacramento heat flares up.  I think that would make a great addition to an already amazing place.
<review# 446,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/28/2013,12/17/2013,136,120,14,14,16>I've been going to The Boiling Crab way too much (hence the Duke of BC, duh!) and so I believed that I should change things up a bit and give Firehouse a third chance.Oh my god!!! For some reason, it got much better! I order 2 lbs of crawfish (original, 3rd degree), garlic fries, and calamari.Crawfish: This time, it was on point. It was some yummy goodness indeed. The sweet asian cajun left me with a mild spicy kick with the right amount of flavor. Next time, I will grow a pair and get the 4th degree or maybe even the ALARM spiciness. It was their anniversary deal (buy one pound, get another pound for 1/2 off), which was an awesome deal.Garlic Fries: It did not disappoint. So much garlic goodness, it left my breath stinking for days.Calamari: Not bad. It had the right amount of batter and showed some good texture. It's something I wouldn't always order here though.Overall, I'm impressed. What's even more impressive is the service. Our server, Hong or (Hoang)? was a sweet girl who was very nice and attentive. She made sure our water cups weren't empty and checked up on us a lot. If you're reading this, you're AMAZEEEBALLSS!!!I believe it's time to become the duke of Firehouse Crawfish yes?
<review# 447,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/22/2013,12/16/2013,324,135,16,18,23>The superlatives for Firestone are many. Some of those may, and likely do, include the following:Best Beer SelectionBest Sports ViewingBest Bar FoodBest Selection of College-Aged WaitressesBest Place for Drinking Alcohol While StandingYeah, that last one cost a star. It's really not Firestone's fault--they're hugely popular--but I've avoided the place at times because I know getting a seat is harder than waking up a state worker at 2pm on a Monday.* Rim shot!I don't consider Firestone a restaurant by the strict definition. It's a bar or pub, really. And the food fits that level of quality. That's doesn't mean it's bad. It just means it's not Press Bistro or Mulvaney's. I like their pizzas, their nachos and even that Shaqramento-sized pretzel. For brunch, you can't go wrong with anything on the sweet side and, on the savory, just order the Benedict and close the menu.When it comes to drinks, there's beer. Lots and lots, small and large-sized, covering the spectrum from light and fresh to dark and sinister. And for weekend morning therapy, there's a bacon Bloody Mary that'll light a gratifying fire in your innards.Firestone does what it does well. There's a reason the place has been jammed packed since the day it opened. Which, ultimately, means the superlative that fits it best is Most Likely to Succeed.*Just kidding, state workers!
<review# 448,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2013,12/15/2013,432,335,20,22,21>Italian is one of my favorite types of food.  Pasta, pizza, panini, salad.  Yeah, they've got you covered.  I like this place.  Just as it is appropriately named, the Cali-Italian inspired cafe delivers its dishes "lickity split."  Which is a definite plus for me because when I'm hungry...well, it's not a pretty sight.  I morph into a mean she-hulk and the boys are like, "Uh oh, better get some food in your belly before you get hangry."  That's right.  You won't like me when I get hanggggrrrryy!!So  I've tried and loved most of the items so far:  1st visit:  Polenta fries.  Ohhhgawwd how I love these fries.  Especially with the balsamic ketchup and creamy Gorgonzola dipping sauces.  I am all over that.  Don't like polenta?  Then you won't like these fries.  GOOD, more for me :D. You must wash it all down with a Coloma Brown Ale by the way.  Perfect combo.2nd visit:  To go lunch order because The Boss lady ordered an impromptu staff meeting that afternoon.  Creamy Polenta bowl with a few fist-sized meatballs blanketed in Marinara sauce....meh.  Where's the bold robust flavor I was anticipating from the meatballs and sauce?  And why do I keep torturing my taste buds with bland creamy polenta?  I keep forgetting that I don't care for creamy polenta.  Ugh.  My co-worker's garlic fries were yum.  Bits of chopped garlic, parmesan and parsley were distributed well throughout the layers of fries and gave us both the STANK breath just in time for that dreaded meeting :P. Needless to say, we didn't have much to say at the meeting.3rd visit: Carribean salmon salad and a hard cider.  The Carribean salad was light and refreshing.  Just the type of meal I was hoping for on a warm Spring day.  It had mixed greens, seasoned spicy salmon, mango, red peppers, chopped pecans, bits of goat cheese and tossed in poppy seed dressing.  This really played with almost all my taste buds.  It was sweet, slightly spicy, crunchy and creamy with almost every bite.4th was takeout: Pronto BLT and Rosemary potato chips.  This really sealed the deal for me.  I'm a sandwich lover and the BLT was just delightful.  Yeah, I said de-freaking-lightful!  The panini bread was toasted just right, thick cuts of smoky bacon, sweetly acidic tomatoes, crisp lettuce and the basil aioli tied it all together very well.  Service has been great on each and every visit.
<review# 449,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2013,9/30/2013,129,87,19,14,15>Well slap my ass and call me Suzy! Where the hell has this place been and why have I not eaten here?!?!?I am literally writing this review as I'm still picking steak from my teeth because I just got done eating my sandwich. Graphic yes, semi-disgusting, maybe. You have to understand I normally wait a few days before I write a review unless I am A. Extremely pissed off/disappointed about something or B. I am thoroughly impressed with something. Let's go with Option B today shall we?Tidbit Catering & Gelateria. Now I always go to Devine Gelateria for my gelato needs, but I have always been curious about this place as far as food goes. I have today off so I really wanted a place I could walk to, and get my lunch fix on. Let's give Tidbit a shot as I am always rooting for the small biz folks.They have a pretty good lunch selection (I snapped a pic of my folded up menu). I really wasn't in the mood for pasta, but who doesn't love a good Philly cheesesteak am I right? Huh? Who's with me? Guy in the back with his hand up you know what's up!I got my order to go, and walked my happy arse back home since it's only a few blocks. Ok maybe my strides were quite large since I was hungry, but this isn't a contest ok! Got home and oh my my I was pleasantly surprised!My side was the Pasta Salad (I'm sorry I didn't even try it, it's still in my fridge I was focused on the sammy.) I'll update my review after I've tasted the pasta. The sandwich looked AWESOME!!! Now let's see if it tastes half as good as it looks. Took my first bite and sat for a second and literally said out loud "Holy sh!t." Went in for another bite, and thought this is a pretty damn good cheesesteak! The garlic aioli was zingy, the pepperoncini's gave a good kick, sauteed mushrooms and onions and the melted provolone. Hot damn that is a good sandwich! I know it's not an authentic cheesesteak or whatever, but seriously this is the best steak sandwich I've had in a really long time. The steak wasn't stringy, wasn't tough, AND the most important thing about a steak sammy.....when you bite into the damn sandwich all of the steak stayed in the sandwich!!! Enter Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah with chorus and all.Look I'm def going to give this place another go, because if this sammy is great, then the other stuff has to be good. Give this place a shot because I'm sure glad I did. The interior is bare but I could care less because it's not like I'm there for the edible wallpaper. The woman taking your order works her ASS off because she's taking orders, bussing tables, and serving! And I thought I could multi-task because I can type and blow my nose.
<review# 450,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2013,9/29/2013,451,183,13,14,13>Top of the muffin TO YOU!! God I love these muffin tops. No, not the one that sits nicely above my pant line on the waist, but the fresh baked blueberry and espresso muffin tops that are offered daily for only 80 cents. Oh mon dieu, I am in blueberry muffin top heaven as I devour not one, or two but three of these things per visit. I cant help it, I'm hooked!!!And then there's that blackberry pie, just staring at me from the display case, begging to go for a ride in the car, to my house, then right down my gullet, not stopping to chew. Ok, that's a little dramatic but practically spot on to what happened.My boyfriend actually ended up eating the whole thing, not me. I was lucky to even get a slice. But that slice tasted like heaven. No ice cream or heating of pie required. I saw a ton of bread selections there last time, and though I hate cake, am curious to try their cake by the slice. There are also cookies, doughnuts, mud pies, scooter pies, fruit pies and oh those muffins to choose form. I had the raisin bran muffin and it did not disappoint. If all you have ever had here is a doughnut or cookie- go back and get something creative.  Try a scooter pie. Or a pie pie. Then write a review of the yumminess that made your day!
<review# 451,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2013,9/28/2013,675,207,4,10,8>Love, love, love Karen's!Karen's is a great breakfast and lunch spot for the entire family!Karen's is located just below old Folsom near the Bike shop which is very convenient if you are a runner or advent cyclist for you can stop by Karen's and fuel up!Karen's is surprising pretty big with having both indoor and outdoor seating. When we first arrived (7:30am on a Saturday morning) we saw that there were about 5 other family's there already eating! We walked up to the counter took a look at the delicious assortment of muffins, and pastries in the window making my mouth just salivate!I grabbed the menu and the first thing that I saw was the Egg's Benedict, I'm usually not an eggs benedict fan but thought what the heck, and ordered it. My wife ordered the bacon and egg croissant along with 2 lattes.After about 10 minutes of waiting we received our meal and lattes. After just talking a look at my meal it was love at first sight! The Egg's Benedict was cooked to perfection and the home cooked potatoes we're a beautiful golden color! The Lattes came in these big tall glass type mugs which I wasn't a fan of but it worked. Our meal came to $30 for two meals and two lattes.Overall our experience was great and we will definitely be coming back! I can't wait to experience lunch here (soon, very soon).
<review# 452,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2013,9/27/2013,50,132,10,11,12>I fought for a long time with myself over whether or not I should write a review for Osaka-Ya. On one shoulder, my good conscience said, "Share with the world!" While my bad conscience said, "If you review it, they will come.....and then you will wait in even longer lines."Well this place deserves 5 stars and the world should know it. I'm so glad my friend told me about this place because the shaved ice is a-mazing! Whenever it's a million degrees outside, which in Sacramento is often, I crave Osaka Ya. The watermelon flavor is really good and you can get extra syrup for a few more cents. The portions are also very big. An extra small is perfect for one person ($2.25). The only downfall is the long wait for your order to come out, but I promise you it's worth it. I suggest you bring some water while you stand outside and wait for your order. Or you can go inside the small store and browse all the mochii and candy they sell.
<review# 453,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2013,9/26/2013,291,553,6,13,10>I visited Bacon and Butter on a Sunday morning around 9 a.m.  At that time, there were already several small groups waiting for a table, but luckily it was just my boyfriend and I and we didn't mind sitting at the counter (which we did not have to wait for.)My boyfriend and I decided on just sharing a couple of things.  First, we got the bacon and peach fritters ($4.50).  You get two in an order and the best part is that these are already made, so they are served to you instantly.  These fritters are kind of like donuts.  They have a surprising amount of bacon flavor to them and are worth a try.  I'm not sure if I'd necessarily get them again, but they were pretty good.  Definitely share the order.We also shared the biscuit, bacon, and gravy ($11).  The dish is pretty large for one person to finish, and it was a good amount for the two of us.  The biscuit is large and pretty much unremarkable compared to the rest of the dish.  You get your eggs done however you choose.  We went with scrambled.  Now, on to the more exciting parts of the dish.  The bacon is very good- I was sad that it only came with one slice, but it sure was good.  It had a good flavor to it.  The gravy was also really good because it had the bacon-y flavor/drippings to it.  I prefer bacon over sausage anyway.  'As for the service, it was very prompt and helpful.  The staff was friendly and the food came out in less than 10 minutes- I was impressed.Next time, I want to try out the pancakes.  They looked so fluffy!Notes:-They give you the check in an old book, which is cool.  Feel free to sign the pages and leave your mark!
<review# 454,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2013,9/25/2013,206,100,11,17,17>Great little ice cream shop. Close to my home and serves Gunther's ice cream. I stop here pretty often with my daughter on the way home from kindergarten.I am so happy this place is here. Located in the F/65 shopping center, near the Folsom Blvd. entrance. Now I don't have to drive all the way to Franklin Blvd. to get good ice cream, and fruit freeze from Gunther's. They also serve Hawaiian shaved ice, with several flavors, sundaes, custom ice cream cakes, and lots of of homemade novelties which include; chocolate dipped cheesecake, chocolate covered cherries, nutty cones, and several more. Really not a good place if your on a diet.  Everything is so good! My personal favorite is the salted caramel ice cream, and my daughter loves the birthday cake ice cream.The staff is always very friendly, and helpful. They will let you sample a few item before you decide. They have a punch card, for each visit over $2.00, you get a punch . After only 5, $2.00 visits you get a free scoop! Try to beat that. It's hard to not find something to get. It's only hard to decide on one item. The only bad things I can say about this place is that the water cups are tiny (they will give you a big cup if you ask). There seating is limited when really busy. They do not have all the Gunther's flavors, but they do have what I like. I really like this place, and you will too. They have a 10% off check in special.

Let me explain:You know how you have that one cousin who's perfectly nice but boring? He lives in a cookie-cutter house in a cookie-cutter suburb and, whenever you visit, you just watch reruns of CSI and Two and a Half Men? Yeah, that cousin. He's Chipotle. Now think about that artist aunt of yours. The one who lives in a beach house, makes art with shells and driftwood, zip-lined through a rain forest and once wrestled a pygmy in New Guinea(she won.) She wears colorful hats and neckerchiefs and always has a new dirty joke to tell you. Hello, Freebirds!This is no knock on Chipotle. But Freebirds offers so much, for the same price, and gives you the choice to make your selected dish your own work of art.Example: the burrito bowl.For under $7, it's twice the size of Chip's. I got to choose between cilantro-lime or Spanish rice, white or dark meat chicken or a mix of both, one flavor of cheese or a combo of jack and cheddar, refried, black or whole pinto beans. See where I'm going here? And I haven't even touched on the 10 to 15 free add-ons. I had them slice up some fresh avocado for me, too. It's extra but worth it for the additional health and flavor punch. Delish! To top it all off, Freebirds has a free do-it-yourself hot sauce bar that allows you to put the finishing touch on your masterpiece. I went ape shit on it.So there you go. You make a lot of decisions in your life, day in and day out. Maybe you don't want to think too hard about your burrito or nachos. But, given a choice, why not? Isn't it the little things that make life better?As that beautiful, crazy aunt might say, "You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough."
<review# 456,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2013,9/23/2013,136,120,29,39,30>Watch out Lao's Kitchen! This new spot called "The Spot" is close to winning the King of Lao's food on my list! This hidden gem is located far within the plaza of where Stevie Boy Burgers resides. This place can easily be missed if not for the big sign shown on the street side of Stockton Blvd. If driving north on Stockton Blvd, you will need to make a U-turn to get into the plaza.  Considering how bad traffic can be on Stockton Blvd most of the time, I recommend turning into Lotus Casino and then turning out. It will make your life much more easier (Just don't plan on gambling instead). As soon as you enter the plaza, you will need to drive all the way in to find that spot.Once entered, there is a full bar on the right with endless amounts of alcohol and to the left will be the tables. This spacious restaurant is painted in a black/purple theme, much like the theme of our beloved Sacramento Kings! Our server seated and greeted us quickly within time of the menu and specials. We ordered the Kasoy, Papaya salad w/ 5 peppers, fried wings, and Thai Tea.Kasoy - Every bite gave an extravagant burst of flavor. The flat-bed rice noodles were smooth and silky, the soup was hot and spicy, the meat (both the beef balls and ground beef) was tender and juicy. This tasty wonderful noodle soup was the highlight of this place.  If you never had it, it's much similar to a bowl of Pho but with tons of more flavor.Papaya Salad - You will be asked on how many peppers you would like. I would recommend between 5-6 peppers for the spicy goodness, but if you're a hot little spicy daredevil, I would ask for more. I'm not really fond of papaya salad's in general but I thought it was pretty good. Some other expert in this papaya salad field may explain it better than me.  This salad was a bit fishy tasting due to the copious amount of fish sauce, but by adding a few squeezes of limes, I think it will taste even better. Nonetheless, this salad surely kicked my ass, spicy-wise.Fried Chicken - I was planning to order the stuffed fried chicken, but they ran out of the stuffing so I ended up with plain fried chicken! The fried chicken is mediocre to me. I will review it again when I get my stuffed fried chicken next time.Thai Tea - A must get when you order the Kasoy. It's like both the Kasoy and Thai tea are meant for each other. You wash that hot and spicy flavor from the Kasoy down with this icy cold sweet tea. Don't ask about it and just get it! Overall, this place definitely hits the spot (no wonder why it's called "The Spot"). If you're going out with a big group, come here for lunch/dinner. This place would be perfect for a guys or girls night out as there are TV's and drinks. Trust me, the food here is quite addicting.

There are a few Asian food "delis" and a cafe seating area inside if you're starving and need hot food ASAP.  They also have a few small businesses within - travel, cell phone, boba shop, Chinese herbs & tea, oh, don't forget to stop by the bakery for a sweet treat!  Prices are average.  It's pretty much a one stop supermarket.
<review# 458,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/14/2013,9/21/2013,1594,134,5,13,17>Hands down the best chocolatier in Nor-Cal and possibly all of California. We've been following Ginger Elizabeth's confectionery career since she was the pastry chef at the Masque restaurant in El Dorado Hills, many years ago. ( In fact the desserts were the best thing about that now closed restaurant ). We've done chocolates for special occasions, ordered cakes, macaroons, and desserts, and now try to make it down for each of the "specialty" Ice Cream Sundaes they are doing during the Summer months. They are simply amazing ! We always bring our out-of-town visitors who have an appreciation for fine chocolate and they tend to agree with us, about how fantastic this place is. It's great to see a local chef make good, and I'll predict we'll be hearing a lot more great things about GEC as they progress.
<review# 459,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2007,7/4/2007,106,184,1,9,5>This is the best meal I have had in years.  Well, at least since I first tried Waterboy.  I do think Mulvaney's is a serious contender to Waterboy and when my parents come to visit I will suggest Mulavaney's for dinner, instead of Waterboy.  As Sarah S said, this is no star inflation.  It is the real deal.  Everything presented to our table was well presented and had an absolutely fresh and crisp taste.  The waitress was awesome.  She was the best combination of helpful, polite, and engaging, but gave us our space.  The wine was excellent, the smoked salmon melted in my mouth, the halibut was buttery and each side delicious.  The beans were so good that I didn't have a child-like reaction and gag when I ate them.  In fact, I ate them all.  The small green salad was hoovered in no time.  Of course half of my experience was two wonderful dining companions, who were amenable to tasting each others plates, and to split two wonderful desserts.  A banana flambe with a rum sauce and ice cream and the upscale version of a ding dong.  I do love the fact that Mulvaney's is respectful of seasonal produce and ingredients and understands that food tastes best when they are in season.  The menu changes daily as certain ingredients are available.  My enviro-guilt was appeased by this fact and I was set as ease immediately and could truly enjoy my meal.

They also had milkshakes in great flavors like banana and peanut butter.  They also bring the food to your table right away.  I know this because the french fry burnt my tongue. Sitting outside on picnic tables are nice too.

Only bummer is that they close for a couple of weeks for Xmas which makes my relocated friend from Seattle whine when she comes to Sac once a year and can't get her milkshake fix . . . I guess if I were more thoughtful, I could freeze one for her - but I doubt I would be able to keep my grubby little hands off.

Not really, I go willingly anywhere I can get a drink easily that's cheap. I like the Old Tavern because wether you are at the bar or a table or whatever there is a lot of ROOM. That seems to be what I like in bars, a little elbow room and cheap drinks. The only place that there isn't any room is the bathroom stall, which is good  because if you start to get drunk & you are leaning the wall is right in front of you to keep you upright on the toilet - now if you lean sideways you are on your own.There are pool tables, dartboards, a big screen tv but I don't know what makes it a casino.. I don't gamble anyway. The bartenders are nice which is always well nice. At the end of the evening there was also a "band" in the parking lot, it was a cool way to end the evening. "Pregnant Again" was probably my favorite song. Just a fun place to visit all the way around.
<review# 464,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/19/2007,6/27/2007,23,110,4,2,3>First off, I should mention that this place is not very good for vegetarians.  Almost all of their dim sum has some sort of dead flesh in it, and they only have 2 or 3 other dishes without meat in them.  (I must mention that my roommate loves their dim sum, and she's somewhat of a food connoisseur, but I've never actually had any of 'em myself.)  If you're averse to eating flesh, stay away.The decor is a funky mixture of slightly sleek and stylish with a massive dose of 1950s run-down coffee shop diner.  The fish tank near the entrance is musty and inspires suspision about the cleanliness of the kitchen.  The staff is very attentive and quick, although fairly curt with the customers.Even though I've not eaten any meat for over 15 years with the exception of two Rocky Mountain Oysters (bull testicles) just to say "yes, I've eaten them" about 5 years ago, I frequent the place for take out since they're very close to my house, and they're very, very cheap.  For about $12, I get three meals worth of greasy fried stuff that always hits the spot.  The food I always get isn't great, but isn't bad.  However, it gets extra points since it's so very cheap.The place reminds me of an ex-girlfriend - it's funky, not very good for me in the long run, but I know exactly what to expect from them, it occasionally hits me just in the right sweet spot that I like, and its...uh.. cheap.
<review# 465,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/19/2007,6/26/2007,75,26,4,5,5>The review before me literally took the words straight out of my mouth.  Ditto on the mashed potatoes and the gravy.  I order that every time I am there.  This is also another place where you're bound to bump into someone you know.  The line gets long at noon and extends all the way around the restaurant in a shape of a "U".  But the line moves rather quickly as it is a buffet.  And waiting in line never gets boring because all you have to do is turn to the opposite direction and you'll notice a friend standing in line right behind you!  So you say hi and make a little small talk, which makes time go by fast faster.  Make a little small talk to those who are already seated chowing down their meal.  If you're standing near the entrance, you will most likely see yet another person you know entering the restaurant.  This place seriously feels like a reunion.Not to sound sexist, but I usually see a lot of men dining at this place.  Originally I thought it must be the buffet's daily serving of carved roasted meat for men to boost their testosterone levels? *shrugs shoulders*  Or maybe the place is actually that good and that it also reminds one of a traditional home-cooked meal.Here are their Daily Specials as i have the menu in front of me:Monday: Salisbury Steak with Mash Potatoes (recommended)Tuesday: Lasagna (bleh)Wednesday: Beef Stew with Rice or Mashed Potatoes (haven't tried it yet)Thursday: Meat Loaf with Mashed Potatoes (decent)Friday: Lasagna (double bleh)Served Daily: Spagetti with MeatballsAll specials come with bread and butter and are $7 for a full plate.  You can also order a half plate for half the price, which is usually enough for me.
<review# 466,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/30/2007,6/25/2007,22,12,1,3,4>I am so glad that my friend dragged me to this establishment about eight months ago against my will. Their food is delicious and something that my stomach can handle at lunchtime. Mostly all dishes come with pita bread and a salad. My favorite dish is the Chicken Sumac which is chicken in a pita with an orangy colored sauce and sauteed onions (yumm...yumm...yumm) which is to die for! It comes with a little hummus and a tabbouleh salad. FYI-you might want to ask for more pita bread on the side to dip into your hummus. I have also ordered their steak pita and their curry which were rather tasty as well but I think I am hooked on that Chicken Sumac. I have heard that they have belly dancing on Saturday evenings and can't wait to go check that out some time.  The restaurant is small so I can't imagine how close those belly dancers actually get on a Saturday night, but I have only gone there for lunch and it's definitely cozy during those hours. The service is good (they aren't overly friendly but you get your drink refills on time which is important on my list). Definitely should be on your "Should try out" list.

Get your butt over here."Oops.  I forgot that we were going to the Old Navy in Roseville, located across from the Galleria mall.  Oops.  Well, first off, I can't be seen here since I'm not white.  Secondly, I NEVER venture to Roseville because my ex lives out here and  there are just some people I choose not to be friends with for the rest of my life.  Third, ugh ugh, I realized why I'm never here: talk about lack of diversity and animosity toward single people who are not married-have no kids-and don't drive an SUV.  I think my sister and I were the only Asians on the road and with no kids.I pull into the parking lot and am immediately in danger of being sideswiped by some blonde soccer mom driving a humongous SUV and she swerves right in front of me.  She's doing this, while yakking on the phone with her bleach blonde stripes-like-skunk hairstyle is whipping around her over-tanned wrinkled arms and a set of three children in the back seat holding on for dear life with their Demon-ride-like over the neck straps.Old Navy is perfect for people on the run.  The clothing is cheap, some are stylish, and wearable as coordinates under other fine types of clothing.  I've been able to procure a simple white cotton t-shirt ($12.50) here and wear it underneath a suit.  My workout shirts are all from Old Navy....my current fave being a slightly sheer Grey T-shirt that says Chicago across the front of it, purchased from the clearance racks for $4.99.Yesterday I was not really in the mood for much browsing, but did locate a great bright yellow cami that actually looked okay on me and managed to cover my fuller-than-most-Asian front.  I'm not a great supporter of stripes, but they did not make me look bloated like a killer whale.  $14.50 and I was out the door.  I've been to several Old Navy locations and have to say, that this location is by far the cleanest, which makes for an easier time for perusing.  Even my finicky sister had a good time clothes browsing and left with a screened T-shirt for $12.50.

It's cool hearing stories about origin, flavors, brewing styles, etc.On my last visit, the crowd was diverse and positive vibes filled the room. My fellow yelpers and I sampled some tasty treats (big ups to the Pulled Pork Sliders, Nachos, and French Dip), listened to some smooth beats, and suffered through a not so funny comedy act.  The coolest moment of the night was when a young kid rocked the mic with some serious beat-boxing skills. Trust me when I say: SKINNY WHITE BOY HAD MAJOR BEATS!!! Then, as if he wasn't cool enough on his own, two brothas joined in and dropped some smooth lyrics.  Moments like this aren't easy to plan or replicate. I'm so happy I was there to experience it.

It was a drink and appetizer in one! Bartenders definitely know what they're doing. Plus the fact that they had blue cheese olives...(deep sigh) life is good.Parmesan fries and jumbo prawns with BBQ creole sauce were great starters. After that, we had two MORE starters....Hubby had the clam chowder that was pretty damn good and I had the wedge salad. Surprisingly, I didn't finish the salad. It was huge and enough for two. Plus I needed to save room for my entree.I had the hazelnut-crusted halibut and Hubby had the 12 ounce fillet. Both were prepared perfectly. Hubby likes his steak double char rare which not all restaurants execute very well. His steak was delivered charred on the outside but pink and warm in the middle. Exactly how he likes it. Not an easy feat!Couldn't squeeze in dessert after all that feasting, but the dessert menu looked to have a smattering of mouth-watering temptations that will get some attention next time.The focal point of the room is the wine 'obelisk' which is a glass circular column located in the middle of the dining room that invites walking around it to see the wines available. Kinda cool.Service was very good and B. our server was incredibly attentive, knew the menu inside and out and offered some good suggestions.Parking was a little bit of a challenge since there was a Sutter Street event going on that evening. But alas, we had parking karma and snagged the last spot in the garage located directly beneath the restaurant.I hear the burger they serve at the bar is amazing. Can't wait to go back and try it. I have a feeling I'm gonna be a regular here!

THE SIT-REPI have always loved JACK'S URBAN EATS because they make some of the best meat-carved sandwiches - Steak or Chicken sandwiches, all made to order.  But of late, I have been making "feinted attempts" to eat better and Jack's has some ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SALADS!   STEAK SALAD = NOT AN OXYMORON HERESteak salad and a particularly spicy buffalo chicken salad if you request it.  So when my "lovely former spouse" (she pays me to say that) blitzed in from the North Carolina Reich this past weekend, she called me and said she wanted some "face time".  (Actually, it was a fun time catching up).THE FAREShe's become a vegetarian (good for her), whereas I still consume the flesh of helpless domestic livestock on occasion.  Jack's has a very clean, compartimentalized food preparation environment that permits the wonderful creation of completely vegetarian selections (with utensils and items that do not come into contact with meat), such as their huge salads and a delicious grilled PORTABELLO MUSHROOM SANDWICH that we shared along with a meatless CAESAR SALAD.In the past, I have gotten the aforementioned steak (almost a decent tri-tip like cut if you ask me) sald, and also chicken added to my Caesar Salads and have also gotten their SPICY BUFFALO CHICKEN SALAD (which is my fave salad).  But previous trips to Jack's I have also gotten the CARVED TURKEY SANDWICH which is absolutely delicious when served with sandwich trimmings that make you feel like you are celebrating Thanksgiving any time of the year.And did I mention the GARLIC and CHEEESY MASH POTATOES and other delicious VEGETABLE SIDES?  Mmmmmmmmm.....So the total bill, including her BEER (she considers that a perfectly acceptable vegetarian item, but I ask you, is "yeast" vegetarian?), was no more than $20.  NOT BAD for a DELICIOUS DINNER FOR TWO in MIDTOWN SACTO!THE LOWDOWNNice.  Classy.  But not too pretentious and not at all expensive!

That crunchy French bread, the garlic-y spread I can't quite put my finger on, and the  brie-- Oh the warm, gooey, brie.  The shrimp bisque, if eaten alone, could have been considered salty, but with the sandwich, oh no, it was perfection.  Sometimes, I think about Chez Pont's sandwiches before I go to bed and those nights, my friends, are the best nights of sleep.
<review# 473,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2010,3/17/2011,464,293,5,18,11>One of the most frustrating features of the Midtown food scene in the last few years has been an influx of restaurants who didn't seem to understand what Sacramento really needs. Take the sushi craze that so many Yelpers have joked about: yes, sushi is awesome and we are blessed with some great spots, but that market is saturated. We don't need more crazy sushi rolls! So, while I commend anyone for endeavoring the labor of love that a restaurant truly is, I feel bad as someone who has a sense of what Sacramento needs when I see these spots open up that are clearly doomed.The owners at The Press clearly have their heart to the slow pulse of our little burg. I could not think of a more perfect addition to the Sacramento nightlife. Gourmet snacks at a reasonable price in a non-stuffy, open, fresh space. On my first night there I took my younger sister who just moved back to Sac from San Diego. I was proud that Sacramento could offer a classy, laid back little spot like this because San Diego is swarming with them.They have about 9-10 tapas on the menu, and sell a "4 tapas for $10" offer. We sat on the patio at 9 PM the other night, relishing the warm summer air, sipping martinis, sangria and a ginger julep while snacking on some tasty little snacks. Very $10, you aren't getting a ton of food, but you are getting a damn good sampling if you just want a nibble (and let's be honest, when do you NOT want a nibble?)Along with the tapas, we shared the fried pork belly. It was crispy and flavorful, served with fresh nectarines for a summery take.The owners are David England, previously mentioned by other Yelpers, and his partner, an attractive and spirited young woman whose name is escaping me. They were actively involved in our dining experience, asking us what we thought and offering recommendations. Our food server was quite friendly and attentive as well. I think this is my new favorite spot.
<review# 474,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2010,3/16/2011,642,604,7,15,10>We decided to have dinner here one Thurs evening. This restaurant is usually busy for lunch. But Folsom Blvd. gets pretty sparse on traffic during evening hours and weekends. We thought this would be a good time to try this place out, since there was only another couple dining. The dining area looked well maintained and spacious. We were seated immediately.  The menu had a nice variety of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes. We selected the sauteed shrimp with vegetables & cashews, and a vegetarian crepe (ban xeo) that had some of the best tasting tofu and bean sprouts stuffed into a large, fluffy, yet crispy egg omelet! Lettuce, mint and a dipping sauce accompanied it.  A side of steamed rice came with our food. Everything was very tasty! The portions were adequate and satisfying. The prices are a bit higher than some other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, but not a big deal as long as the food is good! Our waiter was nice, on the ball and helpful in assisting us with questions about our selections. Even though the restaurant was pretty empty for dinner, there were several patrons who stopped by to pick up "to go" food.   As we ate, we were trying to remember what this restaurant was called way back when. Then my boyfriend exclaimed "Sambos!"  Boy was that a long time ago! I liked eating here and hope to return again soon to try more of their dishes.

I was a bit tipsy by that point...Speaking of which: does it make me a total alchie that my favorite part were the booze vendors? I was getting refill after refill of that amazing chardonnay from the Winters vinyard (forget their exact name), he was just looking so lonely over there! And the award-winning beer guy, filling up my glass to the brim with Pilsner... thanks, dude!Was great to say hi to some of my favorite yelpers--hi, Betty, Tiffany, Michelangelo and Minh!

But it's an honor just to be nominated (as an Elite member).And I just wanna say, boo to all the people who have referred to this as some "exclusive" party; I think this event really represents, as Alex said when he was giving out the awards, the kind of community we're creating here.

<review# 476,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2010,3/13/2011,70,158,3,14,8>We went here not expecting much, but I'm sad to say that I sorta like this place more than Petra. I know! It's sorta crazy but this place has it's pro's and con's. First off we saw a sign for Cafe Europa with an arrow pointing to the left. The actual restaurant is near the pet store. It was empty when we got there and no one ever walked in while we were eating. Walking into an empty restaurant says a lot in my opinion, but I was wrong. Didn't know what I wanted so I ordered the Supreme Beef Pita. It had mostly everything in it like Petra's pita: Tomatoes, fries, lettuce, onions. We also ordered Greek fries and Baklava.The Greek fries are the best! It has some sort of seasoning, lemon, herbs, and feta. It is sooo great, better than the Petra fries... Sorry! :( The feta here were slightly melted compared to Petra's and I just love the added lemon.The Baklava wasn't as good as Petra's though. It was okay, but I think if it was fresh it would've been awesome. Keeping it in the frige made it hard. I don't blame them for trying to keep it refrigerated, but it's too bad it ruined it's texture and taste.The pitas were really great. They give you a lot of meat and you almost feel overwhelmed by all the stuff in it. I ended up eating the stuff falling out and making it slimmer. How am I going to complain about too much meat!?The service is very attentive and nice. He gave us refills and asked us how everything was. No complaints there.I would definitely go back here again. I love how it's around the arden area, because it tends to be just fast food and burger joints. It's too bad that the restaurant is hidden because I think people would go here more. Petra is very modern, in midtown, and open late. I think that's why people dig it so much. This place is just as great for their pitas and greek fries. Both places have small differences but are both great.I think people should spread the word about this place!

My expectations for sushi are really high and I did not think Izumi would meet it. Boy was I wrong!No one warned me that one roll would be so large. I was pleasantly surprised when my two rolls came out. I swear, I have never seen such mammoth pieces of sushi. And that's every roll they have. Even the California rolls are huge! You know, I really love sushi but I hate that it's so expensive and that I never feel full from just one roll. But at Izumi, the rolls are half off (all the time) and the rolls are twice as big (so that's like 300% more for your money, right??)I ordered the HP roll and the Monarch roll. The Monarch roll has seared tuna, avocado, and salmon on top. It was a very yummy, saucy, more savory roll than the typical. I think the semi-cooked nature of seared tuna gives it a more savory taste. I really enjoyed my HP roll. One look, and I fell in love. It was a large roll and everything inside of it was raw, fishy goodness. Other than the rice and seaweed, I think it was all fish. Not only was the roll totally and completely worth my $7, the spicy tuna was perfect and not too spicy. The salmon on top of the roll was soft and to my liking. Even though my mouth wanted more, my stomach told me no. I ended up taking half of one roll home. I was thoroughly full after the meal but our server Candy was so sweet that she gave us each a mochi ice cream for after dinner dessert.Izumi was definitely a win in my book. The food is affordable and tasty. The workers are sweet and fun. I would definitely love to come back soon!
<review# 478,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2010,3/11/2011,222,180,10,11,10>My first visit to Lucille's was a fluke. I had just attended orientation for my program at school, which had extended two hours beyond what I had quoted to my driver. Indebted to his patience, I allowed him to elect our dining venue -- and Lucille's it was. A year and several five-star visits later, this place is still as finger-lickin' good as the first time. The Americana decor is cliched, but the detached patio seating and loud live performances blur the chain-y ambience. On even the busiest of nights, I've been seated within 15 minutes, but I can't attest to the average wait for larger groups. All of Lucille's eats are pretty true to the soul food/BBQ formula, and the helpings are collosal. I recommend the Southern Fried Chicken Sandwich and the Jambalaya "Me-Oh-My- A." Spicy and decadent.
<review# 479,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/25/2013,5/30/2013,136,157,11,14,11>My daughter is here celebrating a milestone birthday (no, I'm not telling you which one, I know some of you have good enough math skills to solve for 'x' and figure out about how old I am..none of your damn business, that's how old) and wanted to get her first tattoo (ok, so she's obviously over 18) My fabulous boyfriend took her  to a few places around town and looked at pictures, checked prices, talked about process (because of mom's healthy respect for blood-borne pathogens) and she wisely chose to come to American Graffiti. Sam was the nicest of all the people she talked to and really took the time to listen to her ideas, and had great suggestions on creating a unique design that reflected her personality. Upon returning the next day (today) Sam was available and took a few minutes to set things up for her. I should mention that she's in a wheelchair and needed some  accomodations, Sam again used his creative skills and worked out the best scenario for her comfort.90 short minutes later she has spectacular artwork she adores permanently adorning her right leg. The colors are fabulous and the size is exactly what she was looking for. After care instructions were provided in writing, and some helpful tips  were given while he gave me time to take photos prior to bandaging.Added bonus:While I was waitiing, one of the gentleman who works there came in from the street with a man in tow. He took him to the counter and explained to Chris (I think that's the name I heard) that he needed help, he thought the man was deaf  but was pretty sure he needed help making a  phone call. Chris (I think) patiently communicated with this man through notes and hand gestures, called a friend for him, let him know the address and that the man needed a ride. Kindness and patience go a long way with me, watching this scene unfold told me everything I need to know about the character of the people in this establishment. Needles to say (see what I did there? mispelling needless to needles? pretty clever, huh!) I will get my next tattoo here, as well as recommending this place to anyone who asks.
<review# 480,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2013,5/29/2013,102,307,6,12,9>This review is only for the teppanyaki grill side of the restaurant. The other side has a sushi bar and regular tables, I assume with a more extensive menu, which we did not try. I had the day off with my sons since their daycare was closed and my mom wanted them to come visit her office and go out to lunch. She thought they would get a kick of having their food cooked in front of them and had come here before and felt it was good. When we arrived at about 12:15 they said it would be about a 15 minute wait for a grill table. We were not in a rush, so we decided to wait. It ended up being a little less than 15 minutes. They seated us right in the middle of our table, with highchairs and boosters for my kids and then placed two couples on the ends of the table. We then waited again for our order to be taken, starters to come out and then our chef to come and cook. This is not a place to come if you are looking for a quick lunch, or maybe skip the grill and sit on the regular restaurant side. Once the show got started, my boys were entralled with the fire and steam and fancy knifework that is typical for a Japanese steakhouse. Our chef was pretty entertaining and the food was plentiful and tasty, also very affordable at lunchtime. I got the seafood combo, which came with soup or salad, fried rice and had a good size calamari steak, three scallops and five shrimp all for $11.99. I thought that was a good deal, even better my mom got the filet mignon for the same price. My boys split the chicken yakisoba (sort of like chicken chow mein) and a side of scrambled eggs and it was so much food that we took a huge box home. Probably for my toddlers (3 1/2 and 1 1/2) they would have been good with just the scrambled eggs and fried rice.My main criticisms of this restaurant would be the wait and some cleanliness issues. While we were waiting to be seated my younger son tried to lift their blinds to look out the window and the window sill was covered with dead flies and lots of dust and dirt. It was pretty disgusting. Plus, walking back to the bathroom, the unused grill tables, while cleared of plates seemed not to have been wiped down as there was bits of food still on them and it wasn't like they were in the process of being cleaned. They did not have a changing table in the restrooms either for little ones still in diapers. Changing a kid on the floor of a bathroom is never pleasant. All of that said, the food was all very tasty and filling and the price was right, especially if you compare it to their chain competition, which I find to be exhorbitantly expensive. For the four of us, with food leftover, it was about $50 with sodas and juice. Considering that it was basically lunch and a show, that is a good deal. Where else can you get a complete steak meal for under $12 and have it be decent?

<review# 482,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/29/2013,5/27/2013,268,85,14,14,14>A churro truck?  Say what?  Yes, it's tasty.  Yes, it's fresh.  Yes, it's LEGIT. So I thought Disneyland Churros were the best.  (They are pretty good).  Even when I had to fork over $6 for ONE, I knew deep down it was worth it.  I gained perspective after trying Union de Tula.  I could have a bigger delicious churro for a $1.00?  Uh, yes please!  By far, one of the best churros I have had!   Churro - The churro is made to order, so YAY for hot, freshly cooked churros.  It has a great crunch right out of the fryer!  The inside is light and airy and they add the the right amount of cinnamon sugar.  Be sure to grab a napkin to soak up the grease and extra sugar.   Other food finds - Mango Ice It's frozen mango slushie surrounded with spicy red chile powder sauce.  At first, it was tough to eat...the sweet frozen mango slushie mixed with the chile threw me off.  Oddly enough, I started to develop a liking to the dessert after a few spoonfuls.  Definitely an acquired taste so bring a friend and try it.      Service - Awesome.  There was a 10 minute wait and they gave us a bigger churro for the inconvenience.  Score!       Kid friendly - It's a food truck, so no tables or chairs.  The churro is piping hot when you get it, so make sure the kiddos are aware of this.  I almost burned my tongue because I was too excited to try it.     Misc - They also sell tacos and sno cones.  Parking is limited.  There are no bathrooms nearby.  It's a bit of a drive into town, but well worth it.Would I come back?  Yes.  A gem in the Woodland area.  I'll get the churro roll next time.  This place has definitely raised the bar for my churro expectations!
<review# 483,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2013,5/26/2013,340,642,9,12,12>Where are all my fellow yelpers!  This was a fun event and considering this wasn't a money making event (proceeds went to charity) it was well put together.  Johnna was manning the Yelp Wheel of Swag along with a couple of other volunteers.  Parking was $3 or free with a canned food donation and vehicle entrance and exits were being monitored to prevent traffic jams since this location is under the freeway and not in true event center.  We arrived a few minutes before 11am and there were 1/2 hour long lines at Koja Kitchen, The Chairman and Krush.  There were10 minute lines at Roli Roti, Green Papaya and few other trucks.  Most of the other trucks had no wait or a 5 minute or so long wait.  There was a nice picnic area set up in front of the live music area with tables, chairs and garbage cans---perfect!  The beautiful weather outside made this the perfect walk around and stuff your face event. We ended up sampling goods from Roli Roti, Koja Kitchen, We Sushi, Krush and a Dawg stand (cant recall the name).  All the food was fresh hot and delicious.  We will be looking forward to this events return next year!My only real complaint would be the Reggae band playing was just a wee bit to loud as it was impossible to hear what the person next to you was saying.
<review# 484,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/29/2013,5/25/2013,474,133,30,21,19>I attended my first gun show over the weekend, an event promoted by The Buck Shot and held at the Gold Country Fairgrounds.  Keep in mind that I haven't shot a gun in at least twenty years and never one that didn't say Red Ryder the side of it. At first I was a bit taken back by the $8 entrance fee, but one gaze of the crowd and I knew I would've gladly paid double that just for the sheer entertainment of it all.  The only way you could get a better people watching experience than this would be to put a Golden Corral buffet and a catfish pond in the middle of a Walmart and simultaneously host a county fair and a tractor pull. Of all the times to be wearing an Obama '12 shirt, it turns out this one wasn't it. In fact, I hadn't felt that out of place since the time I rolled into Sturgis on a teal green Vespa and crashed it while attempting a wheelie on the main drag. I couldn't believe the amount of people at this show. At $8 a head, someone made some serious money. As for the show itself, there were rows upon rows of tables with proprietors eager to deal in many different types of guns, ammo, knives, BBQ utensils, camouflage gear, jewelry and hideous blankets featuring wolves howling at a full moon. Honestly I wasn't sure what half of what I was looking at even was, but judging from the madness of the rabid crowd that surrounded me, there must've been some pretty special stuff there.  I did manage to find myself a bumper sticker that read "The 2nd Amendment, The Only Gun Permit I Need." I think I'll put it on the back of the Prius so that I fit in better at the next gun show.
<review# 485,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/28/2013,5/24/2013,3276,1443,21,39,28>Best Food & Most Creative Artisan-Crafted Drinks, But My Experience Is Marred By A Cover Charge PolicySITREPShady Lady consistently provides this area's best swanky lounge scene action, scrumptious food & refreshing drinks. On Fri or Sat night, many people forgo a trip to the Bay Area and stay here to entertain guests, because Shady Lady has it all here.But having said that, I make it a point to avoid establishments with any cover-charge targeting a specific age-bracket. I acknowledge a right to price differently for the under 21 crowd since there is a legal precedence for this demarcation, but not for the 21-24 year old bracket.  Yet unfortunately, I only became aware of this situation because of a recent run in with it.  [I will return to this later.]SETUPOn a recent trip here back in Nov, one of my best buddies Mike P. and his sisters, mom, friends, etc. celebrated a wonderful reunion and post election-jubilation, and Shady Lady delivered.  We had both large plate and small plates of appetizers items and their exceptional hand-crafted drinks.  Their Romaine Caesar salad and Reuben Sandwich is still the best in their class that I've had in Sacramento.  And while dining on these refreshing brews and our delicious munchies, none of us noticed that 3 hours passed us by.  It was a great evening at Shady Lady.TIMES CHANGEYet on my most recent stop with out-of-town guests, including my niece and her hubby from the East Coast, we were suddenly confronted with a policy I had never seen before: a cover charge to 21-24 years old.LACK OF FOUNDATIONWhat cost metric is this based on?* Certainly not age to vote, since that is 18.* Nor is it the drinking age either, since that is 21.INSURANCE METRICSYes, the Insurance Industry has their own statistical foundation about "driving-risk" to back their actuarial tables for charging 18-24 year olds higher rates than 25 & over.  But I believe the hospitality industry has no business using another industry's unrelated metrics.  Bottomline:  Drinking Behaviors do NOT equate to Driving Behaviors.COVER CHARGE PARTICULARS & VARIABLESReasons cover vary:(A)  Some cover-differentials are based on CLOCK TIMES - for ex, $3 before 10pm / $7 after 10pm.(B)  Other cover-differentials are based on special events - for ex, Halloween Balls - there may be a differential based on attire ($5 in costume, $15 not in costume).(C)  GENDER & SENIOR PROMOTION ANALOGIES - on a related discussion, many like to analogize specific-age bracket charges (ie. 21-24) to clubs & restaurants that have "Ladies' Nights" & "AARP Senior Specials."  But these are based on a pre-stated-cover - for ex., $10 - that a business is then free to give discounts - or waive entirely - based on those precise conditions that are advertised.So in these examples, NOTICE IS PROVIDED at the door / register, and also on flyers, websites, promo-ads in papers, etc.  [More on "notice" in a bit.].  So when a policy is NOT stated like the above, it is an avenue for abuse.PUBLICIZE YOUR POLICYWhen this policy is SECRET until the individual is ambushed with it at the door with it, THAT appears to be an obvious case for a deceptive practice on a discriminatory pricing.  A policy like this is best brought to the light of day.  So when this policy is kept secret, individuals like me will utilize the service of Yelp to provide a heads-up when no other notice is provided in advance.CONVERSATION WITH SHADY LADYI had an opportunity to converse about this policy recently with Carl from Shady Lady.  It was productive and he took the time to give me insights on safety issues he made me aware of for possible confrontrations with certain patrons.  Also, at 14th & R where Shady Lady is located, the businesses on this block work in conjunction with each other to cut down problems with drunks, douchebags and bullies.  Carl asserts the cover is a proven mechanism to cut down on problems.   I'm not on the same page with Carl on his assessment - we have to agree to disagree.  But I'm willing to defer leeway on this matter.  Again, though the policy bothers me, I see the failure to "provide notice" of this exclusionary practice in advance as the primary toxin poisoning what is otherwise a wonderful well. THE LOWDOWNYou have awesome service and quality food & beverages.  But this targeted cover practice is ill-conceived. A visceral gut reaction of 2-Stars is raised to 3-Stars based on our rational discussion of this situation.  But the concern remains.  [Not that my opinion counts for a hill of beans, but I would totally re-raise my rating to 4-Stars if "notice" was provided in advance of this cover practice on your website, and back to 5-Stars if this cover-practice was abolished.]
<review# 486,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2013,5/23/2013,390,173,19,31,25>The first time I visited The Eatery was shortly after they opened. I remember being hugely impressed with the artful presentation of a pork belly appetizer, but disappointed in a steak that was tough served with a bland potato croquette. Things have definitely improved. We recently sampled a couple of impressive happy hour noshes. The tender mussels were addictive. I liked the two giant slices of grilled bread served with it to sop up the delicious broth. The disco fries, served with gravy and two poached eggs, were also more than enough to share. I could have used more gravy, but maybe that's just my inner sauce 'ho coming out. This would have easily been enough to fill us up, but we also opted to try a baked potato soup special. Lacking bacon and seasoning, it was unremarkable. Still, less than $20 for our happy hour dinner was quite the steal.We found the star of the show when we returned the following week for Sunday brunch. Things got off to a bad start when we were told they were already sold out of their much talked about cinnamon rolls at 10:00. Ah well, French toast it is. And what a French toast! Vanilla custard and plenty of maple syrup made this a decadent, perfectly sweet treat.It was a feast as we also ordered Eggs Benedict, a breakfast scramble special, and a side order of their amazing sausage patties. The "build your own" Eggs Benedict is a concept where you start with the English muffin, two poached eggs, and hollandaise; then you choose two other ingredients from a list of 16 that includes unusual items like tofu. I chose ham and mushrooms leading to results that were unbelievably delicious. One of the best Benies I've ever had.The breakfast scramble was one of those "kitchen sink" dishes that had eggs, cheese, sausage, ham,  onions, and red bell thrown together for a tasty combination. Loved their house potatoes that came with both entrees. Nicely seasoned thin sliced rounds with slightly crisp edges, they're a perfect accompaniment.The side order of sausage deserves a mention of it's own. I balked at the $5 price tag, but when a large plate of juicy, delectable house made patties was delivered, it was worth every penny.Service was a little puzzling. The bartender who waited on us was fantastic, but she had a waitress co-worker who kept loudly complaining about tips or lack thereof. I felt bad for the bartender as she seemed to be a little uncomfortable with the situation. I have high hopes that they'll start doing brunch on Saturdays. For now, we'll be returning on a Sunday soon and we'll be there when they open at 9 to hopefully get our hands on one of those cinnamon rolls :)
<review# 487,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2013,5/22/2013,222,180,8,14,11>By any measure, Firestone qualifies as a sports bar: Rowdy, jam-packed, and a largely twentysomething fan base. But the ambience is refreshingly simple and contemporary, and the food is so much better than your run-of-the-mill pub fare. We were ambivalent when we stepped inside and saw the jostling and hubbub because our party contained two nine-month olds, but the hostesses were sweet and accommodating, seating us at a large table with rolling swivel chairs, which are surprisingly convenient when you have to keep scooting away to pick up items hurled onto the ground by your infant. The menu here (at least the lunch menu) is pretty small. There's only a handful of entrees to choose from, but I suppose many of the starters could double as entrees if the long plates I saw sliding out of the kitchen were of any indication. I ordered a club sandwich, which was massive for the price, and the toasted, buttery sourdough was so good I'd have been satisfied with just a bit of avo smeared on it (to accompany the $10 mimosa train, of course). For the price, the portion sizes are enormous; the get-what-you-pay-for adage is brilliantly honored here. I'd bump Firestone up another star if the menu had just a few more lunchtime offerings.
<review# 488,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2013,5/21/2013,289,200,7,10,9>I would eat here everyday if I could. Jacks never disappoints (unless its closed). Their salads are just the best in Sacramento. They basically have the concept of an upscale salad bar, you pick what you want and they toss it for you, or order one of the salad choices on their menu. They also have lots of yummy fatty stuff too, if you're too manly to eat just a salad. Nice sammiches, fries and comfort foods like roasted turkey with a side of mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. The key is that everything is done really well, so the quality is what you'd get at a sit down restaurant but with a casual, family-friendly, dog-friendly vibe. Beer and wine too, which is a must. I would put this among the best restaurants in Sacramento.
<review# 489,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2008,9/18/2008,4,107,3,3,3>The Nugget is the best supermarket that I've been to in Davis (also my first discovery of it...)!!!  I love their decor and decorations.  The items are always stocked.  They have a wide variety of different ethnic foods, as well as natural and organic selections as well throughout the store.  The bakery always amazes me with their delicious looking cakes and bread.  I have yet to try any of the sandwiches but so far, I have only been hearing positive reviews in that area.  Prices are not too bad and I usually find things here that can't be found at Safeway or Savemart.  This place would get an extra star (if yelp would let me ... but it won't) since I found my childhood favorite ice cream that I have been nearly searching all my life since the 3rd grade: ESKIMO PIE!  I've literally stopped in random supermarkets just to see if they offer Eskimo Pie and I have seen none....until yesterday night!!!!!  I'm a fatty so I bought two boxes....but hey, I plan to share it with my fiance!
<review# 490,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/13/2008,9/16/2008,17,21,5,3,3>Walking into Hott Coffee (which is the name, by the way, and not Dawn2Dusk anymore) feels like you're walking into an FBI sting. There's cute, petite blonde girls who are quite possibly underage destroying their self esteem by serving coffee at the counter along with cracked out looking dudes just leisurely chilling along with them. You walk into this place with a friend with a little java on the mind, take a sniff around, and within seconds you're just expecting guys in FBI jackets to come crashing through the window, guns in hand and pointed at your head, and demanding that you get your ass on the ground.Which, in my book, is cool. As a coffee shop, this place is kind of no frills, really. At least, on the surface. Then you realize that yes, those girls really do serve those hot beverages in just bikinis and summer wear. Doesn't seem safe or totally hygenic and as a gimmick, it's a little sleazy. I can't imagine the mindset of the regular Hott Coffee patron. Well, actually I can, and that shames me. Maybe this is the kind of place you go if you're happily married, but like a little eye candy before you slide yourself home to the ball and chain?There's loud music playing and you feel yourself relaxed, you get past the half naked tanned and toned cutie barista and sit down with a friend and try to make normal human conversation. You try not to find yourself leering at the ladies in this oddity. You try not to notice that they have a special UFC night (Come on!). Then you notice that they apparently have a liquor license, because you can order imported and domestic beer. And vodka cranberry. And red bull and vodka. Even just vodka shots. Who the hell in Rocklin is coming into this place needing a vodka shot that badly?Especially since Hott Coffee closes at 7 pm each night. Maybe that makes sense for a normal coffee shop. But for a half Hooters with sleazy bar aspirations? Really.So, trying but failing at ignoring all of this, you turn to your friend to try and put these questions into words. But your friend, (in my case, Guy D., to whom this is like his second home) nods over in the direction of the doorway. Cops. They're coming in and they've got big sicko smiles on your face. You're like, "Great. It's finally happening. After all the shenanigans and usual rodomontade, I'm getting arrested. And worst of all, it's happening here of all places." But nope. Those cops, Rocklin's more than finest, they're just another of the bizarre regular patronage. This is probably their second HQ, maybe even a fallback location for when the zombie apocalypse or class riots swoosh in over Rocklin. Oh, and the tweener in the bikini who's serving mocha and booze, she knows their names! They are regulars!So, I guess that would mean that Hott Coffee would be a very safe establishment to be in, but probably just not one for people who have, you know, taste.Is this review even coherent? Probably not even a little, but I don't care. I went to Hott Coffee a week ago and my brain is still mush from this madness. This place has got to be a front. For what? I don't know. Something amazing, clearly. But so weird.

Oh my gawd, what have I got myself into?I decided while training for my marathon to try out 'hot' yoga at Yoga Loka on Folsom.  I took advantage of the 10 days for $10 special they offer new students!  Boy, what a deal!  Yoga classes, in general can be very expensive, but I guess that's the price you pay for mental well being.  I try to use these specials whenever possible because I do love yoga, but it is not an expense I can afford often.If you decide to do hot yoga, please remember to take A LOT of water & an electrolyte replacement drink like Gatorade or vitamin water...you WILL sweat buckets!  The class is awesome.  I feel so relaxed & exhausted all at the same time.  It is a wonderful feeling.  I guess the point of the hot room is to help deepen each pose, but because of the extreme heat, you really need to be prepared!  Like I said before WATER, AGUA, H2O...oh, and a large towel to put over your yoga mat!Have fun losing 4lbs of water weight!
<review# 492,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2008,9/14/2008,53,209,,6,4>The Terrace is a new restaurant located in "The Collection," a subdivision of Town and Country Village at Fulton and Marconi which seems aimed at cultivating the image of an upscale lifestyle-oriented shopping destination (think San Jose's Santana Row on a much smaller scale).  While Town and Country is a popular shopping location in general, anchored by the likes of Trader Joe's and William Glen, it has never been a solid dining destination.  Aside from a popular brewpub, there have been historically few reasons to go there for dining per se; eating options have been either fast food (Noah's, Jamba Juice), or just plain mediocre (Bobo Cafe, etc.).  Enter The Terrace, a 2-month old restaurant opened by a local husband and wife team.  Serving breakfast and lunch only, they claim to offer "California cuisine," a concept that has been diluted to the point of losing all meaning since its inception in the 1970s.  Typically, the moniker portends simple food prepared with fresh ingredients, often taking inspiration from the Mediterranean.  Whatever Terrace's intent was in appropriating the term, the bottom line is that their food is very well prepared and flavorful.  The restaurant's interior has a light, bright feel, with large windows and a skylight.  An outdoor seating area looked very nice, but we opted to sit inside as it was a very windy day.  Table settings are neat and clean, creating a feeling of casual elegance.    My entree was dubbed a "salmon BLT."  Beautifully prepared salmon was served on warm focaccia with thick-cut bacon, lettuce, and tomato; the sandwich was satisfying and richly flavorful without being heavy.  Accompanying fries were hot, crisp, and tasty, enough said.  My wife had a dish consisting of seared scallops with a peanut sauce, accompanied by an Asian noodle salad.  The salad was refreshing and precisely executed, with supple, cool rice noodles mixing well with fresh greens in a dressing that sang with the flavors of fish sauce and mint.  The scallops were not, repeat NOT overcooked, a near miraculous occurrence in Sacramento dining.  Again, a dish that is fresh in concept and in taste, without any overwrought touches that mar many incipient restaurants in our area.  A perfectly prepared, citrus-accented creme brulee rounded out the meal.  Even the iced tea was one of the best I've had locally.    For a new restaurant, service was uncommonly smooth and the staff unusually knowledgeable and polished.  While some things took a while to get to us (e.g. drink refills), it seemed to result from the hard-working staff being stretched a bit thin, not from inattention or sloth.  I had assumed that they do not serve alcohol, being only a breakfast and lunch establishment.  However, on exiting the place, I spied a decent wine list by the menus.  Hopefully they'll remember it next time.    In summary, The Terrace is a new addition to Sacramento dining which offers focused, ably-prepared, accessible cuisine at fair prices.  The fact that they are this good after being open less than two months is promising indeed, and reflects the owners' attention to detail and uncommonly mature conceptualization of the dining experience they are creating.

My Chinese cook grandma will ONLY come to Jade Fountain when we do family dinners (about once a month and every holiday).  There have been a few times when we have gone to other restaurants but at the end of dinner, she always turns to me and whispers in broken English- "Jade Fountain better."  Now on to the quality of the food and service: We always do one of the group meals and eat family style - soup, 7-8 entrees, dessert, which is really cheap.  Soup- Always good, especially the jook.Entrees-We always order my favorite- now num (phonemic spelling) chow fun with Chinese brocoliMy brother orders the honey walnut shrimp (and I eat all the walnuts)Our staples are- green bean chicken, peeking spareribs, tofu/stew meat pot thing, the fish, clams, asparagus chicken (if in season), and tomato chow mein, or chicken chow mein with gravy. I don't like seafood, so I can only comment on the non-seafood dishes.  I like all the food but it is nothing I crave.  Portions are huge- we always take home lots of leftovers.Negatives-I have had much better chicken at other Chinese restaurants.  The desserts are always weird sweet green bean soups or other odd things. The service is awesome-but ONLY if you take my grandma with you.  If not, I hear that they tend to be rude and slow.  If my grandma is there, we seriously get our food within 5 minutes, so I would recommend borrowing her.Apparently, they only take cash!? My grandma always pays-so I never knew that..odd.
<review# 494,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2008,9/12/2008,242,141,10,15,9>I cheated on my doctor and I feel GREAT!I've been too busy to change my primary doc and I didn't feel like going over there, especially since this clinic is 1) closer; 2) has a pharmacy outside it's door; and 3) hasn't irritated me yet.There was no wait at 2pm on Monday, and the clinician was able to treat my eye infection really fast. I paid my $15 co-pay and I was outta there in no time.Here's the kicker -- they called on Saturday to ask if my eye infection was better. You could have knocked me over with a feather. My doc's office has never followed up nor could they care less.Myeah, see ya later, Doc!
<review# 495,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/2/2008,9/11/2008,45,163,4,6,4>Who came first? P.F. Chang's or C.F. Cheng's? I'll probably never know but this name cracks me up. C.F. stands for the chef's name= Chifan (eat rice?). Anyways, we ordered the spicy/sweet eggplant which was the most delicious eggplant that i have ever eaten and contained little bits of marinated beef..so good. I don't know what the soup was called (I just called it "poor man's shark fin soup") but it contained crab and fish cheek, wasn't too salty and they do half-orders of soup! The last dish was a clay pot with chicken, tofu, and salty fish. Man did the salty fish stink but it was great on rice. The service is very friendly and the restaurant seems recently built. The whole family works here and I like giving my money to them than a stupid chain restaurant. More pricey for this variation of Chinese food that I'm used to, $33 dollars including tip. Also, location is weird, right next to a Mountain Mike's. Next time I'll be back for the special salty fish fried rice!
<review# 496,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/2/2008,9/10/2008,37,41,3,3,3>On Saturday afternoon / early evening we visited Nishiki for one of my good friend's wife's birthday. We had an amazing time with about 20 guests including friends and family of the couple. Nishiki was able to take care of us with great customer service and even better service from the sushi chefs with quick delivery of our sushi boats and our individual roll for the less adventurous type like myself. Located in a great location and stocked to the rafters with delicious food really help Nishiki stand out as one of my favorite sushi joints in Sacramento.I started my meal with my regular large Sapporo and a Miso soup. For the main course I ordered the Unaten Roll which is Shrimp tempura, avocado, unagi, two special sauces, scallions and masago with an order of Ebi. These two items were delicious however the rice was not packed very well on my Ebi which made it a little difficult to eat. That is ok because the food was awesome. Then my friend's mom orders this shot (See photo's from restaurant) that had unagi, raw quail egg and some other business that looked a bit terrifying. She drank it and told us how awesome it was and offered to buy us one. I declined at first because I have a weak stomach and am not a huge fan of most fishy tasting things. Then my friend called me out and said that he would be willing to do it if I was. Well after a bit of banter back and forth between us we did it.....(dry heave)....Once I got it down it tasted ok, but I spent a minute or so at a table full of people looking at me with a mouth full of this shot until I could muster up the energy to complete the task at hand. getting the shot down was a difficult accomplishment, but it gave me the courage to take a large step into the realm of rawness and tried a few raw numbers that I was not to pleased about eating. I love this place and after this weekends good times they have gained my continued support.
<review# 497,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/25/2008,9/8/2008,175,452,5,8,6>Finding Savory Chicken closed; we had 2 options, Viet Hoa or Kabob Palace. Kabob Palace won and we headed in for a late lunch/early dinner.  What a find!Kabob Palace is EXCELLENT! It advertises itself "enjoy the finest taste in Afghan cuisine" and they are right. Walking in the place is simply decorated and small. They have larger facilities next door where a funeral was going on. It was a bit weird trying to enjoy a meal with a funeral going on as close as the curtains were but the food made up for it. The service was friendly but they were busy with the event so water, plates, and forks all had to be requested. Styrofoam plates, plastic forks and knifes are available but the actual meal comes on a real plate. Ordered the bolani appetizer ($9.99) which is a "turnover filled with chives and potatoes with onions and special spices." It is a HUGE plate and it was more than enough for 6 people. We took some of it home. It comes with a green sauce that is spicy. Yogurt was ordered at an extra charge. The kabobs are very big portions and enough to share. Tried the #4 and #5 Combinations ($11.99) which had  1/2 tikka and  1/2 seekh kabob,  1/2 tikka and  1/2 chicken kabob respectively and come with a salad of tomatoes, onions and cucumbers. The chicken kabob was a standout. 5 large pieces of chicken that was moist and tender and perfectly spiced. The tikka and seekh kabobs were also good. The plates come with a mountain of basmati rice. I'm sure 4 people could eat from one plate of rice. It's a big portion. The rice, though a little oily is really good and compliments the meat well. Tried the #6 chaplee kabob ($10.99), "ground beef marinated and griddled like a patty." This doesn't come with rice and has a flatbread instead. This was also a standout. The spices in the meat are really good, a little on the spicy side and the bread is really good and fresh. I didn't try the #2 entrée qorma chalau "chicken stew served with basmati rice" but was told it was a bit dry but the sauce was good. They have baklava ($1.50) for dessert as well as other offerings. Will definitely eat here again.
<review# 498,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2008,9/6/2008,114,76,9,3,3>It was hot, I was tired, and my 6'7", 265 lb. son was in town on a break from his arena football gig...and he was bringing his humongous appetite with him. Now this is a kid that wasn't a picky eater when he was growing up, but also wasn't wild about fish...so I assumed he didn't dig sushi. Thank God for the exposure to adulthood and different cultures/foods a traveling football team allows. His team mates have apparently succeeded where I failed in getting him to try new foods.After reading the reviews, and having a sincere need to get my sushi groove on, I knew *exactly* where I wanted to take him for dinner. When I mentioned trying Mizu...an all-you-can-eat sushi buffet with pretty good reviews, he was all over it like a bad toupee on Howard Cosell. As luck would have it, we arrived shortly after 5:00 on a Saturday afternoon. Parking was a task even at that hour, so I guess that's one of the very few negatives I can find. They don't open for dinner until 5:00, so when we waltzed through the door (to the horror of hostess) the buffet was fully stocked and the masses were just arriving. She seated us in the faaaaaar corner, perhaps an attempt to keep my behemoth of a son from incurring too much collateral damage on their buffet? The restaurant seats about 200, and is surprisingly nice for a buffet. It's decorated with a modern, somewhat edgy flair and was really nice and clean. Seating is all tables and chairs, and a giant buffet lines the far north wall of the entire restaurant. We molested the sushi section first. There was none of that 'three basic, anemic rolls only" thing going on here. I'd bet there were no less than 10 different kinds of rolls, each looking like they came right off a "normal" sushi restaurant's menu.  Many had generous sprinklings of tobiko, eel and some tasty looking sauces....so of course I loaded up and tried practically one of each.But wait! What was this? As I walked further around the buffet, it just kept getting better! There was Maguru, sashimi and even a honki'n bowl of Poki salad! Was I in heaven? I know my kid thought he was...even if the sushi chefs seemed to be a bit taken-aback and stammering as they looked up at him while he wandered down their buffet line. From the way they were eyeballing him, I think they fully expected him to just open his mouth and tip the serving trays into his gullet. It was pretty funny to watch.We headed back to our table, practically giggling like two 49'er miners who had just discovered the Mother load. Our drinks were waiting and we sat down to partake. Everything was surprisingly great for a buffet...everything but that Poki Salad. Not sure if it was just not spicy enough (pretty bland actually) or if it was the texture of the tuna - something seemed a bit off. It tasted fresh, but was just really bland. No worries though as God knows there was plenty of other stuff to make up for it, right? Round two included a drive by on the hot menu items. I had a nice, juicy braised oyster in the 1/2 shell, some walnut prawns (pretty darned good) a pile of yummy veggies including some excellent mushrooms, a couple of pieces of tender, juicy, BBQed to perfection tri tip, and a small cluster of snow crab legs. All of it at least a 7.5 on a scale of 1 to 10. The staff kept all the bins fully stocked with fresh food and everything was very clean. Impressive.The place had filled up to capacity by 6:00 and people were still streaming in. Our wait staff were very attentive and all but one grumpy little lady bus person were very nice throughout our entire visit. I had to giggle though as when my son went back for seconds on the crab legs, I thought he was going to get mugged by at least three little tiny Asian ladies. While he politely used the tongs to pick up the legs one at a time, these women pushed and shoved, and reached around him to snatch huge handfuls of crab before stomping off...LOL! Hell hath no fury like getting between a tiny grandmother type and her cheap crab legs.Overall, it was a really nice, fast dining experience. Total damage for 2 including tip? $46.00 - and we were SO stuffed we didn't even make an attempt on the dessert bar. We'll definitely be back, and I'm pretty sure the Boise Burn Arena Football Team would be happy to sign an endorsement deal with Mizu if they hooked them up when they come to town. I'd give them 4.5 stars if the system allowed 1/2 stars.
<review# 499,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2007,5/18/2007,87,115,1,12,8>We had lunch her today for the umpteenth time in the past 3 years and I realized I hadn't turned anyone onto this gem yet, so listen up!The chef is from Mexico and makes everything from scratch--he hasn't been corrupted by Sysco or S.E. Rykoff like most of the other Mexican joints in town--probably because they are owned by the Mexican market next door.My partner always wants to go here when she's got the cravin' for enchiladas and Monday is enchilada day. I always go for something else, but I'm always eyeing her enchiladas...they are pretty awesome and made fresh with very tasty homemade red sauce. $5.99.Today I saw some Mexican guys chowing down on something that looked good, so I asked the server what it was. "Carne Asada"--big slabs of thin beef steaks smothered in grilled onions with slices of avocado on top. It was great with the pile of corn tortillas they give you--enough for about 6 or 7 DIY tacos--I took half of it to go, it was so much food. Served with rice and beans--$8.99.I've had their Cocido in the past, which is beef soup in homemade stock with vegetables--another winner. Their sopas are great, too. They also have really good chile rojo and chile verde. Ask for a little of both--Christmas on a plate!They're across from Campbell Soup which might explain their only misstep--the Pace picante sauce that they automatically bring with the generous basket of chips. Be sure and ask for the Salsa de chile de guajillo--it's the tastiest table salsa in town--they automatically bring it for me!if you've still got room, go next door and get an Arros con Leche popsicle, and buy some marinated carne asada to take home and grill.UPDATE (of sorts):I see some of you have checked out my review, but have not chimed in about how great this place is--keeping it to yourself? hmmm? We still come here once every coupla weeks and it's still great. Don't forget Monday is enchilada day! I love the cute little waitress with the glasses! She is so sweet!

Where does this come from?  I enjoyed the food, but kept thinking, peanut butter?   Is this some authentic Italian thing that no one knows about? Is this some local thing created by an insane restaurateur? Are people that grew up in the Carmichael areas the only ones that can appreciate this? Can I write an entire review using only questions?????

They had a good Happy Hour deal: Draft beer and a slice of pizza for $5. And how was the pizza? Pizza is subjective...I thought it was a lot like Giovanni's NY style pizza. It's not my favorite type of pizza...but I do like that there's a new pizza joint that's open late and serves pizza by the slice. They also had a great selection of beer. Newcastle on tap! That's pretty awesome. Looks like a good beer and pizza destination for the late night munchies!
<review# 502,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2007,5/14/2007,13,22,4,4,2>Badlands is by far the nicest bar/nightclub that I have been to in Sacramento. For example, this place is way nicer then The Park Lounge or Harlows. It has 3 stories, a back patio, front balcony, and I think 4 bars. The dance floor is nice and there are video screens playing music all over the 1st floor. I was not a fan of the music but that will not stop me from going back. Sheit, both times I was there I danced. It was part of the experience. The drinks must have been strong because after just a couple "adios motherfuc*@rs" I was having a blast. They also have a cheap happy hour on Sundays from 4-8 with dollar beers and $1.75 cocktails. Highly recommended.

God, I miss the lamb sandwich with kalamata mayo and goat cheese...drool. This place can do no wrong. They carry the freshest produce (farmer's market notwithstanding) and their ready-to-cook fare is incredible. Let's not forget the delicious freshly baked loaves of bread and the aisle of exotic soft drinks. I would seriously give anything to have a nugget here in SoCal. Those living in Davis should consider themselves so damn lucky to have not one, but TWO Nuggets in town.

<review# 505,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2007,5/11/2007,43,36,,4,5>hina's tea is finally open for business!  i went in earlier today, and i have to say i am pleased!  i really like the simple, clean, modern design.  the owner assisted me in picking out some teas, and brewed small glasses for me to try.  he acts like a tea bartender while you sit at the bar.  it's neat. once he brews the tea, he places it in small clear mugs and sits it on the bar on special glass coasters with small lights on them that are built in to the bar.  there is no charge for sampling different teas.  they have over 250 tea varieties in the store, so there's something for all tea drinkers. i picked up three varieties - a pinpoint gunpowder green, a (gasp! flavored!) almond black, and an herbal called 'on the waterfront' that basically has every herb ever thrown in! the teas are affordable because you can buy a single ounce (for under $2) which will probably brew around 10 cups of tea. for those of you who aren't very into tea, eventually they will be getting a liquor license and serving wine and stuff in the evenings.  they also serve coffee drinks (but who would order coffee there with all those delicious teas?!) and martini-style shaken iced teas. i'm so pleased to have a nice, modern looseleaf tea merchant in midtown!
<review# 506,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/30/2007,5/9/2007,39,65,9,5,4>No way! I'M the first person to write a review of the Bolt? WHAT? I read a review written by a self-proclaimedly self-loathing, self-homophobic San Franciscan that was pretty good a few years ago, I wish I could find it so that I could either direct to it or plagarize it.However, he was overly harsh (about everything, but in a way that's funny) in his critique, so I'll try to be more balanced.A very good friend of mine should really write this, as he's more eloquent than I, and hangs out there more than I do.Okay, now the actual review...let's see.The Bolt is a gay leather bar. For a lot of people, that's all they need to know. I've only been there a handful of times with a friend of mine who equally feels more or less comfortable there, but who obviously does not fit in with the "crowd".There's a bondage sling in the corner, which is kind of silly, and god knows if it actually ever gets "used". Every time I've been there, it's pretty tame, but there's a titch of scandal going on. Yes, ladies, you can go there, you will be treated politely, though some obligatory jokes might happen.The Bolt is right in the ass crack of Del Paso Heights. Yes, it's scary, but keep in mind, the Bolt is a pretty rough n tumble crowd, if they like you, they'll have your back, and dispite all the machismo flying around, they might act silly, but they're generally nice guys.Example: A guy offered to buy me a drink, I politely accept, and he asks me what I'm gonna have: Beer. "BEER!? How STRAIGHT." Ha. Obnoxious, Gregarious, sure. Nice guy, though.Straight guys maybe exersize some caution, I've had hands on my that I didn't exactly invite, but it's the kind of groping that leaves you feeling more annoyed than violated. But don't go there if something like that is going to drive you instantly to indignation (it's not even that likely to happen, I don't think it would have happened to me at all if it hadn't already been openly established that I was gay). A simple "hey, knock it off, I'm straight" should get you in the clear, though there might be some catty responses.I'd say the Bolt doesn't try to be anything that it's not, but it sorta does. It's not quite as earthy and un-pretentious as it wants to be. That said, I've never had a horrible time there, even though my tenure there has been more just stopping in with friends who I like hanging out with, and who are more into it than I am. I could tolerate it, let's say, and take what fun I could from it that appeals to me.Since it doesn't pretend to be much more than a meat market, that fun usually consists of ogling, even though not a lot of the guys there are my type, but it wouldn't be three stars worth on just ogling, it's also  that even if you're talking to somebody who you have virtually nothing in common with, they'll be pretty nice to you, even if kind of catty and snotty. You can totally just go in and slug down a few beers and shoot the breeze there, though if that's seriously all you want, there might be other places better suited for it, depending on your tastes.So you've learned almost nothing. Somebody who's more into this "scene" should review the place.
<review# 507,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/1/2007,5/8/2007,53,66,1,15,2>Short review:I really love the vibe of the place - sitting on one of the leather sofas enjoying a wonderful pumpkin muffin and a latte while watching the staff going about their baking business is a unique experience, unlike a lot of the other coffee shops in the area.However, Four Stars will be the most this establishment will ever get from me. This missing star is not one of my tilt ratings, but a concrete minus - I'm not wavering on this decision.  The reason for this is because of the indubitably piss-poor first impression and unfriendliness I got from the guy who took my order, especially towards someone who had never been there before.I may come back again and see if they can earn that fourth star.  Possibly when it's not his time of the month, or if someone else was at the counter.--------Details:Since I had the day off, I figured I might as well check out Old Soul, based on the overwhelming high stars it consistently gets.  First of all, if you haven't been there, you'll probably wander around a bit trying to figure out where it is.  Even reading the other reviews here, I thought I'd be able to find it right off the bat, but I was very wrong.(To help others, if you're heading south from the intersection of 17th and L, there's an alley on the left side, and you should be able to see their sign.  On the hybrid view of maps.google.com , the entrance is going to be smack dab in the middle of the block bordered by 17th, 18th, L, and Capitol - the building with the 10 skylight windows.)Being my first time there, but armed with yelp knowledge, I was prepared for the $2 per item honor payment system -  but I was completely unfamiliar with what they served since there was no visible menu or board or anything on display.Not being one who drinks a lot of coffee (long story) I naively asked "Can I get a mocha?"The response I got from the guy behind the counter was a distinct and sharp, "No, you can't".   He then turned around and continued cleaning up the coffee machines.Taken aback, I asked the back of his head, "Well, what do you have?"I feel sorry for the wall we were facing, as it was barraged with a list of drinks they did serve.  I wonder if he was trying to get his voice to echo off of it, which was quite a distance away.  Since The Fray's music was being pumped from a Bose Soundwave unit in the corner at the same time, I was only able to catch "coffee" and "latte".Not wanting to have to ask him to repeat himself, for fear of bearing the full brunt of his wrath, I asked the back of his head for a latte and a pumpkin muffin.  While he was making my beverage, he told the machines, "Yeah, we already make $2 lattes.  A $2 mocha is a bit much," followed by a pompous snicker.  After my order was complete, he then dashed off to an area in the back that was hidden by woven burlap coffee bags.I don't know about readers like yourself, but businesses should NOT treat customers in such a manner, even if the guy was having an off day.I sat down to try to enjoy these difficult-to-obtain goodies and take in the feel of the awesome space.  Another friendlier looking fellow came out from the back door to the central counter/bar area and continued to clean the equipment.From the back area, the snippy guy barked out "Hey Jay!" (C'mon... what is with all the yelling?!!?) along with some business related questions.  The guy at the counter responded, so I figured he was Jason - which meant that Mr. Grumpy-loudmouth behind the woven burlap coffee bags was Tim.In looking at Ally D's pictures of this place, the guy who took my order was the guy wearing the baseball cap.  Incidentally, he was also wearing a baseball cap today as well.Anyway, the latte was "ok for me," but it did taste better than lattes I have had at other places.  Again, I don't drink a lot of coffee based drinks, so don't take my word for it.  The pumpkin muffin, however, was a delicious and wonderful way to start off my morning.  The interaction... not so much.
<review# 508,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/4/2007,5/7/2007,260,392,29,14,8>I had been seeking this place out for quite some time ever since picking up a flyer for the business at a popular lunch place.  The flyer gave a breakdown of the huge savings you can get on meat if you buy in bulk, starting with a 27-lb. package that includes ribeyes, gound beef, marinated pork ribs, pork chops, chicken wings and bacon all for only $69.00!  I thought this would be my chance to find a cheap way to supply meat for group barbeques or parties my friends and I like to throw during the summer months.So my first trip was fruitless.  I first resorted to looking up Mad Butcher Meat Co. on-line and found the  8665 Folsom Blvd address.  That storefront appears to be empty and long closed.  I  resolved to find my "magic flyer" from way back, as I was in disbelief that I had missed the boat on bargain meat.  Another component to my quest was that I was searching for sources of crawfish meat so I could try my hand at making crawfish etoufee.  Other Yelpers had also started a thread in the discussions board searching for crawfish.  Having spent seven years living in Louisiana, I was determined to locate a reliable source out here in Cali-forn-eye-yay!When I finally made it to the Mad Butcher Meat Co., this time a functioning store located on the industrial side of town, I was impressed.  It appeared to be a busy operation judging by the hustling and bustling of the Asian butcher shop behind a small storefront replete with freezers full of interesting selections of meats.  I found my crawfish... however they only had five pound bags of cooked crawfish in the shell.  I know I've been able to eat nearly eight pounds of crawfish in one sitting, from attending the Mudbug Madness festival in Shreveport, Louisiana for several years straight.  So five pounds in the shell is not a lot of tail meat.  And it's certainly a lot of work to shuck all of them crawdaddy's.  So I decided to make good on my fact-finding mission and not leave emptyhanded.I was tempted to buy a 5-lb box of shrink-wrapped frozen N.Y. strips for only $25 but wasn't sure i had the freezer space.  I perused the freezer case that was  full of packages of neatly-wrapped one-pound portions.  Perfect!  I settled on a 3-lb box of tilapia filets and a 1-lb. package of ground duck breast.  There were no prices stated on the packages themselves, but paper price lists were available on a nearby counter.  I couldn't find the price for the duck breast but the cashier was very friendly and looked it up for me.  She pulled out a second "secret" price list I hadn't seen before.  She rang me up and put the elusive special price list in the bag with my purchase.I felt like something might be amiss, because I thought I saw a picture of a dog and cat on the second price list.  Turns out, the Ground Duck Breasts (Boneless & Skinless) for $5.95/lb. were part of the "Premium Raw Foods for Dogs and Cats".  I suspected something was a little off when I had spotted a "Not for Human Consumption" sticker on one of the freezer packages in the cold case, but I thought  nothing of it because it was something strange like Ground Turkey Necks with Hearts.  None of the other packages I saw, including my newly-purchased Ground Duck Breasts said anything to this effect.I am faced with a terrible dilemma now.  Do I eat the duck meat?  I'm stubborn enough to not admit defeat and get my Fancy Feast on.  Because I can reason that there must be members of this butchery's clientele that seeks out Ground Lamb, Ground Venison, and Ground Ostrich (all available in convenient one-pound packs!)... and not for their friggin' pets!  I'm sure some of these meats and meat by-products have made their way into the odd wonton or Chinese dumpling.  Or am I just rationalizing?  Are people really feeding their pets this well nowadays?I personally don't own a pet, so once I debate my options (ad nauseam), I will consider a meal of Duck Meat a la Fido.  I would certainly hate to throw away good food.Mad Butcher Meat Co... I will be back for the N.Y. Strip Steaks, but I'm still questioning your "don't ask, don't tell" policy.

THUMBS UP!
<review# 510,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/15/2008,5/7/2009,145,130,4,6,4>They were once worthy of four stars, but they changed cooks and the last time I was here I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the bland chow mein and fried rice. Nevertheless, my family is crazy about their fried cream cheese appetizer (a bizarre combination of textures and flavors for Chinese food), the walnut prawns (sweet and mayonnaise-laden), and hunan beef (decently spicy). The sweet and sour pork was unacceptable because it didn't contain onion. Green bell pepper and carrot especially do not enhance the flavor of sweet and sour pork to me. Bland, bland, and more bland. What a waste of digestion.It's not exactly good, but since there's very little else to choose from in the area, it's worth a shot. There could be some gem dishes in the bunch that I haven't discovered yet. Somehow we seem to keep going back, so that in itself earns them their three stars.
<review# 511,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2009,5/6/2009,437,1330,5,5,5>Went there last night.  I thought i the meat was very, very moist.  Personally speaking, better than Sandra Dee's and JR's.    I also liked it that the BBQ tasted sweet, honey-like, finger licking good and that it wasn't smothered all over the meat.   As far as the mac and cheese, I thought it was alright.  I like Sandra Dee's better in this area.  Open late and got a sports bar like feel (without the drinks), I think it's a winner.Famous for: Moist, finger licking good Ribs
<review# 512,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2008,5/5/2009,9,30,1,7,6>With the family's overall attention to detail, Randall, Nancy, Josh and Tamara have never been ones to cut corners. I believe Ella to be another example of their quest for unique menus and food experiences. From the  unmatched visual and ambient experience they have created with the decor and design (recruiting the amazing work of UXUS from Amsterdam - uxusdesign.com), to the quality and selection found within their menu, this "family-style" experience (thus why the portions are smaller and designed to be shared) is one to try a couple times. Why a couple? In order to allow you to navigate the menu enough places to find all the hidden gems (or dishes) on the menu. The up sides so far for me? Try the following and you should walk with a smile - ask about the oyster specials (usually VERY fresh and briny with perfect texture), the crispy porkbelly and the gnocchi for small plates, the green beans with bacon for a veggie, the pappardelle is one of the best I've ever had in my life and finish dinner-style with the short-ribs. The sorbets and the ice-creams are usually clutch as well. From a drinks perspective, their wine list is legit and deep for the connoisseur to the novice and their homemade gin and tonic is literally the best I've ever had, tonic made from scratch. And, although the joint comes off very upscale it still has the Selland's stamp of "use the salad fork all night if you want" comfort that I love.Either way, critical or not, you walk with a unique gourmet experience in your belly and whether a few dishes hit or miss, the food is unmistakably unique, quality and most importantly delicious. Have fun exploring!
<review# 513,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2008,5/4/2009,93,15,9,6,19>Ah, the Round Corner. Among my incredibly disparate group of poet pals, we forever refer to the Round Corner as "The shooting." Yes, that's right dive bar colleagues and yelpers, I was there the night of the shoot out. Hell's bells the bullets were flying!So, it was a spring night, we'd just come off an interminably long open mike night at Luna's, and one of the gang suggested we go out for a nightcap to celebrate the impending publication of my first collection of poems. And, like true brooding artists, we avoid the shellack-head chest-hair baring barbarians of upper J Street (c'mon now, it was the nineties, and the Park was just a slick dream in the Mason's junior high-era Brittanicas) and head to the Round Corner. At the time, I was fresh out of grad school (Sarah Lawrence, where all the students are offspring of the rich and famous and/or phlebbed out on psychotropic medication) and hadn't yet entered the hallowed halls of corporate America. I had a gig as a substitute English teacher at Hiram Johnson High School, which at the time had the highest gang membership/drop out rate in the state. (Seemed like home to me, I went to Kennedy!)I digress. We snare the red booth right by the front door, sit down, get some drinks, raise our glasses . . . WHAM. A disparate posse of teenagers burst in and start shooting. Actually shooting. A guy at the pool table went down first, someone else fell from a bar stool. I had, being the nervous girl I am, been kicking my jittery foot against the booth, and some brilliant explosion of understanding in my mind allowed me to at once realize that the booth seat was hollow while immediately crawling under the table and into the inside of the bench to hide. Good thing, as the last things I saw were the animated faces of a few of my HJHS students, my manuscript skittering across the gritty floor, and one of my less-than-chivalrous male friends crawling on all fours out the door. Well, who knew they keep all the local high school yearbooks on a shelf at the police station? I don't think they ever caught the boys. I don't think anyone, though several were shot, was permanently or seriously injured. My book came out. I moved away, I moved back. It's still there. Any dive bar that has red pleather seating, guns firing, stiff drinks, and a  mix of artists and half way house residents? All right by me. The Round Corner lives up to its "Tavern" moniker. At least, it makes for a lovely evening if you're so inclined toward a decidedly downwardly mobile experience.

<review# 515,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2009,5/2/2009,340,166,14,10,18>I find it interesting that the new underground location has lost the vibe of yesteryear's street-side location.  I imagine Jimmy and the boys meeting at the old Marilyn's and yucking it up with the young cherries.  His cousin Tommy doesn't show much interest, but Jimmy and Eddie are all over those fresh flowers like bumble bees in heat.  Ethel and her sister stop by for some popcorn and sudsy brew before shaking it on the dance floor with John and Bob.  They really don't like John and Bob to be honest.  They came to flirt with the bartenders.  But, John's a funny guy and Bob has the car.  The new Marilyn's is very spacious.  The staff's standout service ensures shorter visits to the bar and more time for dancing, smiling, clapping, drinking, and cheering.  The night we went, the Beatles cover band was on fire.  Their multi-talented John Lennon kept everyone lively, Paul made sure we were in good hands, George had us switched on, and Ringo kept the beat.  It was a groovy time for all, but I still can't help but to wonder about Marilyn's old location.  I can only imagine.
<review# 516,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/19/2009,5/1/2009,354,285,6,4,5>A hot dog place close enough for me to walk to from my house, nice and tempting. Finally made it over to Sacramento's hot dog stand for a tasty treat: hot dog and beer on a Sunday afternoon. Time to see what the rave was all about. My joy was quickly taken away when I walk in and see the prices. Let me tell you about the prices. Cheapest "Combo Meal" Dawg and Fries is $7.09. Really? $7.09 for a hot dog and fries, no soda?? Another $.30 for cheese to add on and $.40 for ranch for my french fries. Geeze shiesty here. Sure whatever, I fork over the $10 knowing I could have gone to Costco and bought 6 1/2 hot dogs and sodas with my $10. They bring out my food and i am sure they are not correct. This wiener (i don't even want to refer to it as a hot dog) can not be what I just paid $7 for? Really this little wiener is all I get. Ok, so don't get me wrong its good, but way overpriced. I would think $5 for a plain boring hot dog and fries is a reasonable price. I walked out of there feeling robbed. Will I be back, yes. Will I still complain about the price, yes. Why? Because it was good, close to my house, and a fairly original kind of place for down town Sacramento.
<review# 517,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2008,4/30/2009,148,83,8,14,9>Marshmallows! Nuts! Chocolate! If I were standing in front of you with a plate of this stuff, everyone would be knocking each other over to get there first. This fudge is delish!Unlike many, I am not a huge fudge fan. However, this is the one fudge I'd give my left shoe for (not the shoes I got at the thrift store, but the expensive ones from Macy's). I first tasted this fudge many moons ago at a nonprofit function where they were giving out free samples, and fell in love with it. Then, one day in fitness class, one of my fellow gymsters shows up with samples for everyone--turns out she is the creator of this fine sweetness, and I've been pumping iron next to her, unbeknownst for months! Then, another several moons pass, and I move on to another gym. I had not eaten this fine fudge again until last night. I was at another nonprofit function, and there she was--my fudge lady! Her multi-tiered platters of creamy delight called to me from across the room. I think I ran. Started throwing those little bites of gooey sweet chocolate into my mouth like there was no tomorrow! My favorite: the "s'mores" with marshmallows and nuts tucked inside. There's also a delicious coconut and nut variety. Another one has coffee. Something for everyone.Why this fudge and no other? It's light. You don't need a stretcher to cart you out after a few pieces. It's smooth; it melts in your mouth; and it's silky--as they rightly advertise it to be.
<review# 518,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2009,4/29/2009,75,26,2,26,14>I came here in 2006 when my vet recommended that I take my dog to see a neurologist to find out why she had nerve damage in her rear paws.  It took me awhile to write this review because I wanted to wait until my dog passed away and for the time for me to grieve.  Now that I'm feeling better, here it goes.I took my dog Buffy to see Dr. Gregg D. Kort.  My dog was a 30 lb American Eskimo and I wanted to know why she was limping.  He gave my dog a thorough exam and recommended that my dog get an MRI and a myelogram to find out if it was a slipped disc or cancer.  He also diagnosed that my dog was going blind because of old age, something my other vets didn't catch.  We scheduled the exams on the same day of the visit.  I was a bit nervous to put my dog through all of these exams, but Dr. Kort walked me through everything I needed to know and explained why the exams were necessary.  The staff was courteous and told me about Buffy's experience when they took her downtown to get an MRI.  What they do is take the pets to the MRI clinic after hours when all of the humans have had their exams.  I was relieved to hear that Buffy was calm throughout the car ride to the MRI and cooperated well with the staff.  Because  the vet clinic provides 24 hour emergency services,  I got to pick up my dog from the clinic that evening once she woke up from the anesthesia she had to undergo for the exams.  The diagnostic exams were expensive, but I had to find out what was wrong with my dog.  I thought it was a slipped disc at first, but the vet wanted to rule out all of the other possibilitiesIn about 2-3 days, Dr. Kort called me in the evening as soon the test results came back and told me that my dog was diagnosed with spine cancer.  He recommended radiology to slow the process of the cancer spreading to her internal organs and the future paralysis of her hind legs.  He also told me what to expect if I opted out of radiology.  I decided to opt out of radiology and was prepared to expect what the doctor told me.  Buffy lived on for 2 more years and I did the best I could to give her the best quality of life before I made the decision to put her down when I saw that she could no longer suffer anymore.  Overall, if any pet owner seeks a pet neurologist, you'll be in good hands if you come here because the staff and doctors are knowledgeable and they care a lot about animals.
<review# 519,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2008,3/22/2008,257,300,3,16,7>Remember when you wanted a two-wheeler bicycle so bad you could barely stand it?  Perhaps it was a Christmas long ago, and you'd dropped so many hints that God Herself would have sent Santa / your parents straight to h-e-double-hockeysticks if there wasn't a red and chrome bicycle with white and red tassles under the tree that year.And remember how it felt to own that bike you'd dreamed about, it was so good you'd lose sleep at night because once you'd mastered it you couldn't wait to ride it again, and again, and again, and again.....And now imagine that instead of being able to run outside to the garage in your footy pajamas and jump on that bike first thing every morning, even before Land of the Lost, even before Lucky Charms, and ride with the wind in your hair, you had to get dressed, drive 20 miles out of town, and pay $25 bucks or so to ride your bike.  That's how I imagine it must feel to be an excited new gun owner  / enthusiast who lives in downtown Sacramento.  But never fear, fellow gun lovers, your fix is near:  Cordova Shooting Center.Follow the signs/arrows to the central trailer where you purchase ammunition and pre-pay range and gun rental fees, purchase or rent ear and eye protection, and browse the selection of for-sale merchandise.  From there you can walk or drive across the parking lot to the rifle/pistol range, or go 'round back of the central trailer to shoot skeet / clay pigeons.  Tips:  bring sunglasses or safety glasses, and bring ear protection (or buy rock-star earplugs inside for a mere $0.75).  Both are required of everyone present, whether or not you plan to shoot.At the pistol range, stop at the gate and wait to be let inside.  If you bring your own guns, bring them opened, unloaded, pointing down (duh) and the range master will check your receipt, inspect your weapons, and tell you where to set up.Every fifteen minutes or so, they announce over the loudspeakers that shooting is over.  You unload your gun and leave it open / unloaded on the table and step back against the wall.  Once they call "all clear" you can change targets, fresh ones are about $0.50. Today I rented two Smith & Wessons.  One was a small-frame .357 magnum and the other was an SP-101.  The SP-101 was too light for me, and the .357 magnum was mis-firing at random, but it was nice to try some different weight and model guns.  Plus, gun rental is only $15.00 and if you find that your first pick isn't working out you can switch models at no extra charge.  Their rental selection is small, however, and the wear and tear on the rentals is obvious compared to the gun we brought with us.  They've changed their paper targets from the super-cool round black-and-white ones to a crappy small colored-squares motif, which made it more difficult to see if, and where, you hit the target.  (minus one star)If you like, or are curious about, guns this is a great (albeit moderately expensive) way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  I can't imagine ever having come here on my own volition, but now that my other half has introduced me to this all-american pasttime, I'm hooked.
<review# 520,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2008,3/21/2008,305,464,11,12,15>100 reviews . . . Damn, I need to get a life, or some sleep.  But, Yelp is so "fun, useful, cool . . . and cathartic" (acronym for ya?).  100th for a place that will make it to 100 years, soon enough.What other place in the area can boast damn-near 75 years of seasoning their grill . . .now that's some serious seasoning (I am only hoping my cast iron skillet will someday attain a fraction of that kind of seasoning).I will always have nostalgic memories of Jim-Denny's, when my mom would very rarely treat me to a day with her at work - an office job back in the days when you would see a big harvest-gold or avocado-green ashtray on every desk, and chain smoking in the office was the norm. The highlight of those smoke-filled days at work with mom, was firing all of her co-workers and then walking across the street to get a burger at Jim-Denny's.Today (some 20-odd years later), Jim-Denny's is starting to become part of my Sunday graze-fest. This place is tiny and will always be tiny, as it's on some kind of historical building list and cannot expand.  Yet, somehow they were even able to fit a Christmas tree in there last month.  And, food-of-unusual-size is getting grilled up nicely from such a matchbox of a place. Seriously.  Hollow yourself out.  Really.  Make sure you're all good and empty (whatever it is you need to do *cough* colonic *cough*).  Because I don't think there's a human alive that has ever finished the "Scott's Just Right Breakfast".  "Just Right"?  Just right for whom? Paul Bunyan or a small country, maybe.I have a friend who IS hollow, and can put a hurtin' on Bunyan-esque meals, but this hollow pal couldn't finish the Scott's "just right" breakfast, which includes that MONGO pancake.  Yes, the pancakes are touted as being larger than your head.  As I have a pinhead, that's not hard to accomplish. Butt, J Lo could make full-coverage bikini bottoms with this pancake.  On my last visit, there was joint razzing of a fairly large dude that ordered this breakfast.  I, and other strangers at the counter warned him.  Luckily, Patsy (manning the grill) offered to hold off cooking the rest of his breakfast while he tried to make a dent in that pancake. . . Well, needless to say, Patsy didn't have to break a sweat and cook up the rest of his meal.And, another luckily . . . If you really want a pancake, without bustin a gut, you can add a mini (yeah, mini, as in Jim-Denny's skewed idea of mini) pancake for a buck.  I am in love with the banana pancake, but they also have other changing flavors such as peach, pumpkin, chocolate chip, apple cinnamon - so be sure to ask what flavors they are doing that day.This is also a place that I can even feel comfortable dining alone - because it's so small, you'll never be quite alone here, and will eventually end up chatting with the owners and other customers.Love that I could pick out a cute little Christmas-themed mug for my coffee; it just adds to the warm-fuzzies I get eating a nice hot breakfast there.  Check out the specials posted up behind the counter.  I lust for the "Stack" (it may not be one of the specials, but they can still make it).  It's a delicious sausage gravy, that I would love to swim in, topped with hash browns, 3 eggs - any style, 3 slabs of bacon, or sausage, and cheese.  I also ask for some of their homemade salsa on the side - yummy.  Then I add on a "mini" pancake for a buck - yeah, I usually end up noshing on these leftovers all day.Breakfast ONLY on Sundays, so don't go expecting to get a burger - just grub down on a delicious breakfast.  Poor schmucks . . . I've seen a few customers leave after finding out they couldn't get a burger on Sunday - they don't know what they're missing - oh well, more room at the tiny counter.I'm gonna get out of my Sunday rut soon, and make an effort to go there when they're making burgers again, just for the sheer fact that you can add a side of bacon, and side of peanut butter to the burgers!  Makes me wanna kiss that metal cock statue out in front - oh yeah, I did.

<review# 523,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2008,3/17/2008,448,416,7,8,11>Nestled away across the street from Ironsides and Wes Lasher's VW place is a funny little store with no windows and two large mysterious Chinese characters on the wall.  Looking up behind the tree at the hidden sign you see in smaller letters "Lee's Mini Mart & Hardware".  I ventured inside one hot day after work looking for a six pack of beer and I entered an alternate universe I did not know existed.  It is like a sort of run-down mini-mart (like Bonfare) and an extra low budget hardware store that you might find in ChinaTown in SF.  The whole thing looks like it got picked up by Dorthy and Toto's twister, tossed like a salad, and then dropped into its current spot.  The store has, lets say, an "eclectic" variety of goods and wares.  In the cooler were mixed six-packs - like bottles cleaned up after a flood or other natural disaster and repackaged with whatever was left intact.  Boxes of things that appear normal from a distance jumble across the shelves - but aren't what you expected when you get up close.  Sorta like entering a Mexican Walmart - which is a surreal experience if you want to have one.  What else do they carry? There is "hardware" like stuff - string and tape and glue and the type of hammers and screwdrivers you'd find in the $.99 bin at Ace.   They do have smokes and lottery tickets and also some mysterious Chinese electronic thingies.   Boxes of cereal brands I've never seen before stand out in my mind.  The lady behind the counter has always been nice enough - I perceived a bit of a language barrier, and she tends to stare at me like she is thinking "what are YOU in here for?" - but she is always semi-courteous and makes my change right.I've been back a few times for this and that - and I've sort of grown to like the place - I'm like that - always picking the runt of the litter.   I'd recommend checking any expiration dates (if there are any) on food products.  Probably as a mini-mart or hardware store I'd give it two stars - but as an interesting voyage into the unknown, Lee's MM&H gets four.
<review# 524,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2007,3/16/2008,8,25,3,9,5>If you are in Elk Grove and need a sushi fix I'd recommend this place.   Of course the reason I'd recommend it is that it's the only one I know of in that area (is it obvious I'm not a local?).  It's a trendy place and has that open airy feel.  Almost has a chainy feel but clean, nicely decorated and sort of swanky.  I have got to say the few times I've been there the fish has been very fresh.  The menu seems to have a large assortment of those maki mixed rolls.  You know the ones I'm talking about.  They are about the size of your head filled with assorted vegetables, fried things, cheese and other foliage. While I'm not into those kind of rolls my fellow diners had some and I must say they looked delicious.  They raved about them.  If youre into these rolls you will have several pages to select from and likely enjoy calling them by name like the "japanese mafia".I stuck to my standard favorites himachi, maguro, hotate and spicy tuna roll or the "911" with a saki back.  They were all good.The times I've been there service has been good.  Friendly and they get your sushi over fast.This place was an oasis for me while I was in Elk Grove on business so it get 4 stars.
<review# 525,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2008,3/13/2008,3,18,5,6,7>Holy...cow.  With all the hype, I wasn't sure what to expect but I really enjoyed my cheeseburger and managed to down the whole thing because it was so tasty (although it did take about a hundred napkins to accomplish this hard core eating mission--one should definitely only bring a dining companion they feel comfortable eating like a pig in front of).  Christ, I think I even out-ate a tall 16 year old teenage guy a few stools down.  I hope he had a big after school snack because that's just frightening!  The patty is more "diameter" than height, which was good because the bun with cheese skirt, lettuce (not iceberg!), pickle, and tomato created a pretty lofty bite.  The woman (owner?) working the counter was very attentive and great with refills.  I like the fact they have various hot sauces and love the rare to score soft crushed ice in their drinks.  I think the only thing missing from this place is frosty cold beer and some wet wipes.   I recommend bringing some wet wipes so your hands don't slide off the steering wheel on your drive home.  As for the size of this place, we went after work and had no trouble getting a seat or getting our orders in a timely fashion.  Post-gorgefest, we tried to down a couple drinks at various watering holes to help ease the pain of the damage done to our waistlines, but were too darn full to drink ourselves out of this one... Overall, a great little burger joint that far exceeded my expectations!  I'll be back.  Once I digest this one.
<review# 526,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/27/2008,3/11/2008,70,309,9,4,6>Last night I broke a score of 75 with two strikes. Pretty amazing, huh?I am not a bowler. But, as far as bowling alleys go- this place is great. Its totally old school, and I personally think that bowling alleys should be old school. It adds to the overall experience and helps me to get into the bowling mood. Plus- games are just $2.50!! That itself is awesome. They also have some great deals for unlimited bowling on off-hours. Oh, and the bar inside the bowling alley- Fireside Lounge is awesome. Amazing place to people watch, there is major cougar action going on there.
<review# 527,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/7/2008,3/10/2008,63,181,8,12,9>The entrance of a second customer, and then a third, should not induce panic behind the counter -- especially if the customers are unarmed as I'm certain both of them were. It's possible I lost the lady employee's attention when I queried about the location of the nearest public phone, revealing myself to be a citizen-patron of questionable intent, but I had just dropped $30. on a modest quantity of chocolate goodies and didn't especially love the obvious and hasty turn in service. Rather than kick your current customer to the curb when another interested party walks through the door, why not make the space, small as it is, a more engaging place to wait one's turn? Or just let that big centerpiece window -- with its view to the kitchen -- provide some momentary diversion. Choosing a six-piece assorted box of chocolates isn't rocket science but it also isn't an every day trip to the grocery store. So don't put me and my goods on a conveyor belt.The chocolate here is good. 4 1/2 stars for the general character of the chocolate. I took mine in liquid, powder and ganache form. I carried an eight ounce cup of the Oaxacan out the door, on the way to meet a couple of my favorite Sacramento yelpers, Gretchen S. and Alan S.! I'd rank it ahead of Bittersweet Chocolate Cafe's version of the spicy beverage, and for a fairer price. Add a plop of freshly whipped cream or a handcrafted marshmallow if you like at no extra charge. (By now the cost of your Bittersweet beverage is probably running you $8.)The Meyer Lemon, Hazelnut Praline and the The Palet D'Or -- which provides a nice, unadulterated taste of dark Venezuelan chocolate, were my favorites of the six-piece assortment I selected. The nicely packed and ribbon-tied slender brown box contains a foldout card that features photos and names of all chocolate pieces as well as recommendations for storing and serving. The box runs $12. (or $2.00 / piece). I'd have loved to spring for the 12-piece assortment and share with friends back home but the $22. price tag discouraged me (despite its price per item break) and I couldn't help but compare it with the price ($18.) of the equivalent-quantity box offered by my favorite chocolatier, Jacques Torres. But it does beat the cost of the Vosges assorted boxes by far. No freshwater pearl dust here -- and c'mon, who craves that anyway?The candied almonds covered in bittersweet chocolate were the pick of my purchase. The caramelized layer was thick enough to lend a sweet flavor and crunchy texture, but thin enough to remain delicate and spare the teeth. And the chocolate powder will stain your fingertips thoroughly, rendering you useless at the keyboard at work for the rest of the day.The chocolate chip cookie was the only real disappointment. Far too sweet and thick and with a very distracting granulated sugar quality, although I DID drop this one in the street getting out of my car in front of my apartment, and even though I applied a rudimentary scraping of the contaminated surface with a butter knife I may have missed a few offending cement particles.
<review# 528,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/8/2008,3/9/2008,43,95,14,6,10>David Lynch would love this place.  From the outside it's a nondescript windowless box at the end of a strip mall.  Ernie's used to have a snazzy 50s-looking sign with a martini glass in the logo; now it has a new, generic sign that offers no clue to what's inside.  From the parking lot, it looks like a run-down dive bar.  It's not.  Inside, it's a cozy room that's pleasantly lit with tiny lights.  The U-shaped bar is clean and the bartender is quietly professional.  The patrons are...there's no other way to say this...old.  A gentleman informed me that we were, in fact, hanging out in God's Waiting Room.  My friends and I were a novelty to the ancient regulars, who had probably never encountered anyone under the age of 70 in Ernie's.  It was a surreal experience.  Not bad, mind you, just strange.  One of our party played an Elvis song on the jukebox that woke the crowd up momentarily.  I'm sure Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra are more their style.   We had a good time, although it was odd to be the center of attention merely because of our age.  Will we go back?  Hmmm.  It was a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to spend my last days there.
<review# 529,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/30/2014,10/1/2014,410,518,8,10,9>I'm completely heart broken that the moment I move back to Sacramento, I find out that Bangkok Garden is closed and I'm forced to eat at Thai Spoon.  My bro and his GF assures the hubs and I that they're fast, good, and give plenty of food.  I don't know what they're talking about but I didn't get "fast, good, and plenty of food".The hubs and I came on a Friday night after work and this place was packed.  We had to wait to be seated and then wait for water and to order.  That's fine, I get that it's Friday and most young couples, families, etc, like to eat out on Fridays.  Too bad the hubs missed lunch and was cranky.  I tried to keep the conversation light and flirty to keep his mood positive.  We order the Beef Padsewew and the Thai Spoon Prawns with a side of white rice.  Once we ordered the food it did come out relatively fast.  The Beef Pasdsewew was just ok.  The beef was chewy, not tender at all.  It was like a large hard  bubble gum consistency.  The noodles were flavored well, but that was it.  The amount was just ok, but not too much.  Definitely a dish for just two people, so keep that in mind when you're in a larger group.  The Thai Spoon Prawns were really yummy, but you only get 12 prawns.  Keep that in mind when you're ordering and you're hungry.  We should have ordered a curry to be cost effective as opposed to the prawns.  We were satisfied, but not full. This Thai food was more take out/cheap mall Thai food than Restaurant Quality.  I guess I've just had better.  I know because we've literally been living off Thai food because of the move back to Sacramento. The search for amazing Thai food continues in Natomas.
<review# 530,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,9/30/2014,79,54,9,15,12>Definitely coming back! My friend and I wanted to try something new since we always eat at Arigatos and we saw sumo sushi had good ratings and their sushi looked really good from all of the pictures. The location is fine, I personally don't like driving in these plazas in fair Oaks cause you turn into some weird street with all of the stop signs and then you turn into the parking lot. Hard to explain but you'll know what I mean lol inside the restaurant is nice. It's pretty big and there's a lot of seating. We were the only customers along with another table of two so it was dead but idc about that. The food was delicious! Sushi rolls are half off and they are decent sized too. Super cheap as well and made my money's worth. From all of the reviews, we saw that the naked salmon was good, and it was soooo good! I've never had anything like it because there's no rice. It's like a piece of raw salmon that wraps around crabmeat and avocado and underneath you can scoop up tempura flakes. Only 7 dollars too. Some people order sashimi and nigiri for 5-10 bucks but you only get a few pieces. I think this is a good alternative for a better deal. The pieces of salmon may be smaller but you get more flavor and it's a bite size. I like how there isn't rice because rice on sushi makes people fuller faster. We also tried the Roseville roll. I forgot what was in it but I think it's tuna salmon cream cheese deep fried shrimp and crabmeat? This roll was delicious as well because they have cream cheese in there which is my favorite. The bill turned out to be a little over 14 bucks which was good for us! I could order a small roll like a sake maki and a big roll at other half off sushi restaurants for around 14 bucks and the rolls we get at sumo are big and good sizes! I'm digging the prices here. Not much to say about service but the waitress was real nice and and made sure we were doing alright and I also like how the sushi chef greeted us too. I will come back to try out more rolls because they have a lot of sushi rolls on their menu. Definitely getting another naked salmon though

Pepe le Pew would not be pleased.If you like le taste of le mayo and le crème, bon appétit!  But if you like rustic, simple, fresh flavors, get a sandwich from La Bonne Soup.
<review# 532,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2014,9/28/2014,88,211,13,8,12>This is the coolest thing.On the far side of this little shopping area in Folsom is Fluffy Sno - not "Fluffy Snow" as Yelp seems to think it's called, but Fluffy Sno, with no "w," because "W" is the orst [sic].You, dear reader, have never had anything like Fluffy Snow before. It's snow. It's not shaved ice, it's not a snow cone, it's not a slushy. All of those things are gross. Fluffy snow is not that. Fluffy snow is snow.Snow. Seriously snow. It is flavored snow, like the kind you would get outside if you lived somewhere that it snowed, except flavored. Not snow that has some sugar juice on top. Snow that tastes like something. It is not yellow snow. It is flavored snow, like:- Taro- Green Tea- Bubble GumSnow. Let me re-emphasize this - it's snow. Not ice. Snow. It is superbly cool stuff, tastes amazing, and feels super weird in your mouth. I saw this white lady come in here with her two kids on a whim thinking it was a snow cone. She ordered it for herself and her kids. Her kids devoured the entire thing because they had never had anything like it before. She threw most of hers away because it was too weird for her. When an old intolerant white lady hates something you know it's amazing and probably one of the best things you will ever try. I recommend you get the Taro or Green Tea to start since they have the most universal tastes, then get condensed milk on top and something simple like chocolate chips. Then eat it. Then be like "wow, what in the world?" and eat it all and come back for more.SNOW. This place is too hidden, and no one knows that it's here, so I strongly encourage you to find it, go here, and try one. It also has bubble tea too if that's your thing but dude there is snow here. Snow. Go here, try it, then let me know you went here and tried it.
<review# 533,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2014,9/27/2014,111,104,13,18,18>Krush Burger is in Davis... awesome! The people of Sacramento know of Krush Burger, but it may not be so well known to the citizens of Davis. Krush Burger offers up slider sized burgers in a few different variations. The atmosphere of the restaurant and the tasty food make it a great choice to eat at when in town.I have to mention first that Krush Burger is not what I would consider a budget friendly place to eat. It's not terribly expensive, mind you, but just don't go in expecting a lot of food for your money. That being said, I think college students on a shoe string budget probably wouldn't appreciate Krush Burger as a go-to place for cheap eats. Because it's not that. I see this restaurant as a nice place for Davis families and working professionals to frequent.As I mentioned, Krush Burger serves up slider sized burgers. The Ninja burger is probably one of the most unique and popular burgers on the menu. It's is an Asian style burger with marinated Korean short ribs and Asian slaw. It has a definite kick to it and can be overwhelming to the pallet. I think it's great for its size, but I can see how some may find it a bit too much.I personally really like the Philly burger and the Pacific Coaster that I had today. I think the Pacific Coaster is a seasonal item... but oh, I wish it wasn't! It's basically a crab cake in the form of a slider. Everything in that burger balances just right. My wife and I LOVED it.I recommend getting two (or more) different burgers when you go to Krush. Don't ever get the same burger in the same sitting. The flavors used are pretty strong, so having just one of a kind of slider per visit is about right.As for sides, I would most definitely choose the fries over the tots. The fries are just normal fries - tasty and perfect with a burger. The tots are over-sweet for me. Krush uses sweet potato for them, and I just can't get past the sweetness. I prefer a more savory side.All-in-all, I think Krush Burger is a great addition to the restaurants in Davis. The Marketplace Plaza is the perfect location for it too! I'll definitely be frequenting Krush often.
<review# 534,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,9/26/2014,283,229,10,15,12>Wow! Just wow! I have to start off this review by saying I have a shopping problem and yet very little money. So in other words, this place is paradise. The best way I can think to describe it is a nicer goodwill with style. The fashion on the racks is great. This is not the stuff that people turn in so they feel like better people not throwing their crap away. This is name brand, new looking current fashion.  The prices are fantastic! Tops for $6. A dress for $14. The highest top price I picked up was $8. The purses go past $20, but are very unique. They have a large show collection, with very unique pieces as well. The dressing rooms were clean and spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful. They don't not use bags, so bring your re-usable shopping tote to carry your loot. The parking lot is a busy one being next to Trader Joes, but I found parking just a couple aisles away from the store. I went Friday after work too, so on a weekday parking would be cake. Highly recommend this for my fabulous thrift store lovers out there! It will be a challenge not to walk out with at least one new piece to add to your wardrobe!
<review# 535,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/6/2014,9/25/2014,127,123,11,14,13>I was so glad to find out that Oz Korean BBQ opened a new location in Elk Grove!  I live in Elk Grove so it makes it much easier to come to this location for some good eats. Upon driving up to this location it was a bit confusing on where the actual doors are but it was quiet alright because we finally found the front door and went inside. I think this location is much better than the Bradshaw location. The ceilings are quite high and it just overall seems much more spread out. There are a few large big screen tv's everywhere along the wall. Loving the fact they have K Pop on Tv, it brings the excitement before cooking away on their new grill.  For some reason the grill distributes the smoke below the grill and not up so there's not all that BBQ smoke that usually comes out when you are grilling your meat. I like that very much. it makes it easier to cook the meat and not have to keep avoiding all the smoke. Our Server Joanne was very helpful with food selection. She has a lot of knowledge of what's good to order on the menu. She has great customer service which made our first experience at the new location much more memorable. She surely has a good memory also because after a week from the first time at this new Oz location, I came back for dinner with my Boyfriend again. She greeted us even when she wasn't our server this time. She even asked if we were doing ok and if we needed anything else etc.... Might I say she really takes care of her Customers! I'm so glad that finally I have a new favorite restaurant I can enjoy whenever I want in Elk Grove. I'm already thinking about going to Oz next week again for dinner! I'm really craving the delicious sweet chili chicken wings and the Bone in Galbi ( Korean BBQ ribs). =)  Yummy! A+++++ for Customer Service and A++++++ for the Delicious Food OZ!!!!!!!!
<review# 536,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2014,9/24/2014,144,58,12,18,19>I have a Gucci Charm bracelet watch that I haven't been able to wear for over a year now due to a missing screw in one of the bracelet links. I was free today and running errands all over so I decided to check out some places. I called two places before I chose this one. I ended up choosing this place because when I called and explained what I needed, the man on the phone was able to tell me right away if he could do the job or not and told me how much it would be. (One of the places I called told me they don't repair screws on links because they don't have any. I thought that was extremely strange.)When I showed up, I immediately knew he was the man I spoke to over the phone. He was friendly and professional but serious. I liked that about him- he was a "straight to the point" kind of person. He took my watch and examined it. Then I asked about a new battery since mine was dead. He told me it needed a new battery and a gasket. I normally take my watches to Precision Time for batteries because most of my watches require a re-seal and they offer a 3 year warranty. But since I was here already and the watch was pretty basic, doesn't have any crystals/diamonds, date window or dials, I decided to go ahead and get the battery replacement done here. No more than 20 minutes later, my watch looked good as new, I was thrilled! I was in and out of there so quickly I forgot to ask for his name. I ended up paying only $32 for a new screw, battery and gasket with a 1 year battery warranty and he also buffed out the scratches on the face. Not bad at all, I usually pay twice that much just for a new battery alone. The location of this place is kind of hidden. I definitely didn't see it even though my gps told me it was on the right side 200 ft away. I passed it then had to make a U turn and then I finally saw the tiny sign. It's in the same strip as Togo's. So when you see Togo's, turn in, you're there.Overall, I was very happy with the service that I received today and will definitely recommend this place to anyone who needs watch/clock repairs. Give him a call or come check it out for yourself. This place is great and accepts CASH only.
<review# 537,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2014,9/23/2014,257,251,10,13,12>This place is a favorite at the Old Sugar Mill.  I  love the wines, the relaxed atmosphere, and seeing and getting poured tastings by Kelly.  She is just as much a reason that we come back here as the wine. As for the wine, I'm a big fan of the Old Vines Zin and Field Blend, and the Petite Sirah.  The Albarino is on the sweeter side of white which I'm normally not a fan of, but I actually enjoy it very much.I visited this Sunday with some girl friends (two of which who had never been to OSM) and they enjoyed the experience just as much as I did.  We were all very much excited to find out that the company they feature for wine aerator's is coming out with new designs-- including a zombie!
<review# 538,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,9/22/2014,390,173,17,26,24>That Tower-ing brunch behemoth down the road should be worried. Iron is looking at you and taking aim. As I listened to someone complain the other day about the hour wait time for brunch at that other place on Broadway, I thought wouldn't it be great if another restaurant had most of those same qualities....a cute patio filled with plants and seclusion, a fun brunch menu and gracious service? Little did I know just how close Iron comes and it's just a couple of blocks down.I was surprised to find out that they're open for brunch on weekdays as well as weekends. It was a treat to go on a Tuesday morning and have our pick of seats. We chose one of the plush, comfy booths that line the wall and had plenty of room to spread out our feast. I hate it when you want to get your morning grub on, only to have the hostess seat you at a dinky two-seater that leaves you shuffling arriving plates and cups like a mad juggler. After looking at other reviews, I knew I wanted to try the seafood omelet. I have to agree that the $14.95 price tag seemed a little high, but this sucker was worth every penny. Mounds of crab and bay shrimp mixed with a few cherry tomatoes combined in a rich, cheesy sauce. It's topped with a light, lemony hollandaise. Kali D. is so right when she says that the lemon hollandaise is perfect. The lemon really helps to cut the richness of the dish.An honorable mention goes to the fact that they have Pepper Plant sauce on the table. So much better than Tabasco, it's savory flavor adds a whole new dimension to the eggs, even for a spice wimp like me.The BF got the garlic fried chicken and eggs. We traded bites, so I got a taste of this delectable dish. A super crunchy crust gave way to moist chicken breast. It came with a side of sausage gravy that was some of the best gravy I've had in town, really flavor packed. Mixing up his eggs with chunks of that tasty chicken and gravy, he created an awesome breakfast stew.Each of our dishes came with a choice of toast or beignets. I loved the beignets! After reading a few negative comments about these fried little morsels, I was afraid of disappointment. Not at all! I asked our waiter if I could get them while we were waiting for the main course. Wish they would do that anyway because if you're ravenous like I was, it was a heavenly appetizer. Puffy and light, they came with powdered sugar and a little honey butter. The sweet butter wasn't really necessary, but it did take the beignets to a higher level of decadence.As if all this wasn't more than enough to have us rolling out the door, we decided to go for full-on gluttony and get a side of the strawberry/cream cheese-stuffed French toast. This was the only dish that was a little too rich for me. I think it might just be a personal preference, but the cheesy element of it was too much. I felt like it would have been better with whipped cream and strawberries. But it was very well prepared, loved the blackberry drizzle across the top.Service could not have been better. The young gentleman that waited on us was the epitome of professionalism, while still being friendly and casual. The gracious hostess helped him out, refilling waters and coffee when needed.I was very impressed with the ambiance of the dining room, bar, and patio areas. We noticed the patios first. There are two separate areas, one on Broadway and one on 13th Street. Both have comfortable seating that's sheltered by many beautiful plants. I noticed they have outdoor heaters available for chilly nights, too. Inside, the inviting bar has a couple of large screen TVs. In addition to the regular bar seating, there's a nice pillow-lined bench seating area that looked cozy. Probably my favorite part of the dining room were the enormous, plush leather booths. I immediately like a place about 20% more if they have booths like this. It kind of has a retro steak house feel to it that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Or maybe I just like being far enough away from my dining companion to not have to share my beignets.
<review# 539,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/19/2013,9/10/2013,102,307,7,16,11>I was down in the Laguna area two days in a row and on the second day I finally put two and two together and realized that the sub shop in the same shopping center as Red Robin was none other than THE Jimmy's Superb Subs and More that I had heard so much about. So, I decided to check it out. When I came in I was overwhelmed by the huge selection of lunch items that they had to offer. Cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, grilled sandwiches, hamburgers, chicken burgers and even Indian food! I am sure there was even more items, but I had to focus on what I was going to get. They had a grilled California Club (which adds avacado to a typical club sandwich) and I saw that they had onion rings, so I knew that was for me. The lady at the cash register was really nice and friendly and I was rung up, getting my soda and picking my table in no time. The decor here is pretty standard for a sub shop, but it was clean and they even had a TV you could watch if you did not have a companion or reading material. My food came out pretty quickly and I was delighted to see that the onion rings were battered and not breaded, just how I like them. Everything was hot and fresh and plentiful. The avacado in my sandwich was just perfect. I had been craving a sandwich like this for a few days, so this fixed that craving. I was really pleased with everything and I was in and out in just about 30 minutes, which was right on time for me at my lunch hour. I would love to come back and try the Indian offerings. I have never seen that at a sandwich shop, but I am curious to see just how it would taste. These sandwiches are miles above your chain sandwich shops though, so give them a try.
<review# 540,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2013,9/9/2013,289,200,7,17,12>A group of us came in Wednesday after work for happy hour and were treated well by the bartender, who let us know this was their first HH and they were still "working out the kinks."  I appreciated his candor, nothing wrong with that.  I have heard from friends that the first couple nights were rough, but that's to be expected - not necessarily held against them long-term.  (After reading the other reviews it sounds like there are some rude staff members... hopefully management will drop them soon enough.)Definitely will echo the other comments regarding the decor and the spacious outside seating area.  My companions and I lounged outside, smoked and sampled the house creations: the ladies enjoyed the Shady Garden; the bourbon drink got mixed reviews between the guys and gals.  We received good service in a beautiful location, it's close to my office and they serve one of my personal favorite wines (Joel Gott SB).This is a great addition to downtown just in time for summer.  I predict it will edge out KBar as the new favorite after-work hotspot for thirty-something Capitol workers... I will definitely be back.

After having to take a moment to find parking we walked in and there was a long line..sign that the place must be good!So we ordered a few different things so we could sample everything!QuicheAlmond tart2 different macaroons (passion fruit and strawberry)Danish Raspberry danishI ordered a vanilla latte with soy no whip....because if the long line (2 workers) they seemed a lil stressed and rushed. ultimately my latte had whole milk with whip...the only negative didn't want to cause any more stress on the workers so I just drank it. Everything was so yummy....the macaroons were yummy my favorite was the Passion fruit. I would love to come back and try all the other flavors.
<review# 542,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2013,9/7/2013,450,173,8,22,14>You had me at avocado shake!I was driving around the other day, feeling the pangs in my tummy tell me to grab some food, so I jumped on yelp and did a search for vegetarian restaurants, hoping to find something new.  I did!  So, I came over to Bodhi Bowl to see what they were all about.  When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the decor, it's simple and zen, very clean and inviting.  I love the tranquil music playing in the background.  I was immediately greeted by Mai, the owner.  I sat down and took a look at their menu.  It's very simple, covers the basics with a few extra twists.  Of course I had to try their egg roles, Pho and the AVOCADO SHAKE!  The egg roles were great, the Pho was very good and very big, but the avocado shake... wow!  I am in love!  It's so simple and apparently a common treat.  How have I never heard of this before?!  It reminded me of a combination of bubble tea and a milk shake.  Super good!After I had stuffed myself with all of the yummies I chatted with Mai a bit.  She let me know that she just opened back in January and is continuing to work on adding to the menu.  Her goal with the restaurant is to provide a tranquil atmosphere (check) with healthy and tasty food (check) in an environmentally sustainable way (check).  There are some really good vegan Vietnamese restaurants in the Sac area, Bodhi Bowl just got added to that list!
<review# 543,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2013,9/6/2013,642,604,17,24,23>I hadn't eaten at a Mongolian BBQ since the 80's when this style of Asian cooking became popular and fashionable.  I had always enjoyed the food, but it somehow declined in availability over the years, so I kind of forgotten about it!  Then, Donovan H. mentioned that he and his girlfriend really loved the food at Silver Garden (coincidently, my boyfriend Joe K shared that same love).  This is when Joe decided to arrange a UYE here for us Yelpers who didn't make it in to the CMYE being held on the same evening.Along with myself and Joe K., my dining companions included top Yelpers Donovan H. with girlfriend Claudia, Tiffany K. with her husband and cute little daughter Isabelle, and the ever popular Yelper of the Year 2011: Michelangelo S! This spacious restaurant is nothing fancy, but fulfills the job of offering not only good service with a smile, but delicious food!  We were welcomed right away as our intimate group of Yelp friends entered.  You have the choice of ordering from the Chinese menu or join the line for the Mongolian BBQ side of the room, which was our destination.  Start by grabbing a bowl.....I only wished it was bigger!  Then proceed to serve yourself from the numerous selections of pre-sliced, frozen morsels of meats such as chicken, beef, pork or shrimp.  I skipped that section and started with the noodles and veggies which were too many to list!  It doesn't take much for your bowl to overflow with so many choices!  After you pile as much as you can on, there are several sauces that you can add to the mixture.  Use as little or as many as you want.  The grand finale comes when you hand your bowl over to the chef as you watch him expertly stir fry your food on a huge round flat grill.  He keeps the sizzling action going for a few minutes as he adds water and continuously moves the food around the grill in a circle.  Then, when your food is cooked to perfection, he effortlessly grabs another larger bowl and directs your completed meal into what almost seems to be mid air, as it all glides into the bowl without a hitch!  Each meal was only $8.50 and that included a bowl of egg flower soup, pork fried rice, an egg roll, and a cream cheese wonton with sweet & sour sauce!  Everyone really enjoyed the food along with receiving spot on attentive service.  We all had a nice time enjoying each others company and vowed that Silver Garden will definitely be a place to frequent often!youtube.com/watch?v=_-6O
<review# 544,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2013,9/5/2013,62,138,6,11,9>When Song Hay closed down several years back, I was feeling lost & alone. I was a girl in need of a tasty local Chinese restaurant.I'm so glad I took a chance on this place. The chicken chow mein is among the best I've had. Never greasy, always fresh, & just the right mix of veggies to noodles to meat. (I hope you're taking notes, Panda Express! Because all that cabbage is fun for no one!)The fried asparagus (or green beans, depending on the season) is also bomb. And I can't forget about the chinese chicken salad! It's a different variation of what's normally served in that the chicken has breading & it comes dry (with a side of delish dressing). I actually prefer this because it doesn't get all nasty & wilted if you refrigerate it. I've only gotten take-out here, but I've never been disappointed.
<review# 545,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/29/2013,9/4/2013,113,255,5,14,15>I'm a sucker for brunch. I love it so much that I woke up early on Sunday and drove all the way out here just to try their buffet. I don't even like buffets but I was assured this place was different, and it was!First Priya was nice enough to make a reservation for our party of nine in the glass room. The room was exquisite. Large oak table and big comfy chairs enclosed by glass walls. It was very welcoming. The buffet includes unlimited coffee or tea and bottomless mimosas. They walk around with oj and bottles of champagne. My glass was never empty, unlike some places I have been. The buffet is kept in a separate back room which helps keep the noise level under control.Now for the best part, the buffet. The buffet consist of four different stations; a fruit and pastry station, a hot lunch food item station, a hot breakfast food station and a made to order egg and omelet station. All food was kept in warmers and not under heat lamps like other buffets. From the pastry station I had several cinnamon  rolls, fruit and bagels with lox. I was delighted that they served lox, most places don't. The salmon was smoked to perfection and some of the best I have had. The cinnamon roll had a light, tangy cream cheese frosting with a hint of ginger. These items were probably my favorite, and I kept going back for more. From the hot station I tried the bacon, french toast, spinach eggs Benedict, biscuits and gravy and potatoes. The benedict was poached to perfection and the spinach and tomato prevented it from tasting too heavy. The bacon was crisp and salty and slightly overcooked which just so happens to be the way I like it. The biscuit and gravy were the only bad thing I tried. Cold and hard, I only ate one bite. I didn't try the lunch items which consisted flat bread pizza and enchiladas, but I did order scrambled eggs and they made them just how I liked them. Honestly this was a pretty high end buffet and I really enjoyed it. However, the price is also higher and I'd probably reserve this brunch for a special occasion. But it's absolutely worth the drive, and money well spent.
<review# 546,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2013,9/3/2013,266,563,16,9,12>I have a beef with people who put down the Sacramento Zoo because it's not on par with the SF Zoo/San Diego Zoo/any other major zoo. Hello, that's because we live in a cowtown (I say that with love; I was born and raised here and I own it) so we have a cowtown zoo. Take it at face value and just enjoy it!Went today with my dad and little sis and had a good time walking around. The kangaroos were trying to sunbathe, but the emus kept pecking them and waking them up. The red pandas were adorable (of course). There was a fight among the chimpanzees over a blanket, it was like watching The Real Housewives of Chimp Jersey. The snow leopards were both lounging and giving Grumpy Cat realness in the face of adoring crowds. The anteaters (whose enclosure is amusingly in the Big Cats area) were following a scent and digging up the ground to follow it. Did you know that they have large claws that they use to dig up anthills? I watched one tear up the dirt with these raptor claws and thought "Clever girl..."Sacramento Zoo is a casual way to spend a day, and it's great for kids and families. Go early to avoid big crowds and lines.
<review# 547,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2013,9/2/2013,195,127,8,11,11>My review is of the facility and of the couple who own and run the dojo- Jessi and Jason. I come here for the FREE Tough Mudder workouts on Saturdays led by Jessi. She is a great and tough Tough Mudder trainer with extensive experience in this area. Although the workouts are challenging they change every week and they are designed specifically to prepare you for this tough race. The workouts also promote teamwork and bonding with your fellow workout partners. It's definitely a supportive and fun atmosphere which makes the experience enjoyable and doable. I may be sore for a few days, but I still look forward to each  training session. Jason- He is the Sensei at Courage Martial Arts & Fitness.  I haven't personally taken any Martial Arts classes with him but my boyfriend's daughter is a student of his and she loves the class. I have gotten to know Jason mostly through the Tough Mudder workouts because he works out with us. I see how encouraging he is with everyone and what a great rapport he has with others. His demeanor and patience are part  of why he works so well with kids. He has extensive experience in Martial Arts which make him a wonderful Sensei for all ages.Jessi and Jason run a wonderful facility together! The whole facility where Courage Martial Arts is run is a large, cooperatively owned fitness gym. There are several different trainers and types of classes offered at this place which will satisfy anyone's workout preference.

They had life sized super heroes everywhere including the hulk, superman, and iron man.  Great photo op.Numerous old comic books were framed with old costumes...oh so exciting.The beer places were awesome.  You pick a size and then you can sample everything they have until you found the one you wanted.  They had a stand this year that I don't remember seeing last year...the bacon wrapped everything stand.  Bacon wrapped turkey legs???  Are you kidding me???  I decided to avoid the copious amounts of fat and cholesterol but now I regret it!  I might go back just for that...4 solid stars...great live music in the evening...a must go this year!
<review# 549,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2012,1/26/2013,202,243,11,18,12>So happy that someone has finally done something with that old-timey gas station. I also love the fact that in a retro piece of Americana, where one might expect coffee or fried eggs, the business that opens is the very modern Korean/Mexican Tako BBQ. (Now, ain't that Americana? Neh?)Welcome Tako and I hope that you stay around because I think I love you. Some love:Your location is perfect - great visibility.Your menu is short, simple and fantastic. You need to put it up big on the wall, but I'm sure that's coming.Your seating is a great combo of AC-ed indoors and misted outdoor tables. I loved eating my meal in the warmth of this weekend.Your tacos are delightful. The flavor was great, the meat was quality and the kimchi was good.Some queries:I saw your liquor license at the door, but there was no liquor listed on your menus. Do you serve yet?Can you buy tacos one at a time? My husband was really craving 4 tacos, but you only seemed to sell them in 3-packs.And speaking of your 3-taco packs. Can you mix and match? There seemed to be much confusion on this point. It would be awesome though. I got to try the short rib (wonderful!), but I was eyeing the chicken ones too and would have loved to add a single.Some tough love:Retrain/talk to the lady at the cash register. She was the face of your restaurant for many this weekend and she was rushed/nervous/ not knowledgeable/a bad first impression. Why even have parking on site if it is as complicated as I saw? Unless you are an intrepid, driving-in-NYC/New Delhi-is-a-piece-of-cake driver, don't even try to park by the building. Tako, you should get more seating and plants out there and make everyone park on the street. There is plenty of easy street parking around, so it's not a hardship. It was a great weekend (based on the lines I saw), and it was a great meal. I really recommend the short rib tacos (incredibly delicious!). The quesadilla is also good, but probably better as a shared side than as a meal. Go Tako, go! I have high hopes for you as you get more weekends under your belt since I think you're off to a great start. To getting better and better!
<review# 550,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/18/2012,1/25/2013,356,378,23,15,15>I love karaoke but I hate sharing the mic, so I decided to go alone to Oishii to get the diva out of me. I asked the hostess if people often come alone to karaoke and she said yes, many Asian girls do. Haha! I guess I fit the bill too! Luckily, I also went during happy hour when the rooms were half off (small room comes out to be $12.50/hour) and glasses of Lagunitas IPA were only $2.50 each! Little me occupied one of their small rooms that can easily fit 10 people. After the hostess demonstrated briefly how to use the machine, I was off, singing song after song of MY choice. I'm really into Taiwanese music from a few years back, and much of what I wanted was listed. If I needed a refill on beer, I simply pressed a button and the server came into the room to take my order soon after. I did find it weird that my server came into the room a couple of times at no request of mine to check to see if everything was okay. He could have just briefly peeked through the door instead, I thought. Anyway, after an hour and half of entertainment, my bill came out to $27, and I couldn't have been more happier and buzzed. I seriously had a great time (yes, even by myself) and I know I will be back again for more very soon.
<review# 551,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2012,1/24/2013,346,105,15,17,16>Full disclaimer: I am not a beer drinker.  I know very little about beer except for the fact that I don't like the ones that look like piss and have lite in their name, and I tend to like the ones that are smooth and dark and full-bodied.  Hmm.  Anyway.  There's that.I was invited to go to the Capitol Beer and Tap last night by a friend who is ALL BEER ALL THE TIME.  His yelp quote is "I'll have the IPA."  His profile pics on yelp and Facebook generally show him drinking a beer or making beer.  Yeah, that's right, he makes beer.  Out of his house.  Every month, because he needs to keep his supply coming.  He brews 50 bottles worth.  I told him he should say he makes boutique beers.  Sounds far better than some of the alternatives I was thinking (considering he stores the beer making thingy in the spare bathroom.  See earlier comment about beer that looks like piss.)Why wax rhapsodical about my friend, you ask?  Isn't this a review about Capitol Beer and Tap?  Why yes, yes it is.  However, I wanted to provide an offset to my disclaimer about my inexperience with beer, with my friend's obsessive immersion in the stuff.  See, now it all makes sense, doesn't it?Okay.  So I had to circle the block (or triangle) of Howe/University/Fair Oaks a couple times looking for parking and finally scored with one right out front.  The place is set back from the front of the buildings, tucked away on the side, but you can't miss the frenetic energy you sense almost immediately as you approach the patio.  The place is packed with men between the ages of 24 and 60.  Score.  Wait, I'm here for the beer.I entered the place and it looks like I entered the wrong place, initially.  I was expecting to be dumped right into a bar/pub area but instead I was greeted by a small grocery store looking place, walls lined with refrigerators and shelves showcasing beers from all over.  I quickly walked through to the back, where I saw the crowds of people.  Seriously, ladies, you have no idea.  Don't hang out at Fats or Sienna or even Bandera next door... Capitol Beer and Tap is where all the men are!  I saw maybe three women guests, and maybe 3 to 4 female servers.  That was it. Anyway,  Found my friend quickly, tucked away in a prime corner spot with his bud (who deserves a review of his own.  Really.  He's a golf blogger.  Oh the stories that are just waiting to be unearthed.)  My friend was already pretty happy after having been there since 5pm, and was insistent that I try the beer he had, and what he called the "elixir of the gods."  Yes, an India Pale Ale, also known to the beer afficionados as an IPA.  I'm an accountant.  To me, an IPA sounds very close to an IPO, an Initial Public Offering, which makes me sit up and take notice.  This, my friends, would have bombed on opening day in the stock market.  I tried it, and the bitterness settled in the back of my mouth and I couldn't hide my distaste.  Luckily, my friend, let's call him R for ease, didn't take offense and instead asked me what I liked.  So I explained what I said up there in my disclaimer.  He was able to translate that into a glass of a pretty awesome Obovoid (by the Boulder Brewing Company.)  Dark, nitro enhanced creamy head, delicious.  Now we're talking!  Quickly realized that the place doesn't serve food, but you can order in food from Tokyo Fro's next door.  Pretty accommodating.Oh...I forgot to mention why I was even dragged over there...for the Knee Deep Tap Takeover.  Something I knew nothing about until two days earlier, when R explained it to me: when a local brewery brings several of their beers and "takes over" the taps at the pub, and then the pub is swarming with beery men salivating for a taste of the manna from heaven.  Or something like that.The place had a great energy, lots of conversations going on, happy, excited, unrestrained.  So this is what its like when women aren't around.  Interesting.  The counter ran along the entire length of one wall, but the bar only came to half the distance...looked a little awkward to me, but the patrons had enough to look at on the wall...lots of little framed chalkboards with great drawings by one of the servers...who draws tributes to the beer being highlighted at the moment.  Not bad, supporting the arts...I am liking this place more and more!I stayed for little over an hour, good conversations with my friends, a lot of beer knowledge was imparted (in one direction, to me, the novice) and then I headed off to midtown to meet another group at the Pour House.  From beer to whiskey.  That's the life.I will definitely be back.  And I'm not sure if I will bring my girlfriends with me.  Kinda want to keep this all to myself and my guy friends.  Selfish?  Maybe.
<review# 552,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2012,1/23/2013,149,559,9,17,14>Dim sum review only.Short version: New favorite dim sum place. It's spectacular. If you don't love it, it's a character flaw.Longer version: We have been here a dozen times, and I keep waiting for it to falter. It' hasn't.  What makes it legit is delicious, hot, fresh, flavorful dim sum, with lots of variety at reasonable prices. What takes it to the next level of amazing is:1) The dishes come out quickly, and there is a huge variety at any given time. We showed up at 10:30am on a Wednesday, and they had just as many dishes circulating as during the lunch rush.2) The seafood is exceptionally fresh. 3) It's customer-service oriented. Feel free to engage in hipster commentary about that awesome Chinese spot where no one cares about you and how "authentic" is it. I'll engage in raving about how much it rocks when a dim sum spot brings you water immediately, has smiling staff, and wants to engage about your experience. It's a nice change, and it means you can bring your non-Chinese friends and in-laws without feeling like you need to be a cultural ambassador.4) English is consistently spoken, when the occasion calls for it. This is not a requirement for dim sum. It does, however, make it a lot easier to introduce your non dim-sum-eating friends to the wonders of choosing dim sum over $15 omelets in midtown on a Sunday morning.

Second, they have a variety of spaces to study, or shoot the shit with a friend, or have an emo moment to yourself while sipping on some tea and reflecting on life.Third, the staff and owners are friendly and personable. I've never felt that odd stuck up coffee shop vibe from anyone.Fourth, they steep your tea for you so it doesn't over or under brew. Plus, they save your tea leaves so you can get a second brew. Hell, I've even pushed it and had a solid third brew during long study sessions.Fifth, I don't drink coffee often, but when I do I usually have to put an absurd amount of sugar and cream in it. For some reason I don't have to do this with the coffee at Insight. Dare I say it? Their coffee is so smooth I can drink it black--straight up craziness!
<review# 554,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2012,1/21/2013,591,132,9,23,14>After having a fail night at wingstop natomas and their bad service. I found this place. starving with a big appetite. sweet! More Ramen competition! I love it! And this one is closer to where I live! Same management as Sushi Hook. So service was good. I had the Tonkotsu Ramen it is a non-spicy ramen and I also added the $3.95 small Chashu rice bowl.That was a delicious starter! The broth was delicious but wasn't very thick as Ryujin yet hold a strong flavorful, salty broth. The noodle type is different from all the other ramen houses.I like this place and I think I will be returning simply because they have a large menu of variety to try from as well as making your bowl the way you want it by adding more to it than what is already there. I got full off the bowl without adding any meat. I would have posted a picture but I went at it the second the bowl was placed in front of me.Five stars because I was starving, the service was great, nothing to really complain about, because there was only two parties dining and that includes me. Price was decent for what you get. The noodle and broth definitely hit the spot for me. It's much much healthier than eating little greasy baby chicken wings.

I went with a group of 2 other people so this is what we had:Boneless Habenero chicken wings - Very good and has a pretty good kicks. Made my friend tear up and broke a sweat.Boneless Wild Hot Chicken wings - ok, tasted like normal hot wingsBoneless Asian Zing Chicken Wings - Very tasty, just think of a hot & sweet kung pao sauceJuicy Steak Burger - Tri tip was included in the burger along with a meat patty.  Tri tip was well done but still had flavor. I don't think i would order it again. Jalapeno poppers - Very good appetizer. just think of a loaded potato skin with bacon fixings deep fried with jalapeno.Strawberry lemonade - pretty good and free refills.Place is loud like TGIF, especially with TVs all over the restaurant.  The server does provide you with this portable device where you can play poker one the TVs. Also the server said, if you want to watch a certain sport/game, they will change the channel for you to view it at the closest TV to you. Overall great place to watch any type of sports if you're a sports nut. Awesome spot for a big gathering or kick it with the boys.  Also excellent ambiance for late night bites as they are open til 2am on the weekends. I just hope this place stays in business doesn't draw in the ghetto people to make it go outta business.I'd rate this place a 3.5 but since there are over 71 Tv's, i'll give the benefit of the doubt to 4 stars.

Don't know why "bug" is in the name, there are no insects on display here, but lots of information on the gold rush and an actual mine you can walk into. I am slightly claustrophobic, but I did not have a problem with this mine, it's not too deep and fairly spacious!You take the residential streets and end up here. I don't recall the exact price for the mine entrance, but everything is very reasonable. In fact, to rent a pan and sift through for gold and gems (they're planted), it only costs $2 an hour. You sift through a wooden trough with other prospectors hoping to strike it rich.I didn't find any gold, but found some quartz, calcite and some other stuff. There is a large picnic area for groups and flushing toilets. Yay! The surrounding forest area is beautiful and it's just nice to be in nature. The gift shop is reasonably priced. You can purchase different rocks, glass eggs ($3), rock candy ($1.25), postcards, books on rocks, maps, etc. I was chatting to the woman in the store and she said last year they had visitors from all 50 states and all over the world! She didn't know how people found out about it...maybe Yelp?

In fact it's quite nice, like a not-used book store.  The employees are your typical cool Dimple clerk types - friendly and helpful.They carry a great selection and to my delight I have found every single book I have gone in there looking for. During my latest trip I walked out with an armload of manga (finally I don't have to feel guilty that I am spending too much money on these comics).They also carry vinyl records in the back section of the store and that area seems to stay pretty busy so I guess they have a good selection. My old record player bit the dust ages ago so I don't bother to look.

They offer a variety of services (check out the website) and do an amazing job with all of them. I had my haircut and my eyebrows done on the same day, and Marissa did an amazing job with both. I went back the next week to have my haristyled and it turned out amazing, I was the Latina Marilyn Monroe! Marisa has an amazing ability to recreate 40-60's hairstyles, you will not be disappointed, I promise! The place is also decorated a-la 50's beauty parlor, and they have an area in the back where you can purchase retro clothing. Although they are still working on stocking it...most of the clothes are for their Pin-Up make-over photoshoots. If you are into the sexy ultra-fem styles of the 40's this place is where you need to go. The staff is uber friendly, and they will help you with selecting a perfect style for you. They even watched my 2 year old while I was getting styled which was amazing! She loved them too!

I'm guessing that ownership changed since my last visit (four months ago, maybe?), because what I saw this past weekend was a brand-new New Canton. Waitstaff has probably tripled. People are wearing suits. You can actually get a refill of water. Whaaaa happened? These are all welcome changes. Food quality is the same, if not slightly better than it was before. Better meat used for shortribs. Roast duck was of very high quality. All the other standards were pretty much the same. Oddly enough, despite all the glaring improvements, the dining room was the least busy I'd ever seen it. How exactly does that work?
<review# 562,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/29/2008,10/9/2008,418,300,6,8,8>It's the Doorway To The Delta.  My wife and I decided to head on down the road to the Freeport Bar and Grill for a celebratory dinner. We weren't sure what to expect since we'd never been there. I've driven past on many occasions while exploring the Sacramento Delta. Always looked like my kind of joint. We decided to try it out for dinner. I got a gigantic rack of St. Louis style ribs. They were enormous! They could tip over Fred Flintstone's car. They were also pretty damn good. I used lots of napkins. The baked potato was tasty too. I washed it all down with an ice cold beer. Freeport Bar and Grill ain't cheap. So keep that in mind. After we finished our dinner we headed over to the bar part of the restaurant. They have karoake and it looked like they were getting ready to set it up. It was a really good mix of folks too. Old. Young. Tweeners. Regulars. Semi-Regulars. I love the bar area. Paco is one of the best bartenders in the area. Friendly and affable. The karaoke was awesome! The host is cool. he's not a poser. He has a good rotation too.  There are some really great singers belting out the tunes on Friday nights.  We always have a blast at the Freeport Bar and Grill.
<review# 563,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/16/2008,10/8/2008,148,83,7,28,20>What a gem! This is the sort of place to bring your mom on her birthday. It is a quaint, quiet little restaurant open only for lunch and run entirely by volunteers. The money you spend on this lovely meal goes directly to fund the Sacramento Children's Home. Professional chefs plan and prepare the meals here. There are typically two or three entree choices each day, including one vegetarian option and a salad. Your meal includes dessert. Everything is prepared fresh, and the food is wonderful!On my most recent visit, I chose the veggie salad. It came with an Asian vinaigrette, red bell peppers, cabbage, noodles, peanuts, bean sprouts, green onion--lots of fresh, crisp veggies. But don't think the meal is light--the salad was piled high, and I couldn't even finish what they brought me. Friends at my table had the chicken enchilada entree, and I had to force myself not to lick their forks. It looked delicious drowned in red sauce!For dessert: frozen berry pie with a macadamia nut cookie crust. Delightful!The setting is also whimsical. The seating area (all windows) is surrounded by a sweet garden--full, green trees, flowers, butterflies--the works! I'm certain that by now you would like to rush over to the restaurant. But don't just show up! You need to make a reservation in advance--they fill up quickly, because it's popular with the ladies!

<review# 565,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/2/2007,10/6/2008,43,95,2,16,7>I wish I liked Elliott's better.  I really want to support a locally-owned business that's been around for 55 years.   They're not cheap, but they carry hard-to-find items and the store is always neat and well-stocked.  But alas, I can only give Elliott's a three-star "average" rating.What I like about Elliott's:  they carry some obscure Tom's of Maine products I can't find anywhere else, and they satisfy my henna addiction (since Sally Beauty Supply so rudely cut me off several months ago).  What I don't like about Elliott's:  the staff are indifferent, disinterested, slow, dull and completely unengaged.  They're not rude; they're just utterly unconcerned with things like making eye contact with customers, saying hello, asking if you need help, and ringing up sales.Come on, Elliott's, wake up.  Get some enthusiastic people behind the counter and invite me to come back.  I only visit when I absolutely need my fix.  Give me a reason to drop in and browse.
<review# 566,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2008,10/5/2008,66,86,7,6,5>Dear Ettore,You hurt me with your prices.  You wow me with your culinary goodies.  I am but a poor, young girl... please have mercy!The interior decor is flawless, with framed vintage posters en Francais adorning the walls, sweeping granite counter tops, sturdy, comfortable furniture, and moldings of stained wood.  Your glowing cases of sweets and treats are tantalizing - candy for the eyes and palate.  Your food is fresh, well-made, and altogether amazing.  The BF loves your grilled chicken on focaccia, as I feel for your tuna sandwich on a perfectly crisp croissant (both about $9.)  The BF treated me to a slice of the princess cake, which was beautifully decorated with rich chocolate swirls on almond colored marzipan, topped off with an edible lily.  The raspberry preserves balanced perfectly with the filling and cake, which had a subtle lemony flavor.I loved that the sandwiches each come with a side salad - not too much, not too little.  My pasta salad was a little warm and near bland, but I'll assume that was a fluke.  The BF's Caesar salad was deliciously dressed and had fresh, tasty croutons.The BF and I sat by a window, looking onto the nicely decorated patio.  Because of the pocket in the road, the patio is actually more peaceful than you would expect a restaurant on Fair Oaks Boulevard to be.  Next time, we shall sit outside.Thank you, Ettore, for the wonderfulness that is your establishment, but please - easy on the wallet.  You remind me of a cleaner, saner version of world-renowned Gayle's Bakery in Capitola, without the market-style, take-a-number madness.  I know expenses are going up, I feel it too; I just can't stand to not be able to afford you.Love,Karen (and the BF)P.S. I love your name.  I love how the Italians have made sucky names like Hector into cool names like Ettore.  Plus, anyone who has read the Iliad knows that Hector is a selfish jerk in the guise of a selfless hero, much like Jack Shephard on Lost.  Hector sucks more than Nestor, the old Achean man who talks just to hear his own voice.  Then again, Nestor just became ten times cooler due to the naming of Nestor Carbonell, who plays Richard Alpert on Lost.  What was I talking about again?  Is it February yet?P.P.S. Your food still rocks.
<review# 567,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/15/2008,10/3/2008,44,281,1,4,6>PCLL is the American branch of a Korean chain called  Cheogajip Chicken.I stopped by before a drive-in movie; it is very convenient as it is right across the street and stays open late. Aside from a few side dishes, all they have is pizza and chicken.First we were served a cabbage and corn salad, and pickled radish cubes. We ordered a bulgogi, corn, and potato pizza which was ok; it tasted like it had been frozen at some point. The fried chicken was moist, but a little bland. My favorite item was the popcorn chicken, which was coated in spicy sauce. They also have soju and huge plastic pitcher bottles of Hite beer.This location used to be a restaurant with more typical Korean fare, called Jan Soo Chong. The decor hasn't changed much, and the owner from the old place is still there.*Note* PCLL is not open for lunch; only for dinner and late night.
<review# 568,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2008,10/2/2008,10,21,2,6,3>It's pretty difficult to add much to what has already been said here.  I'm a big fan of this place, eat here perhaps once a month or so, and have never had a bad experience.  The food is consistently good.  It's not "OH MY GOD" good, but it's good.  Table service CAN be slow sometimes, but I usually eat at the bar, so I don't care.I've heard the complaint that Bandera is a little over-priced for what it is, and I'd agree with that if it were not for the lack of a corkage.  If you drink wine - and I do - the overall dinner ticket is very reasonable, in my opinion.My favorites are any of the rotisserie items, the poke and the grilled artichoke.  The pork chop is great too - plan on taking most of it home with you - it's ridiculously large.  I've also never been disappointed with whatever their catch of the day is - very good fish here.Try eating at the "counter" area back by the kitchen - quite entertaining.Very much recommended.

Ya see, if you (yes even YOU) manage to get a Review of the Day, Phil here will GIVE you a free FIVE COURSE FREAKING MEAL.So, cuz I am a starving student, and owed my mom a mother's day present, I took her here. (ALL CLASS RIGHT?)Phil was amazing. He came out and greeted us, got us two glasses of wine, talked it up with my mom and wished her a happy mother's day. But let's get to the food.A) Greek food is seriously in my top 3 favorite foods EVARB) When Phil tells you to come here hungry, you come HUNNNGGGRRAAYC) the staff....so kind, so funny, so courteousFirst dish was the pita and hummus appetizer. IT'S GINORMOUS. The hummus is smooth, and topped with spices, and the pita bread is nice and thick and fresh!Second round was the "A little of this, a little of that" Salad: it includes the Tabouli (my favorite), the Summer in Athens, Orzo pasta (another fave) and the Chickie mama (which is flavorful chick peas). All totally worth it.Third round (we were pretty full by now), was the Variety platter. Enough food to be a complete dinner for two people! The spanikopita was flaky and and creamy, the dolmathes were wrapped perfectly and the blend inside  was deeeeeelish, the deep fried falafel was well (it's deep fried so it had to be good), but my favorite was the gyro meat with tzaziki! The meat is tender, melts in your mouth, and you can taste each and every spice!Fourth (yes four holy moly) was by FAR my favorite. the pasta. The Penne with Mizithra and Feta. FETA ON PASTA is the best invention ever. This simple, yet elegant dish was a total shocker. I am so glad I had enough to take home. Fifth and final dish was the grilled leg of lamb. Perfectly seasoned, moist, and topped with mint, it was a great way to end our Greek excursion.Phil even called me and left me a voicemail telling me how nice it was to meet us, and thanking us for coming in!TALK about customer service. THIS is how it's done folks. Great atmosphere, AMAZEBALLS food, great staff and the owner showing mad appreciation.I will definitely be back here to stuff my facehole SOON!Thank you Phil!
<review# 570,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2012,12/3/2012,451,541,8,18,15>Pho Le is a great place for Vietnamese food in the South Side of Sacramento [Border]. Its conveniently located in the plaza by 24hr fitness and Osaka. The food here is on the better side of quality and reasonably portioned. The selection is plenty for the range of Vietnamese Food here from Soups to Rice Plates to Noodle Plates. The restaurant is one of the cleanest Vietnamese restaurant in Sacramento, so don't fret about that. On the other hand, I found that the staff here can be apathetic and at times rude. Win some, Lose some I guess.Here are the following I triedHungry Man Combo 5.5/10yelp.com/biz_photos/SOVsBig Portioned Dish at a cost of almost 1.5 plates. Filled with the assortments of meats and vegetables one would find in Bun Thit Nuong and rice places, the Hungry Man Combo does fill you up; however, its rather lacking in some of the meats here from my experience. Some of the meat I received was dry and greatly overcooked. I felt like I ate almost complete jerky. Try it, but its just okay. Bun Rieu 4.5/10yelp.com/biz_photos/SOVsI found the Bun Rieu was just okay. I have tried this on several occasions and I just didn't like the way it was. Well, it was almost lacking in quality of flavor in my opinion. The taste of Bun Rieu should have a good blend of flavor of crab/shrimp meat  and tomato flavor, this one didn't. Give it a try, but don't get your hopes up.Bun Bo Hue 7/10yelp.com/biz_photos/SOVsThis in my opinion is very good. It has a really unique flavor and base that compliments the noodles and ingredients in the bowl. I would say it is up there. Give this a try!Bun Thit Nuong 6.5/10yelp.com/biz_photos/SOVsYour normal Vermicelli bowl with all the ingredients. You really should get this wrong and Pho Le hasn't. The classic Vermicelli bowl here is solid and your go to choice if you don't want to choose.Pho 6.5/10yelp.com/biz_photos/SOVsThe Pho here is good, almost excellent. Hopefully it gets there. The soup base is nice and light; however, the flavor isn't deep or complex. Its good so don't hesitate to try it.This place is definitely recommended for its range and quality plates that they serve. Give it a whirl!Pros: Food, Price, Portions, AmbianceCons: StaffStars: 4

This posed no challenge to the gentleman here who gave me one of the finest haircuts I've ever received. Limon is very skilled with scissors. After trying out a few lengths and getting the go-ahead from me, he went to town on it like Edward Scissorhands. I was a bit nervous at first but he looked like he could do this in his sleep. Needless to say, it turned out awesome. He was even able to thin out my 'fro to a manageable density. $18 for a haircut, which is a little higher than I usually pay, but I do believe it's worth it. This is an old school one-chair shop. You'll only chit chat if you feel like it, otherwise just relax with the sounds of 1940's Big Band and let this man make you look like a champ again.

However, the gal working the counter was super friendly, and a look at the menu revealed the above-mentioned carne asada fries. I knew right then we were coming back.And we did a day or two later. I had just burned 800 calories between my circuit training and my bicycling, and nothing sounded better than a whole bunch of Mexican flavors mixed with some French fries. We walked over, and happened to catch the owner working the front counter.You know, there's something really awesome about talking to a business owner about their place. This fellow has been in business for 20 years. He showed us their new menus, and we talked about the ins and outs of running a restaurant for a bit.And then our food showed up. It was everything I wanted, everything I hoped for. I took a bite and I realized world peace is possible. Lions and Gazelles can live in harmony. French fries and salsa, guac and carne asada can co-exist, both on the plate, and in my belly!

They even make a great po' boy (get the gator!). And nothing like a $2 pint of PBR to wash it all down with. One of the ONLY places in the world I'll willingly drink the stuff. Too bad it doesn't come in a tall boy wrapped in a paper bag =PThe sauce is great. I'm a BBQ sauce junkie so getting my fingers, mouth, and chin covered with the stuff is the business for me. Extra napkins?? We don't need no stinkin' napkins!!! Well, okay, I do.....but a nice big stack of them okay???The boyfriend and I will share a large platter with a selection of meats. Last time, he had the gator po' boy and it was amazing. My ribs were of course, delicious. I'm drooling just thinking about it. And seriously, the mac and cheese is amazing!Service is always great, they seem to enjoy working there and it shows.

Great assumption so kudos to me and I'm giving myself 5 stars. The waitress was super sweet and very attentive. When my son that is non-verbal and makes some humming noises started to hum I told her why he did that and that if it got too loud I'd leave and that if anyone complained to please let me know she said "don't worry about it, he'll be fine" and gave me a very sweet look.  I wanted to hug her. THAT was 5 stars right there in my book! He only hummed a few times and actually loved the place.We ordered egg rolls, fried wantons with cheese , crispy noodles, vegetable fried rice, chicken chow mein, and sweet and sour chicken. The portions on those plates were huge and everything was delicious. I was really impressed with how the veggies were cooked to perfection. None of that soggy, overcooked mush. The bill was not bad at all either for 4 people to enjoy a lot of food, great service and a very cute restaurant.***NOTE: The reason I always mention my son and Autism related experiences in my reviews is because parents with children like mine have a very hard time knowing where we can go, how people will handle being around our kids, how our kids will respond to the environment, and I am always exploring new places so while at it I can let them know of good places to take our kids**
<review# 575,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2012,11/26/2012,474,133,5,19,22>I've always been a Habit fan so I had been closely following the progress and anxiously awaiting the opening. The published opening was for Monday, but when I saw there was a Sunday soft opening with all proceeds going to charity I knew I couldn't pass up the win win opportunity.  I've always enjoyed the hype of the opening of a new business. You've got the short lived fairy tales, the future should have beens, prima donnas  and meh I've had betters and stars in the making. No mystery with The Habit though as it is a great burger place with long history on West Coast success and a strong reputation. Today's visit to the newest location was everything I've come to expect with The Habit. The service was friendly with high emphasis placed on service and most importantly the burger was outstanding. I've always appreciated that the person taking the order repeats your exact order back to you, specifically listing any item you've added or asked to be removed from your burger as to ensure that your order is always correct. As if that is not enough, the person giving you your order goes back through the same process to ensure you're reviving exactly what you ordered. The burgers here are full of flavor and the option to added, perfectly cooked bacon or fresh avocado always make for taste perfection. In terms of burger places that you order from a counter, I don't think it gets any better than The Habit. As for the fries, I don't find them to be anything special and rarely finish them. That said, if you serve me a worthy burger I could accept strips of cardboard as my side. The addition of The Habit along side Islands, Smash Burger, Red Robin and Burgerocity gives Folsom quite the roster of burger choices.

It was sexual healing kind of good dunno if that makes any sense. Anyhow their portions are reasonable and the food comes out relatively fast.

But, oh Naked, you have won me over and gone straight for my SOUL (and yes, frankly, I am cheating on Temple). Let's keep this short and sweet, no need for me to ramble on and on. I come here for one thing and one thing only...BOWL OF SOUL. Pure tranquility in a cup! It's the perfect concoction when you don't want coffee, but need something warm and soothing. Who would have thought that soy milk, chamomile tea, honey, and a dusting of chocolate could create such a state of euphoria?! Problems float away and sorrows drowned in this frothy silky potion. Your soul will be stripped "naked" of all demons (okay, maybe I took it a little too far, but it does calm the soul!). Other bonuses of this spot include free wifi, friendly hipster baristas, delicious coffee drinks, sinful pastries, late hours, cool midtown location, and possibly a Paul J sighting. Don't forget, BOWL OF SOUL. Seriously, go get it!
<review# 578,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2012,11/23/2012,37,82,3,13,6>Finally, I, like many have been waiting for the Pour House to open for a while now, but it was well worth the wait. I'm glad they held off the opening until everything was perfect. The interior is well designed, and had a good flow. Everything is dark wood and orange lit. The Edison bulbs are great touch. The walls in the main area are all a little different, from exposed brick to recycled barn wood and a small section around the walk in is done with tin tiles. All of the chairs and booths are wrapped in soft leather, and were actually very comfortable. My girlfriend liked the purse racks under the bar (It's all about the little things). The bartenders all dressed in prohibition era styles, to compliment the interior design. The back room is not dark like the main bar, it is actually really light. The gold danmask wallpaper really lightens the room. There is a second bar in the back that was not being used yet, so I cannot speak to its uniqueness from the main bar. One uniqueness about the Pour House is the whiskey lockers. Patrons can rent a locker to store their own (bought at the Pour House, not brought in) bottles of whiskey/bourbon/scotch. Their bottles are locked in and the renter keeps the key. The rent is two bottles per month, so this is great for the diehard whiskey/bourbon/scotch drinker, but not the casual user. We were able to try the table taps, so here is the low down on those. The server swipes a card on the table one time for each patron. The tap system allows two drinks per person, so one table of 3 people could pour 6 ounces of Jameson, and the next table of 3 could get 96 ounces*of beer. *I am assuming the beer is calculated at 16 oz, but it could be 12. The screen shows the user in ounces, how much of each they have had, and how much is remaining. That way the server can calculate payment. The server can at anytime, add guests, or clear the screen. If I had to guess, there are more than 50 different whiskeys available, and more than 100 bottled beers. There are 25 beers on tap, and a cider. I didn't get a good look at the cocktail menu, but my girlfriend had the Whiskey Fig - I think that's what it was called. It had fig jelly in it, tasted figgy, but was very tasty. I also had a sip of (and I don't know the name of it) some drink that was made with Sudwerk Hef and smoked apple butter. The smoked taste was delicious, but made me hungry. Not normal hungry, but, I want to eat a long string of smoked sausages hungry (The good kind of hungry).In summary, beautiful building, cool table tap system, lots of drink selections, great craft cocktails.
<review# 579,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2008,9/5/2008,91,74,5,5,3>I never thought I'd be gorging on chicken & waffles and downing jar after jar of sweet tea in Elk Grove. I mean, BJ's, TGI Friday's and Chili's doesn't serve that type of fare, so I'm glad when an above average restaurant comes into my town so I can break away from the monotony that is chain restaurant slop. Personally, I've never had fried chicken & waffles, but now I've seen the delicious light and it all makes sense to me now. The servings here are out of control, so I don't think anyone can complain on Table 260 skimping anybody on serving sizes. I think the only downer for me is that the food that Table 260 provides will serve you up with a mean case of "The Itis". Shamelessly stolen from UrbanDictionary.com, "The Itis" (for all you non Dave Chappelle watchers out there) is "the general feeling of lethargy and well-being experienced after eating a satisfying meal." I would of loved to take a three hour nap after eating here, but it was 6:00 and I didn't feel like ruining my sleep cycle. I know I punished my body after taking in so much of that rich goodness, so I can't see myself eating here more than once a month just for the well being of my body. I also don't eat grits very often, but the grits they served up here (aptly named "Buttered Grits") tasted like lard with fat dressing. The taste may be for some, but eating these grits explained why America is such a bovine nation. $3.25 for Sweet Tea is a rip too, even though it is some of the most delicious tea I've ever had and the refills are unlimited. Knock a dollar off of that price and I'd be more inclined to pay that. Table 260 will make you tired. Maybe even hate life and make you run three miles afterwards to make you feel a little better about yourself. But Table 260 makes fantastic food and should be visited by everybody, especially if you're a fan of decadent food.
<review# 580,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2008,9/4/2008,3,31,,6,11>SCI's main focus is on international projects, not so much for selling products.  Having said that, they're a great resource for learning about solar cooking and finding ways to get involved with promoting integrated cooking (fuel-efficient methods when there's no sun).  I use a solar oven when hikiing or camping for easy, no fuss slow cooking and it's great.  It really makes sense, especially here in the desert.  So check out the website.  There are inexpensive solar cookers you can buy or make yourself.  And there are plenty of recipes to get cooking delicious meals without using fuel.  Don't get the kids an easy bake oven.  Help them MAKE a solar cooker and learn 'em good!

It really was for my girlfriend, but I don't think he believed me.Now, after perusing the rag, I feel embarrassed: It's dirty, in a Hustler meets Nip And Tuck kinda way. Even my girlfriend, the Von Teese enthusiast, found it repulsive.Anyway, not sure why I'm sharing this, except maybe to illustrate that Newsbeat has anything and everything. Need a copy of Hamburger Eyes? They can get it. Need Maximum Rock N Roll, Issue 300? Hell, they were able to unearth that for me, too.And (this one's for you, Joe) they have FOUR different flavors of Its-Its. Oh, and they also carry those Petit Prince dark-chocolate shortbread cookies for, uh, someone besides me. Yup.
<review# 582,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/22/2007,9/2/2008,183,105,7,13,16>Wow, I really can't believe all the negativity for such a wonderful chinese restaurant!  This is easily the best chinese food I've had in long, long time.  It's clean, the food is always prepared fresh and the staff is friendly.  I highly recommend the General Chicken - it's crispy, the sauce kicks ass, and they use white meat.   Nothing is worse than places that use that crappy, stringy and tough thigh meat!  I thought the hot n sour soup was quite tasty and I didn't find it to be overly thick at all.   They make really great crab/cheese rangoons, too.Yes, you will have to drive to... *GASP!!!* ...West Sacramento to eat here.  Technically it's Southport, so maybe the fear of meth labs, pit bulls and broken down trans-ams on cinder blocks won't be quite as bad.  I mean come on, Southport sounds more like a quaint little made up soap opera town, does it not?  Hell, I live in Long Beach and we don't have chinese food anywhere near as good as this place, so you Sacramentans and "Southportians"(???)  should consider yourself lucky!
<review# 583,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/14/2007,9/1/2008,0,8,2,3,4>We started going to Tower some two three years ago on a regular, almost weekly basis. Originally, I went probably two or three times in High School and wasn't thrilled. It has become, however, the perfect hangout for my mid-twenties to early thirties return from College scene.The restaurant itself can be somewhat of a visual mess. It's a hodgepodge of touristy items from semi-obscure locales and discounted University poster fairs (I'm waiting for someone to tack a picture of Che or Ben Harper on the wall) The chairs aren't particularly comfortable and the two seater tables are, like most two seater tables, too close together.The wait-staff is fantastic. From the energetic, uber-friendly blond who I see running at CalFit, to the super-hot aloof wrestler, to the sweet ever smiling dark haired girl each waiter performs his/her task with uniqueness, grace and ease. Tower's food is kick ass. Of course, I've experienced an off day, but 99 percent of the time I'd say its close to perfect. Their burger is probably one of the best in Sacramento: good meat, super juice, very filing, and can come with jerk sauce, avocado and bacon (all highly recommended) The fries with fritte sauce are a perfect blend of potato and tangy (ie saturated fat and more saturated fat) Combine this with the burger and you've got a great evening, along with an opportunity to see the spunky blond waitress as you run off the calories the next morning. Their Carnitas and Birria are both great options for meat lovers. Neither are particularly greasy, but both offer a lot of great flavor and spice. Speaking of spice, the Guinness Beef Stew is a mouth fiesta, and is particularly good for a cold night. I've had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken only as an appetizer, and found the sweet and savory jerk sauce to be the hi-light of the dish. Try it with the Carnitas or Birria as a substitute for salsa. My mom always gets the Tower Linguine or the Salmon. The linguine is excellent, and I'm not a huge fish fan. The Salmon, well I'm still not a fish fan.Most people frequent Tower for their homemade desserts. To be honest, I've usually consumed enough calories for the majority of Landpark by the end of the meal so I've only tried dessert there a few times. Each time, however, has been a real treat. I'm terribly sad the banana cream tart is no longer available for me to at least dream of.Tower also has a great beer and wine selection. You can't beat Anchor Steam on tap.As for Mike S' view on the crowd: If you are so urban and cultural why the fuck do you care? Seriously dude, get over it. I'm an East Sacramenten and I thought I could be snobby. Remember, your Landpark is a few short lights away from Meadowview (not that there's anything wrong with Meadowview. I just think criticizing the Placer County folks is didactic and egregiously dismissive)
<review# 584,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2008,8/31/2008,268,316,5,12,11>I finally made it to La Bonne on my summer sabbatical tour of downtown lunch spots. I had high expectations, and how could one not, with all the 5 star reviews and top ranking in best of Sac Yelp. Armed with my yelp acquired knowledge of the place, I made my visit right at 10:30 when they opened. And my research paid off, there was nobody in line and I had no wait. There was a lady eating her soup sitting down who had made it there before me. I appeared to be the 2nd customer of the day.Chef Pont was polite and reserved. I enjoyed watching him make my sandwiches with care. In about 5 minutes I scurried off quickly with my soup and sanwiches, ready to sink my greedy chompers into them.The sandwiches were great, we had the proscuitto & brie and the pork loin. The ingredients were fresh and his secret sauce was what really helped pull all the flavors together. The bread is hard on the outside, but not too hard to sabotage the entire sandwich. If you eat it carefully you can avoid scraping the roof of your mouth. I came through with just a few mild abrasions. My wife said it was too hard for her liking. The brie was cut thick and was fully melted, oozing out of one side of the sandwich. Amazingly my sandwiches were piping hot even after the drive home. The pork was moist and light in flavor, definitely not too salty. It still made for a great sandwich.The cream of corn soup was heavenly. It was sweet and filled with corn goodness. I am a corn soup nut, and this really fit the bill. The cream of mushroom was also good, and had plenty of garlic. Both soups had a spicy zing to them, as noted by our 4 year old: "It's spicy, spicy like bell pepper."Looks like I will be going back often this summer, I've got the rest of the menu to explore! (I took pics of the menus and have posted them for your enjoyment.)
<review# 585,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/14/2008,8/30/2008,8,31,7,4,4>Once upon a time Streets of London was one of the best bars in Sacramento.  Great gut-bomb pub food, awesome employees, authentic juke box with selection of fun british music, fantastic beer selection, the best smoking patio around, and walking distance from my house.  And then three things happened...I quit smoking, Streets got a liquor license, and somehow Madonna showed up on the jukebox.  Good things don't always come in threes is all I'm saying.  First of all, the smoking patio is still great -- but since the liquor license appeared, the clientele has changed a bit.  Now instead of folks looking for a selection of distinct ales, you get the boys looking to shoot whiskey and play darts and the sorority chicks who love them.Dude.And the Madonna thing is still baffling -- I know she speaks in a British accent, but last I heard that didn't change the fact that she was born in Detroit, people.  It's kind of a bummer, because it used to be my old watering hole, but now you probably won't find me there unless it is on a Sunday night for Pub Trivia, which is still a REALLY good time, but not something I do on such a regular basis anymore.  The fish and chips are still ridiculous good and so is everything else on the menu in that "disgusting pub food" kind of way (I'm looking at you: Scotch Egg).Thanks for the memories, Streets -- but man, I miss ya now that you've gone to the dark side...
<review# 586,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2008,8/29/2008,43,21,9,1,4>What it lacks in appearances, it more than makes up for in griddle skills.That's right.  GRIDDLE SKILLS.  This place has 'em.Pancakes of any kind here are your best bet.  If you prefer more crunch, waffles are great too.  Whatever your griddle passions are, just be sure you can handle a mountain of fried dough with a generous helping of whip cream and whatever else you desire on your griddle goodies.Sit at the bar for quick, attentive service.  Sit, and possibly wait, for a booth if you prefer a more intimate breakfast.This place will soothe your heart and ease your mind, but your cardiologist will hate you.
<review# 587,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2008,8/26/2008,10,87,2,6,6>My child could not POSSIBLY love this place more!! I almost dread taking him there, because it's SO hard to get him to leave! But, we have a great time every time we go. You can take the Amtrak from Oakland and literally walk to Old town Sac, which is RIGHT where the Railroad Museum is. It is a fun day for parents and kids. There are TONS of HUGE trains, tons of models, 2 different Thomas set ups, and a gift shop. Plus Old Town Sac itself! You can't beat a day like that. If your wife or daughter's not interested in any of that, there is also a HUGE mall within walking distance. A great day for everybody no matter how you plan it!
<review# 588,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/1/2007,8/25/2008,305,464,6,8,10>This cute, yes I said cute (not so much from the outside), little place offers up some pretty tasty burgers.  There are two disparate menus.  One offering Chinese and the other is a typical drive-in menu of various burger variations, sandwiches, fries, shakes and whatnot.  I don't recommend the Chinese food, as it's pretty average.  But the burgers are great, not huge, but works for me.  The cute part, to my nostalgic leaning, is the old fashioned indoor counter where you can cop a squat, eat indoors and watch the Mrs. getting her cook on. The owners are very nice and friendly. Some local boys from the neighborhood seemingly followed me in, asked to borrow my cell phone to call their mom, then plopped down some change and the Mr. gave them some water.  They hung out a bit to drink their water as I, and another boy with his dad hung out a bit to enjoy burgers.  The owner was equally cordial to me (asked me a couple times how I liked my burger), the regulars (new exactly what they wanted), and the water drinking boys (didn't kick them out for ordering only water and loitering a bit in the parking lot).  If you're in West Sac (near the vague boundary of Bryte and Broderick), in a hurry, and Whitey's is too busy, then get on over to the Run.*P.S. Yes Gordon B., I let them use my phone, but I dialed their Mom's # - I'm too much of a softy.
<review# 589,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2012,12/14/2012,667,245,5,11,7>I've been waiting for years to try this place! I work downtown now so I was able to come here on my lunch break! I had The Big Vinny and it was soooo delicious! Every bite tasted like heaven! There was smoked salmon, prosciutto, goat cheese and balsamic in the sandwich. All the flavors went very well with each other and the bread wasn't too hard like some have said. I know some may think that $8 is a bit much for a sandwich that's not very big, but trust me, it's worth every dollar! I definitely want to come back to try their french onion soup. It's always the hole in the wall kind of spots that are always the best! The owner and his wife were super friendly! My order came out very fast as well. I work 3 blocks away and I was back in the office with my food in 10mins! This will defnitely be one of my go to spots for lunch from now on.
<review# 590,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2012,12/13/2012,289,200,8,18,13>I also purchased the Groupon for three massages.  I'm not sure if I realized they were massage students, but so what. A massage is like pizza... even a bad massage is better than no massage :)The place has a nicely decorated, clean and upscale waiting area overlooking Cesar Chavez park.  The vibe from the staff: very casual.  My massage was good, the therapist was professional.  Two things I really appreciated: 1) he was careful not to get lotion in my hair, and 2) when it took me 15 or so minutes to arrive, fill out paperwork, get undressed, etc., he didn't subtract that time from my massage.  Nice.My only problem is that they usually can't accommodate an appointment same day, which I am used to at places like Massage Envy (I can't plan which days I'm going to have back/neck pain!).  But I will definitely return, since the price is right (non-discounted massage is $40) and it's very close to my office.
<review# 591,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2012,12/12/2012,260,155,3,10,9>When at work this is the GO TO spot for Mexican style eatery. I have been here only a few occasions, but enough times to where I can make my assessment on La Favorita. First time I came here I just had the Guacamole and chips, and now my most recent visit I went with the super nachoes and an order of enchiladas, which you can see with my recent photo uploads. During my visits I always left more than satisfied with my meal and in much need of a nap.The menu offers a variety of items which will be an eye opener (especially during your first visit) and you'll find yourself turning your head to cover the entire menu. On my most recent visit here I noticed that they offer breakfast items, which I find useful for customers who need a pick me up during the morning, especially if you have a long day ahead of you.The prices are decent, and competitive to any other establishments through out Sacramento or near by. My order of super nachos were only $6.10 and I couldn't even finish the entire meal. Prior to receiving my order, I was able to gather together some chips and salsa, to help by pass the time waiting and made a great appetizer. I am very pleased with this location, and I see myself coming here again. A couple of my coworkers call this location their Go to spot for Friday's.So when your craving good quality food either on the go or to enjoy at their location, you defiinitely won't go wrong coming here. Your stomach will be happy, your wallet will be happy, and most importantly your taste buds.
<review# 592,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2012,12/11/2012,147,322,6,14,9>Best Ramen I've had in Sacramento. The Donkotsu (Pork Bone, not to be confused with Country Fried style Pork) stock was just perfect. The Kuro Ramen had this awesome oil on top which made it even more delicious. I generally don't want anything too fancy as far as Ramen goes, only that they have Donkotsu stock and soft boiled egg. This place has both. The stock is nice and creamy and the egg is boiled western soft instead of Asian, so the yolk is completely runny instead of mushy. The Chashu was also perfect, not too brittle and even layers of fat. It's cooked to that perfect balance of chewy and soft which is what chashu is all about. I've said this before many times but the best thing about Asian food is bone/marrow based soup. This place delivers a mean soup at 8.95USD.  If you've ever wondered what Maruchan is SUPPOSED to taste like.... go here and you'll never want that 25cent 3minute imitation ever again.
<review# 593,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/9/2012,12/10/2012,290,371,10,15,14>When we initially pulled up to Rivers Edge Cafe & Espresso I noticed it was crazy busy for a place that looked so simple from the outside. Like they say, "Never judge a book by it's cover." While this place looks like the type of cafe you could get your everyday cup of joe and favorite all American breakfast this place has something much more special than that- Stuffed Hash!!!Rivers Edge Cafe & Espresso takes all your breakfast and brunch favorites and monsters them up to another level. They've got all your comfort food favorites like Country Fried Steak, Omelets, Corn Beef and Hash, Scramblers, Breakfast Burritos and even Breakfast Fried Rice! The thing that jumped out at me the most was the The Original Stuffed Hash. Just imagine.. hash browns stuffed with bacon, sour cream & cheddar. It's like a breakfast baked potato! I enjoyed every bite of delicious, fresh creation and left satisfied for the rest of the day. Next time I think I'll go even bigger and have "The Hangover" which includes a side of biscuits and gravy.Some other things worth mentioning are their many TVs for all your sports fans, excellent and attentive service, Pepper Plant Salsa at the table and lots of parking!
<review# 594,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/23/2012,12/9/2012,390,173,15,30,22>Thanks to social media, I've become curious about two things that collide at Broderick...Wicked 'Wich food truck and Mayor Cabaldon. The first one is obviously the provider of the delicious eats found here. The second one is the loudest cheerleader for local eateries like this moving into his beloved West Sac. If you're familiar with what this stretch of West Sac. used to look like, you'll have a real appreciation for the improvements that have been made. Just look at River Walk Park as you're driving by. It could teach the City of Sac a few lessons about what to do on the other side.But I digress...it's a very dark, almost dive bar atmosphere as you walk in. Reminded me a bit of the popular Jamie's on Broadway. Especially when you factor in the surprisingly gourmet food.The bar stools were almost full at 11:45 AM on a Monday, so that's saying something about the good times to be had. Seemed to be a friendly crowd as they welcomed others to join in the fun.We sat in the empty dining room. There's a large screen tv on the wall, which thankfully provided a bit more light to the cave-like darkness. Our waitress was positively adorable. I meant to get her name just to give her a shout. (pixy red hair, feather earrings) She was very apologetic for iced tea not being ready. A short time later we were brought glasses of some of the most delicious brew I've ever tasted. Just a touch of peach flavoring to it. She remained attentive and friendly throughout.My Bleu Burger was huge, but it was dwarfed by the monstrous Pastrami 'Wich the BF got. If you're familiar with the truck, you're prepared for the sandwich that arrives with EVERYTHING inside. There's just no possibility of a normal human mouth fitting around that thing. Fries, coleslaw, and an optional fried egg made for a sandwich that he wound up deconstructing, fork and knife style.Must admit, I eventually went that route myself. The bleu cheese, grilled onions, thick-sliced bacon, and juices from the premium, perfectly cooked burger proved too much for the soft bun. We both were very impressed with the top notch meats on our sandwiches. You really can taste the quality.They were out of a few items on the already limited menu. Hopefully that's a hiccup that will be worked out over time.It's nice to know I don't have to rely on Twitter anymore to find my favorite sandwiches. And even though I love my area of Natomas, I'm compelled to root for the successful refurbishing of West Sac. This is definitely another step in the right direction.
<review# 595,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2012,12/8/2012,648,305,5,9,10>I'm so happy to review these guys. They are amazing. I have used them twice, since 2009. I'm gonna call myself out; I assumed (like an ass) that they would be flakey (student movers and all) Well, they were anything but. They were super nice both on the phone and in the person. Last time, one of the guys called to say he would be late, and he actually walked in right on time. They are hard working, fast and very trustworthy.4 movers: $100/hr? Cant beat that. Ive only had them move a piano up and down stairs, (then up again) However, in a few more months, I will be calling them to move a lot more. Check out their website! They have deals! They move in Sacramento too!
<review# 596,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/8/2012,12/7/2012,116,75,12,20,18>I stopped in here a couple weeks before my giant sushi-picnic-10th-anniversary party I threw for my husband and I and about 50 of our nearest and dearest. I'd purchased sushi grade fish from Oto's before, but heard about Sunh Fish and wondered how they compared.Immediately I was impressed with their customer service. They asked questions about the occasion, number of people, etc and made suggestions from there. Again- I was still weeks away from the party and was still simply browsing at this point. But I was sold.Two weeks later I went in with my brother (a fellow foodie) to make my 5lb purchase (which was a gift from my bro- thanks!!). Two pounds each of ahi and salmon, and a pound of hamachi (ahi $16/lb, salmon $9, and hamachi $19/lb) were now mine, all mine! Muahahaha! As if this wasn't already enough to make my day, they offered to skin it and portion it for me to make it easy to prepare for the rolls & sashimi I would be serving. Had I ever cut fish before? Well sure- how hard is this goig to be? When they invited us behind the counter and basically gave us a tutorial on how to cut where and why and what cuts to use for chopped spicy tuna roll versus straight up sashimi, etc.... my brother & I were stupified by what we were being treated to and were just gushing about how awesome these people were and how happy we were with, well, everything. The fish is the freshest, the prices are very fair, and their customer service brings a tear to one's eye. My party? Awesome. Everyone was blown away with the fish they enjoyed that day and I do believe I have turned on at least a few people to Sunh Fish. In fact, one friend/coworker has been there weekly ever since.Fish is healthy for you. Get yours at Sunh Fish. And tell them the sushi picnic lady sent you. :)
<review# 597,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2012,12/6/2012,413,239,7,16,11>I've found my favorite place on School St. I've walked pass this place hundreds of times and now. This place is amazing, from decor, wine, and their food. Inside is so cute and I've been to places that looked like this BUT HELL NO NOT IN THE 209! Instant thought of the name "the dancing fox" & look, feel of the place was the movie Fantastic Mr. Fox, or the shire. Great art work on the walls and the decore is just so cute. This is a great place to grab lunch, their sandwiches are delicious! They have a few lunch combos, I cannot say that I've had something here that I did not like.All of their food is made from scratch and organic, you cannot go wrong there. Everything is fresh and delicious. All of their desserts are awesome, I highly recommend their bread pudding.  You know a place is legit for their desserts if they have APC (American Pie Council) and the Bread Bakers Guild of America stickers on the window!! s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com Their brunch is absolutely amazing. There is a omelete cooking station where the chef cooks up omeletes for u. From fruits, omeletes, pastries, french toast, waffles, eggs benedict, bacon and sausage. Also they offer bottomless mamosas. You can dine in or site out on their patio in the great weather. The Dancing Fox is simply wonderful and a great place to go to in the city of Lodi.
<review# 598,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2012,12/5/2012,280,194,5,11,10>Tapa the World is the Brunch answer to a great meal under $30 for two. We came in on a Sunday, hungry and struggling to find a good place to chill and have a memorable bite. The weather was a little windy for the outside patio, so we choose to dine inside. Well lit with a themed Spanish interior and rounded plastered columns, the place is intimate to say the least. It was almost empty inside but provided a nice quiet environment. The waitress was busy running around but we got good service from her. We had the traditional bread with balsamic vinegar and oil for dipping. The breads also included two types: the traditional soft sweet bread and the baguette style variety. I ordered the steamed mussels and the famous traditional Paella, a mixture of Saffron infused rice with chicken, clams, mussels, scallops, and cilantro. This is their staple. It didn't disappoint in size or flavor. The steamed mussels were fresh, tender, and melt in your mouth goodness. This is different as some are more familiar with the frozen variety that is more fibrous from the frozen section at the stores. The flavor from the broth and the accompanying bread for dipping, left me to want additional orders of this dish. At around $8, you can't go wrong, there are approximately 8 mussels and all were amazingly flavorful. My brunch date had the spice rubbed tri-tip dish and steamed summer squash. It was okay for my taste. Nothing bad, nothing good, but she liked it. Prior to this, we were on a hunt to the not only the best bang for your buck, brunch place, but also one with a balance of great food, and ambiance. There are plenty to choose from, but if you want to step outside the box and sample international cuisine for the price and are not looking for greasy morning after meals, this place will carve a nice niche in your heart.
<review# 599,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/19/2010,2/27/2011,179,181,6,12,7>I'm not a raw foodist, a vegan or even a vegetarian, but I love a good vegetable-based dish, so I was open to trying the Green Boheme. Upon walking in the door, the staff was immediately friendly and helpful in explaining the concept behind the raw food diet, giving dish suggestions and explaining the ingredients in the items my boyfriend and I were interested in. I ordered the enchilada, which came with pozole and a side that looked like it could have been replacing Spanish rice but had a pleasing, crunchy slaw texture to it. The pozole was colorful, with a decent dash of spice that was warming despite the cool food temperatures. However, the clear winner of this entree was the enchilada itself. It looked innocent enough, but burst with flavor with every bite. My boyfriend ordered the no sea "tuna" sandwich, and while he enjoyed it, he lusted over the extra zing my enchilada offered. The only thing that really threw me off about the whole experience was ordering at the counter but not paying until I was finished eating my meal. It wasn't sit down service... it wasn't takeout... My best guess is they're hoping you've saved enough room to try their ice cream before you clear the bill. Maybe next time! I suspect if they opened a midtown location, I'd eat there all the time.

<review# 600,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2011,2/26/2011,156,145,9,10,12>Once upon a time I never would have believed that I would be a fan of a glutinous rice cake filled with sweet beans. I know... totally unlike me. At least thats what I thought before Osaka Ya came into my life.I had experienced mochii ice cream and mochii on frozen yogurt, but I had never has traditional mochii desserts. At first I was weirded out, but I was feeling brave and gave it a go. At first I wasn't sure what to think, but the texture of the beans and the glutinous rice quickly won me over! The shop itself is small and simple. A little cluttered, a little funky. But who cares...that to me is part of its charm! Service ranges from good, to indifferent, and sometimes endearing. For example, the nice gentleman who was very unsure about selling me mochii and ramune soda. He was very concerned that I didn't know how to open the bottle. I assure you this is not my first run in with ramune! But I appreciated his fatherly concern all the same. The earlier in the day you go - the better the selection. My personal favorite is the pancake wrapped mochii and the favorite in my office is the peanut butter chocolate chip mochii. Really how can you go wrong!

They usually have two cases full of desserts that you can purchase individually, by the slice. They also have whole desserts for purchase, as well as special orders. Desserts are on average $6 a piece which is less than you pay at a restaurant! Anything and everything chocolate here is awesome! I recommend any of the torts, tarts, bombes and cakes. I love Rick's! Did I mention I love Rick's? The interior is an old diner feel and they have mini jukeboxes at each table, I love that they have a big jug of water because you sure are going to need it for the delicious, rich desserts. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! They're open late so when your sweet tooth hits you, head on down! It's in a really cute location in midtown and there are a few patio seats outside too. They get really crowded later in the evening especially on weekends but you can usually find a place to sit or get it to go. Along with their baked goods, they also serve coffee and ice cream items as well, but heck, you must come here for the fabulous desserts. It's just like homemade, but only so much better and prettier! Their cakes are huge! Usually five layers or more! MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM! Go!!!!!

<review# 604,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2011,2/21/2011,390,173,7,12,15>Had to give Sampinos an update after trying the meatball sandwich for the first time today. Whew...that sucker is toe-curlin' good!! Everything about it was just perfect...bread, sauce, spices, size.. EVERYTHING!Loved that they're not as busy on Sat. While I was waiting for my sandwich one of the deli guys brought me an unprompted sample of their potato/leek soup. Fantastic! Creamy, but not too rich with amazing depth of flavor. Then came a sample of the clam chowder. Also very good with little bits of pancetta sprinkled in. One of each, please! Guess I'm a pretty easy sell when it's cold and dreary outside. (Didn't hurt that he was super friendly, cute and knowledgeable :)I'm always just a little happier walking out of this place than I was when I walked in. That's about all you can ask for out of any establishment!
<review# 605,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2010,2/20/2011,48,81,20,6,5>Dear dental tech,I am sorry for coming to see you the morning after my evening meal at Maalouf's. I should have shown more restraint and not ordered that delectable chicken shwarma wrap, all cozy with its tomatoes and pickles, drenched in the concentrated, creamy garlic sauce that permeated my gums all the way down to the happy root zone. I tried to brush away the remnants of hummus, babaganoush and falafel happily embedded between my teeth, but apparently, to no avail. For, despite multiple brushings and flossings prior to my visit, I could still smell the fantastic meal from the night before on my breath above the din of your dental polisher and picks. And for that, I am sorry. But, truth be told, I will have aboslutely no problem doing it to you again.
<review# 606,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2010,2/19/2011,826,495,4,8,9>If you're headed out on the town and want something nicer than a dive bar filled with hipsters but are not quite in the mood for a club and the attitude that entails, than De Vere's is the place for you.Plus, being downstairs from the Mix and down the street from the Park, De Vere's has a much better looking clientele than many other spots and as Henry, the owner, explained, the benefit for men is that women are much more approachable when they are in "bar" mode as opposed to "club" mode.Beer and mixed drinks are served quickly and for a reasonable price plus, if they're not slammed, the bartenders will actually take the time to talk with you. De Vere's also show many of the gaelic games on television, including soccer and rugby and should be a great place to watch World Cup 2010 later this year.So if you want to support a local, family-owned business check out De Vere's and Erin Go Bragh!

And yes it involves mixing beef with whiskey!  Throw "whiskey burger" into the search spot of your choice and you will find a few.Whiskey and Beef!  Whiskey and Beef!  Not that I want to see a McWhiskey on a menu anytime soon. The menu is excellent.  Great seafood, excellent pasta, and they appreciate the meatless among us by offering a 3 course vegetable tasting (no, it's not whiskey and eggplant).  Reasonable prices, nice wine list, great service.  A keeper.Whiskey and beef!
<review# 608,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/29/2010,2/17/2011,99,177,8,10,10>First, I've avoided this place since I arrived in Sactown since I'm no fan of tattoos.  However, I've been working late nights for weeks and on the night of the lunar eclipse i realized i hadn't eaten all day.  I looped around midtown and everything was closed so i knew my only options were del tacos and mcnasty's which i didn't want because i've been living on fast food, burritos and coffee through this whole crunch time.Then I passed Ink while i was driving, around 10:30 and it looked packed, which is a good sign.  I parked in front, caught a glimpse of the moon beginning to get shaded, walked up to the bar and grabbed a menu.  It's a great menu.  Good solid ingredients, something for everyone.I ordered the salmon blt sandwich, or salmon sandwich, i don't remember.  It was perfect!  Delicious!  The salmon was cooked just right, not dry and it came on a plate with fries.  Naturally I ordered a pint to wash it down.Furthermore they were watching Anchorman:  The Legend of Ron Burgundy on the TVs and everyone was having a good time with that too.So for serving an excellent high quality meal at 11 at night in Sactown, and being able to watch Ron Burgundy walk around with his bonaire, these cats get a 5 star!Happy New Year Everyone!
<review# 609,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2010,4/20/2011,189,452,8,9,8>(PARTY OF 6)Today my family/friends and I went in and decided to try THE BOILING CRAB.  We wanted to know what the hype is all about since family and friends have been raving about it in the Bay Area.  Now there is one in Sacramento, CA.  If you know where Goldielocks use to be in 65th Street/Stockton Blvd, then its right behind that place where it use to be.When we first entered, the hostess was kind enough to seat us even though half of our party hasn't arrived yet.  We had a choice of regular table with chairs or a booth.  We choose a booth.  Once we got our seats, our waitress came by to take our order for drinks.  Our waitress was extremely friendly and showed us how to order.  She also helped tied our bibs around our necks.  APPETIZERSWe started off with some deep fried calamari and deep fried oysters.  It was tasty with their spicy sauces.  I have to say the Deep Fried Oysters was the first time I ever tried in my entire life.  It was good to eat.  Both appetizer dishes was gone in about less than 15 minutes.  I guess the whole party enjoyed it.MAIN MEALAll 5 of us ordered the MILD - WHOLE SHA-BANG Dungeness Crab and one of us ordered the MEDIUM - WHOLE SHA-BANG Dungeness Crab.  We also ordered steamed rice and they came in white looking PINTS/QUARTS tubs.  It was cute containers.  One of us ordered a whole sha-bang sauce for her corn on the cob and I got butter on my corn on the cob.  Pretty good.  The corn is pretty yummy and slightly sweet.  The whole sha-bang just means adding all the spices (Rajun Cajun, Lemon Pepper, & Garlic Butter) and stuff all together. You will see when you see the menu.DRINKSThe women ordered waters and sodas.The men in our party ordered at least a total of 6 corona beers.  TAKE OUTAt the end of our meal we ordered TAKE OUT for loved ones that never came to the dinner.  They were nice enough to do that for us and without acting like it was going to be a hassle.  We ordered a pound of shrimp to go.PAYING CHECKIt was kind of messy on the way out because we got two checks. One for our dinner and one for our take out.  Keep in mind there is a 18% Gratuity added to the check...so watch out for that.*****I would love to give this place 5 stars.  No complaints so far.  I enjoyed what we've ordered.  It was a new experience for me.  Hands got dirty and even my BIB was super dirty. It's a great experience to try.============================My comment about the other reviews....I think its ridicules that people are complaining that the food tasted like there was salt water. That is just so hilarious!  It's seafood.  It's going to taste that way.  Some complained the fishy smell!  What do you expect?  It's a SEAFOOD restaurant.  It's their specialty food, so what can you do?  Why did you try it anyway if you cant handle that type of smell?
<review# 610,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2011,4/19/2011,1059,313,9,12,16>I was there on Thursday and I have to say that I had a fantastic time. When I finally arrived after going around the place in circles about 5 times and missing it, I was greeted by Tiffany N. (SF-CM) whom immediately made me feel super comfortable. Then I was greeted by a few other Yelpers.  I was feeling the love.  :)David O. rocked the house being the first one to sing... Paul and Paul, absolutely Awesome, Alex kicked butt and Katie had the drummer drooling. Tiffany really brought it and having her back up dancers really put the whole thing together beautifully (Paul does a pretty impressive running man. Ha! I loved it). I'm sure I missed a few but they were all great. I met Micah and I think he is pretty Awesome too ;) Actually quite funny... I didn't expect that. OK now to review Marilyn's on K. The place was cute, the door man was very polite, the bartender was very nice and the fact that karaoke is done with a live band just puts the cherry on top. I don't sing but... I had a fantastic time cheering for people.
<review# 611,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2011,4/18/2011,147,109,16,9,11>Eating a taco at Chando's really just makes me want to yell "CHHAAAANNDDOOOOO!!" loudly in a fashion similar to scenes in movies where the main protagonist falls to his knees and as it randomly starts pouring rain, he screams in overwhelming emotion.  Only in this movie, he yells out "CHHAAAANNDDOOOOO!!" as he bursts to tears of happiness and all his happiest childhood memories leading up to this grand moment of taco nirvana are flashed across the screen.   These tacos are so magnificent and make you feel so spectacular, "Chando!!" with a mouth full of taco seems to be the only appropriate thing to say or do at the time.Let's get serious now.  This is a fiver.  And fivers are few and far between.  Sometimes you expect it and sometimes it hits you out of nowhere.  This is a story of the latter.  This is a story of a little guy's struggle, the fight against big corporate junkies, and freedom.  Freedom for us, the people, to enjoy a beautiful combination of corn, meat, sauce and love.  Wow, maybe it just got too serious?  On with the review!My coworkers and I decided to head in after the lunch rush.  I read the reviews here and knew it would be packed, so I knew the best thing was to wait.  Patience is a virtue.  We arrived around 1pm and NO LINE!  Yay! Now, time to order.  I got the adobada, birria and carne asada, and they were out practically at the same time I ordered it was so fast.  Holy guacamole, the adobada and the birria taste like they've been marinating for days.  Topped with some sauce which wasn't too sweet, too salty or too spicy (da triple S's, or in this case, eses) but juuust right.  And of course, the carne asada, I could taste was the same stuff I smelled grilling as I pulled up.  Amazing.I was ready for seconds, especially the birria! But unfortunately I had a meeting later that afternoon I had to be awake for.  It's been one day and I'm already craving more.  I must return this weekend!Ps, for the haters:  "CHHAAAANNNDDOOOOO!!!!!"

<review# 613,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2011,4/16/2011,418,300,13,10,12>B-Dubs. That's what we called it when we lived in Louisville. One of our favorite places for sweet bbq chicken wings, watching the game and playing trivia. Finally B-Dubs has come to the Sacramento area! Bout time. When we entered the place was noisy and crowded. We had a short wait for a table. We were seated in the bar area. TV's galore. A lot of the servers looked like Katy Perry with a ponytyail. Our server was top notch. Kinderlee B. was perfect. She was genuinely friendly and had perfect timing. we ordered a round of beer. Newcastle and Blue Moon. Then we ordered the sweet bbq wings and some fries. While waiting for our food to arrive we played the Trivia Games. I was usually in second place behind somebody named Seka. "I'll take 80's porn stars for 200 Alex." The food arrived pretty quickly. Right in the middle of a trivia battle royale! The tricky part is eating the wings while playing trivia and not getting the sauce all over the trivia keyboard. had to use my big toe. That slowed me down. Some guy named "Pizza" was gaining on me. I left him in the dust with the music trivia. Eating sweet wings in one hand, destroying the competition with my big toe. The wings were just as I remembered. Delishious. The sauce was excellent...as sweet as I remember. The fries with the cheese were good too. Welcome to Sacramento B-Dubs!
<review# 614,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2010,4/15/2011,209,356,17,10,8>I consistently find cheap, good quality clothes, housewares, and odds and ends here. The store is well organized and the staff is pretty friendly most of the time.All in all, it's one of the better thrift shops in Sacramento, but I'm knocking 1 star off for three reasons:1. That bathroom is unreasonably horrid.2. They half-assedly attach tags, which fall off as soon as anyone touches the item, then don't allow you to purchase the item, even if you beg and use the puppy eyes. You have to come back at opening the next day and hope that no one else has purchased it after they've priced it and returned it to the rack. Bitch, please.3. They sell rancid looking toiletries that probably have new life forms growing in them. Yech. At least they keep them contained in a glass case so they don't burst out and start attacking shoppers.
<review# 615,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2010,4/14/2011,354,195,4,6,8>LIke I really need to write a review that will tell you something the others have not already written about the awesomeness of this place, but Im going to write one anyway...Shabu is a great, fun, entertaining place that you will love to bring people to. The BF and I along with two of his new to Sacramento friends ventured over to Shabu and had an amazing three hour dinner. Yes three hour dinner due to the fact that our table ordered the unlimited all you can eat and drink for $41(per person) That comes with 3 different meats (American Kobe, Lamb, Chicken) Udon noodles, rice, veggies (carrots, mushrooms, spinach, sprouts, ect) any beer you want and your hot sake. Oh and lets not forget your dessert (I had green tea, I dont remember what the other option was)Half way through the amazingly delicious spicy miso broth the boys basically said "F*ck the veggies, can you just bring us out plates of meat and keep it coming with the sake and beer?"Of course they obliged and the boys filled up on more meat plates and tiny cups of sake possible. I love the way I was in charge of what I put in my little soup dish. I LOVED the citrus soy sauce (soy sauce with lemon squeezed in??) I LOVED the spicy miso broth, I LOVED that I was cooking my meat in the broth and not in hot oil like I assumed I would be cooking it in and I loved that the waitress could put up with the obnoxiousness of our table, okay the obnoxiousness of my BF. Great Job Shabu! I will return.

<review# 617,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/1/2010,4/12/2011,356,378,5,14,8>Yelp came to the rescue again. This time I was in search of soup in downtown and Muntean's popped up. Although I had to trek across downtown to get here, it was well worth the trip. It was a little past noon when me and my coworkers finally made it and a line was already forming out the door! While my coworkers stood in line, I mozied my way to the front to see what soups they were offering for the day. One of the staff was nice to have given me a sample even though I was technically cutting. Hehe. Chicken minestrone, you got me. I ordered the jumbo cup (which isn't all that jumbo) for 5-something but each spoonful was hot, flavorful and comforting. If you don't like soups, they also offer a variety of sandwiches as well, but by ordering them, you'll probably be clogging up the soup line! Stay warm and have some soup, my friends! It was really good!
<review# 618,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2011,4/11/2011,410,518,4,10,8>I can describe Pizza Rock as the rebellious love child of Chicago Fire and Uncle Vitos. This place screams rock and roll (literally) . With the booths disguised as speakers, guitar on the ceiling, a truck coming out of the wall (not sure what that's about), and loud music. Nestled between Dive Bar and District 30. It was a Wednesday and this place was packed! There was a 50 min wait at 7pm.. but that's OK since you can go to Dive Bar and wait to be buzzed to be seated. Crowd: mid 20's -30 type crowd. Definitely not a date place or family friendly. This spot is for you and an awesome group of friends. People tend to be dressed a lot cooler/hip/fashion forward..etc here. But that may be because they're headed to either Dive Bar or District 30 after. Food: It was good enough. For appetizers, we ordered the Calamari Fritti and St. Germain Wings. There is plenty of calamari. I think it could feed four as opposed to two. It definitely was too much for me and the bf. I was under the impression that the wings were going to be spicy, but they weren't spicy at all. Oh well! Pizza: There are categories of different pizzas to choose from based on oven type, temperature, and sauce. We chose the classic American category and ate the Sacramento 16. We decided to stay on the safe side and the bf wanted the pizza with the most meat..so you know how that goes. I can't wait to try out the other pizzas!!Dessert:  Tried the honey pecan gelato.... super yummy!!!  You have to try it!  I really wanted the Tiramasu, but they were out.  Service:  Two thumbs up.. three if I had another hand.  They were very attentive and we definitely didn't wait long for our appetizers, pizza, or dessert.  Nor were waiting for the check very long.  I'll definitely be back!
<review# 619,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2011,8/26/2011,319,199,5,12,8>Allright, I have two previous reviews on the old Mati's location and am happy to say that Mati's in Midtown delivers the same great Indian food, in an even better location. The chicken tikka masala is everything you would expect from a good Indian restaurant. GREAT sauce, thick and savory with large chunks of white meat chicken. The lamb vindaloo is also delightful. Very spicy, tasty, authentic, and again the meat was excellent. The best part is ordering two delicious meat dishes served over rice for around $7. For real, you get a whole plate of great Indian food for HALF THE PRICE of "some other" Indian restaurants in midtown **cough** bombay bar & grill **cough** pretentious rip-off  **cough**.Oh, did I mention the service? Well I should, because they are some of the friendliest people you will ever run into at any restaurant environment, counter service or otherwise. Happy, helpful, generous and a pleasure to deal with. Lastly, the new location is nice and clean with lots of booth seating to enjoy your reasonably priced deliciousness in. Also, a fountain drink machine... you know, because Indian food pretty much requires access to free flowing beverages. _____A few things on my Mati's "wish list" +++ BEER +++ (update... THEY HAVE BEER! Hooray!)Honestly, I don't even care what kind. I just love a beer with spicy food. +++ A Chutney bar +++Think Mexican takeout style salsa/sauce bar, but the Indian version. Nothing fancy, just a self serve chilled bar of various chutneys.  +++ Later hours +++The more post-midnight eating options in midtown, the better. How great would it be to consume a deliciously massive plate of Mati's after a night of heavy drinking? I'm told they are looking to see if business warrants the extra hours and will consider staying open later this summer!
<review# 620,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2011,8/25/2011,97,108,11,13,14>I don't have words for the glory that is the mini burger truck.... The very first time I heard of the mini burger truck, I followed the tweets and it sent me into downtown Sac where we then drove aimlessly up and down the street that they last tweeted about. The boyfriend drove in exacerbated fury because I was convinced that we somehow just didn't see the giant burger truck and refused to give up but eventually I went home disappointed. BUT NOW I FIIINNNNND YOOOUUU!First off, I love that they give their schedule in advance on their website because I like to plan out my meals. They were near my house today so I walked there and was filled with glee when I recognized the truck. It's a super simple menu and I got the 3 burgers for $8 deal. I got the cowbell, Da Philly and the seasonal burger which is some combination of prosciutto, brie and apple ON TOP of a burger. I topped that all off with sweet potato tots and an ice cold iced tea. I was basically the only person in line when I ordered and it still took a while for my food to arrive. Because I was the only one, I had the benefit of sitting back and imagining the care and detail they were putting into my food but I imagine the wait would have sent me into a hangry fury if there were more people there. The burgers themselves were SO good. It's like children, you know? Where everyone says there's no favorite but there kinda is? Da Philly was probably my least favorite, but still loved. Cowbell delivers but is kinda predictable and safe. But the seasonal with prosciutto? You are my star. Not to be outdone, the sweet potato tots were awesome. All in all, spectacular.
<review# 621,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2011,8/24/2011,35,60,7,11,10>Its nice to get a home-cooked meal from a restaurant literally a stones throw away from home.  This humble Vietnamese-Thai restaurant was many things before it was this.  I remembered when it was a seafood cafe and a cajun foods place before it became its present day incarnation.  This is a great place to grab a home style meal, if your home is southeast Asia.I must be honest, I prefer the Vietnamese side of the menu over the Thai side.  Of the Thai side, I tried the Chicken Larb salad and Pad Thai.  Both dishes were average with lots of fresh produce and herbs, but was not the best dishes I have had.I think the winning dish here is the stir fried beef with mint and lemon grass served over rice vermicelli noodles.  I will preference this by saying that my dad makes this dish all the time and I grew up with it.  So when I found this dish here it had a high standard to go against.  The fresh mint and lemon grass is perfect with the tender stir fired beef and onions.  Its served very simply over the noodles and a side of sweet and spicy fish sauce.  I personally don't really use the fish sauce and the flavors of this dish does fine without the sauce.  I ask that it is made spicy and I love it.  This is a must try if you come by.  Simple, fast, delicious!The spicy beef noodle soup (Bun Bo Hue) here is also Grade A.  Rich beef broth and amazing spice.  If you love spice, you gotta try this.  A hot bowl of this on a cool night will warm you up and fill you up.  When made spicy, it makes me drip sweat from my brow and I love it.  All and all, great little restaurant.  A winner in my book because it suits my taste palette!  If you are up for spicy foods, come here and ask for things to be made SPICY!  You will not regret it.  This place leaves me with a good sweat, burnt out tongue, but a satisfied belly!

I want to spend my whole paycheck here...I have my eye on a purse, so I'll definitely be back. Walked out with a pretty sweet fedora and a smile from the experience. This is exactly what Sacramento needs - More locally owned shops that offer great selections that are unique enough to be cooooooooool, yet a price tag that doesn't make you broke as a joke. She really has impeccable taste - going to LA once a week! or was once a month? Either way......She's dedicated! You've got to go in to see the deer head on the wall, I mean, come on!I heart Heart.

They have a lot of good products and imported items for those of us looking for ingredients for our Mediterranean recipes. They also have a fresh vegetable section, a full service butcher (awesome since they carry a lot of cuts of meat (beef, lamb, chicken) that you can't find anywhere else. Where else can you fine and entire side of lamb? Perfect pieces to make large ethnic dishes. Their restaurant looks good; I haven't eaten anything from it yet. Their bakery though, OMG, fresh bread, baked right in front of you. It is really really really good. Also they have a few garments from the Middle East, they look nice, but I Think they are a bit pricey. Really great assortment of Hijab (or head scarfs). Also, here is was sold me on them. I bought a hookah pipe from them; their prices really can't be beat. I know, I've been shopping around town for one for a while now. I took this pipe home and the hose didn't work at all. I took it back the same day, and stupid me I couldn't find the receipt to save my life. They were very courteous to me and allowed me to exchange it. This is a family owned business and the staff is very very very nice. They are from Iraq, and they even chatted with me in limited Turkish, which I really enjoyed. Way to go, I really hope this works out for the family, and it stays nice and clean. I recommend this place to anyone. I am however waiting to see if they fill out their spices and curred meat/cheese/olive stock.
<review# 626,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2011,8/18/2011,249,49,10,12,10>You've all seen it... that big "Wilson Trophy" sign from I-80. After doing business with them, I now feel like giving everyone I know some kind of trophy, medal, plaque or certificate! If you have a leadership role in a league, club, association, organization, etc., know that there were great people who helped you along the way. Make them feel super special with an award they can proudly display. Where do you get that award? Wilson Trophy. I can honestly say that I, myself, was proud to give such an attractive looking plaque of gratitude away. I can also see how this would be a fun place to get comical gifts... like a happy birthday bowling trophy for a friend who has never been bowling, or a medal for the friend who always arrives late (I deserve that one). Appreciation plaques would be nice for that special person/people in your life who make the best chicken adobo EVer. (That would go to my parents, by the way.) Oh, the ideas!You've got a lot to choose from at Wilson Trophy since they have such an assortment. Keep in mind that there's a HUGE difference in aesthetic between the website photos and the actual products. Go to the store and check 'em out in person. In case you're curious to know the kinds of awards they offer: wilsontrophy.com  As far as prices go, I've done a lot of web surfing to find that the prices and array of choices here are awesome! They even have sale items to help with costs. There's a setup/engraving fee of $25. The turn-around to get something is about 3-5 business days if I'm not mistaken, however, if you need an award created at shorter notice, even as soon as the day of, there's a $40 rush fee. The people at Wilson deserve a trophy for the awesome service they provided me! I wonder if they give each other trophies from their own store...? Hmm. ANYway, lol, they were really patient and accommodating over the phone and in person while handling my last minute request. I'd recommend this business to anyone.

It's not a chain (how rare of a find in Elk Grove)Upon walking in, the man behind the counter greeted my friend and I with a big smile. He had tons of energy, and gave us a little spiel on his favorite dog and popular customer favorites. He sold me on the western dog (his personal favorite).The sight of a perfect hot dog, wrapped in adequate bacon with BBQ sauce, tomato, and onion ring, I wanted to tear up with joy. Oh yeah, there was a hot dog in there too! I enjoyed my hot dog, but to be honest, I love anything with bacon.Heavenly dog is a refreshing change in Elk Grove, amongst the infinite supply of chains and franchises. I will happily choose this any day over BJs or In n' Out!

I must have driven around the place three times before I finally stumbled across it's threshold, mere SECONDS before I would have smashed my gps to pieces. (I'm quite fussy when hungry)I don't quite remembered what I ordered. (Crystal something or other) I'm not even sure I waited for the host to get us seated. What I DO remember is the kitchen sending out this MASTERPIECE of Eggs, Ham, and Cheese sitting atop a pillowy biscuit and SMOTHERED to death in the most amazing (one could say  orgasm inducing) sausage and pepper gravy I have ever had the pleasure of consuming.Note to Self: No matter how delicious it looks, consumption by inhalation is never a good idea no matter how ingenious it may seem at the time.Before I knew it, I was mopping up the remainder of my gravy (using my partner's breakfast potatoes of course) while absentmindedly contemplating whether my grossly distended stomach had room for seconds.Gluttony is never pretty, but hot DAMN if it isn't just the ticket every now and again.
<review# 629,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2011,4/29/2012,562,500,16,20,17>While I was at the order counter joking with the really nice lady that owns Empanadas 'n Buns, I kept thinking this place was a little on the expensive side.  After all, the empanadas by my house are a buck fifty at the most. We ordered smoothies and were told they have been phased out.  I am thinking "are they too lazy to make a smoothie"?  Hmmm!  Over priced empanadas and no smoothies "maybe I should have gone someplace and ordered a hamburger"?The lady disappears into the back of the restaurant and I hear chopping sounds followed by the sound of food cooking.  A few minutes later, out comes our order of spectacularly gorgeous, flaky, freshly fried empanadas.  The baked empanadas by my house, sitting cold in a display case, may be overpriced in comparison to these culinary masterpieces.One bite and you know you have something special.  I love meat pies but they even pale in comparison to these exquisite pastries filled with meat and veggies.  I ordered the pork and my daughter ordered the artichoke and we both absolutely loved them.Do I really think they need to be messing around with smoothies instead of using the time to pour their heart and soul into the wonderful items on their menu that are so unique to our area?
<review# 630,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/22/2012,4/28/2012,141,309,9,12,11>The bad reviews for this place based on their service are funny. Get a sense of humor! The guy who helped us out this morning was hilarious! There were some tourists in front of me paying while I was filling my basket, and I kept hearing him deadpan, "Sir, I'm going to need you to open your wallet again." At first I thought he was being rude, but then I saw that he was paying for his wife and children's candy :)He kept joking with us all through checkout and made sure to have us leave with yet another sample. He opened it in my hand so I didn't see what it was, and he said, "Put it under your tongue." OWWW!! It was one of those sour punch-you-in-the-tongue mini candies. My eyes watered and he laughed! Not maliciously - just old-school slapstick humor. He yelled out, "Sucker!" on my way out. Everyone in the store was laughing and munching on samples.I, for one, appreciate a little humor like this :)
<review# 631,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2011,4/27/2012,534,268,9,11,13>Believe it or not, my date took me here! Well, of course right after lunch. He was like, "let's get dessert," and I was down, but kind of expecting some like frozen yogurt. Well, he took me to get MOCHI and SHAVED ICE! Man... now I'm in LOVE!A-total-whole-in-the-wall-place, but man, it was delicious!So, we got:(1) A variety Mochi pack: comes with green tea, strawberry, peanut butter, and red bean - delicious! Wasn't too sweet, very soft, chewy, not too sticky and gummy inside. 4 stars!(2) Shaved-ice: basically, there two areas, inside the store, which sells the mochi goods, and the outside is the shaved -ice. Yup, you'll have to order from the outside and you are not allow to bring the shaved-ice back inside the store. So, buy your dessert good first and then get shaved-ice. As for the flavors - I got watermelon mixed with lime - sweet and sour! 5 stars!The only downside is that they take cash only and other than that it's pretty awesome.**OVERALL: shaved-ice on a cold day is better than frozen yogurt. 4 stars!

<review# 633,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/13/2012,4/24/2012,642,604,12,20,16>When I started hearing about a new store in town, I kept wondering what the name "Fresh & Easy" implied.  Was it really going to be THAT fresh AND easy?  So after some grand opening crowds finally died down, my boy friend and I decided to give it a try.  Upon entering, It immediately felt a little like entering a Trader Joes.  Just another small neighborhood market.  But as we perused the aisles, there was not only standard grocery items, but an impressive variety and selection of packaged foods put together to make some enticing meals for quick heat and serve lunches or dinners.  Now, if you can't decide what you are hungry for, then you can visit the refrigerated or freezer section and see what looks appetizing all in one store.   Ethnic foods, meats, chicken, fish/seafoods, pastas, salads, veggies, fruits, desserts, and even some baked goods.  You'll find everything listed on the "food pyramid" here.Fresh and Easy carries alot of their own store brand products along with other popular brand names at competitive prices.  All fresh foods are prepared and stored in recyclable containers, labeled with the ingredients and expiration dates clearly displayed.  It's true that most grocery stores offer the same types of convenience meals, but the variety and options are a little more extensive here.When the time comes to check out, it is all done with self check out registers.  And of course, staff members are right there to help if you hit a glitch or don't understand how to use the machines.  A store with a different twist in ones food shopping experience that furthers us into a more modern era of one stop shopping when you just don't have the time to cook!youtube.com/watch?v=Sv0K
<review# 634,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2012,4/23/2012,294,325,4,17,13>You want to change opinions on your restaurant? You want better reviews? You want to go from a three star review (IMO, that's a good review) or less, to a better review? Follow the example of this place...I'm bumping my review from three stars to five stars. I've been here quite a few times. I used to come in here with Cameron when we first moved back to Sacramento. The last time I came here, I just had a soda and sat at the back of the restaurant on my computer (using their free wifi). First off, that's very nice of them to offer free wifi (especially when I only bought a refillable soda). I didn't eat here this visit. As I was sitting at the table, busily sending out my resume, someone came up and asked if I was a customer who came in with his son and would sit at a different table. I said, yes that was me. She told me it was very nice to see me again, and she was happy to have me back. I thanked her and thought she was kind to remember me. Then about ten minutes later, the owner came over to me and introduced herself, and told me how happy she was to see me again. She too, remembered me coming in with my son quite a few months prior. She was very sweet. Now, I remember my review for this restaurant. And I remember what I said about this restaurant. And I know that they remember my review and what I said about this restaurant. And that review was many among dozens that have been done (and yes, the owner told me that she remembers my review). The impression that leaves me with, is that they took to heart what I said. I love the food here. Some of the best Medi food you can find in Sacramento. But what got me, is that they remembered what I had said months prior about being standoff-ish. It's not that I thought they were being rude, I just believed it was a cultural difference. But when I came back, they went out of their way to make me feel comfortable, wanted. They were being the opposite of standoff-ish. And that SO IMPRESSED ME! It shows me that they take to heart what their customers think of their restaurant, their food, their culture, and everything that embodies them. Because of this, I will always be a huge supporter of this place. Not just with my patronage (I will come back many more times), but also with my recommendations to other people. Whenever someone is looking for somewhere to eat downtown, this will be one of the first places that I recommend. Look, eating food and critiquing it is not very stable. We can say what we want, be it good or bad, depending on many factors OTHER than what we just ate. To take what someone says about you or your food (as constructive criticism) and make a change based on that...shows growth and dedication. I appreciate that whole-heartedly.Please, if you're downtown and are looking for some good food with GREAT EMPLOYEES, try the Crest Cafe. You can't go wrong.
<review# 635,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/20/2012,4/21/2012,337,422,18,7,6>Seriously??What the hell do you expect when you are at a gym that is located right next to a 24-Hour Wal-Mart? This spot by far, exceeded any expectation I was going to have for them.Just like California, this gym is a melting pot of people - every race inhabits this place, classy && trashy!Note to grown men: STOP wearing your sponge bob square pajama pants to the gym, you look like an idiot!!I'll let you all in on a little secret - people don't take care about the equipment because they aren't personally invested in it. You get what you pay for. If you want a perfect gym, go get a membership at the Capital Athletic Club, you are in the wrong spot!The staff here are constantly changing, but there have been a few who have stuck around for a long time. They are always friendly, especially Heather one of the front desk girls - she's so sweet! Almost all of the front desk remember most people by name and greet you. The trainers are great and will help you out, don't be afraid to ask.Don't let the area scare you, this gym is pretty good. Besides the Super Sports in our 40 mile radius, this is the newest 24 Hr. Sadly, there is no pool, sauna, or steam room - but I get it, those are too luxurious for the hood-ies, huh?!?To be honest, I'd rather you not come here so it won't be too crowded. A little thick skin is needed, but really just plug your ear buds in an no one will bug you...for the most part.Hooooood-tastic :)
<review# 636,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/31/2011,4/20/2012,794,137,5,15,11>I stand corrected: this restaurant is a winner!  After not having been for 4-5 years, I went back to give it another whirl with my better half and a couple of friends.  Turns out, this is a great little dining spot.Let's start with the value.  Maybe I'm getting old and my memory is fading (always a serious possibility), but I think Lucca's prices are more reasonable now.  Perhaps they've always been this way, but I thought that the entree prices ranged from $12 to $19, most falling right at $15 or so, this place is a bargain on quality and ambiance.Among other things, I was very impressed with the cocktails.  Sometimes we ignore the cocktail menu all together and go for the wine, but on this occasion, our table tried a number of Lucca's fabulous libations.  The big winner for me was Spring Thyme, a lovely little blend of vodka, peach bitters, fresh blackberry and (you guessed it!), fresh thyme.  It was dry and herbal with just a hint of sweetness, and very very smooth.  The jalapeno martini was another big hit at the table, and I stole a few sips from my hubbie.  It was perfectly balanced: not too spicy but definitely plenty of jalapeno flavor.  We also ordered a pitcher of red sangria for the table, which was very tasty and filled with fresh fruit.For appetizers, we tried the famed Parmesan Fries with black truffle dip.  Lord knows I LOVE a good fry, and this my friends is a very good fry.  They were perfectly crisp on the outside, and pillowy on the inside.  And the dipping-sauce had a delightful black truffle kick.  We also had the shrimp bruschetta.  I was less impressed with that.  It was supposed to be spicy, and I'm not sure it really achieved enough spice, but overall it was still pretty good.Entree-wise, the big winner of the evening was certainly my friend's Spaghetti Carbonara with delicious grilled pork belly.  After he graciously shared a taste, I almost grabbed his plate and made a run for it!  The pork belly was fork-tender and absolutely melted in the mouth.  The carbonara (a delicious but frequently destroyed Italian sauce) was perfectly cooked with plenty of delicious, flavorful egg yolks.  When I return to Lucca, I'm getting a full plate of this for myself.I tried the gnocchi with chili-tomato sauce and spicy sausage.  I could have done with the gnocchi being slightly less cooked (i.e., a little softer), but that's how I prefer to make them at home.  Overall, they were still fluffy and flavorful, and the sauce was solid.  My husband had the lamb flatbread, and we both felt that it was a bit heavy on the tapenade but otherwise, very good.  There's no question that the meat they use here is very high quality.  I'm curious to come back and try one of their Lucky Dog Ranch steaks.Overall, we had a great time with fantastic service in a beautiful little midtown restaurant.  I'm excited to see how the menu changes and evolves seasonally, and we'll definitely be adding Lucca to the rotation.
<review# 637,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2012,4/19/2012,343,568,11,10,13>This is exactly what I do NOT need so close to home!!  Are you kidding me?!  A case filled with gorgeous, delectable treats, all screaming my name!  It's like the dessert version of going to the pound and having all the doggies look at you with their big, sad eyes, begging you to take them home. OK so it's not that sad, but you get the picture.This shop is attached to and owned by the same family that owns Opa Opa, but is in a separate room (so they don't have to charge sales tax on the sweets). Way to stick it to the man!!  Topped with chocolate!!There is a small variety of bars/cookies, and a couple of cakes/cheesecakes by the slice.  But the stars of the show are the individual desserts. Imagine, if you will, a cylinder about the size of a cookie, 4-5" tall, made out of pieces of HEAVEN. NY cheesecake, chocolate mousse, chocolate raspberry, and more!  All for $4.99.  Luckily my dining partner made the choice on which one to split, otherwise I'd still be standing there in a cold sweat staring into that heavenly case.  We split a Boston Cream pie, which was surprisingly light and fluffy, not rich or heavy. The layers of fluffy cake and cream covered in ganache, what a great way to end a meal!  Unfortunately, I'll HAVE to come back and try the rest of them!!
<review# 638,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2011,4/18/2012,299,309,7,7,6>Very pleasantly surprised.  I was told this place was good, and I was told this place is very authentic, but wow. What a find. Some of the best Chinese food I've ever had the privilege to stuff into my face. Like usual in a new Chinese restaurant, I ordered the shrimp fried rice (I believe I can sum up the cooking ability of a Chinese restaurant by their shrimp fried rice).  We also ordered their Mongolian Beef, the Honey BBQ Pork, a side of steamed rice, and a large Hot and Sour soup (another item I think totally shows the cooking ability of the place).  The food: shrimp fried rice = A++, amazing!  Hot and Sour soup = B+, pretty decent but not the best I've had, not complaining, it just didn't have as much of a kick to it as I would have liked. So according to my theory, the rest of the food should be pretty decent... And it was.  Mongolian Beef was amazing, possibly the best I've ever had.  The BBQ pork however, wasn't my favorite dish, it just tasted funny, and it won't be ordered again. All in all, I LOVE this place, and will now be a regular.*UPDATE: This place does use MSG (a food flavoring similar to salt - meant to enhance the flavors of the food) in their food, so if you believe MSG to be harmful to you, be sure to ask for "no MSG."  However, -disclaimer- there is no scientific proof MSG has any harmful effects beyond those already known to be associated with common table salt (in case you were wondering).
<review# 639,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/19/2007,2/27/2007,33,52,10,2,3>Bla bla bla.  That is the essence of Monkey Bar.  Nothing new or exciting about this place.  Just another bar for the young'ins to gather in and let their loins swell.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the place is just so... I don't know... unapologetic?  Blunt?  Basically, it's brutally honest in its failure at being a posh, upscale hangout, and it doesn't  really try too hard to hide it.  It's like, eh, whatever, ain't no thang but a chicken wang, we trashy!  If this were the commonly accepted opinion of Monkey Bar I think I wouldn't have a problem with it, but because the majority of the clientele believes that they are chillin at the HAWTEST place in the 916, I require a large dose of liquid oblivousness before I even arrive at this fine establishment.

I also liked the hamachi, it was  very fresh. the pepper fin sashimi was spicy and good. the food made me very happy. i did not like enoki appetizer very much. it had a strong taste. maybe i would have liked it more with rice. the wine was good match for what i ate. amy, the waitress, was friendly and very nice. i liked the strawberry candy they gave me at the end of my meal. next time i'm here from tokyo i would go back:)
<review# 641,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/18/2007,2/25/2007,4,2,,4,2>But for the coconut based soup this establishment merits only two stars.  We went out Friday night, so one would expect the waitress to be busy, but her rush precluded eye contact and included a knack for running away while simultaneously serving the dishes---an amazing feat!  I even asked her to slow down a bit--maybe I was rude--but this was extreme.  As before mentioned, the coconut based soup is absolutely wonderful and is alone enough to merit a return trip.  The Pad Thai was also quite good, though the red curry was more spice than flavor.  I'll try next door next time I am in the area and looking for Thai food as this place is generally unremarkable.
<review# 642,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/7/2007,2/24/2007,108,68,14,3,5>Why is it the few times I've patronized this rape of the sea freeze-fest there's always a Klump family reunion singing hallelujahs over their tumbling tower of shattered shellfish? Cheddar Bay Biscuits be damned, those things should be outlawed as they clearly contain copious quantities of crack cocaine - how else to explain my fortnightly craving?Sometimes my dish of fish is brought out with an accompanying medley of flavorful seasonings, caressing my palate on a coasting wave of drawn butter and bodily negligence. Sometimes my sad little shrimps sit there looking at me in a curlicue of dessicated misery. There seems to be no pattern to the cruel whims of the soux chef and the heat lamps.I marvel at the tacky, incandescent splendor that is corporate Middle-America's concept of a captain's bountiful sea-shanty. I never knew nautical thematics could be implemented and abused in so many ways. I love the lobster tank featured at the front of the lobby - I have serious doubts as to whether or not one's choice of crustacean actually ends up on one's plate, but what a high-end concept eh? How fancy. Hahaha. Look at those goddamn slobs there in the khaki shorts and flip-flops, why aren't they in their best Bugle Boys and windbreakers like all the other classy patrons?Oh for God's sake. Just eat your crab claws and suck down your soda.(Do you wonder why I wrote this and yet prescribed three stars?

<review# 643,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2007,2/23/2007,3,74,,10,8>My boyfriend was driving through a residential area in Sacramento.I was thinking that we were on our way to the Holiday Inn where our friends' wedding was held. He then started parking in the middle of the street. I was puzzled.When I stepped outside to figure our what was going on, I found a beautiful golden plate hiding in the vine, that said, "Amber House".Then I realized that this was a little surprise from my boyfriend.when we rang the door bell, friendly yet professional staff came out and led us in to their lobby area. They had comfortable sofas and well chosen antiques. Our room wasn't ready yet, so we went off to the wedding. When we came back and opened the door, there were rose petals beautifully spread through out the room. Also on the coffee table we had some home made cookies and tea waiting for us. The bathroom was clean with the bonus of cute bath tub that fits two. We enjoyed their lavender bubble bath and the great stereo system built into the wall.In the morning coffee was already waiting by the door.Breakfast was served shortly by a cheerful lady. She started us off with a bowl of fresh fruits carefully chosen, along with crispy baked croissants.Up next was delicious quiche and OJ. We were left happy and full.I totally loved the stay at the Amber house. We were taken care of very well. I felt like a princess!All of their rooms are styled differently. I can't wait to go back.
<review# 644,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2007,2/22/2007,37,28,3,3,5>You know it's going to be a delicious dinner when the salivating begins more than twenty-four hours before the actual meal. That's how I feel about Tucos in Davis. As Yvonne mentions below, college towns do tend to cater to young, broke students who might be void of tastebuds after one-too-many beer bongs of Natty Ice. BUT, there should be choices: cuisines and prices that appeal to a wider audience...that's where Tucos comes in. Tucos offers innovative and delectable foods that leave your tastebuds dancing and cheering for more. Our family went to Tucos to celebrate my Mom's birthday. They must have known she was coming because they put on her favorite Mexican ballad singer: Luis Miguel. Ten points for mood music for the birthday girl! (And I'm very serious about that being her favorite music.) We ordered the Cafaro Cabernet, and while I felt that it wasn't spectacular, I can't complain because we chose the bottle ourselves. (For those of you who want to experience the wide variety of wines, they offer flights for sampling. They have a few different themed flights for you to choose from, including a Sake selection.) We started off with a dozen oysters, a mix of: Marin Miyagi, Olympia, Kumumota and Wellfleet. What a perfectly luxurious way to start out a meal. Then, after the ideal wait time (short enough to properly feed your hunger in a timely manner and long enough to feel secure that they didn't "warm" anything up) our food arrived. My mom started with the Cream of Turnip soup with cooked swiss chard, and I had a plain, mixed green salad with warmed goat cheese. The soup was delicious! Very innovative flavors...I tasted an aftertaste of nutmeg or something similiar. Then my balls arrived...my Niman Ranch Lamb MeatBALLS that is. They were dripping in some sort of gravy looking wine sauce. YUM! So far, so good. My dad ordered the Bison, and although the portion size was small...it was worth it! The meat melts in your mouth like a handful of M&M's in the summertime. My Mom ordered a Piri Piri chicken breast with mashed butternut-potatoes and greens. This chicken was so light and fluffy..is that even possible? Soooo juicy! My brother ordered a bison burger and again, the portion size was small but he enjoyed it thouroughly. Overall, our experience at Tucos was brilliant. From our delicious meal, the vast wine and beer selection, the owner who was present and actively overseeing the restaurant activities, to our spectacular dessert...Tucos will be seeing our family again in the near future.

<review# 646,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/7/2006,2/18/2007,341,1031,8,3,3>This store is INSANELY huge.  I have to give it only 3 stars because sometimes it's hard to find what you're really looking for when you want it.  It's a good place to kill time when you're in the Sac area and you want an electronics fix.  They have everything from power cords to porn, massage chairs, and lots of computer techy stuff too.  I bet a motivated nerd could find all the necessary elements to build a robotic woman in this Fry's.ps - their security is HOT!ETA - I had to up them to 4 stars because on my last visit I sat in the massage chairs for about 30 mins.  soooooooooooo nice!

<review# 648,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2007,2/16/2007,217,602,1,2,2>I'm not a mac person. I'm more of a PC gamer. I guess that means I look like the doofus on the left in all of the PC/MAC commercials that are so popular right now.  At least that would explain why I have this internet cam taped to my head.Anyhoo...When I was living in Davis these people really took care of me and my iPod. Everytime I would drop/bite/pee on/throw my iPod they would take my reservation to the GeniusDesk online, I'd drive over there, and they would promptly give me a replacement. For free. No waiting. Very litle explanation.Yippie!
<review# 649,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2012,3/26/2012,432,335,6,10,13>Devout fans of the highly revered Chef Pont....unfortunately, I didn't have the pleasure of making his acquaintance before the change in ownership.  I had passed by the cafe numerous times, catching a whiff of something delicious in the air, but always deterred by the long line snaking outside of the door and onto the sidewalk.  "Someday I'll stop in" I thought to myself.  The day finally arrived but Chef Pont was already long gone.  The nice couple that now runs the place do an efficient job of it.  Despite the growing line behind me, orders were moved along quickIy.  I was warmly greeted by the husband and placed my order with him:  Roasted Asparagus and Smoked Salmon on a crunchy baguette while O.Bestie desired the Roasted Chicken w/Gruyere cheese and olives on baguette.  Then, I saw that they had Crab Bisque soup on the menu and had to give it a try.  I found my selections to be most pleasurable and satisfying.  Every once in a while I like to torture my gums with a crunchy baguette...don't you?  Even had a bite of O.Bestie's sandwich and loved it too.Yesterday, I returned solo.  I ordered the French Club (mixed greens, turkey, bacon and Swiss on toasted baguette) and the Chef gave a smile and nod of approval.  A few minutes later, he bags the sandwich for me and says "I think you will enjoy this" with a knowing smile.  I retreated back to the sanctuary of the office break room and devoured the contents of the bag.FYI:  As promised, I did enjoy it.
<review# 650,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/3/2012,3/25/2012,329,223,10,16,11>$3.50 for the movies?  Really? Agh! The money I could have saved over the years!!For our last hurrah to wind up my son's Christmas holiday I told him we'd have a special mom-son day and go to the movies.  He requested Puss In Boots.  "Er, you know that came out in October, right?" I crossed my fingers and looked online to see if it was playing anywhere.  In luck!! Sunrise had it! Oh... Sunrise? That's kind of far, but a promise is a promise.When we got there I was pleasantly surprised with the admission! $3.50 weekdays, $3.75 weekends.  Say what? OK, OK, so there are only a handful of films and they aren't the most recent releases, but I seldom get out to the theater when movies are first released anyway.   Inside is kind of like a small town theater: small lobby, small viewing rooms, friendly staff.  The price of the drinks and goodies will give you a shock.  The price of a soda is more than the cost of admission.  Um, pass! I suddenly feel like a tightwad now that I've discovered I don't have to pay $10 each to see a movie. I had a slightly hard time hearing some parts of the film.  I am hard of hearing, but theater films aren't normally a problem.  The acoustics in this place, however, totally amplified candy wrapper rustles and kid whispers (complete with every parent shushing in unison) which drowned out some of the movie dialogue for me.  I would say this is a great theater to take the kids or go on a cheap date.  3.5 stars, really, so rounding up to 4.
<review# 651,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/13/2011,3/24/2012,354,195,14,14,13>Dear PineCove,I must admit that it is hard for me to try a new bar. Im oddly particular about the crowds that come in to a place, the food/drink you serve (or not serve), The employees, the price, and of course the place itself. You Pine Cove, made me very happy.The Friday night I was dragged in here was due to the fact that you can't say no to the birthday boy's wishes. If it weren't for him I would have never fallen in love with your no cover entrance, humorous kareokee night, your cheap pitchers of beer or the staff who apprently loves their job enough to party and hang out even when it's not their shift. But the true moment I knew that you were an awesome place to be, was when the most obnoxios, self-loving group of people came in thinking they were going to rule the joint with their disgusting lapdances and slutty dressed girls, who obviously assummed they didnt have to get out of the way of the people who were singing on "stage" . Instead of just letting them get away with it cause they were a large group, or because their C cups were hanging out for the world to view, you took charge and kicked their butts to the curb. You tried to warn them. You asked them nicely several times to move out of the way of the "singers" but they just didnt want to listen. So you did what a lot of bars overlook due to either a lack of care or a lack of respect for others. I will be back Pine Cove, on my own will next time.
<review# 652,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/14/2011,3/23/2012,648,305,10,10,11>Came here on a whim- it was one of those "I don't give a crap about what we eat for lunch let's just find something right now I'm friggin' hungry" afternoons. Prices, I have to say are fair- my only beef was with how small my half of a panini was....I ordered it with the pasta salad- and thought it was a side of foccacia. I'm not gonna lie..it WAS good. I'm a sucker for fresh basil though;) The kid had the Marguerite pizza....amazing. You bet your ass Ill be back for a slice. I am not sure how they do Is it the sauce? the crust? the spice??? Whatever it was, it tastes like HOME. I also love that they sell cans of orange and lemon Pelligrino. Staff was SUPER sweet and cool- service with a no nonsense smile. We sat outside in lovely rocking chairs, under a huge umbrella, with the Capitol as our view next to a beautiful baby olive tree. I can see myself coming back here for the gelato. I'm kinda in like with you, Cafe Roma.
<review# 653,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2012,3/22/2012,156,145,11,18,12>Yes, yes, yes!!! I already knew the Drewski's menu and loved their naughty sandwiches. However, I almost never got to have them because I am not that into chasing a truck. So I would only stumble across them from time to time. I am so thrilled that there is now a brick and mortar establishment where I can have the awesomeness that is the Drewski's food. The restaurant itself is huge!! There are several different styles of tables and a large couch lounge area in the back. I like all the options in seating styles. Thus far my favorite has been sitting up at the bar. It is fun to watch the bartenders and servers do their thing back there. I have also always been a fan of eating up at the bar (which by the way is huge!!!)The crowd was an interesting mix. I greatly enjoyed the people watching while I wasn't too busy chowing down on the awesome meat sandwiches. My favorite is the pulled pork with the mac and cheese. I also recently tried the chicken quesadilla with the pineapple salsa. Perfect!!! Not too cheesy, way awesomely chickeny and a wonderful perfect amount BBQ sauce. The pineapple salsa was also the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. The most amazing thing that I have tried is the s'morski. A s'more sandwich...genius!!! I must not eat too many of these though if I want to keep my waistline from growing!!Looking forward to many fun meals here!!!
<review# 654,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2011,3/21/2012,125,189,8,21,10>I'm just as surprised as anybody that one of the dumpiest bars in town (Round Corner) has one of the best kitchens.  The stuff these guys and gals are cranking out is pure gold.  Incredible quality for dirt cheap.I've only tried some of their different tacos (my current favorite being the chicken - nice and spicy!), but Downtown's Kitchen offers up plenty of options for both the meat eater and the vegetarian/vegan.  While I've yet to try any of their veggie food, a friend of mine vouches for it as well.Another perk I'm anticipating utilizing is the Kitchen's delivery option.  Yes, they deliver in midtown!My sole complaint is that every time I order the tri-tip tacos, they're out of tri-tip.  I imagine it's because everybody else comes in before me and eats all of it up!
<review# 655,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/11/2011,3/20/2012,101,78,8,11,9>This shop provides products, grooming, and self-service dog wash. This review is for the self-service dog wash only.My dog usually gets the not-so-fancy backyard hose/shampoo baths in the warm weather, so I am not a frequent client of DIY dog washes. However, on a recent chilly day, my pooch got into something very stinky and it was time for a major intervention.I put her in the car, rolled down all the windows, and beelined for the nearest doggie wash--which, according to Yelp, was Launder Dog.We were greeted warmly by two people (I think one may have been the owner). Fortunately, we were the only ones washing right then, because the whole experience was a bit overwhelming for my dog and having other dogs around might have been too much for her. Launder Dog's wash area is small but efficient. Good size tubs, and plentiful products for washing and grooming. The tubs were a bit high for me (I'm short), but tolerable. They recommended some different shampoos to help get rid of the odors--and the products were very effective.Overall, a good experience for both me and my dog. I would go back if the need arose again.
<review# 656,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/6/2012,3/19/2012,116,75,14,13,16>After reading other reviews, I just had to stop in to see what all the fuss was about.Immediately, the scent of yummy cooked food gets ya right in the beak. And what's that? A freaking pharmacy?! Awesome. Oh, giant bags of all kinds of rice? Very nice.I cruised their produce section first and found many items that were cheaper than at my neighborhood gorcery store, so I picked up spinach, romaine, cucumber, and celery. (NBD, right? Well I just bought a juicer, so stuff it!)I also walked out (after paying!) with sushi-grade salmon (which was great! just ate it), wakame (seaweed salad), a couple chicken breasts, canned mackerel (I like fish- back off!), and some ramen that I haven't tried before in a "spicy seafood" flavor. They also have: a traditional Chinese tea counter, an herbalist, a self-serve dim sum deli, more deli counters with vitenamese soups & other stuff I don't know about yet-whole duck-chinese food, seafood counter, a live seafood counter (tanks galore and fish on ice!), meat & poultry counter, a bank/loan consultant, a cell phone merchant, and what else? I know I'm missing something. I'll just have to go back.The store is very clean, they're friendly, and they seem to have decent sales. I found galanga, which is kind of hard to find and is a necessary ingredient for my favorite soup: tom kha gai.Can you believe I got home and discovered I'm completely out of soy sauce?!
<review# 657,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2011,3/18/2012,100,187,11,10,13>I took my nephew in for his 21st birthday. He asked if he could have a free drink since it was his birthday, and the bartender said sure! I totally was not expecting that he could get a free drink, but that was pretty awesome. AND to top it off, he actually let our whole party (there was 5 of us) have our first round free! I'm not sure if he had intended on doing that, but I'm not one to refuse free drinks. I don't know if it was a holiday thing, but there was food there and for $4 you could get your grub on. My sis got a plate for my nephew because she swore that he needed something to "pad his stomach." Ha, she acted like it was his first night drinking. The ping pong tables are freaking awesome!! Everyone playing on them was pretty awful except the 2 guys in my group. And man, the game started to get pretty heated! Don't get between drunk men and their ping pong. Just saying.
<review# 658,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/14/2011,3/17/2012,211,129,6,11,6>I'm always hot and bothered strolling through Old Sacramento on sunny days.2 weeks ago I went to Sac. Sweets. Co. and was disappointed in the ice cream, on our way back to downtown plaza we saw this place. "Frozen In Time" proudly serving Gunthers Ice Cream. The boyfriend and I looked at each other and wished we came here instead. Well, fret no more I say! I came by couple days ago and was determined to stop by this shop and so I did and it was as delightful as I had hoped.It was a super hot day and my siblings needed to cool off, so I suggested this place. Upon entering, we were greeted by the cool breeze of the air conditioner blowing our way. They had 3 staff working that day and lucky for us there wasn't a line formed yet.  There were plenty of seating areas too. The menu consisted of a large variety of ice creams, shaved ice, and sandwiches. I ordered the Green Tea ice cream and rocky road in a bowl. My sister ordered the shaved ice with green apple and strawberry flavor. Don't get me wrong, my green tea was delicious and everything I hoped it would be but as soon as I had a taste of my sisters shaved ice I knew that was what I was quenching for. The shaved ice was super soft and was so easy to eat and the flavor was super juicy! I just had to come back and get my own... So after walking around trying to hurry and eat my green tea ice cream, we came back with a huge line formed! I waited about 30 minutes til I actually got to order but boy was it worth the wait! The regular size was about 3 dollars after tax and the large was about 6.. The regular size was still pretty big and so worth the money and the long wait! They give you this cool nifty cup to catch the falling ice. You can keep it as a souvenir too!After staying in the long line I figured that this place was known for its shaved ice, everyone was ordering it! Green apple is my favorite flavor so far. Passion fruit was good too! Strawberry was okay after tasting the others. Can't wait to come back to try other flavors!
<review# 659,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2012,10/11/2012,124,112,4,7,4>I have found the location I'll watch sports events.I have never seen so many screens outside of a casino sports book.  With pool tables, a full bar and a menu expanded upon from Drewski's Hot Rod Kitchen?  This is a haven.  There is a ton of seating, but enough space around so you don't feel crowded.  (unless you are at a Yelp Elite Event.)The owner of the place really gives you a vibe that he cares you are having a good time.  Whether you are at his truck, or his bar, he wants you to have a good experience.He's the kind of guy who SHOULD own a bar.  I'm glad he does.
<review# 660,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2012,10/10/2012,151,185,5,16,6>Thanks to groupon I found out about eyelash perms.  I have done eyelash extensions which gives you instant gratification, but when those bad boys start to fall out, it's hideous, and I'm not the type of person who can be bothered to go and keep getting it done.  I drove all the way from Lincoln to get my eyelashes permed by Judy and boy was it worth it!  It's my own lashes, nothing will fall out, and when the perm ends up falling flat, I won't feel the need to immediately go back, because my eyelashes won't look like a deformed spider on my eyes (how you'll look when your eyelashes come out from extensions).  BUT I WILL be back!!Judy made me feel comfortable and I got to take a nap!  Judy didn't make me feel awkward and knew full well that people will and do fall asleep, good thing I'm a light sleeper, I heard her every time she came in to check on me.  What it boils down to, you go there with your mediocre lashes, you get a nap (or you can relax) and leave with amazing lashes that are your own, how can you go wrong?!
<review# 661,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2012,10/9/2012,26,143,4,11,4>I am in accordance with most other people that have reviewed this place. It will always be Benny's regardless of what the sign says.That being said, Benny's is a dive bar in Sacramento that has entrenched itself as a midtown landmark. The drinks are cheap and strong. The bartenders are super nice and interesting. Bar food is basic but done well and also very affordable. You will always see a good mix of people here all unified for the same goal: to have a few cheap drinks with cool people.The back patio has been under construction this summer, and it is supposed to get a new roof, gate, and walkway which will make it much nicer back there. I have been a part of several intense flip cup marathons on this patio, hopefully with more to come.Get the pesto fries and mozzarella sticks, you will not be disappointed.
<review# 662,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/6/2012,10/8/2012,98,296,6,13,10>I live right near Yellowbill and have been eagerly awaiting its opening since Keith over at KI Gifts clued me in as to who was going to be taking over the space.Everything you love about Magpie is here (or will be soon), but in a smaller dose: baked goods, the famous carrot cake cookies, salads, sandwiches. During the soft opening they offered some foccacia pizza that I heard was absolutely delicious. There are a few gluten free salads & vegan items.Added to these delectables are Chocolate Fish Coffee beans, roasted to perfection and made into lovely lattes, mochas, Americanos...you name it. My first drink from these guys was a fabulous latte that reminded me of my first visit to Chocolate Fish. Today I'm drinking a nonfat mocha with a touch of whipped cream (I have a feeling the whipped cream is made in-house) that is superb.The staff are super friendly & provide stellar service. I've gotten to know Nate, Isaac, Matt, Kashmir, and Shawna and they are all committed to making Yellowbill an awesome place to get coffee and a snack. I'm sure I'll get to know everyone else soon, cause that's what happens when you live adjacent to a fantastic cafe. Plus I hear they will be open on Saturdays, which is rare around here seeing as businesses get most of their customers during the week from the state offices nearby. UPDATED: After a short period of being open on Saturdays, Yellowbill is now only open from 6:30 to 3, M-F. Boo.I'm reserving my 5th star for when they have gluten-free items I can try. UPDATED: The almond rocher cookie is gluten free (though there's potential for cross-contamination as they make everything in the same area) - so very good. I have been told the peanut butter sandwich cookie is vegan, so if you're not in the mood for the vegan chocolate avocado mousse, you can get one of these cookies. I hear they are yummy.Rumor has it that Yellowbill will serve Magpie's ever-popular chocolate avocado mousse. If so, you best get out of my way. UPDATED: There are small containers of the mousse available in the fridge. Don't touch the one marked CORINNE. I mean it.In short: if you live/work near Capitol Park, you owe it to your coffee and cookie-loving self to come try out Yellowbill. Tell 'em Corinne sent you.
<review# 663,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2012,10/7/2012,299,309,1,9,9>Smashburger doesn't make the best burger I've ever had, but they do make a pretty-dang good one, with a lot of options to try something new.  I really like their chicken sandwich line-up, and it really provides a nice alternative to the burger I usually go for.  Also, the price isn't too bad, at about $7 for their larger-sized burger, another $2 for some fries, comes out to under $10 for a good meal, and I'm okay with that (and I just grab a free water with a lemon wedge for my drink).Now onto some specifics:The BBQ cheddar burger was my first choice, with the larger sized burger of course, and I found it just alright.  It was okay, and I'm not really complaining, but short of amazing.  Their bacon was lost in the bread, the sauce didn't really have a kick... idk, I just was left wanting more.The next time I tried their Spicy Baja Crispy Chicken.  It comes with spicy chipotle mayo which was excellent,  and a spicy chipotle bun , which I didn't care for too much... I kinda feel like it didn't go with the sandwich and distracted from the chicken which should be the star of the dish.  Overall though it was very good and full of flavor.The two sides I've tried are their smashfries and their sweet potato smashfries,  I absolutely loved them both, and can't really pick a favorite, so choose according to your mood.  The regular smashfries are only $1.99, and the sweet potatoe smashfries are only .20 cents more.Smashburger has created their own different style, something to make them stand out from the other burger places in the area.  That isn't to say that they're better, but they're different, and different is good, and I know I'll be back here from time to time.
<review# 664,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2012,10/6/2012,257,251,5,5,6>YES PLEASE.The PLT is amazing!  The sandwich comes on soft, pillowy foccacia which could have used a bit of toastyness on the outside to better help hold stuff in, but otherwise was absolutely delicious.  The pancetta... mmmmm.  So flavorful and salty, and I love that they toss the greens in balsamic in addition to the pesto.  The rosemary and sea salt fries that came on the side were hot, crispy, and delicious.The Calabrese Calamari dish was HUUUUUGE.  My jaw kind of dropped when it came because usually you get less than half of that amount for an appetizer.  Be forewarned, this dish is most certainly enough for 3-4 people.  It's so good!! If you're a total wuss when it comes to spicy food you had better skip the Calabrese and stick with the traditional style.  It's hot, mama.This was my first time eating here, and I was pretty impressed.  I can't wait to come back with a larger group and try some pizza!  I was completely seduced by some of the menu selection and descriptions, like: "Pork Chorizo, Rosemary, Cowgirl Creamery Fromage Blanc, Lavender Sea Salt."  Ohhhhhhhhh *foodgasm*One small thing I did notice - No greeting or parting words from the hostess whatsoever, not even a glance.  She walked away without so much as a smile, and we were sat by someone else, a server I believe.  Other than that though, the service was impeccable. :)
<review# 665,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/11/2012,10/5/2012,194,575,3,11,6>This place has only been open a couple of weeks and will probably get lots of lunch business mostly, due to its location near the courthouse. It's located where Table 260 used to be, and as of today, it still has the old sign up, but the owner will be getting her new signage soon. It is also kitty corner from Caesar Chavez Plaza, if you need help finding it till then.This new venture from the same owner of Vanilla Bean Bistro is called Trio because it is a restaurant, bakery and market. We just went for lunch, and we had a great time. The owner was there alone waiting the tables and doing the cooking as well, and she was very sweet and helpful. The food is extremely unique and defies an easily definable category, although the cook is Turkish and calls it "Mediterranean-influenced". She told us that she sources local sustainable meats and organic produce, even grows some of the ingredients in her own garden, harvests it in the morning and serves it in the restaurant the same day. Wow!Our bread was just delicious, really top-notch. We got to try several different kinds - one sturdy sliced and toasted one with an eggplant/olive "hummus" and then later, homemade soft, fluffy pita bread with a sweet tzatziki dipping sauce. Outstanding! For my entree, I had the moussaka - very good, cheesy, filling, and vegetarian. My husband loved his chicken-bacon wrap, which was HUGE, sweet/savory, and came on that great pita bread, plus a side of curried lentil soup. As you enter the restaurant, the left side is the "market" side, with various gourmet food items for sale. The right side is the "bakery", and you will see fresh baked breads and desserts, including baklava which I hope to try on my next visit. I hope this place does well, because the owner is genuinely passionate about what she does, and her products are very unique!
<review# 666,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2012,10/4/2012,72,97,5,13,12>This is about to become my go to joint for great BBQ. I was immediately greeted by the owners, Sharon and Glenn, as I walked in yesterday. They were great at carrying a conversation as they presented me a "sample." Which could easily have been a mini lunch. Be prepared to sample everything before you decide on the bbq of your choice. It's a no frills type of place but the BBQ speaks for itself. It has a great smokey flavor, tender, and juicy. From the pork ribs, hot links, chicken, and tri-tip... all was delish! The sides I tried were the beans and potato salad which were solid. And their sauces... yum-o! It's perfectly tangy and sweet, the spicy one has a kick to it though. I'm a fan of beef ribs so I'll definitely make sure to give them a heads up a day before I come back the next time since they'll cook it up per request. Isn't that awesome? I haven't been able to eat BBQ like this since visiting Texas. Excited that there's Mo Mo's here in town!
<review# 667,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2012,10/3/2012,2712,383,7,13,11>Out of all the casino's closest to home, I'd say I'm now a big fan of this place just because I always come out ahead which translates to a break even. I never imagined this casino could ever get packed like a flea market but you don't feel the volume of people which was nice. Clean and tidy, the place smells of casino in both a good way and bad. The table action features the usual games and lots of slots for your money. Of course if you ever get a tingling in the tummy there are plenty of places to eat.This place was so packed that they had CHP directing traffic in and out of the parking lot I was blown away!If you like to indulge in a little casino gaming action here and there, this place is definitely worth checking out. If you really want to push your luck you can of course check in at the hotel and dish out more dough.Who knows, your wallet might just end up packing some thunder...
<review# 668,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2012,10/2/2012,129,87,13,14,8>Wow. I'll say it again...Wow. I am so glad I found this place today. I stumbled upon a fellow Yelper's review and was intrigued. Not only is this place like 5 min away from my house (Operation FatASS will be in full effect) but it's freakin' delicious!!!I got the following: 1 Hot dog roll, 4 Ensaymadas (2 Macapuno 2 Regular), 2 Tuna Rolls (they were out of corned beef but that's ok it gives me a reason to go back), 1 Bread Pudding, and 1 dozen Pandesal, I mean 1 dozen pandesal was $2.25!! Last but definitely not least I got the assortment of Cassava Cakes for $4.99. I really can hear my dress getting ready to split at the seams as I write this review but whatever.Everything was good. Wanna know how I know it was good?! Because I took a bite of every-freakin-thing I got!! Don't judge. Ginelle's has not seen the last of me in fact I plan on us becoming very good friends in the near future.
<review# 669,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2008,6/20/2008,268,316,8,12,9>I've been patronizing ToT for years, with a mix of 80% take out and 20% dine in. I have always been pleased with the food, and keep going back regularly. Have yet to be disappointed!The waitresses are always very nice to me, and usually compliment me in some way when I stop by. Once they commented on how nice I was dressed, how I am a good husband, and just today they mentioned I had a nice watch. I like that...service with affirmation.My favorite items include:1. Tom Kha soup - I could drink a gallon of this soup in one sitting! It's got coconut milk, hot & sour, it's awesome!2. Gaeng Ka Ree - this is my favorite curry, it is very smooth and milky. I could eat just the gravy and rice alone for an entire meal!3. Pad Phet - the basil leaves and bamboo shoots really hit this dish out of the park for me. I usually get it with beef, but sometimes the beef is a bit on the dry side.4. Pad Thai Noodles - ok, so this is the egg foo young of the thai world, but I like it nevertheless. Kid likes it too.They just started accepting Amex which pleases me, since I get 3% back on restaurants with my Costco card.Secret tip #42 - it feels like the portions are larger when I get take out. Try it and compare to dine in and see if you agree.See you there!
<review# 670,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/10/2008,6/19/2008,129,298,5,5,5>I go to this place every week, and love the staff here. The two pharmacists are friendly and always helpful, and the entire staff are really nice.Unfortunately, they are pretty lax as far as being on top of it. I'll give you an example: I go in there every week and usually have scrips called in at least a day before, sometimes much more. Only once in 20 or 30 visits has the prescription actually been ready when I got there - and then (yesterday), I got home and found that the product was not even what the prescription (or the label attached to it or the bag) was for! I don't know how you could stick a label for X to something that is very clearly Y, but it happened anyway.So, of course, after putting 75 in the meter because I expected it to take 30+ minutes and then getting the wrong product, I have to go back again tonight to exchange it. I wish there were a few non-metered spots in front, because I've spent a LOT of money on parking meters here.I'd love to switch to the Rite Aid in my neighborhood, because I know everything would be waiting for me when I get there, and the hours would be slightly more sane (Pucci's opens at 9 - after most people have to be at work - and closes early too).But I won't switch. I prefer to use a locally-owned business with people I know, even if they drive me crazy sometimes.
<review# 671,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/28/2008,6/18/2008,126,2155,10,5,7>Billy Joel (of all people) once said, "There's nothing better than good sex. But bad sex? A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is better than bad sex." I've got to disagree with ol'Billy boy on that one BUT - all questionable quotes aside - I didn't notice any peanut butter sandwiches on Mr. Pickles menu. They had about 15 sandwiches (exaggeration?) based around chicken but nary any PB&J in sight.Staffing in the food industry works differently than in the distribution industry but any time I see four people standing at a food counter I start freaking out and rolling budget numbers around in my head. The person who asked me what kind of bread I want couldn't spread the mayo and mustard on it as well? Really?Should you find yourself in god-awful West Sacramento I recommend that you exit Harbor Blvd and give this place a shot. What works best for Mr. Pickles is that the sandwiches are large, well made and tasty, the staff is friendly (but seemed a bit confused) and its strange location is a gem amongst the area riddled with...you know.....crack dealers...
<review# 672,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2008,6/17/2008,45,6,5,10,8>Yes! They have saved my butt. I had a video project I was working on (tape to digital conversion) and was in the process of upgrading one of my S-VHS decks but that was taking a while for delivery so I took an old early generation but best of class player down (a 10+ year old one- was having transport issues that went beyond what I could fix in-house) to keep working until the new player came in and the repair rates were both good and they knew what would need still adjusting during the repair warranty period so I could drop it off for a day for a touch-up and pick it back up during that period. And they carry used Laserdisc players, TV's and all sorts of other used goodies A/V wise for sale.
<review# 673,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/15/2007,6/16/2008,40,38,14,7,9>I ate at Biba twenty years ago, and thought it was a fantastic meal.  I remember taking my six week old baby in there that day, and recall all the geriatric senators looking at me in horror, absolutely certain my son was going to scream through the meal and ruin their $25.00 salads and million dollar pork barrel deals.Life goes on, and now I'm the geriatric lady huffing and looking annoyed each time I see a baby in an expensive restaurant.  But, back then, I SWEAR, I would have taken my baby outside the second he started to whimper, and nowadays, new moms just let them scream and then breastfeed them at the table.  My lands!You know what raising kids is like - not a lot of Biba meals once they outgrow the "sleeping under the table in a carseat" phase.  So, I hadn't been back until now.My husband and I ate there on our recent anniversary, Lucky 13.  The decor may have changed since I was there last, but the style didn't.  It still screams 1980s. If they did change the decor, they used the same decorator.   Most disturbingly, there is a mirror that runs around the  section of the restaurant that I was sitting in - right at face level.  I essentially sat next to myself during dinner, a choice I would not have made.  And, everywhere I turned, there I was, eating.  It was like being in a horror movie.Service has always been good at Biba, and that night was no exception.  Our server had an Italian accent, which maybe was fake but was so perfect I didn't care.   If he'd worked in a pizzeria, he'd have had a big, swooping mustache.  At Biba, he had a tux.We started with an appetizer - goat cheese wrapped in crispy prosciutto, served on a bed of wilted greens sprinkled in balsamic vinegar and fresh figs.  Yum.  It was very good.I chose as a main course - a steak. Yes, I know.  It's Biba's, dammit, you are supposed to eat pasta!!  Well, I'm not that fond of pasta and when the special was announced - a filet with thinly sliced portabella mushrooms and a stuffed tomato, I picked that.And, it was good too.   The steak was Ruth's Chris quality - about five inches thick, and oh so tender.  I ordered it medium and it arrived rare, but I'm not that picky so I ate around the edges and left the purple part.  Since I can never finish a meal anyway, this was not a problem.  The mushrooms were good too, but had the same balsamic as the appetizers.  I love balsamic but Biba, you really don't have to cover every vegetable with it.  The stuffed tomato was tiny, roma-sized.  I do think it was home-grown though, with nice breadcrumbs seasoning it.My husband also skipped the pasta and ordered swordfish.   He said it was okay. I don't eat fish so I'll take his word for it.  He paid the bill so  his "just okay" means "just okay considering how freaking much it cost."I had a ten dollar glass of red wine to go with it.   Just thought I'd mention that.I got to pick the appetizer so hubby picked dessert.  It was some sort of cappuccino flan, although I'm sure they didn't call it flan.  But, that's what it was.  Not great but I was full anyway.  I also had a real cappuccino to go with it.Now, here is what surprised me.  I expected the customers to be 70 year olds dressed to the nines, so I put on my five inch Carlos Santana stilletos, opened my sexy, snakeskin print blouse down low, had a patent leather belt to match my skinny pants, and some some killer jewelry......and most of the customers were younger then me, and wearing shorts and tee shirts.  I swear, I saw flip flops.Sacramento, fashion capitol of the world.So, what do I think of Biba?  I think the food is good.  I think it's a Sacramento institution and everybody native should eat there once. I think Bay Area people should stay away, because they won't get it.   I think that it might not be the place for a special-special occasion, such as 25th wedding anniversary, but it's fine for your 13th.  I think its over-priced for what you get and I think it's faded from its glory days, when Biba held court.  There are now better restaurants in Sacramento - but there was a time when it was all about Biba, and that is Sacto history.
<review# 674,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2008,6/15/2008,464,293,14,13,15>Flea Markets are serious business. This is not a trip to the mall but more like a trip to Bartertown from Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome. Long rows of tents and speakers and flys and tweety bird t-shirts and knock off Dooney & Bourke bags and piles upon piles of sweet sweet swap meet junk!I like to spend at least 3 hours there. Bring a pocket full of $1 bills, eat a corn dog or some Jimboy's (or both!), buy some fresh produce, buy some cheap socks, drink a soda, haggle.But the best part about Denio's, and what truly separates it from other swap meets and flea markets, is Walt's Mini Donuts. Walt is an old man in a trailer that will hand make mini donuts for you. You can watch as he meticulously frys the donuts. He plays a looped audio recording also, "fresh, hot mini donuts. 5 for a quarter 18 for a dollar and 6 for 50 cents. stop on by and take a bag home." Its pretty sureal.
<review# 675,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2008,6/13/2008,9,0,5,14,12>A Localvore in Paradise: Or, Not the Last Supper I'll Eat Here!In the King James' Bible, Matthew, Chapter 26, we are instructed by the writer to question our loyalties, ask forgiveness, and eat heartily in a small group setting; with all due respect, boy did he ever nail how I'm feeling now, 'cause I've just left my new favorite restaurant: Yelpers, let me introduce you to Dad's Kitchen on Freeport.My fealty to Jamie's is still strong, and rightfully so--as a Bar and Grill, no one does the concept better--but I've gotten a little tired at their being closed over the weekend (not to mention they don't serve breakfast.) So now, having had my head turned by the new kid in the neighborhood, I think I'm going to have to get on my knees and beg Jamie for forgiveness. Really, Dad's is that good. Now on to eating in small groups....I walked in a little before eleven this morning, when they were first opening up; Zac England, who, with his lovely wife Ali, runs the place, was attending to the usual last-minute details and took a moment to chat with me. He asked if I had been to their sandwich shop on S and 13th, and had to say no; at least this way I wouldn't be prejudiced one way or another, although I've heard and read good things about it. The new space, across from the new McDonald's and next to Freeport Bakery on Freeport, is deceptively large on the inside, and has a terrific patio in the back. It's comfortable and relaxing, and it's not difficult to imagine either a cool salad with chilled wine on a warm Summer evening, or a plate of bacon and eggs with coffee and a newspaper served before the heat of the day kicks in. The colors are charming, Rosemary Clooney and Frank Sinatra were on the Stereo, and my comfort meter was maxed out. And this was in the first ten minutes.I asked Zac to bring me what he felt like; I eat--and enjoy--most everything, and since it was the first "real" day (they had a "soft" opening over the weekend), I wanted him to offer something he felt comfortable in serving right off the bat. Hamburger? You betcha.After a dish of his "beer food" (chickpeas deep-fried and seasoned), I was served a beautiful hamburger--please check out the pics--medium rare, encrusted with a bacon crumble and topped with blue cheese. It's not a surprise it was cooked perfectly--the chef, Erik Stimson, previously worked at Morton's--but it topped my expectations of what a great burger should taste like. Fries on the side (also with crumbled blue cheese) were yummy if not spectacular (I bet they'll get better as the days go on), and the condiments included a wonderfully marinated, thinly sliced red onion that you just can't get enough of. I washed this down with a pint of Kilt Lifter Ale and a huge smile. The bill came to fourteen bucks (ten for the burger, four for the beer), and I felt the meal was a terrific value--although, after my last review, I realize not everyone feels the same way I do about value--and I'm sure there'll be something for every budget. Personally, I'd pay for the ambiance alone. Hours will be 8 in the morning til 9 on Sunday to Thursday, and 8 to 10 on Friday and Saturday. Also, kudos to my server Kristin--it's not easy helping a place open, and she seems perfectly suited for the tasks ahead.Zac said he wants to concentrate on using local suppliers, farms, wineries, breweries, coffee roasters, bakeries, etc; if you consider being a "localvore" (utilizing food sources within a hundred or so miles) a priority--we do, for ethical and quality reasons--then I guess this is the place to go. I wonder if Zac has met Patrick Mulvaney? It seems like they're cut from the same bolt of cloth. Slow Foodies of Sacramento, meet Dad's Kitchen: local quality and reasonable prices in a comfortable setting. What could be better?I'm told the Biscuits and Gravy are to die for. Guess where I'll have breakfast tomorrow?Update (4/16) The Biscuits and Gravy are to die for.
<review# 676,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2008,6/11/2008,57,67,7,6,8>What's with all of these hosers with a chip on their shoulder acting like if they're not from the '40s they get treated bad here. I come in wearing dirty jeans and looking like I slept in the gutter sometimes and they still treat me just fine. One of the clerks even gave my son some candy. You absolutely can't find a better wine/spirits selection in town, plus the guy who manages the booze area really knows his stuff and will always recommend anything to me, not looking down when I tell him I'm a cheapo. The oddball sodas are always a kick to get here. They even have bottled Dr. Pepper that used real sugar cane instead of that nasty ass corn syrup. The meats, deli, and cheese areas are without equal (though the Co-Op's cheese section is pretty nice for other reasons). The produce, I agree, though, and doesn't seem to be that much better than what the Save-Mart across the way has to offer.
<review# 677,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/11/2008,6/10/2008,257,300,3,10,11>Old-school wood-panel restaurants like this one that serve strong drinks AND edible food aren't as easy to come by as I'd like.  Secrets to successful drinking and dining at the Rusty Duck:(1) Plan to arrive before sunset (around 6/7 pm).(2) Upon entering the restaurant, ignore the helpful greeter and take an immediate left / go upstairs and have a seat in front of the fireplace (winter) or out on the breezy deck (summer).  Both have great views of the setting sun, the bridge, and the river.(3) Order spicy bloody marys (made with Absolut Peppar, served with olives and pepperocinis).(4) Start with the oysters (they have two varieties, so I usually ask for "the big ones").(5) Check the happy hour special blackboard on the wall - happy hour is from 5-7 pm and they give good discounts on clam chowder, well drinks, and the like.  Also, if you choose to dine between 4:30 and 6, the restaurant offers a short list of deeply-discounted entrees under "early dining selections" that come with an expanded array of sides / courses.My OH and I love this place for the fireplace and the sunsets, the spicy bloody marys, the oysters, and the ribs.  We like taking a walk on the bike trail located just behind the restaurant about an hour before dusk, and then heading indoors to drink and dine and watch the sun set.   So far, my experience with the menu is as follows:Menu hits:  oysters, ribs, duck spring rolls, shrimp scampi, clam chowder, creamed spinach, steamed asparagus, pork loin, seared ahi appetizer, prime rib.  The fresh warm bread and whipped butter that comes with each entree are the kinds of details that other / similar restaurants overlook.Menu misses:  Lousiana Style Cajun Shrimp (not-so-fresh shrimp covered in Old Bay = not worth it); tempura calamari (greasy); crab legs.This is a great place to try if you like sunsets and strong drinks, and having a comfy chair by the fire in a place that seems more living room than restaurant.

Let me state up front that after studying abroad in France, I can think of about a hundred French pastries that I'd rather be eating than macarons. So don't look to this review if you're a macaron fanatic and want a review of their version. When their other stuff is so delectable, I don't see myself ordering the tiny trendy French cookies anytime soon.I went here for lunch on President's Day weekend and ordered the soup/sandwich combo. (The pasta salad also looked so tempting, but it was a chilly day and soup seemed necessary.) I got a wonderful tomato bisque and the roast beef sandwich on brioche with swiss, arugula and red onion marmalade. I could sing odes to this sandwich: the buttery, soft bread, the beautiful combination of ingredients inside... Big fan here!And the desserts! I ordered the Chocolate Banana Monkey Bread and a Cowboy Cookie for my husband (but stole a bit, of course, as a finder's fee). Amazing, and my friend and dining companion was singing the praises of the chocolate-filled eclair. My greatest desire is to repeatedly return until I have systematically sampled every baked good until I have tried them all....Except you know what. :-) Classy decor, only drawback would be downtown parking, but I'll gladly get over that to trek back to this little treasure soon!

The Banh Xeo is huge, and very share-able. Please don't stray away from places that specialize in certain things, in this case just stick to the Banh Xeo. They have perfected the batter down to a "T". Just the right amount of crunch and chew.Again, I insist... try not to order appetizers and etc. Stay away from nem nuong, chicken wings, egg rolls and etc. Stick to the Banh Xeo and wrap it your own way into delicious spring rolls filled with veggies and lettuce to your content.The place is relatively clean and not too much to complain about.

Sorbet is fruitastic*They also have a bacon burger, a pastrami sandwhich, nachos (see pics) and more!SERVICEAlways friendly and accomodating. They offered to cold pack my gelato to go. They ask if you need more of anything. They let you sample. They offered to split my fries into an extra container. Very nice.LUNCH*$5 grilled cheese + gelato lunch special*$8.25 lunch combo = sandwich + any side*Other daily specials (today it's hand rolled pasta)ISSUES THAT FEED MY WORRYThe name doesn't really sell itself as a restaurant. Who would think Philly Cheesesteak when they hear "Tidbit Catering and Gelateria?" Street parking can be difficult. I'm not sure what their niche is. Big competition for lunch and dessert nearby. They have a good luck asian waving cat, but no asian fare. SUMMARYThinking about grabbing Jack's, Chipotle, or some other midtown staple for lunch? Next time, give Tidbit a shot.

Patrick's Day (a tradition since 1959!) and the line was very very very long, but as some guy ahead of us said, "it goes fast". I realize it was a special, non-ideal day to be first introduced to a restaurant, but even so, Sam's impressed me. The line moved quickly at a consistent pace. The wait staff was incredibly helpful and chipper. The food was delicious and the cooks/servers were amenable to me just kind of creating my own plate - picking and choosing among the listed menu items. We even got a slice of pie (chocolate cream - cold and delicious) and a couple of beers. The bar was slammed and yet staffed with only one older lady. She was quite excellent though and there wasn't much of a wait. I had to clear away the dirty dishes some previous diners had left behind, but no biggie (they were packed). I loved people watching as I ate my meal. There were also plenty of neat old-timey photos w/ captions on the walls. I loved getting a mini history lesson as I ate. The clientele trends older (and for St. Paddy's, at least, whiter), the food served is pure comfort (meat and potatoes, mmmm) and the whole restaurant is very rooted in place. This place feels as though it has always been.

<review# 687,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2013,4/22/2013,702,960,16,23,21>Discovered this coffee shop through a  Yelp event that was hosted here! A little off the beaten path, they are located off an alleyway off 20th street between J Street and I Street in a brick-walled small warehouse space. What makes this spot unique is the fact that they sell beans that are part of a cooperative, a global co-op owned by thousands of family farmers from Peru, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico and Ethiopia. Not only does the coffee taste good, but you can feel good supporting the people who grow and harvest the beans. Not sure if a competitor that rhymes with "farbux" can make the same claim!I was so excited to try out some of their Peruvian beans. Having worked in a cafe that specialized in single origin brews, I got to know the qualities of different beans according to where they were grown. At home, I used a drip filter method and also tried it in my espresso machine. I liked the cleanness of the coffee and it had a medium depth to it. Not too acidic either.Their prices are reasonable too, $10 a pound. I'm pretty sure that's what the guy said. I am totally coming back here to try out their Guatemalan beans. Along with Costa Rican, Sumatran, and Jamaica Blue Mountain, Guatemalan is one of my favorite types of coffee bean. Although you can't buy a cup of coffee here, I heard that they are thinking of having the option of coffee drinks. Yes please!

There are a few tables in the back and then you can go through the french doors to a private patio where there is an outdoor bar, heated lamps, and additional seating.  Fun in the summer and fall, I'm sure.On my first visit, upon hearing that I had recently tried whiskey and was a fan, the bartender referred me to the Buck Hunter, a delicious concoction of whiskey, ginger beer, blackberry jam, vanilla bitters and lemon juice.  Two of those about knocked me on my ass.  In a good way.  I've tried and love the risotto croquettes, the polenta cakes and the shrimp tacos.  The Ramen (with shrimp) is slurp-worthily delicious!One of my indicators of a good restaurant is the coffee.  It's been my general experience that unless a place has an espresso machine, their coffee is subpar to mediocre.  Not the Red Rabbit!  They serve Temple coffee in a french press.  Another delicious win.Definitely one of my favorite restaurants on the grid.

<review# 690,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2013,2/20/2014,153,122,12,24,11>Some facts to keep in mind - we came at 8am on a Sunday the beginning of September,  I'm not fit, but I have the energy of a dog,  I only slept 4 hours the night before hiking,  I am usually immune to poo.That being said...**  PROS  **1)   Tons of trails ranging from "I'm a couch potato" to "Cross-fit maniac"2)   VERY quick to get to Hidden Falls3)   Lots of other mini waterfalls with shallow wading pools4)   Dog, horse, and kid friendly (guess you can combine all these wild-lings into one group)5)   Not very crowded6)   Free parking7)   Benches/ pinic tables scattered around the park8)   Rocks around the creek are smooth enough for the monkey in you to climb bare-footed**  CONS  **1)   Dry fields and vegetation  (in Sept) -  I suggest going in the Spring2)   Pools were dirty3)   Horse poop everywhere !!!!  At one point, it was like playing hopscotch around horse poo.4)   The signs/ little pathway to the waterfall are easy to missThis was a relaxing hike with the sounds of wildlife and trickling water.  The falls isn't very big, but it's enough for a nice scenic view.  My favorite would be the Canyon viewing deck located next to the bridge high above the rocky structure.  Not bad and such a short distance from Sacramento!
<review# 691,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/31/2013,2/19/2014,1137,179,15,21,18>Sandwiches! I'm a huge fan of sandwiches and since there aren't that many good sandwich places in Davis compared to Sacramento then I have to suffice to Mr. Pickle's. Though the sandwiches here can be a bit pricey ($7-$8), I think it's worth it for what you get. Plus, you also get a free cookie worth it! I suggest ordering your sandwich online because you get 10% off which basically saves you tax :) Whether it's online or in person, you can also customize your sandwich as well here. I've had the Mr. Pickle, Hang Loose, Reuben, Le' Michele, and a few others to try and they were all very scrumptious depending on what meat you like and how you customize it :) As for their bread, the most popular and one of my favorites is the Dutch Crunch. I stopped eating that because it started hurting the roof of my mouth and it's not as healthy as wheat bread, sweet roll, or the variety of wraps they have to offer. Though if you don't care so much about calories then I suggest you get the Dutch Crunch! :) Staff here is really nice especially the manager here. I warn you though that it gets really busy during lunch hours since a lot of people want sandwiches during their breaks :P Be on the lookout for some of their deals. I remember one time for their one year anniversary that they were selling all sandwiches for only $5! What a deal!
<review# 692,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,2/18/2014,179,181,11,25,11>I won't lie. I had very low expectations for Spice Kitchen after we walked thinking it was Hokkaido, and they were in the midst of a soft opening with limited menu options, even though the Hokkaido sign still dominated outside. I'm so glad I gave them another try.  We returned because Spice Kitchen added ramen to their menu, and ooh boy, was it good. The boyfriend tried the black ramen, and I had the house special. Both were tasty with a lot of ingredients, although my broth was definitely on the mild side. I ended up adding lots of spice, which upped the savory quotient of the house special. Next time, I think I should try the red ramen to get the true taste of what I'm hoping for. In the meantime, I won't hesitate to try what Spice Kitchen has to offer. They have me convinced. Oh and btw, who are these people complaining that Spice Kitchen won't take Hokkaido Groupons? That's like going to a McDonalds turned Burger King and wondering why they won't take your McD's gift card. It's not a management change. It's a business change. Go back to Groupon and get your money back.
<review# 693,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2013,2/17/2014,144,58,4,17,14>This library is small but has a lot to offer! =) I come here about 2-3 times a week depending on how much studying I need to do. I love coming here because the staff is very welcoming and helpful. I feel very comfortable here.It's nicely spread out- They have private desks along the left side of the library and comfy chairs that form a circle. The center of the library provides natural lighting where there are more comfy chairs, round and rectangle tables for four and two person computers. And the right side of the library is the children's area, where they have more computers and tables at a child's height.The BEST part about this library is the small private study room. I come here with a study buddy so it's nice to not have to whisper since we are always going through/discussing notes or reading out loud a new chapter. The room is a first come first serve basis and they will allow you to use it for more than an hour if no one else needs the room. The library also provides dry erase markers so you can use it on the white board. They have a separate computer room, with approximately 20 computers. And if you don't want to sit in there, they have a chrome laptop you can borrow for the day (use inside the library) and it costs 10cents to print or copy a page of paper. They offer great activities like Scrabble, Knitting, Laughing Yoga, Children's book reading and more on certain days out of the month. I haven't done any of these yet but I look forward to. They have a Fast "do it yourself" express check out. Restrooms are always well stocked and clean. Hours are very convenient because they open until 9pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. So 5 stars for a very friendly and helpful staff, 5 stars for being clean and 5 stars because you're my favorite study spot! =)

Because Nugget has a good amount of organic products and regular products. I like to come here to browse their shelves for new products and snacks to try. I can spend a good amount of time here, just window shopping, lol I usually like to come here for their sushi and baked goods tho. I've only tried their philly rolls and macarons, and that's what I keep coming back for.I subscribed to their online ad that comes out every Wednesday for awesome deals, such as 4 Talenti gelatos for $10 & powerade on sale for $.59 each! Some of their prices are reasonable, some aren't, but if you're patient, the thing that you want might just be on sale :D Overall, this is a pretty clean and organized market and the staff are friendly and helpful. Definitely check this place out if you're in the area!

A few of my friends sent this to me knowing how much I value a nice pair of brows. With that said, let me tell you some shit about life.If you're looking to sport a full, natural, and spectacular pair of eyebrows, give a Hair Plaza a chance. These ladies know what's up with threading and giving you the perfect brows. Let me warn you though, this is not a high end luxury salon that offers you wine and a beautiful interior but you definitely get a bang for your buck. $12 for a fantastic thread job that includes a mini face massage!
<review# 697,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/25/2013,2/13/2014,431,328,2,13,9>After living in San Francisco for so long using Uber and P2P services like Lyft, I almost forgot about taking an actual taxi cab. Prior to any of the said P2P services having actually launched in Sacramento yet I decided to give these guys a try (per Yelper suggestions) and was pretty impressed! When I called dispatch someone friendly answered on the second ring and told me a driver would pick me up soon. Within less than 2 minutes my driver, Rizzy, called me to let me know he was on his way and would be there in under 5 minutes. Rizzy showed up right on time and got me home just in time for dinner (which was good because after comparing notes on the best pizza places I had worked up an appetite!). My ride with Rizzy cost me only $9 with tip (across downtown to midtown). The same exact ride in an Uber cost me twice that at $18. The cabs are just as clean, the drivers are friendly and show up promptly...seems like Jay's is a pretty solid option too for about half the cost!
<review# 698,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/3/2013,2/12/2014,100,165,11,17,9>How on earth have I managed to go this long without reviewing this place?   I know why, I wanted to avoid the "Asian & Casino" commentary.  No I didn't!  I'm totally messing.  I have absolute NO issues admitting that it looked like almost everyone in there could have been related to me.I have dined there maybe half a dozen times or so and every visit has been on point.  Service is always top notch, the red wines have always been great, they don't get weird about you splitting dishes (or filets even for that matter), the meat is always cooked exactly as you request (knock on wood) and the desserts have been amazing.  Here is my idea of the perfect meal there:  Two different red wines, the Seasonal or Foster's Salad, Filet Mignon medium rare and a side.  I think I have tried almost all of their sides at this point and they've all been great.  Think my least favorite thus far has been their High Steaks Potatoes.  Bummer that they put their own name on what I feel is their weakest side dish.  Please DO NOT get me wrong, I think the State Fair is great but I didn't want to be reminded of it every time I got a whiff of these deep fried potato chunks.    WARNING sides can be hot.  Like Napalm hot.  Be careful, the roof of your mouth will thank you.Saving the best for last...  DESSERT.  Yes, I just did the whole "strawberry shortcake" trick in my head to make sure I spelled that right.  See?  I'm not full-on nerd Asian (while we are on the topic of stereotypes).  I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I had the Chocolate Creme Brulee, that is UNTIL I tried the Valrhona Chocolate Volcano -last visit.  Sweet baby jeebis, this thing was like...   yeah.  It was like THAT.
<review# 699,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2013,7/12/2013,640,434,5,16,11>Not exactly sure how this place has eluded us for so long.  We live nearby but had never tried the place out. Saw a few reviews on Yelp and thought we better get in here fast.  I was impressed with the enthusiasm of Skip, who greeted us right away and took our order. He certainly makes the a special place. The staff was very efficient and friendly, they even refill your drinks for you, so aside from ordering at the counter your pretty much getting table service after you sit down.  The burger was too much to handle for one person I mean it was huge.  The garlic Parmesan fries were yummy and hubby got the sweet potato shoestrings and loved them.  Like everyone else I see here he was wishing they were criss-cut as well. We all ordered something different and it was all fantastic.  There are options for everyone to get something they like.  The prices are not cheap but it is worth it for a treat cause the quality and quantity are both there.  I especially love the novelty of the pick a card game to try and get the Joker so your lunch is free, it just gives your lunch or dinner a fun twist....and who knows you might get lucky!  Try them out you will not be disappointed. We will certainly be back again and again so we can try more things on the menu.
<review# 700,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2013,7/11/2013,74,128,7,14,10>It is really Banh Xeo's fault that my friend and I found this place. I wanted to share a meal with my friend for lunch, but the hours changed and we had to make a quick decision to go somewhere else. This is the second time this happened, we are starting to make jokes about it.We saw Kabab N Chutney across the street,  it was a winner for us. The menu is quite extensive, the restaurant is modern, clean and attractive with classical music on the sound system. I love when a restaurant has a feel for ambiance.We ordered Byriani, my friend the Chicken Byriani, I had the Mutton Byriani, we shared the Garlic Naan.The flavors were wonderful and complex with just the right amount of heat, the Naan perfect, the voice of Andrea Bocelli accompanying us during the meal. I know I should have ordered some Curry with the Byriani, but the Byriani stood on it's own very well.Next time I will do that, it is so good that I will make this one of my favorite places.
<review# 701,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2013,7/9/2013,728,233,12,21,14>I have refused to go to this restaurant over and over. Why?! Well, if you don't know, the last two restaurants that ran their business here sucked balls. Food sucked. Service sucked. Layout made no sense. So it just made sense to ME to not try ANY food here at this exact location ever again!It wasn't until my friend told me that the food here was actually good. So, I bit my tongue,  swallowed my pride, and gave this location another shot. To my surprise, it was busy. That means people actually come here because it's at least decent.The decor is kept simple with a few paintings hung on the wall. The weird layout (where there used to serve sushi?) is not gone. It's more opened, and it's not as gloomy. Customer service was great. Even though they were busy, they reassured us that they were cleaning a table to have it prepared for us to sit down. We were greeted by the servers and water was given to us immediately.Onto food. What they have here that I haven't eaten anywhere yet in Sacramento is BANH BEO! It's a small steamed rice cake, a Hue cuisine. Everything about the banh beo is worked harmoniously in a single bite: the soft but not too rubbery consistency of the steamed dough (made creamier by bits of melted lard), the freshness of the shrimp meat, the crunchiness of the cracklings, andthe unique balance of the sauce dribbled over everything, where the fish sauce plus sugar should somehow meld everything in a lingering flavor that isn't the slightest bit fishy or sugary yet hints of dried shrimp..And my main entree, is their Com Tam Suon Bi Cha (Vietnamese Broken Rice with Pork Chops and Shredded Pork Skin and Pork-Egg Custard. It is composed of broken rice (com tam), suon (grilled pork chop), bi (pork skin), cha trung hap (steamed pork-egg custard) topped by scallion oil and dressed with nuoc nam (fish sauce) It was savory, succulent, and just damn good.So, for those who have been to this location before, and have been let down miserably (twice) I suggest you come back here and give Bon Mua a try. It's cliche, but "third time's a charm"

That was almost a year ago. CrossFit CenCal is a great place to workout! The workouts are different every day and you never get bored. I am always challenged and just when I think a workout is going to be easy...it kicks my ass. You will be sore, especially when you first start out. I remember my first week there, I was having difficulties getting up from my seat at my desk job. Great training if you enjoy participating in mud runs like the Spartan Race. Christian does a great job of leading the evening classes. They have evening classes that start at 5pm, 6pm, and 7pm. Workouts are designed to be done in an hour.The only thing I wish they would have is a rope climb. The older building had one but it was lost since the relocation across the way.Right now they have a promo on pricing; $55 a month if you sign up for a 12 month contract....DO IT!!!
<review# 703,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2013,7/7/2013,562,500,23,45,37>I have had what I thought was a stomach problem for eight or nine months now.  It was not until I recently went to visit a doctor for a really bad lingering chest cold that I learned that my problem had to do with a bad heart and not my stomach.  I thought my cold may have gotten to the point of possibly being life threatening but I had absolutely no idea to what extent.I was immediately rushed past the crack heads and crazy street people lingering in the waiting area to a bed in a private emergency room.  Wires were connected to my chest to monitor my heart rate, oxygen tubes were stuck up my nose, a couple of intravenous lines were started in my arm, a heart rate cuff was wrapped around my upper arm that automatically took my blood pressure every few minutes.  Vials of blood were continually removed and sent to various labs to be microscopically scrutinized.A saline drip with medication to bring down my heart rate was immediately inserted into one of the IV lines.  A continuous barrage of tests were begun to search for life threatening stroke (stroke is such an ugly word) inducing blood clots.After countless numbers of excruciatingly long hours of tests and close monitoring, I was finally moved to a room in the cardiac ward on the fifth floor where the continuous, unceasing barrage of around the clock monitoring and tests continued. A few hours later I was unlucky enough to get a roommate that insisted on the volume of his television being continually mind splittingly loud, echoing off the walls in a way that reminded me of an acoustically challenged nightclub.  Even worse, the man was semi conscious and kept moaning and groaning at audio levels somewhat above those of a 747 in takeoff mode.Finally the long sleepless nights would turn into day and the construction crews overhead would begin to drill into concrete while my bed frame forced its way through my mattress and into my tired aching limbs. What made all of this even remotely tolerable was all of the angels running around this hospital.  You might think they are merely nurses but I am completely convinced they are earth angels.  Every single one of them was completely amazing and went out of their way to make me comfortable in any way they possibly could.  There are not enough words in the English language to describe how much I appreciate the wonderful way they treated me.Thanks Sutter for taking such great care of me.

The Firecracker Burger, the Chicken Strips with a GIANT basket of fries, the Calzone or any of their pizzas are amazing. And during the weekend they have a tremendous brunch menu with daily specials with killer bloody marys and  bottomless mimosas.As far as drinking goes, whatever you want they got and then some. Full bar, plenty of draft and bottled beer options and any or all of their bartenders (especially Curt and Christina) can get super creative.

After all, a specialty restaurant in Sac must be doing something right if it's been around for several years!!!I'm not sure why I've waited this long?!?! I suppose the outside of the restaurant may not be as appealing and inviting, but boy, I see why they don't focus on their outward appearance; the focus is in the flavors of their food!!!My husband met me for dinner and he wasn't very hungry so I decided we would just split an entree, Thali style, to minimize any excess spending beyond our Groupon value. We ordered the chicken Tikka Masala thali because this is my base on which to gauge whether an Indian restaurant is worthy or not. Let me say, the flavor of the Tikka Masala sauce is by far the best flavor I have tasted in my (only handful of) visits to Indian food!!!! I kept spooning heaping amounts of sauce onto my rice and indulging in the creamy, tomatoey goodness of it all!!! My husband agreed with the flavor.We also ordered a meal for my daughter from the children's menu. The prices for childrens' meals were fair and she was given alternative choices even though the menu had specific choosings for each meal. We really liked the waitress. She was very accommodating, pleasant and easy to communicate with. The only problem was that she was spread very thin. She appeared to be the only 'waitress', though there were others circulating as runners, drink fillers and bill collectors. She was hard to get a hold of, but when she was present she was very attentive...even taking the time to engage with my daughter and 'attempt' to converse (given my daughter's personality, she failed at getting a single word out of her, but that's my daughter for ya!). We agreed we would return again! The lack of one star is in the time we had to wait for our food and for our waitress to come back around again. I found us waiting for awkward moments of time for her to take our order and bring us a check. I suppose if you have the time and understanding, this can be overseen so that you can truly enjoy what you came for...the meal!!!

My wife and I looked at several daycare center around our neighborhood, and on our way to work while she was pregnant. We finally decided on The Poppy Patch because of the security, location, and curriculum for the children.   They have different areas on the franchise tax board property based on the age of the children. you need to get a security badge to buzz yourself in to drop off or pick up your kid. They are constantly teaching your child new things. I wish I could take credit for as smart as she is, but I have to give the credit to the staff here. I am not planning on any other children ever ,but if it happens I would send that kid here also.   My daughter has been coming here for almost 5 years and can read, write, count, and anything else needed to enter kindergarten, and then some. The price was comparable to any other place we looked into and worth every penny.

Then drawing a design and stenciling it on me then he just started drawing the rest of the design right on my skin with a marker.      After my appointment I wasn't even able to see the old tattoo. Just a really nice koi fish with flowers and waves. The colors are so bright too.     I always thought i would have to live with the mistake i made with the old tat, but the work he did is so amazing  I've already started talking to him about the Dragon tattoo I want to get and made a appointment with him at the end of the month to started with it.    Myke is the best.

I'm not being very creative, but I get to sample 2 items and test the rice/beans.The frijoles refritos (refried beans) are quite possibly the BEST I have ever had.  The rice was also very very good....even though I can make better rice at home, this is the best Mexican restaurant rice I've had.Carnitas Super Taco:  Tortillas appear to be "homemade" quality.  Like "Mi Abuelita" brand, only better!  The carnitas were tender and juicy, but needed spice. I was able to add the mango habanero sauces (there are 2 kinds!) to make things OK for my palate.The tamale was good enough for Rocklin, but failed to surpass Carniceria Lopez #2 in South Sac (Who can top those tamales anyway?)I wasn't crazy about the brown sauce poured over the tamale.Next time, I'll try the more authentic dishes.  RMG passed my first visit.Kudos for the "zanahorias" (carrots) in the salsa bar.  3 kinds of freshly made salsas, all were excellent. And the CHIPS were awesome!  Best mexican restaurant chips anywhere.And the "tortilla vegetable soup" sample was a nice touch.Did I mention they have EXCELLENT customer service.  This is another Flaming Grill Cafe, folks.Thank you YELP!!!
<review# 712,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2009,6/8/2009,78,78,3,6,2>Five of us went to Sakuran for lunch. It was EPIC.Also, a shoutout to one of my readers I ran into at the sushi bar! I love meeting you guys.Onto the sushi:Chef's Choice Roll #1- Super thin cucumber roll filled with salmon, tuna and crab, in a light citrus sauce. Chef's Choice Roll #2- Spicy tuna roll covered with salmon and mango, with three sauces.Chef's Choice Roll #3- Extra-wide deep fried roll with mackerel, salmon, crab and deep friend shrimp. This one came with a light creamy orange sauce which was spectacular (Dear other sushi places in the area, learn how to make sauces from these people... I'm supposed to taste fish not salad dressing). Chef's Choice Roll #4- Multi-fish extra large roll with panko crumb coating. I have a picture of one of these posted here.Dragon Roll- Ketel Boyfriend ordered this one because he wanted something spicy. It sure was!Seared Tuna Rose- He took a very lightly seared tuna and made a flower out of it, then shingled paper thin slices of it like fish scales over a plate. Flat Hamachi Ceviche- Paper thin slices of hamachi layered onto a plate and coated in a citrus and spice mixture.Wakame and Radish salad- They took a wakame salad and added radishes to it for extra crunch.JAPANESE NACHOS- Ok, these were crazy good. I told the chef that he needs to put these on the menu NOW. No idea where he came up with this one. He tempura deep fried whole mint leaves, then put a tuna salad on top with some herbs. This was FANtastic. Hopefully these are put on the menu soon so people will know what to ask for!
<review# 713,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2009,6/7/2009,52,42,4,4,7>The lady who did my pedicure, was nice, didn't rush even though they started to close up shop about halfway through, and paid a lot of attention to detail.     I'm a really picky customer and I didn't have any complaints. No pain when she clipped my nails and cuticles, either. The polish looks wonderful, and I'm hoping that since she did a base and topcoat that it won't chip for a few weeks.         She even fixed my nail polish when I fudged it putting my foot in the dryer. I felt pretty bad because I'm sure she wanted to go home, but she laughed it off and said "No problem! no worries!" It only cost $15 which is a big plus because this girl is on a budget.      My feet feel soft and smooth, look pretty, and I'll be going back

<review# 715,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2008,6/5/2009,294,204,3,4,3>I have come to this place off and on, or at least once or twice a week with my cousins.  They are the "regulars" at this place and they even know the owner, who I might add is a great guy as well.  The first time I came to this place, I felt like I was underdressed being that I was wearing a hooded sweatshirt and sweats.  It was a pretty cold night so I didn't think anything of it.  As a matter of fact, the cousin I was with was dressed the same way so I didn't feel so bad.  Despite how we were dressed, they didn't turn us away.As far as the bartenders go, my favorites are....well let's leave that as our little secret...you are just going to have to go there and experience the bartenders.  They both pour great drinks so get ready to walk out of the restaurant stumbling after about a couple (or more) of their drinks (we need to keep them in business).  I love how their well drinks are still pretty top shelf.  I normally order a cranberry vodka and after 4 or 5, I'm a bit tipsy and giggly.  Love them bartenders.As far as food, I've only heard about the drunken noodles and the pad thai.  I heard they were really good.  I've only tried the mango sticky rice which was great because they use real mangos that look like they just cut them and it's even nicely presented.  The sticky rice had just the right amount of sweetness to it as well.The decor of the place is very calming and the water fountains add to the environment.  I usually sit at the bar but people who eat at the regular tables look like they are enjoying themselves.  Ahh...that's another thing, you can order food at the bar while drinking your drinks.  Another benefit about this restaurant.I also cant' forget my spicy cashews.  The first time I had these they were to die for.  Now that I go every so often I have to have them.  They are addicting.  If you go to the restaurant during happy hour I believe they are 1/2 off.  Love it!Overall, this is a great place to just hang out, have dinner, have drinks, talk to friends and family and talk to the bartenders.  You will definitely leave this place with a new friend or friends and some great conversation and hopefully full or a bit tipsy.Hopefully I'll bring more people into this place so that they can experience what I continuously experience at this place.  Thanks Vic, Alisa and Ria.

The stadium has expansion potential to seat 30,000. This year they had lights installed making for safer games in the early season when temperatures here in the stinkin' CV can still hang in the triple digits. I'm going to subtract one star from a perfect five for the excessive use of electricity. College football really ought to be played on Saturday afternoon in October. Why the night games? Super extra bonus star value: Free admission during the fourth quarter!
<review# 717,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2008,6/3/2009,11,75,7,7,6>The last time I came here they didn't have their liquor license yet (long time ago)!  I said, "Oooooh hell to the no!"  I don't know about you, but when I am indulging in a mouth full of beans and fried pork I am not exactly looking to wash that down with a freaking wine cooler!  This time, with liquor license secured, I was a much happier camper.  The black beans were cooked perfectly and had a very savory flavor.  Yum.  And the Carnitas were very tasty as well.  My only complaint about said pork was that it seemed to be a little overly cooked... it had kind of a petrified outer crust.. and the size of the chunks were a little on the large side.  This sounds awfully knit-picky, I'm aware, but when the exterior of the meat is so tough and the chunks are larger than bite size, one is apt to appear a tad on the cave man side while gnawing on a huge, crusty ass piece of meat.  That being said, it was very delicious.  Just don't eat that in front of anyone that you are trying to impress.And since this was my inaugural trip to the much improved boozey Tres Hermanas, It felt appropriate to get pretty trashed.  That bartender knows what he is doing in there.  A very liberally poured Cuervo with a Grand Marnier float on the rocks x 3 +loud mouthed, thirsty bitch= good time for me, bad time for everyone else!  Our server was a little sweetheart too.  She had perfectly manicured, very puffy hair which I really enjoyed.  It showed dedication on her part.

This is one of my go-to places on those nights when you are sitting around wondering where to go. me: "where do you wanna go?" you: "i dunno, where do you wanna go?"me: "i dunno, hell, let's just go to benny's." you wouldn't think it from the front of the building, but there is a pretty good sized patio in the back. in the summer time, it's the ideal place to come for a beer on an empty week night. in the winter time, there are a couple heaters back there to keep me warm long enough to get thru a smoke. OH! big white canopy tent things are new in the back so my friends and i don't have to get rained on while crouching next to a heater long enough to get thru a smoke. there's a bar in the back too so you don't have to fight your way through the crowded hallway up to the bar inside.the pros: the bartenders have the heaviest hands around. if you ask for a double-anything, that quite possibly could be your only drink for the night. don't let them fool you, they may look mean, but the bouncers are some of the nicest in midtown. the cons: it gets really crowded on friday and saturday nights. there is only one bathroom stall for the ladies and the toilet can be on the fritz sometimes. it's best not to break the seal when you are there.

She herself enjoyed it and she loved it so much that she savored every bite of it.  I ordered the usual the Chicken Slouviaki.  I know I should've ordered something different next time.  I just cannot help myself enjoying my Pita.We savored our pitas that we couldnt even begin our chips that came with our combo meal.  We thought if we ate our chips it would ruin the freshness. It's the same as my review the last time.  I LOVE IT!  The freshness is great.  The food is just great.  This time I brought someone again to try it.  OH she said she will be back again.PARKKINGI came here on a FRIDAY around noon.  I was surprised to see that the PARKING is packed!  People who had SUVs were parking on COMPACT parking spaces.  Really terrible.  I guess there is no way to monitor that kind of stuff unless they hire someone to heckle the customers that park.  Other than that, it was worth it coming back here again! Whoo Hoo!  LOVE IT!Im going to go again soon!
<review# 720,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/22/2012,1/14/2013,129,87,15,12,14>Before eating at Mangia's I would always have U2's song playing in the back of my mind when entering other sandwich shops...."But I still haven't found what I'm looking for......"  Well I found it today that's fo sho!!!Me and one of the bestie's were on a mission for some good grubbin' on a warm Saturday afternoon. I remembered reading a few reviews on Mangia and thought let's give it a shot. Since I totally eat with my eyes and I have been salivating at the pictures people have posted of these sandwiches I was bracing myself for what could either be a kick-ass sandwich or a let down (hey it wouldn't be the first time). Ordered the Capital Grinder because let's face it you can't go wrong with some BBQ Beef Brisket and horseradish aioli. The Grinder was absolutely delicious. The bread was crunchy but as you've read in previous reviews not so crunchy where it rips the top of your mouth (I effin' HATE that!!!). The cole slaw was zippy and had good flavor. Everything on this sandwich was brilliant.Bestie was saying a few thankful Hail Mary's for finding this sandwich. The Hail Mary was also a damn good sandwich. The only reason I know is because we split half and half because sharing is caring....CARE BEARS STARE!!!!!! Sorry back to the sandwich. The pastrami wasn't rubbery and tasted like it should meaning it's been marinating and swimming in a hot-tub of its own gravy and juices just waiting to be slapped onto another sandwich for the next lucky recipient. I will be back to try the rest of the menu that Mangia has to offer better believe it. I also would have taken pictures of our sandwiches, but alas you would have thought we snorted those suckers up with a Hoover attachment. Any place that offers a sandwich called the Atomic Meatloaf is more than A-OK in my book. See you soon Mangia!!!!

<review# 722,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/30/2012,1/12/2013,3276,1443,16,28,23>Decent Hookah ExperienceSITREPMy lovely friends Shinya M. & Sydney M. have instituted a reoccuring Gothic Hookah Meetup at the Hookah Lounge and it's fantastic fun!  [Note:  this review is not about the daytime food experience - it is solely about the night-time hookah lounge from 9pm-1am.]SETUPAlong Sacramento's K Street Mall between 7th & 8th Streets, the Plaza Cafe Hookah Lounge is such a welcome addition to the Mall Area and allows for a different sort of and more sophisticated form of relaxation that many of us have been craving.  [Like me, you MAY remember that this location used to be a Starbucks, and as far as I can remember, is one of the few Starbucks that has actually gone out of business.]Right now during the holiday season, it's a lot of fun.  Nestled next to the seasonal Downtown Ice Skating rink, it also allows for a fantastic form of decompression after a grueling 1-2 hours on the ice rink.HOOKAH LOGISTICSFor the most part, they are "single-user" hookahs (though I did spy a few of the multiple user varietals).  For the hookah rental and one bowl of toboacco (flavor of your own choosing as availability permits - some are more popular than others) it is a reasonable $12.  You can see the component parts of the hookah in the following diagram:hookahshop.co.uk/shisha_Each hookah comes with a single grommet for the hookah hose to go into.  On the opposite side is the air valve & ball-bearing for intake.  The pipe tray, the bowl grommet, and the tobacco bowl where the flavored tobaccos go, are all standard elements on this basic hookah set-up.**DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, DANGER!!**Something novices need to learn quick is that is never advisable (when trying to move your hookah from one place to another) to grab your hookah by the upper Pipe Stem - you MUST grab it lower down at the neck of the base bottle (or vase).  If you grab it by the Pipe Stem - as we saw a couple unfortunate individuals do - you will accidentally separate the stem from the base, and the disorientation of this separation will cause you to cast off the hot coals resting loosely upon the foiled cover tobacco bowl, and they may fall onto a couch, or worse - a person's lap - and cause damage/injury.  FLAVORSThere are SO MANY to choose from, but if you don't ask, you may get stuck with a flavor you can't stand.  I took a sample puff from a friend who had chosen the "Watermelon" flavored tobacco and I nearly puked.  Too sweet and strong.  There are also some other flavors such as Green Apple I was not too impressed with.  After having the hookah docent explain to me the flavors & bouquets of the other "mysteriously named" flavors, I settled on "Sex On The Beach" and after a full hour of enjoyment, I was surprisingly delighted by this choice.  It was richer, earthier, and more substantive.  [I think the younger gothlings just like their tobacco really sweet.]UNLOCK YELPER DISCOUNT!After I did my check in to the Hookah lounge, I immediately unlocked the special that allows a FREE REFILL of my tobacco bowl with the same or different tobbaco.  This was a boon for my friends who got to share my hookah well into the night even a couple hours later after I left.  And this is another plus of the lounge:  if you are sitting with a group of friends, even if you leave, your friends are permitted to keep your hookah (and add it to the group-collection) until that bowl is finished.X-TREMENDOUS YELPER BONUS!And actually upon your SECOND check-in, you unlock a bonus-extra-plus-"NoShit!?!"-giveaway!  You are entitled to a FREE BEVERAGE and you get that without having to make any purchase.  I got a Diet Pepsi, but that's just me.  How cool is that?  EVENT-FRIENDLYAs I mentioned, the staff are incredibly friendly and love working with a group.  My docent Michael helped manage the group and allowed Shinya & Sydney to hook up their iPods to the establishment sound system, and so the ladies had some very cutting edge German Industrial & English EBM music playing through the system so that we literally transformed the lounge into a Dance Club, and there was a lot of dancing going on amongst the hookah tables.THE LOWDOWNAll in all, if you want to engage a very pleasant hookah experience, the Plaza Cafe Hookah Lounge is a fantastic way to discover it.

<review# 724,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2012,1/9/2013,86,161,5,9,6>Best Burrito Downtown. Period.I love the pulled chicken, it is what really puts this place over the top.  While most places have dry cubed chicken, the shredded chicken at La Fiesta is just too delicious.  The mark of a good burrito is getting a bit of all the ingredients in each bite, and La Fiesta passes this test with flying colors.Another plus, they have an extensive salsa bar.  Most places have a few salsas, some even have the jalapenos and pickled carrots, but never before has it included couliflour, onion, radishes, carrots, and jalepenos all soaking in the spicy jalepeno juice.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it......That settles it, I'm getting La Fiesta right now!

Both were really good and not crazy expensive If i go back it would be hard for me not to get the same thing again.  I came here for a date, and I must say it was a good "date place". Its not too intimate and a little dark, candle lit tables and string lights make it kind-of romantic . .  but not like crotch-rub-under-the-table romantic. SO I enjoyed myself at Red Rabbit and I would come back again, although I would like to try sitting outside next time, the patio looked pretty sweet.

I took notice of all the signs as I was waiting for my to-go order by the door.. *sigh(I felt unwanted, lol). The brisk cold air from the open door was blowing in *brrr(stood there for about 10min). People coming into the restaurant were looking at me like "why is that girl standing there?". I occupied myself by checking my email & browsing Instagram (using Starbuck's wifi, holler). I ordered the chicken pesto pizza aka Soprano. Crust--not too thick, not too thin, crispy. Pesto sauce-- finely chopped basil, pine nuts w/ olive oil all intermingling nicely together(w/ some small garlic chunks here and there). Cheese--nice layer over the the sauce. Chicken--generous amount laid out on the pizza, just great(perfect chicken to pizza ratio). Nice fat(bigger than my head) slice. NomNation.Yes, it's worth the $5.10(after tax). I forked & knifed it 2/3s of the way up the slice, then used my hands. I didn't finish it in one sitting though(I had a peppermint mocha frap from Starbucks in my other hand). So I placed the rest on a plate and reheated a couple hours later. It tastes quite good reheated!I've had the pepperoni pizza & a costo sample size of their chicken fettuccine alfredo(friend couldn't finish it) and they were good, but that chicken pesto, tho. *insert delicious hand gesture emojiOverall, service was okay, didn't break any rules, & enjoyed my pizza.

Ch..? Ad..? No, I can't say it.  But this hot sauce is not only better, it's the best.  Hear me?!  T-H-E.  B-E-S-T.  I can't emphasize enough.  This is the hot sauce that makes any taco, burrito, quesadilla, any day.  My mouth salivates at the thought. Mmm.Did you recall I started this with a story?  So I went over the other day, feeling particularly indulgent, and it was torn down!  Noooo!!!  I was practically in tears!  I thought, 'the place is packed all the time, how could this be!?'  Well, the sign is still up as a friendly reminder, and they'll be back.  I'm not sure when.  But as soon as I hear, I'll letcha'll know.  And until then, I will be saving my appetite for that sweet, sweet gluttonous goodness.  For some reason, I'm reminded of the Most Interesting Man in the World...

<review# 729,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2011,9/27/2011,347,219,2,12,8>The newest Korean restaurant/bar in Sacramento! This is definitely the new late night kick it spot for cheap drinks and delicious food!The Lowdown: I came here with a large group and the waiter was super courteous, helping to rearrange some tables to better accommodate us. Even though it was close to closing time, there were so many people inside that they stayed open and let us hang out wayy past midnight on a Thursday night. The restaurant has a bar, and is very reminiscent of those Korean bars you see in K-dramas.  The noms: We ordered a few bottles of Hite (Korean beer) and they brought over icy cold cups for us. Then we ordered some soju and a few snacks, and some more beer....and pretty soon, our table was covered with alcohol and yummy Korean appetizers. They brought us cheesy-creamy corn on a sizzling platter, free of charge (and they gave us three of them!). I don't eat cheese but my group said it went wonderfully with the beer. We also had spicy kimchi pancake, Korean fried chicken (with the sauce on the side, yum! You get a LOT of chicken, and some pretty big drumsticks), and spicy rice cake and fish cake. They ended up doubling our order of the fish and rice cakes for us, which was very generous. After we had finished our food and sunk into a deep food coma, the owner brought out some popsicles (the real shit, Dreyer's fruit bars) and handed them out to everyone as a cool and refreshing post-meal treat. Crackinnnnn'This place is a true gem in Sacramento, where most Korean restaurants that have legit food are usually coupled with terrible service or high prices. Here, you can tell that the owners want you to enjoy your meal or your night out without making a dent in your wallet. I will DEFINITELY be back here!

Spencer and Leslie and the rest of the crew really know their stuff and are as friendly as can be, which can be HUGE when I stumble in, bleary eyed, in search of focus and pep.Finally...a reason to look forward to tomorrow morning!
<review# 731,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2011,9/25/2011,79,170,4,8,6>Trying to write...good review...but it's...so early...I had to get up early to try this new donut shop in town, and well...it didn't disappoint. Doughbot has about a dozen different doughnut options, from their standard vanilla or raspberry up to their specialty bacon apple fritter and The Dude.The bacon maple is quite tasty, with the right amount of sweet and salty. You get a piece of bacon riding on top of your maple topping, and bits of bacon hiding inside as well. As my girlfriend points out, the dough itself has a good flavor too - denser than some donuts, not over sweetened, and a good taste.  Perfect base for their variety of flavors.Ok, if you're like me, you want to know about the Dude, right?  I was impressed by the concept of a white Russian in donut form, and excited to see a bottle of vodka and kahlua sitting just off to the side of the register.  Yep, the frosting has both in it.  Inside is Bavarian cream with more coffee / kahlua flavor.  Overall, a successful concoction.  Maybe it's my early morning delerium, but I can totally taste the Caucasian in this donut.And vegans, you're welcome here too.  Steer clear of the above choices and you'll find 4-5 choices like cacao, red raspberry and vanilla bean.Top it all off with a coffee or milk, and you're all set.  I'll be back for more donuts, and in the meantime I'm going to wish Doughbots was closer to my home...
<review# 732,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2011,9/24/2011,648,305,10,16,15>'Amarin' and I had a long affair. We used to have late dinners quite often. Im so thrilled its back!! (with different name and owners)THANK you, for keeping the servers and cook staff! The food? The same as I remembered. Out of this world sweet and spicy deliciousness. My go- to dishes are the Bangkok Pineapple (chicken OR shrimp) and the Mango Curry....frickin' bomb. You can never go wrong.They give you so much goodness we have always ended up taking half our dishes home, here is where I learned how to use leftovers. Doggie bags make THE best morning hangover scramble. Seriously. Crack an egg or two with the curry, bell peppers, broccoli and chicken/prawns in a large skillet- throw in that side of Jasmine rice, and BAM!   Are you kidding me??! (Nope) Impress that Saturday morning lover with a Bangkok Scramble to die for. Service is still top notch, there's a happy hour, and the decor is still amazingly calm and quaint. I love everything here- the Thai coffee, large windows, chic bar, the veggie-head dishes- even the after dinner cappuccino candy. Here, is where I introduced my father to Thai food. Its pretty laid back that way, and the menu describes every dish...Im full... and I STILL want to go back. Scramble tomorrow though...so its all good.
<review# 733,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2011,9/23/2011,640,434,53,73,66>I was introduced to Audra by a friend a few years ago.  Audra had a special for referring clients and my friend was going in to get her haircut and I joined her, since I was looking for a new stylist as well.  Audra was so nice and took the time to really get to know my friend and me as well. She offered us something to drink, a glass of wine was one of the options and I took it.  So my friend and I got to visit over a glass of wine while she was getting a new style!  How can you beat that?!? Well she offered me a free haircut as well and I eventually took her up on the offer (I'm a big chicken) She had the hair glitter in her hair and I got some put in too.  So fun and different.  She was very knowledgable and helpful in showing and teaching us how to recreate the style at home.  Because you know how it is, you go get your hair done and then it NEVER looks like that again!  Not with Audra she really shows you how to do your hair and even gives you free bang trims in between cuts.  I cannot say enough good things about her,  I love her!  She just recently started this salon and I am so glad that through YELP I found her again!  So lets recap, great cut and style, wine, snacks, great conversation, the newest trends and products and you got yourself a great stylist and salon!
<review# 734,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2011,9/22/2011,190,238,6,9,8>Great place to hang out, and have some beers and tacos.  I love bringing out of town and local friends here via boat.  The live music is hit or miss (remember $5 for cover), but regardless the outdoor atmosphere is always cool.  So many morning glories!There is free boat parking, and a super sketchy ramp to lead you to your destination above.  Getting up the ramp is not a huge concern; getting down after a few beers is definitely an adventure.The tacos are pricey, but worth it, on Saturdays (even ala carte).  The $2.99 guac is a tiny little side, so you may need to order two.  The chips, salsa, guac, and tacos are indeed very tasty and filling.  And do not forget to ask for the green salsa, and the ladies will hook you up!Note to those who "break the seal":  There is only one bathroom for women, other than the port-o-johns (...or janes).  I usually invest some time in line for the former, and I must admit I've had some great chats with the others in line, waiting for the loo.
<review# 735,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2011,9/21/2011,466,199,8,8,8>This is a combo bar and breakfast review for the FnG.  Bar I'm at a 4 or 5. Breakfast at a 3 or 4.  Sooo - math it up!The bartenders are sarcastic but still somehow welcoming.  They keep me laughing and always play the fat beats on their ipods.  The drinks du jour lean in the beer and whisky or scotch direction but there is a full bar for your drinking pleasure.  If you order a cosmo, your request may be met with some major eye-rolling but stand strong - they're not as tough as they pretend to be.Breakfast time provides hours of entertainment.  Which hopefully you have because the line is DMV long.  The crowd includes hungover hipsters, church-goers and hungry midtowners who forgot how long the wait is.  FnG's generosity mixed with pity means you get coffee while you wait.  Hallelujah!  Service is fine, kind of hit or miss really, depending on who you get and how busy it is.  Seating is tight but the ceilings are high so I never get that claustrophobic feeling.  The breakfast fare is good but nothing to do cartwheels over.  I do like the  welsh rarebit which I think is a cheese and beer sauce and they use it like hollandaise.  Vegetarian options include tempeh and tofu.  I'm a big fan of the devonshire cream and while it is usually served with crumpets or scones, I would chow down on hubcaps if they were coated with devonshire cream.  I know, bad right?
<review# 736,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2010,9/20/2011,651,150,10,10,12>On the corner of Fulton and Marconi you are likely to find many tragedies.  Among these, the heavy congestion on the streets that makes the late Jerry Falwell's arteries look like the Autobahn.   Coming in at a close second, the unwashed masses of zombie-like meth laden characters who seem to be in a state of perpetual audition for the next George Romero flick.  However, as if to serve as refuge from all of this, a last bastion of humanity in an area rife with discontent, Nagato Sukiyaki stands alone.One of the first things you'll notice about this place upon entering is that it has a small and simple interior.  With the modern sushi joint often riding the line between  a Vegas style club and a Six Flags theme park, it's refreshing to see that not all places have given in to the excesses of decor.  After all, it's really about the food and Nagato delivers.The rolls here are nothing short of amazing.  The freshness of their ingredients becomes really apparent.  I'd recommend the house special, the Nagato roll.  The Omega roll was my favorite though.  The beef teriyaki that I sampled from my daughter's plate was of the kind that melts in your mouth.  It was hardly the rawhide you find other places.The only downside to this place is that you'll wait a bit for the food.  It's probably not the place to grab a meal if you have to be at a show in 30 minutes.  Come when you have a bit of time to waste and come hungry.  On the plus side you can always watch a little baseball at the bar while you wait.  Domo Arigato Nagato Sukiyaki.
<review# 737,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2011,9/19/2011,324,135,19,12,18>I'm impressed.You may think it's because of the generous and clean space. You may think it's their myriad beers, conveniently menu-ed and categorized by bottle or faucet. You may guess it's the creative take on munchies. You may even figure it's the pool and Foosball tables.But what really impressed me the first time I approached the front door of Alley Katz was that they actually had a stray alley cat roaming the sidewalk. A cute little tabby that seemed genuinely happy to play mascot for this new Midtown watering hole.I've been to The Raven: no bird in sight.How about Golden Bear? Must be hibernating.Benny? Never met him.Alley Katz is good, clean, hoppy fun. Grab a pint, sink into one of their giant booths, order the Sylvester.In no time, you'll be a Kat person, too.

Everything I've tried here has been delightful; the food is stupendous. Your staff is on key too. They are very helpful and didn't mind having a chat with me. Thank you for such a great experience. On the other hand, your neighbor brings out the bad side of you. I've disliked the fact that R15 is your neighbor. The noise bothers me at times while chatting with friends during some evenings. I do recommend my friends here; but only during the day light hours. Thank you, Sunny Le.PS. Pros: Food, Staff, Easy menu.Cons: Some noise during evening times.Stars: 4 Flat
<review# 739,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/6/2011,2/13/2012,397,268,8,11,9>Okay, so after seeing many of my Yelp friends check in here, I decided that I needed to see what this place is all about... yeah, I guess that makes me sound like a stalker but it was worth it because Old Soul is a keeper. I walked in, kind of expecting the usual hipster stare down... no way... the crowd was all smiles. So maybe the employees behind the bar are uber hipster looking, I kinda dig it - adds to the vibe, and they are super friendly.  I walked up and ordered my usual - an iced vanilla latte with an add shot. I then parked myself on a huge comfy couch and took in the scenery. Love the atmosphere, the artwork and the big open space. I wondered how I was going to get myself off of that cozy couch but there was no need. The barista must have seen the laziness on my face because he brought the latte right over to me! Now, what typically happens at this point is that i am thinking "wow this place is pretty cool... might have to visit this place on the reg " Then I take a sip of my latte and think "or not".  Well... let... me... tell... you... (channeling my Jewish Grandma), Old Soul's latte sealed the deal! After reading some of the other reviews (more Yelp stalking) I think that I better make a trip back soon to check out the food!
<review# 740,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2012,2/12/2012,160,180,5,7,8>This spot took place at a great gallery of art and imagination!  For New Years Eve of 2012 took place at the Creative Vera Studio. There was a event for the fellow Yelpers which was the coolest thing I've ever seen this year!  The gallery itself has much culture and art portrayed on the oil canvases and painting amongst the walls throughout the inside of the building which are also available for purchase. But during the event, this was a very nice spot.  The building looked a bit small from the outside, but when you walk in, it's like BAM!  You get a large area where there is a dj spinning the top 40's and a spot for pictures to show off your Moulin Rouge theme clothing.. and on the left I didn't even know that there was beer on tap because I thought it was part of the art (I regret it because I heard it was good).  Then there were sandwiches of turkey or ham which were AMAZING!  Just when I thought that was it.. no, they had another room that had a Humanitarian Foundation group that played good music and had this "Bison grass Vodka" called .. "Zu" or "Zubrowka" which is a vodka you sip which was ohhh so smooth! Then in the room in the very back, they had a chill area with couches and random chairs with a table that had crayons we could put a little of our art on.  (I drew a Pacman chasing the ghosts!)  The room in the far back had a wine selection of Merlot or a Chardonnay from "Elevation Ten Winery" which I favored the Chardonnay just because I favored the white grape.  But on the side note, EVERYBODY on Yelp is amazingly friendly, and I really loved this because it was my first event, I truly had a great time and met a lot of new people.. new and GREAT people which I hope to see again!
<review# 741,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2012,2/11/2012,65,799,8,10,10>This was probably my most favorite Yelp Elite Event ever.  Our friends who live in Folsom actually were talking about Land Ocean over dinner a few days ago so my plus one and I were very excited about attending this event to see what all the talk was about.  Land Ocean was right on the dot when it came to ambiance and service. As Joe K mentioned, it was a small and intimate affair, very unlike many other Yelp events and I felt like I could actually go around and meet local Yelp Eliters.  We were seated right near the bar but the servers at Land Ocean made it easy just to order with them.  Did I mention we were given 2 drink tickets each to use at their bar.  Fantastic.  I heard the pale ale was good but i had the wine! My plus one and I were seated at a booth and two other Yelpers asked if we could join them.  Of course they could!  Strangely, the other Yelper and I had three mutual friends and were able to coordinate a separate social event this same week!  Love the idea of meeting new people from Sacramento who also enjoy good food, wine and great restaurants.  The appetizers that they served were beyond impressive.  Yes, no little dinky appetizers that leave you wanting more protein.  Instead, Land Ocean offered a plethora of good (and big) bites including:Kobe Beef SlidersTempura Tiger Prawns with coconut butter sauceBeef WellingtonSouth Western Egg RollGarlic Cheese BreadBBQ Chicken SlidersPork SlidersFresh Home Made Potato ChipsBeef wellington and the Garlic Cheese Bread were my favorite.  The garlic cheese bread just oozed of amazing goodness in my mouth.  I think my eyes rolled back a little. We event got to take our picture next to the Yelp sign. Hopefully they get posted! I also finally met Alex L who helped to coordinate this event!  He was super friendly and greeted us instantaneously when we arrived.  Joy was also helpful checking us in and giving us our wrist bands.  Kudos to another successful event.
<review# 742,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/1/2011,2/10/2012,476,248,10,20,18>Wanting clean flavors and a light dinner, a group of six of us walked on over to Nishiki. Sometimes, on a beautiful Spring day, all you crave are refreshing salads, fruits and SUSHI! You know, stuff that doesn't make you feel like a disgusting piggy.The waitress placed some edamame in front of me, and I was a happy girl. In my happy state, I ordered hamachi nigiri and a Corvette roll which had seared tuna! Mmmm....I devoured both. I even had a sample of the Pepperfin and the Lambert roll...both were really tasty.And, if you're in a small party of two or so, I would suggest eating at the sushi bar. Chatting with the sushi master was nice, and he earned some major bonus points when he have our group free tastes of seared tuna and charbroiled tuna. Oh mama.
<review# 743,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/4/2011,2/9/2012,826,495,4,9,12>I've been meaning to try this place since it opened and I finally convinced a friend to go with me so I wouldn't have to eat alone. It turned out, we were there on the one year anniversary of the opening, but luckily they were able to get us a table right away.I loved the ambiance of the place. It's upscale and classy and while it's not big, there is enough seating at the tables and bar to handle a medium size crowd. They had a guitarist/singer playing, but not so loud that we couldn't have a nice conversation. The staff was very friendly, service was excellent and our waiter was very attentive to our needs. We both started with the clam chowder which was quite tasty. For our main course I went with the prime rib and my friend had crab cakes. The prime rib was done perfectly and the side of green beans and baked potato was delicious. I tasted the crab cakes as well and while they were good, they were a bit bland and could have used some additional seasoning. Despite that though, we had no complaints about the meal.I was also impressed by how reasonable the prices were on the menu. Of course, we didn't have drinks, so that kept the cost of a meal down, but really the prices are not expensive for what you get.I'm glad that I got to visit Had's on its one year anniversary and I hope there are many more to come. I can see this becoming one of my favorite restaurants in midtown and I definitely want to go back and try the scallops and the famous steak sandwich soon.
<review# 744,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/27/2011,2/8/2012,66,86,10,18,16>I am happy.6 years in Sacramento and I've seen three different incarnations at this location fail.  I'm feeling good about Estelle's.  Please excuse having to imagine my lame Jim Carrey impression as I say: I like it a lot.I came in last week (Monday the 19th?) after gorging myself on Christmas freebies all morning (i.e., fat and sugar.)  The seating area was totally empty.  I looked at the two glass pastry cases, and both were filled mostly with flaky little treats.  I noticed near the espresso bar that they brew Temple coffee."Do you have sandwiches?" I asked.They only had turkey.  Good enough.  I was given the option of a full sized turkey croissandwich (5-something) and a mini (3-something.)  Wanting to try the tomato bisque, I took the only mini.  The bisque came in one of those miniature tureens that remind you that your sterilite-laden house is not very classy--this is not stuff that comes in the RE: Room Essentials brand at Target.  It comes with a small pastry on top.  The soup itself is thick, creamy, and smooth with little bits of tomato.  It's like soul food in a bow tie.The mini croissant is literally worth writing home about.  That is, if those still residing at your home are really into croissants.  My mom has a cholesterol problem, so I decided to leave her out of this.  Flaky, tender, perfect.  I really don't know how to describe it.  Go to France, see what their pastries are like, and come home imagine that for a while.  Yeah, it's like that.I came back a second time for a pastry.  I got the pain de raisin (or what I think was pain de raisin.)  Just as good as the croissant.  I also overheard on my second trip that they make all of the baked goods in house.  They also now have a gift cards, too!As far as location goes, I foresee the one-block radius doing better with Temple nearby and Blackbird coming in.  It's definitely a better fit for the corner space, and the window bar and communal table are nice alternatives to the cafeteria setup it had before.For those of us short on airfare across the pond, Estelle's is a great temporary substitute.  Everything is simple, flaky, and flavorful.
<review# 745,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2011,2/5/2012,1059,313,3,11,12>I love it that I can just walk into this place and the staff is always so welcoming. I went here for lunch on my daughter's birthday because she really likes it here. Our waitress "Miranda" was fabulous. Very attentive, pleasant and sweet to the kids. The place was really busy and we were super impressed at how she was so on top of things... refills, food on time, etc. My two boys ordered off the kids menu (pizza and chicken crispers) and they ate it all. My daughter and I ordered the "Triple Dipper". Mine had sliders, potato skins and buffalo wings. The sliders were OK, the potato skins looked reheated and the sauce on the buffalo wings was tangy. I ate it all anyway because it wasn't horrible but it definitely could have been better. My daughter ordered the buffalo wings, chicken crispers and sliders... she ate everything but the buffalo wings as she couldn't handle the tangy sauce. I signed to the waitress to bring something for my daughter's birthday and she came out with a few staff members and a soft serve in a milkshake cup and they all sang. My daughter was super happy. Although the food was a little less than FANTASTIC we will definitely continue to visit because the service has always been great and so has the food we've ordered in the past.
<review# 746,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2011,2/4/2012,209,356,7,13,7>I respect a place that evolves to better itself. Sugar Plum seems to.Despite my past complaints, the last four or five times I've been here have been MUCH better. It's been a long time since I've encountered the dreaded greasy spoon (literally), and their service has gotten a little faster and friendlier. They even have a Square for their iPhone that allows them to accept card instead of just cash.I usually go for weekend endless brunch. You used to have to wait forever for your breakfast to come (and it would usually be cold), then wait forever to get the attention of an employee to ask for a refill, and wait another forever for a new plate to come out. They've streamlined it by just putting the food out buffet style and refilling whatever they're running out of. That way, you can serve yourself and choose what you want, and how much of it, without a hassle. It's SO much quicker and easier on everyone. I think they've gotten more consistent with what they offer too, and how they make it.We had a little hiccup this last weekend where we showed up at 10:15ish (the time we usually go for brunch) and were told that they only do coffee and pastries until 11:00. They tried to play it off like it's always been this way, but that's BS. Every other time I've come for brunch, we've been there way before 11:00 and never been told this before. It must be a new rule, which is fine, but we didn't know and sat around starving for another hour, waiting to eat. So, be warned. If you want brunch, don't get there until 11:00.
<review# 747,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/12/2012,2/3/2012,410,518,7,10,8>We chose this place based on their menu during Dine Downtown.  The menu stood out from the other restaurants because it offered a free drink (wine, beer, soda) with the $30 3 course meal.  There were two choices for the appetizer, 3 choices (really good choices) for the main course, and 2 choices for dessert.  Plus, my gfs and I haven't tried this restaurant out before, so we had to try it.This place is in Old Sacramento...so parking is a biznatch!  You can do meter parking and keep feeding the machine till 8pm (yes, 8pm!  Not 6pm like the rest of downtown), pay the flat parking fee for $5 (which I couldn't find), valet park for $7, or do what I did:  which was park in the Downtown mall parking lot and walk into Old Sac.  Only thing is you have to validate your ticket... which wasn't bad.  And I didn't have to buy anything to validate it :)  OR if you want to donate to the City of Sacramento, you can get a parking ticket for $49.50.Ambiance:  Very swanky/chic.  It's like a more modern Firehouse.  I really like the layout.  It was very open.  They also had private booths and private rooms for parties.Service:  SOOOO slow!  We had reservations at 6pm and it took forever for our courses to come out.  Good thing we ordered extra sides since our main course took forever!  We didn't leave the restaurant until 9pm.  It was a lot of waiting around.  .  Food:  Since there was five of us, we were able to try everything.  So here's the low down.Appetizer:Bacon chop:  OMG sooo good!  Wish there was more of it.  It was literally one very small piece of thick bacon and a very small amount of frisee.Ahi Sashimi:  As far as quantity, there was more raw fish compared to the bacon chop.  Pretty delish too.  Everyone who ordered it was VERY happy.Mac and Cheese:  I really like the bacon bits on top.   Nice touch!  The cheese wasn't the best.  It tasted like melted American cheese from the individually wrapped plastic that you buy in grocery stores, or just straight Velveeta.  We were hungry, so we ate it.  Fries:   Good!  I mean, you can't really mess up on fries.Main Course:Salmon:  My friend really enjoyed her meal.  She ate all of it and was really full afterwards.Steak:  My friend ordered her steak medium rare and it came out medium :/  Since we waited so long to get our main course, she was afraid that she'd be waiting forever if she asked for a different one.  Lamb Shank:  Really good!  It was a nice big piece with mashed potatoes.  I couldn't complain.Dessert:  Crème Brulee:  Yummy and it came with two cookiesChocolate Mousse: Nice, big slice that most of us couldn't finish.Final Thoughts:I'm glad this restaurant joined the Dine Downtown team.  I would have never gone out of my way to try this place out if their menu didn't encourage me to do so.  Service was mediocre at best.  Food was generally yummy.  Definitely want to come back and try their Happy Hour.  GREAT place to host parties, for ex:  engagement party, company holiday party, birthday party, etc.  Beautiful Place.
<review# 748,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2012,2/2/2012,247,159,11,12,10>Ok, love the deals and the prices here.  The good was good, I split two appetizers with my friend.  Had the Buffalo Mac and Cheese, SO FREAKING GOOD, and the crab stuffed jalapeno, it wasn't so good since it came to us stone cold, it could have been better.Drinks are out of control good here.  I also had a few shots of this really awesome 100 proof berry stuff.  The bartender was a lovely lady with whom I conversed with and here is the kicker.  Some of you may get mad if this happened to you.She cut me off, from drinking more.  I was at first surprised that  towards the end of the evening, when I ordered another drink, (I basically sampled half of their drink menu) she asked me, "You're not driving right?"  I said no and she served me, then I asked for a shot and then she said, "This is last one I can give you since you are clearly inebriated."  You know what, I am really glad she was paying attention and I felt like she was a friend looking out for me. I've never had that happen to me before and ended up regretting the amount of alcohol I've had the night before.  No regrets here....Get your butt over to Blue Prynt, and you will be really glad you did!
<review# 749,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2008,4/4/2008,9,0,3,14,8>All Dawgs Go To Heaven          Normally, I wouldn't get too worked up about a hot dog joint; I mean, you put a tube of mystery meat between a bun, throw a condiment or two on top, pay your three bucks, and off you go, right? Well, if that's your pre-visit impression of the newest incarnation of the restaurant space between Jack's and the Mercantile on 20th, then you better guess again; gourmet hot dogs have arrived in Sacramento! Can I hear an Amen! Seriously, this is a place Midtowners can be proud to call ours--great food, late hours, a dedicated staff and an impassioned owner--if this place doesn't make it, folks, it's our fault, not theirs.        The Mrs. and I, after a trip to the Merc's happy hour, walked over and sampled the goods--she started with a Polish frank adorned with mustard and onion, fries and a Coke. I had the Number 7, which is a Chicago-style, complete with tomatoes, pickle, peppers, neon-green relish, and celery salt; honestly, if that doesn't sound good now, just give it a shot--it's so flavorful and honest to its roots, you'll be wondering when the next Cubs game starts. Next up, I had the "Tower Dog", or the Number 16 (Tower--16th Street. Get it?) Imagine a dog (believe it or not, mine was deep-fried, and wonderful), bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and served on a warm bun; it was, like the other two, perfect in both concept and execution. The dogs are from Schwarz of San Francisco, and the quality of the meat really shows. We also had a sample of the chili, which was tasty--I'll try a chili dog on our next trip! In fact, the only quibble I had the whole night was that a couple of cold fries had sneaked their way into my wife's basket--and she states hers were perfect. That's a pretty small quibble for a place open less than two days.        The decor/atmosphere is also spot-on: bright, clean, and filled with hot dog and sports memorabilia (keep an eye for the Warhol print in the bathroom); Mike Brown, the owner, is as enthusiastic and as proud of his place as you'd want a new restaurateur to be, and his staff is friendly and quick.        Capitol Dawg is destined to be the pre-game/post-work/late-night staple for those people who don't have time for a more involved meal or just want to burn a few tenths off their blood alcohol level before getting home; go in and try this place--it's perfect.         Update (4/9/08): I was bummed to find that they changed their hours without much of an explanation; but my wife and I had dinner there tonight, and Mike (the owner) said he felt he hadn't gotten the place to his standards yet and didn't want to give a bad impression to those late-night folks. He said to us, "Better to have people think badly because I changed the hours than to have them think badly because of the food." Gotta like someone like that, huh? Also, he said he's trying still to find buns that reflect his commitment to quality--he's on his third supplier. I guess the Bee review comes out Friday: let's see what Mike Dunne (or someone else) thinks--I bet they like the place.
<review# 750,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2007,4/3/2008,65,28,17,6,5>I recently entered Mishka's and ordered a macchiato.  The arrestingly pretty barista turned her laconic gaze on me and, in a sullen and perfunctory tone, asked, "You don't want the Starbucks kind, do you?"  With characteristic wit, I responded: "No.  I would like a regular one, please."  My charming parry seemed to do worlds for her mood: with countenance freshly lightened, she proceeded to complain a bit about "less understanding" customers who "order a macchiato and expect a caramel latte."  I happily commiserated with this languid beauty, who, galled by the disgusting foolishness of the many, conjectured that Starbucks had destroyed the American coffee palate, and now sought to redefine our coffee vocabulary for its own pecuniary benefit.  I did not disagree, and referred her to Book II, Chapter 5 of Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy.  I graciously offered a summary of the chapter, but somehow my learned discourse failed to pique her interest.  She looked at me with that mix of incomprehension and dismay familiar to all teachers, and with that I sat down and waited for my drink. The macchiato itself was really quite good, as was the dark chocolate truffle I ordered with it.  The cappuccinos and brewed coffee are of similarly high quality, and the dessert case is always full of tasty and somewhat unusual goodies.  In addition to the more familiar scones, bagels, and muffins, one finds baklava, crunch cake, macaroons, and other interesting options.  Everything is made and supplied by local outfits, but don't let that scare you off: most of it is good in spite of the fact that it is made in Davis.Beyond the coffee and baked goods, there is still more to recommend Mishka's, not the least of which are the baristas.  It suffices to say that this is a nice-looking and very friendly group.  Those with laptops will be pleased to find a number of accessible outlets and a reliable wireless signal; those with books will be pleased to find large tables; those with sensitive ears will be pleased to find soft music and general quiet; those with a social conscience will be pleased to find organic and fair trade coffee; finally, those with a drinking problem--or exams to grade--will be pleased to find bottled beer.Given all these virtues, and given the perplexing dearth of options in Davis, Mishka's is consistently and deservedly crowded.  Their cash only policy is mildly irritating, but after all has been considered, Mishka's is worth the trip to the ATM.  Just don't order a "misto," you swine.
<review# 751,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2008,4/2/2008,260,392,6,8,5>This place hit the spot when I was craving Chinese food.  We got the Dinner C, which included multiple courses including soup, appetizers, entrees and sides.  We substituted orange spicy chicken for lemon chicken, which was pretty close to General Tso's style chicken (which doesn't appear on their menu).  We got an extra side of roasted-duck-and-pineapple-fried rice and were impressed with the subtle but different flavors in this dish.  Service was fairly expedient, but I was a bit surprised to find that we had to request steamed rice, as it was not included with the meal.My pilgrimage to Mayflower was memorable.  I should've tried this place sooner, since the food is good and it's located in a convenient spot in Midtown (you know, not far from Plymouth Rock... I mean, Del Taco).
<review# 752,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2008,4/1/2008,2300,8619,9,10,9>This place is definitely a Yelp success story. After coming back from a day of snowboarding, we were going to check out Louie's Chicago Style pizza in nearby Rocklin. We listed to the phone message and confirmed that they close at 9pm on Sundays. So we show up and guess what? It's fucking darker than a bat cave!! No reasons, no signage. Just closed. And it's 8:30pm. Sonofabitchbastard.So I remember seeing a different review for pizza while looking up Louie's and we give Cool River Pizza a call. A real human being answers and they say 9pm. So I get gas then made like a bread truck and hauled buns over there. They were saying to go orders only at first but since we said we were from out of town and had no place to go, they let us stay. Got a medium half pepperoni, half artichoke heart/tomato/pineapple (from another reviewer). Holy cow! This pizza is excellent. I don't want to categorize them as any particular style. They have a great crust all their own with a nice texture balance of crisp, chewy,. savory. Sauce and toppings are also excellent. As we were the last of the diners, one of the staff came out to see how we were doing and I got to chatting with two of them eventually about how they make a mean pizza and that we'd definitely be back to try some of the others. He recommended the Mad Duck which is a BBQ sauce based pie and the Cool Ranch Chicken. As we finished we noticed that they had waited for us basically so that they could close up. We asked them for quickest direction to the freeway (since we took a weird route from Rocklin) and they both offered to drive us towards the exit we were looking for. Talk about service above and beyond. Nicest, friendliest staff I'd seen in a long time and this was on a closing Sunday night shift. Whoever you guys are working the Sunday night shift on 3/2/2008 you guys simply rock. So for any of you living in the Sac area or drive up and down 80 to go to Tahoe definitely check this place out. It's off the beaten path and doesn't look like much from the outside, but the pizza and staff simply kick too much ass.
<review# 753,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2008,3/31/2008,126,2155,11,10,9>Apparently this place used to be a Best Western - it shows in the rooms. They look similar to my first apartment and for the low corporate rate (56.99) per night, I'm pretty sure the monthly total is close to my old rent. ( That's a San Diego joke...)More to come on this review later but for now I'd just like to state the obvious that the shower makes or breaks a hotel room in my opinion. I could have a broken TV or even a smoking room but if the shower is in good order with decent pressure, I'm sold. This shower is on point. They use those weird cloth shower curtains with the curved shower rods though and I never quite know what to do with those. Water gets all over the floor whether you drape the curtain in the tub with you or not. Shoddy design, I suppose.$7 pitchers in the hotel bar downstairs. Can't go wrong, so far. We'll see if the stars hold up through the next four days.
<review# 754,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2008,3/30/2008,40,133,7,12,5>This has to be the best Italian place in Sacramento.  We came here tonight with a "buy one, get one free" entree coupon.  I usually abhor using coupons in nice restaurants.  But...tonight I felt like, "hey.  THEY put it in the East Sac Insider, so they obviously really want us to use it."  So we did.I am so glad we did.  From the service to the quality of the food, Sopratutto is outstanding.  We were immediately seated and served warm bread with perfect basil garlic pesto an amazing oil and vinegar dip.  My lasagna was most likely the best I've had at a restaurant...layers of bolognese and bechamel.  It's hard to do a dish with bechamel and ensure it isn't too heavy or salty.  This lasagna was perfection.My husband's veal was served with a side of small, spherical pasta (fresh made, did I mention they make and cut their own pasta???) which was combined with smoked corn and spices.  Neither of us had tasted anything like it before.  It was delicious.Speaking of my husband - the boy has an addiction to spumoni, which usually leads him to my most hated of restaurants, Old Spaghetti Factory.  :: puke ::  Sopratutto MAKES THEIR OWN SPUMONI.  I thought he was about to lick the bowl.  My limoncello torte was beyond words.The service was prompt, extremely friendly and not too formal.  Ruben** answered all of our questions with interest and didn't shy away from my husband asking if the sea bass was Chilean or farmed.  Now that's a good waiter, because I would have rolled my eyes and said, "Who the f**k cares, a-hole, it's fish."  But...that's why I'm not in customer service.Please.  PLEASE try Sopratutto.  It's a quaint, family-owned gig and the owner/chef will come out and ask how the food was while you're enjoying the amazing food.  Our tab was $79, which included two entrees, two desserts, a coffee and a bottle of '06 Planeta Rosso.**Ruben the Waiter told us they have great lunch prices and deals M-W.  FYI.
<review# 755,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/19/2007,3/28/2008,75,26,1,13,7>I've been going to this bakery since I was little.  It is the best chinese bakery in Sacramento.  Their egg tarts are made to perfection and they always sell out, so if you plan to order a dozen or two (like i do, hehe) then call in advance to place in an order.Also, they have the best pineapple bun (bo lo bao) ever because they actually have custard filling inside (which is rare).  Its best to eat these buns right away when the filling is hot.  Their beef baos are made with ground beef.  They are also good to eat  while on the road as they are less messy.  They also still taste just as delicious from the oven when the leftovers are microwaved.  The aroma of the bakery is very distinctive to the point where whenever i come home to see a pink box on the counter, i can smell outside of the box and know if the baos or pastries are from ABC bakery.  This bakery, i believe, is a family-run business and I hope it stays here for as long as I live because some of their baos are a one of a kind.  Now if they can only make green onion baos, then the place will be 10x more busy.  Then i wouldn't have to go buy them in SF chinatown!For those who are not familiar with the area, the bakery is hidden behind the Bel-Air Grocery store on the left side.  It is a very small bakery and there is ample parking.

And you might want to bring some wipes to clean up afterwards.
<review# 757,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2008,3/24/2008,104,762,3,4,5>What a great place to celebrate St. Patrick's Day!  We figured the pubs would all be busy w/ rogue people drinking the incredibly non-Irish green beer, so why put ourselves through such a boorish celebration.  Queen Sheba has been on my friend's "When Janet comes to Sacramento" list of things to do, and we've actually almost finished this first to-do list.  So off we go to have our first Ethiopian dining experience.  For most of the meal, it was us three couples alone in the entire restaurant!  We ordered the combination meal for 4, but asked that they serve enough for 6.  Our server had a bit of difficulty understanding our request as he was authentically Ethiopian.  But once he did, he was off to the kitchen to submit our order.  We ordered Ethiopian beer to go with; I had the dark beer, which was slightly sweet and very delicious.  Then a huge platter arrived with beef, chicken, fish, lamb, spinach, lentils and potatoes.  It was served with enjera, a thin spongy flat bread similar to a cross between a crepe and a pancake.  It was communal eating, tearing off  a piece of the enjera and scooping up whatever you felt like tasting.  It was a fun meal to share with dear friends.  We are all Ethiopian converts now!  Thanks Queen Sheba, and in the absence of the regular chef's presence, thanks Rodrigo (from Guadalajara) for a great meal.
<review# 758,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/12/2007,3/23/2008,82,143,14,9,11>I am by no means a cyclist.  In fact, I'm rather wobbly on things with wheels, like crashing into things, flying over the front of handlebars wobbly.  However, I was entrusted with my sister's bicycle on a recent trip from Los Angeles to Sacramento.  I was also told to take it to be repaired.  The logic involved in this decision was that I owed her because her other bicycle, while in my keeping, had its wheels miraculously decide to fly away into the ether and disappear. The rest of the bicycle also managed to miraculously levitate around the corner and into a bush.So, on a lovely Saturday morning, I decided to go on an adventure and bike on over to the bicycle kitchen.  After almost getting run over, almost running someone over and an incident with a fire hydrant and a small dog, I managed to get to the kitchen in one piece.  Sadly, my back tire popped right outside.  The wonderful people inside (once I located the place, the entrance is actually on Broadway, not 36th) showed me how to replace the inner tuby thing inside the actual tire.  Then, they took apart my gears and made them work again.  Then they did something else.  After all this work was done, I realized bicycle riding is fun!  And I wanted to ride around some more.  But, my sister came back and took the newly functioning bicycle away and left a barely functioning bicycle in it's place.  Ah well, back to the Kitchen I go (or wobble).
<review# 759,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2011,12/10/2011,474,133,38,34,41>In a modern world where it is easy to get into the "habit" of standing at a "counter" waiting behind "five guys" to order something called a "smashburger," it is easy to forget one of the originals like Fuddruckers. Personally speaking, it's probably my never ending quest for new, different and better that has caused me to let so much time pass in between visits to Fuddruckers. I guess you could say a case of the grass is always greener somewhere else syndrome. After a long hiatus from the Fuddruckers chain, my recent visit has reminded me just how much I've been missing. Yes, it's a chain and it is along the lines of the Habit, Counter, Five Guy's and Smashburger, but it's among, if not the original and quite possibly the best in the class. The competition is definitely on in Citrus Heights as Habit and Smashburger have both set up shop within a block or so of Fuddruckers. The only real advantage I see that Habit or Smash have is that they seem to be a little quicker at turning the orders out, but I will stick with Fuddruckers and the slightly longer wait times. Alright so enough with the comparisons and onto the food reviews. I went with the 1/4 lb. Fuddrucker burger with cheese combo that included fries and a drink and the total was right around $10. There are bigger burgers available, but the 1/4 lb. with fries were more than I actually needed. First of all I would be curious to know where this place is getting their buns because they're not your everyday run of the mill style. Fuddruckers buns are absolutely delicious and superior to most any other hamburger buns I've had anywhere else. The next thing they're doing right here is the cooked to order meat with an incredible flavor. Next you've got your choice of toppings and condiments at the build it yourself burger bar. I have seen this same concept replicated other places, but never as good as it gets right here. Then there are the fries, crisp and perfectly seasoned. Last, but definitely not least is the kettle of melted cheese at the end of the toppings bar. Who other than maybe a lactose intolerant individual, doesn't appreciate melted cheese for dipping their fries in. I owe Fuddruckers an apology for my long absence and the flings I've had with the rival burger chains in town. After my last visit I am reminded without question that the original is still the best.
<review# 760,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/20/2011,12/9/2011,202,116,6,48,4>EXCITINGExciting new Indian place! Keith R. made a bold statement that this could be the best restaurant (of any type) in Davis. What I can say is that this is my favorite Indian restaurant of the 7 or 8 I've tried in the Davis/Sac area.We really just loved everything we ate, especially the vegan feast meal. Excellent recipes - just like my grandma would have made if she had been Indian/Nepalese. Seriously, the food tastes homemade! The menu has clearly marked veg & meat sections, so it's easy to sort through. The free vegetable pakora appetizer was an added bonus [update: no free app 2nd visit]. The food came medium spicy.DECORKumitaa T. is right about the nice mural. The decor is clean and contemporary. Relaxing classical Indian music in the background - not Bollywood pop madness!ONLY COMPLAINTSIt took a little while to get our check, the dishes sat on our table for about 10-12 minutes after we were done, and there was an annoying little gnat that fluttered about during the meal. If they can get these little bugs out, this will be one of my favorite spots in town.POORI (aka puri)The big fried puff that came with our meal is called poori. It was too dense and greasy for my taste. There's a better version at Mylapore in Folsom. But the waiter (manager?) noticed we didn't like it and said next time we can substitute naan. Works for me!SUMMARYIf you like Indian food, and haven't checked this new place out, give it a shot!
<review# 761,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2011,12/8/2011,192,54,6,11,11>Since my first review of Kilt Pub I have had the fortune of visiting my favorite work-ajacent watering hole many many times. And ya know what? I love it here!The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable of the food and beer that they serve. John, the owner, is a stand up Scotsman and can be found pouring beers and running food out to tables on any given night. Ask one of the Kilted bartenders to describe a beer for you and they'll paint you a verbal pidcture of the brew in question so accurately that you can almost taste it before you taste it.The beer...oh the beer. Racer-5, Affligem, Lagunitas, seasonal specials and, of course, Bass, Guiness, Harp and a whole slew of other British Pub appropriates. A dozen or so on tap and almost twice that many by the bottle. The selection is generally in a minor state of flux as they try on new selections and part ways with the old.The food has come a long way since these guys and gals started serving it up. All the Pub Grub is well represented: Fish & Chips, Shepard's Pie, Scotch Egg and Bangers & Mash to name a few. They have a fantastic burger and drop daily specials several times a week which are often focused on seasonal and regionally available ingredients.At the Kilt Pub, the atmosphere is chill. Local residents are commonplace. If you visit enough you will get to know a lot of the regulars. John has started several daily and nightly special such as Trivia Night on Mondays, Lassie's Night on Wednesday, lunch specials and daily Happy Hour discounts. TVs can be found on at least four walls and they have a dart board in the dining room. Plenty to keep one occupied should the food and drink not suffice.I hope this review does the mighty KP justice as I want nothing more than to keep their revenue stream a-flowin' so I can continue to savor all that this, my favorite pub in the Sacramento area, has to offer!

Oh hell no. They better still have my Big Jake! Luckily the turkey, avocado, cream cheese goodness that was formerly known as the Big Jake is still on the menu under the pseudonym, Big Jay. (It seemed like most of the sandwiches from before were on the menu, just under different names.) I got it on dutch crunch with everything on it, except peppers. Brought it back to work and wasn't expecting anything different, but much to my surprise, the Big Jay was bomb dot com! What kicked it up a notch was the garlic flavored oil that was mixed with the garlic sauce and a little bit of vinegar. I don't remember that being on the sandwich before! The dutch crunch was super crunchy and didn't get all soggy. It also mopped up the oil and vinegar that spilled out on the wrapper very well. So good! Mr. Pickles, who?

Walking in, I was immediately enveloped by the delightful clutter of bygone wares and stared in wonder at the varied history that was for sale. Books, Barbies, pots and pans. Suits, scarves, jewelry and junk. This is the type of store that's as much fun for lookers as it is for serious shoppers. But I was there for a reason so I made a beeline for the clothing section......where I found just the black slacks I was looking for. All the racks were conveniently labeled as men's or women's and further divided by size. Easy-peasy. I grabbed the pants and headed to the dressing rooms......where I found one unoccupied. Or so I thought. When I pulled open the saloon-style door, I was surprised to find a small women in mid-trou-dropping. She was bent over and so tiny I didn't see her at all. She also neglected to lock the door. With apologies, I sprinted away to the "vintage wear" room to wait and allow the embarrassment to dissipate.It did, eventually, the slacks fit and walking in on a half-dressed woman was not in vain. I laid down seven dollars and left the SPCA Thrift Store thinking one man's trash truly is another man's treasure. The eyeful of granny-panties notwithstanding.

Of course I rationalize by saying to myself that shoes are an investment and what we have on our feet can really make an impact on our overall body comfort and bla bla bla. Really I just want pretty shoes. See how much I am rambling? That should show you right there how pathetic my shoe love is.This store is great for a shoe fix. I decide on a limit before going in so I can keep myself in check.

You have no idea how many times I hear "Oh Davis is alright but it's not Berkeley or UCLA blah blah blah." Of course not, but CA is pretty spoiled when it comes to top public universities.The campus is very large, thus why owning a bicycle is a must. It is great that the school was planned out with the bicyclist in mind. The atmosphere in Davis as awesome, although located in a relatively small town, there are so many students and things to do, that I never get bored. Another addition to UC Davis is it's location, SF and Tahoe are both within a two hour drive, so it provides you with an opportunity to travel to a variety of places any given weekend.I am attending UC Davis as a grad student and have been very happy that I chose this school over other more "prestigious" schools.

So naturally ramen soondubu sounded enticing and I had give Bowl & Ramen a try. This place does not have large, easy to see signage out front. When you're driving on Alta Arden, if you see Mana, then you're there. It's right next door, under the string of Japanese lanterns. On a Tuesday lunch, there were only two other parties eating and no hostess or waitress to greet us. We sat ourselves, got our own menus, and probably waited a solid five minutes before any help came to serve us. To me, even though I'm Chinese and have experienced my fill of bad service growing up with my parents eating at Chinese restaurants, this is on the borderline of unacceptable. If your server's focus is at Mana and you don't have many patrons during lunch at Bowl & Ramen, since you share the same menu anyway, why don't you just close down the Bowl & Ramen side and have all of your patrons be seated over at Mana so that your servers can more attentively take care of all the customers? The more I think about it, the more I'm irked. Maybe it was the impatient me who knew what she wanted to order already and wanted to do so immediately so she can eat and get the hell out of there and back to work.  Onto the food. Ramen soondubu was literally maybe half of an instant ramen overcooked and soondubu. Of my soondubu experiences, stems of green onions and maybe some daikon are included as flavoring and garnish. Not here. It's seriously just tofu in soup. Fortunately, I requested it spicy and it was delivered. Overall, I'd say the entree tasted okay. Would I come here again just for this? Probably not, as they've inspired me to go to Koreana and buy myself a pack of spicy soup, tofu, instant ramen, and green onions and whip it up at home quickly and perfectly for half the price.
<review# 774,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/5/2013,8/16/2013,153,122,14,15,11>Crab Feed 2013I chose this crab feed over the others because they had a great value $35 for all-you-can-eat crab + interesting menu items (see menu pic).  I was originally excited for the side items.. However, they were not worth my stomach space.  The Buffalo Mac & Cheese everyone talks about tastes like pasta with Frank's Red Hot.  Hot sauce with a tinge of sourness.. just not good.  Everything else wasn't memorable and lacked that flavor Oomph.  Parmesan polenta was a big disappointment.  It was bland mushy-looking grits that were just plopped onto a corner of the plate.  So THIS is what prison gruel is like!The only sides worth depositing to my love handles are:*  Thai Chile Crab Cakes - interesting spicy flavor for a nice surprise in your mouth*  Crab Bisque  -  intense crab flavor.  Makes a nice dip for your crab too*  Clam Chowder - big chunks of clam is always a plus*  Fresh Fruit Tart - refreshing & light. crust tastes freshly bakedand of course CRAAAAAB!!The crab was brought out in half leg portions, still hot.  For a crab feed, the legs came out pretty hefty.  But no main shell.  Booo.. my fave part is the potent yellowish curdles in the main shell.  Me like crab braaaains.. arrrghhh... The feed was in a restaurant made to order, which may be awkward if you want to chow down.  But pride aside, my eating buddy and I KILLED IT.  I believe dungeness crabs may be on the endangered species list now that we're through eating.  Service was super attentive - plates taken away, refilled waters, more crab..Aside from the disappointing appetizers, everything crab-related was delicious - crab, crab bisque, crab cakes.  Blue Prynt sure has a case of the crabs!  Stop by and remember to bring plenty of protection.  I was speaking of bibs.  Get your mind out of the gutter.
<review# 775,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/24/2013,8/15/2013,489,900,17,28,21>Say cheese! 'Cuz you'll be smiling after eating at this new downtown gem :)I purposely ate very little during the day so I'd be ready and prepped for noshing at The Rind after work. The game plan was me and my buddy Stasia meeting up after work and delving into cheesey goodness by ordering one charcuterie, one grilled cheese sandwich, and one mac 'n cheese and sharing between us. That was the game plan at least...but due to last-minute family issues (hang in there Stasia!), I was left to go it alone. I mean, I was already at the restaurant and my palette was totally set after having perused both the food and drink menus for 15 minutes! So I went in....alone.First round, I ordered the Proscuitto baked mac 'n cheese ($11), which was topped with garlicky bread crumbs. The combo of meat, cheeses, and bread crumbs was delicious...very grown up mac 'n cheese for sure! I loved pulling out a delectable spoonful and having the ooey gooey cheese leave a long lingering trail of melty goodness. I paired this awesome dish with a glass of prosecco ($9), just because I like prosecco (note: they offer lots of wine and beer options, so you'll find something great to pair up with your vittles).At this point, I was both happy and sad, because I got all that mac 'n cheese to myself, but sad because I knew I was only gonna have room for one more item, which meant missing out on a third item that was SUPPOSED to be shared between me and Stasia. However, I felt it was my duty to press on...I opted for the grilled cheese sandwich instead of the charcuterie, and went with the Cowgirl grilled cheese sandwich ($11). OMG, I was blown away! Sooooo dang good (I liked it more than the mac 'n cheese!). The combination of uber-creamy Mr. Tan with flavorful Red Hawk was DIVINE...seriously, it was the best-flavored grilled cheese sandwich I've ever had. And the roll upon which all this cheesy delightfulness rested was soft yet crunchy/crispy at the same time. Heaven! I paired my sandwich with a bottled Abita root beer ($2.50)...yum!All in all, a great first experience. A few kinks to work out maybe (it took quite a while for my dishes to appear), but that's to be expected for a place that's only been open a little more than 24 hours. I look forward to coming back with Stasia so she can see what she missed.

Load up on the stuff you need for the next big blowout bbq or party you plan and invite me or other of your best friends.  Seeya.

They also have expanded their Men's section.  I picked up 3 (Thread for Thought and Alternative Apparel) sweatshirts for my love for about $20 bucks a piece. Also, if you join their frequent buyer program (I think I have the no-cost membership), you will get 20% coupons mailed, emailed, and texted to you regularly.  Parking can be a drag since it shares its lot with Save-mart, Chipotle, Jacks and many other businesses, but the savings is worth it.
<review# 778,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2013,8/12/2013,337,422,21,22,21>Dearest Russian food, I whole heartedly apologize...Instinctively, when I hear the word "Russian" I think of SATC and Carrie's last love before marrying Big! Overly girlie of me, but that is the extent of my Russian knowledge. Well that, and they made/created my favorite libation, the Vodka. My ignorance was bliss, until last night!I have two friends, who are married (yes I'm always third wheel, and it's okay), whom love to meet up once a month or every other month and try new places or frequent the ones we love. They were adamant that we go to Firebird this occasion, I did throw out a few ideas, but they were strong willed and I was ready (kinda) to be adventurous. I peeped the menu about six hours before dinner, not too bad - lots of cream and mushrooms, but I saw some chicken items that would work. They also mentioned that it was kinda far, I didn't take them very literal.Completely out of my grid comfort zone, I found myself at the intersection of Manzanita and Winding Way. It's all very cookie-cutter Carmichael-ish and then as I made my last turn, on the left I see the words BUFFET. Then I realize that's the place I'm supposed to stop at. Needless to say, my inner fat kid was excited because I thought I was going to enjoy a buffet. Nope, that's only for the lunch time folks on the weekdays and the brunch folks on the weekends.Squished in between some other non-descript businesses was our lovely little haven of Russian and Ukrainian food. I walk in and immediately notice how quite the entire place is, besides my friends there was only one other table of patrons, and the two employees behind the bar. Not only was it desolate, but your eyes are immediately attracted to the buffet station (empty at the moment) and the interesting décor in the corner. It was almost a tableau of a home in Russia (I'm guessing here). It was cute and looked like it could have been pulled straight out of a play.The service was on-point. I'm not sure if it was attributed to the lack of customers, but I don't really care, my water cup was always full, they were extremely nice, and their food was good. I can't really ask for much more. Since I'd never eaten here before, I asked the waitress to help decide between the Chicken Kiev (breaded breast of chicken stuffed with tarragon and parsley butter) or the Chicken Shashlyk (herbed and marinated chicken kebabs), she immediately suggested the Chicken Kiev. I was a little put off by the fact that you have to order sides individually ($2.99-$3.99), it's the Asian in me. However, I went with Rice and Vegetables side (insert Asian joke). My partners-in-crime tried new items as well, since this was their 3rd trip here. The rest of the items ordered were the Shuba, Bilini with Smoked Salmon, and Beef Stroganoff.Luckily they love to share, so I was able to take a taste of everything that was brought to our table. We were getting antsy, because it was taking awhile. The sides (although ordered as his meal) were brought out first, then finally came the two entrees. However, it was worth the wait. My Kiev was a perfect looking breaded specimen. When I made the first cut juices oozed out onto the plate. It was the perfect blend of breading, moist chicken, tarragon, and melted cheese in the middle (a surprise for sure). The rice was a great compliment to the chicken. There were some veggies and a pretty carrot carved flower that adorned my plate too. The beef stroganoff was delicious as well. My parents tainted me with horrors of Hamburger Helper's version, so I am adamantly opposed to eating this anywhere. However, when this was set down I was ready to give it a try...I'm so glad I did. As always, we decided to just "look" at the dessert menu. And as usual, we ordered one item to split among the three of us: the Apple Strudel. Given that we cleared our plates, this dessert was the perfect fit for the three of us (but I could have ate the whole thing myself, if necessary). Two strudel's were cut into six pieces, decorated with whip cream, powdered sugar, and a cherry. These little puffs of magical delight were fried perfectly, the apples and their sauce was beyond tasty. It was the perfect way to bow out from a meal.I hope my apology is accepted, I am ready for round 2 - buffet style!
<review# 779,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/1/2008,10/24/2008,260,392,10,5,4>I felt the need to review this store for a couple of reasons, the first one being that they usually have decent sales on men's athletic shoes.  The second reason is because after searching high and low in other discount department stores and finer retail establishments, I finally found the "Ballcap Buddy".  This thing goes by various names I'm sure (the $2.99 version at Big 5 is called the Cap Washer by PerfectCurve).I'm hoping my brilliant purchase of the Cap Washer will allow me to resurrect a number of old baseball caps that have suffered a common fate due to hot Sacramento summers.  They've become crusty and stained with the sweat of my brow and melon, and are no longer fit for prime time.  I slathered a trusty old light-colored baseball cap with Spray 'n Wash Stain Stick, locked it into the plastic contraption, and gave it a whirl in the washing machine.  I am hopeful that it will perform its promised magic.  If it doesn't deliver, maybe it's time to try the alternative approach and wash my cap on the top shelf of my dishwasher (as also recommended in the instructions).  I would be leary of simultaneously washing dishes I plan to eat off, however.  Nothing adds that "crowning" touch to a meal like Essence of Flopsweat.Aside from the Ballcap Buddy, er, Cap Master 2000 or what-have-you, this Big 5 has a rack outside with free travel guides of local destinations.  I picked up a Shasta Lake Map and travel brochure for free.
<review# 780,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/22/2008,10/23/2008,574,469,6,6,9>Hear ye! Hear ye! This is my new favorite place in to eat in Sacramento! (Trumpets!!)I love this place. I have only been here once. But I just know it's consistent. I got a great feeling from Evan's Kitchen. This is my type of fare: Moderately priced, with a decent selection of AWESOME tasting food. Although it is a down-home kind of idea in general (there is a little nook for the kids to play=ackward! Johnna is scared of kids,) it is down home with some serious gourmet flair. This place is some kind of special.To think I was enticed to come here. My friend was dying to try this place after he tasted some takeout that his co-worker brought in. That takeout  made a serious and lasting impression on him. He's been suggesting this place for a month. I am glad I finally trusted him! We went for dinner. Service is authentic and attentive. To eat, we started with bacon-wrapped scallops with a spicy and DELICIOUS sauce. They were absolutely divine. (My guest all but picked up the plate and licked it.) I had the special after I saw it on the way to another table. It was pork with mango chutney, sour cream mashed potatoes, and asparagus (it was super fresh even though it was not really in season.) My guest had the meatloaf served with the same sides. Halfway into our meal, we agreed that we were eating for pure sport: We were that full (the portions are massive!) but just couldn't stop. Ladies, if you need some man to marry you, just sneak some Evan's  takeout home every night and plate it like you made it. You won't be sorry (unless, of course, you choose the wrong man.)And, you wouldn't be able to "make dinner" on Sundays, Mondays or Tuesdays, because Evan's is closed. They are, however, open for brunch on Sundays until 3 pm. I am very interested in having breakfast here.Where has this place been all my life? I'll tell you: hiding in the damned Antique Row. Antique Row is weird and Evan's kitchen is hidden away in the Antique Row. I am mad at the Antique Row for hiding Evan's Kitchen from me all these years when we were destined to be together. As we left, we met Evan himself and I wanted to french kiss him for making us such a great dinner (A rare moment! I hate french kissing!) I am now an Evan's Kitchen groupie. They could install a disco ball and a year-round fiber-optic christmas tree and I would still give this place 5 stars. I love me some good food and Evan is the clear master of good food. A++++!

<review# 782,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/7/2007,10/20/2008,28,47,3,6,2>When Italian Importing Company on Folsom Blvd. closed, I was left scrambling around for a new sandwich spot. Corti Brothers is great but the lines are too long. Togo's if I am hungover. La Bou can suck it. That being said, I vectored over to Sub Shack, now called The Shack.  I learned that it is under new ownership by a couple named Gary and Jen. The decor does feel a bit 70's but they have done a good job at remodeling the place.They have a GREAT wine selection. There wine selection rivals those of the most expensive restaurants in midtown for a fraction of the cost. The sandwiches are very good, but I did take off a star just because some of them are outstanding (the tuna or the club) whereas others are a bit lackluster (carribbean chicken). The one thing The Shack does great is food outside of sandwiches. Gary is an amazing cook. I have been on Thursday night for Mexican food and it was great. I have had the gumbo and it was the best I have EVER had. I hear the cioppino is amazing. Overall this place rocks. Kinda a fancy sammich date.
<review# 783,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2008,10/19/2008,42,25,,13,6>This is my favorite restaurant -- it's not even a restaurant, it's an all-night dining and entertainment extravaganza! The cliche about living in Sacramento is "the best thing about Sacramento is that you're an hour from Tahoe and an hour to the City."  For me, the best thing about living in Sacramento is that we have the Supper Club!  For the unfamiliar, the Supper Club serves pre-fixe meals on Fridays and Saturdays, with or without specially selected wines that are served with each course.  Matt and Yvette Woolston are the chef and hostess respectively, and both fulfill their roles to perfection.  The evening begins at 6:30 and we usually roll (literally) out at about 10:30.  Yet the evening is perfectly paced and by the time it's over one wonders how it could have gone by so fast.  The evening always begins with passed-around appetizers and wine or a special cocktail for the evening.  At about 7 p.m. the guests are seated.  Chef Matt then comes out and talks with the diners, explaining what he's serving, how he made it, and why he selected the wines he has paired with each dish.  His speech is always entertaining, especially when he nonchalantly explains how he threw together some ridiculously difficult-sounding item such as the pickled watermelon rind salad that went with the spinach and seaweed-infused rice cake for the tuna course. There is always a "surprise course" not listed on the menu.  His wine selection skills are stellar as well.As we approach 8:30, then 9:00, the anticipation began to grow for the main events of the evening, the meat courses.  I could go on all day about Matt's appetizers, soups and salads but I'd need a week to describe his presentations of meat.  (I must mention here that the Supper Club also has now added a vegetarian menu served in a similar fashion.  I imagine that it must be very good, but I'll never know.) Past menus have included rabbit, wild boar, and buffalo, but also usually include some combination of chicken, pork, lamb or beef.  And they give you seconds!  Another element of the Supper Club experience is that they pass around seconds of the meat courses.  As it approaches about 9:30, one wonders if it is possible to continue.  Yet the menu says that there is still dessert.  Be prepared that the desserts at the Supper Club keep up the level of artistry and quality and that you will simply not be able to avoid eating every bit and wishing that they passed seconds on that as well. There is always a cheese plate and a dessert available, both paired with dessert wines.  If you're a couple and smart you'll order one of each.  The cheese plates are always excellent, usually three types of cheese varying in flavor and texture along with a port-poached pear and, as usual, some micro-salad greens, spiced rosemary walnuts and baguette from the Old Soul bakery.  Cheese heaven.The price of the evening is $85 without wine and $120 with wine (poured generously).  For one of the very best meals, and very best evenings you are ever likely to have, it's a bargain.  Go.

If not, it's one exit off off the 99, a stone's throw from Carolina's and the western boot shop. The same guy, who admittedly looks a little bit like a crack fiend, makes doughnuts there in the middle of the night, every night. When he swirls those twisty concoctions, it looks like a magic trick in Vegas. Pay very close attention to the man in the floury cloud.You get not twelve, but fourteen, for $5.99. And they have natural strawberry glazed, with little bits of strawberry in the frosting!On weekday mornings, the place is chock full of handsome old Mexican men, the "universidad" type, sitting at the counter, barking back and forth about god only knows what (some foolish girl thought learning French was more cool) peppered with occassional recognizable words like "presidente!" and "la luna!"and "Neruda!" They also sell old school hot chocolate that comes out in a stream from a big rectangular machine.Yum Yum indeed.

Miso soup and macaroni salad (which i think needs a little more salt) - strong coffee, and plenty of newspapers... it's a great place to hide out. It's delicious, the service is fast and friendly, without being creepy chain restaurant friendly**. You are unlikely to see anyone you know, but you'll find yourself in conversation with the entire restaurant (which only seats about a dozen people, completely full).The place feels like what it is: a cafe where the owners run because they want to. They are retired, and this is their contribution to the neighborhood. This is also why, some day you will pull up to the parking lot ecstatic to get your fill, only to find a sign on the door saying "We're on vacation for two weeks, sorry." And it's only open 9am-2:30pm, the menu is only on the wall, and what's listed may not be available - and there may be some special June has concocted that you need to ask about to find out. June's isn't for everyone, and isn't for every day. You can't get a salad there. There is no hot sauce. You will smell like fried rice for the rest of the afternoon. But damn, it's rejuvenating some days. And the food is delicious - heavy and unhealthy, but delicious. And you can look over at June, and think getting old isn't so scary after all.*There are other days when your soul needs a trip to the Laura Mercier counter at Macy's Arden Fair, or a Sac City nails pedicure... and on those days, June isn't going to be able to help. She's not a superhero. Sheesh. Solve your own problems.**June's husband, the sole server, will never interrupt your conversation to ask how everything is, as if you need anything else, while smiling stupidly.

Now who can complain about those prices?!!! Just because the prices are cheap best believe the quality is not, these dogs are better than any boiled dog you'd get at a street cart and they even deep fry them if you like. I do highly recommend that you try the deep fried "DOGANATOR" too, it simply changes the whole hot dog game.  The casing rips apart during the deep frying and gives the dog a sorta "crunch" but the best is that whatever toppings you put on your dog kinda get inside the dog itself and make for the perfect ratio of hot dog, topping and bun in each bite.

This continued when we saw how the small space it occupied was decorated.  The windows are filled with staggered shelves of what I can only describe as Japanese kitsch: little manga books and geisha figures and ceramic Buddhas galore.  The furniture was both rustic and stylish, each table topped with glazed ceramic toothpick holders and soy sauce containers.  Another plus: NO techno music or colored uplighting!This place really seems to be attempting to get its customers to try new things as business gets rolling.  Our server came by with a salad on house; it had a house-made fruit dressing.  It was OK, but I'm not a fan of the spring mix they used.  BF looked it up on the menu and it's regularly $10.  In addition, maki were 50% off; I don't know if they're going Arigato on us or if they're just trying to get us hooked.  The quality of the rolls led us to believe that this might actually be a temporary thing; if it's not, I may never set foot in Arigato again.  Sushi Hook doesn't have free green tea, but... who cares?We ordered the Titanic, a gargantuan roll with tempura prawn topped with ikura and real crab meat.  The prawns were very crispy and freshly fried.  We also got a simpler roll with hamachi and avocado topped with unagi and the traditional sauce.  We also got an Oregon, which is simply tuna with avocado, and some modified California roll with real crab and topped with tobiko.  The Oregon was topped with toasted sesame, which had a very strong but pleasant flavor.  The rice was well made, not too soft, and well-proportioned with everything else.  Somehow, the BF and I felt refreshed after a long, hard day at work after a rough, restless night of bad sleeping.Four rolls cost us under $30.  In other words, there's no way the 50% off thing is gonna last.  Catch it while you can.
<review# 791,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2009,4/16/2009,702,960,5,8,4>Had lunch here today - I suppose if the name of the restaurant did not have the word 'Seafood' in it, Umeko would get higher ratings amongst us Yelpers. After reading all the reviews, I was pleasantly surprised! I was not expecting much seafood - and to be honest, there wasn't much. There was a clam tray, a whole fish, a few shrimp things and a stuffed crab dish that was not good at all. The Chinese food part was surprisingly good! My friend and I both agreed that the flavoring was pretty authentic and the food was rotated enough. I sampled a little of everything. What was frustrating was not knowing what I was eating! Is it spicy? Is it pork? Is it even seafood? There are not enough signs to tell you what you are eating; there is probably one for about every third or fourth dish that is labeled. I only had one sushi - they kind of all looked the same. Nothing spectacular like a slab of maguro or even tekka maki. Just a jumble of assorted vegetables, seafood mix (imitation crab) and a thin slice of salmon on the top with the requisite mayonnaisey sauce to go with. Don't expect authentic sushi here, my friend. The dessert section isn't bad for a buffet - pretty typical. I skipped the instant pudding section. Can't stand the aftertaste of that stuff! Fruit was good, the little mini cakes are spongy and I love those deep fried sesame balls.

Hands down, it's the saltiest and tastiest, and most lemon-iest chicken wing ever.  For $39.99, we ordered the Family Pack of 50 wings and got half Original hot too.  But you can choose up to four flavors.  Along with a side of veggies, fries, potato salad and Ranch dressing dips, we all went to town on those little drumsticks while recapping the night before.  As far as flavors go, Teriyaki is a winner too.  And Garlic Parmesan initially sounds good, but the artificial garlic powder is a turn off.  I want to try to Hickory Smoked BBQ next time, and Hawaiian sounds interesting.  But what's it taste like?  Pineapple? Spam, or what.. C&H sugar?!  Haha see what I'm saying?  Wtf, I'll pass.  But anyway, go pick up your chicken waaangs now and get your finger lick on..

I think our show was about 3 hours as well and my bootay was so numb when we left!!! I love this comedy club better than Pepperbelly's in Fairfield because its more open and well over all they treat you a little better! Maybe it's jus me though! So we came here on a spur of the moment kind of thing! We originally were trying to see the 8:30PM show but it was already full so we went down the street to have dinner and came back for the 10:30 show! OMG, that line was out the door, good thing we bought our tickets ahead of time! We had to wait in line for about 20-30 mins though! And man this place seemed so huge to me, until I got all the way inside, lol! Anywho, the comics for that night were: Nico Santos (Host) aka Darth Gaydar, Dan Gabriel (so funny, although he was a little slow, lol) and of course the main event Rex Navarrete!!! So I loved all of Nico's jokes, and not just because he was gay, but he was being real and diverse. Dan Gabriel had me dying laughing, especially when he did his phone sex skit, lmao!!! As for Rex, he was funny, however, he only talked about the Philippines and the Philippine culture, all I'm saying is, "don't you got any other things to talk about?" I mean he was funny, but its like OK, I live around Philippine's everyday so I already know all that funny stuff! Oh well I had an awesome time and I would go there again! Oh but they do have a 2 drink minimum, and don't get the sex on the beach, cause it was more like sex in the sandbox, LMAO!!! There was so much juice in it that I thought it should have been served in a sippy cup, lol!

<review# 795,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2008,4/10/2009,28,66,6,4,6>F Big Spoon and Mochii, THIS is the place to get your yogurt! Normally I'm a chocolate and vanilla swirl girl, but the Raspberry Pomegrante, blueberry, and the non- dairy pineapple flavors are to die for! Don't get me wrong, vanilla and chocolate are also really good too! Also, the fresh fruit, mochii and candy which you can top on your self ( a la big spoon minus the cluster F and annoying brats sticking their dirty hands into the bins) are really good. They do not go overboard on their candy choices (which I think is a good thing), but like myself I find that most people go for the fresh fruit and mochii. The place is impeccably clean and the service is always fast and friendly, and I love the nice outdoor shaded patio to enjoy my yogurt on a warm summer night. My only complaint is the one and only jumbo size cup they provide which makes it deceiving when you're filling up.
<review# 796,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2008,4/9/2009,86,48,6,7,6>I bought my cruiser during their yearly sale in March of '04, and I bring it in for a tune-up each spring. The peeps are cool and knowledgeable but the NUMBER ONE BEST REASON TO BUY FROM THEM is their obsession with long term record keeping. Case in point:Last weekend I was enjoying one of midtown's lovely summer outdoor community events. Having ridden my bike, I locked it in plain view.  After a bit of fun, I noticed a odd woman eye-balling my bike and decided to unlock it and move it closer to where I was hanging out.  As I approached my bike and the woman, she accused me of having her stolen bike -- MY bike.  I told her that I bought it brand new from City Bike Works. She insisted that it was hers, and told me that she'd called the cops!  This made me very very angry, but I knew I didn't have a receipt or any unique markings on my pretty pink Kosmopolitan . . . just seething righteous indignation and no paper work to prove it.  Luckily, a friend suggested I call City Bike Works to see if they had sales records on hand. Low and behold, they set the record straight.  You see, City Bike Works keeps sales records for all it's bikes.  They where able to get on the phone with the coppers and verify that the bike was in fact mine. They helped prove to a crazy lady that my bike was -- is! -- mine, and I'm sure they'd do the same for you.
<review# 797,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2009,4/8/2009,16,31,2,10,7>Since 1999, this nonprofit organization has been committed to eliminating animal overpopulation in the greater Sacramento area. And my daughter who's brilliant boyfriend bought her a pug (neither daughter or boyfriend has a job) was getting ready to overpopulate. After reading about the low cost Spay Day in the newspaper (I thought awesome, daughter has no job remember), so we called this wonderful organization and they offered vouchers for spaying/neutering. After answering some questions and providing proof of unemployment; they sent the voucher by mail the very next day. Along with a list of vets. I highly recommend this organization, they also have a feral cat program. If you don't have a need for their services; how about a donation, I'll be sending them mine.

Serving quality sandwiches at a reasonable price." -From my other review.There's not much parking... pretty much on the street. If you feel like siting down.. good luck! This place is a grab and go. The sandwiches are exceptionally good. Its probably made with lots of love :p. The ingredients are delightful and wondrous at times. I would come here more often then not. The service and employees are fast and nice. I recommend satisfying your hunger here at least once a week, if not more :D.Also, the out back patio is quite nice... needs shade?Pros: Quaint, Good food, Good Service, nice patio areaCons: Parking? The small table in the front.. :/Rating: 4.25
<review# 799,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,7/2/2014,1134,510,24,29,24>Clap along with me, Yelpers, 'cause I'm happy, happy, happy!!!!!This was a super fun Happy Hour on a Sunday.  Yes...a Sunday!  (Happy, happy, happy...!)All appetizers are 1/2 off.   We had the spring rolls, chicken satay, cheese wontons, and potstickers.  Seriously, everything was OMG good!  Satisfying portions.  Packed with flavor.  Light and fresh spring rolls. Tender chicken.  Moist potstickers.  My favorite though had to be the cream cheese wontons.  Definitely one of the BEST things I've ever put in my mouth!  Ever! Perfectly crispy wontons wrapped around a creamy, pillowy center of warm, oozing goodness.  (Happy, happy, happy..!)Not only does Coconut have amazing appetizers, but having their "wine sampler" ($3 HH) along with them was fun and entertaining.  It's 6 shot glasses filled with 6 wines of your choice.  The wine list is actually a nice selection of affordable brands, with a balance of reds and whites, and even 2 sakes.  You can also do a "beer sampler" for $2 during HH.  Rick, solely "in charge of all the liquids", proved to be a passionate and generous sommalier.  When he first brought out our wine sampler, there was an extra shot glass of wine.  When he realized that he forgot one on my list, he came back with another glass.  Then he saw that we had peanut sauce (served with the satay and spring rolls) and came back with shots of sake because "it pairs perfectly with it".  He was so right.  As we were finishing up and deciding what to get for dessert, he brought out a bottle of "Chocolate Rouge" and poured us more shots.  It's not on the menu, but he wanted us to try it.  We shared the fried banana with Gunther's coconut ice cream ($5).  The thickly battered banana pieces were delicious with the creamy ice cream.  Rick came back with more shot glasses of another chocolate wine that tasted like, and had the same consistency as Bailey's, so I poured it over the ice cream.   Rick rocked!  One of the best Happy, happy, happy hours in Sacramento!
<review# 800,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,7/1/2014,356,378,7,17,13>Field House really struck a chord with me. The food, drink, and décor really come together making this a great dining experience. I love chicken wings and when I read that Field House has six types to choose from, I had to try some. I ordered the Vietnamese style wings and they were amazing: crispy skinned tossed with plenty of fried garlic with a little spice kick from the Serrano chilies and spring from cilantro. I want to say that it may have included some fish sauce too? While I wanted to try all of the chicken wing types Field House has to offer, I decided to go with the tomato soup and grilled cheese combo instead. It was simple and delicious. The drizzle of olive oil on top of the tomato soup gave added flavor to complement the mild-cheesed grilled cheese that I appreciated was not overly buttery toasted. While Field House offers over 10 rotating taps and a good variety of bottled beers, their cocktails are sophisticated, as expected from being Shady Lady's sister establishment. I ordered Jameson and the Giant Peach and felt like an adult from the Mad Men era sipping on this delicious cocktail. I usually don't care about décor because good food takes priority, but Field House gives off a modern feel to an old-school sports bar. I love that the old articles and photos are grouped together on the walls. I love the trophy case. I love all the types of seating they offer (high tops, booths, bar, and lounge). And they even have shuffleboard! They may not have huge tvs, but there are plenty of them placed in strategic areas all around the bar and restaurant.  I was expecting the place to be super crowded with March Madness in full effect, but it was relatively quiet for a Sunday afternoon. I'm selfish to want Field House to be sparse, because I wanted excellent service and I indeed received that while sitting at the bar. Mr. Bartender was super nice and my server was super sweet. I can't wait to come back to try more food and drinks on their menu!
<review# 801,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/23/2013,6/30/2014,267,761,8,16,12>I didn't have high expectations for this place. Hubs picked this place for dinner since I said I was craving Indian food. We bought a Groupon - can't hurt to try if we have a deal. So I thought this would be more of a traditional sit down restaurant, but it's not. You place your order with the cashier. There's not menu board so you have to grab a menu book to see what you want to order. You also get your own beverages. Supposedly they bring the food out to you but we had to go up and get our own food. We didn't see that was the case for other patrons? Interesting. Here's what we ordered:- Seekh Kabob- Chicken Tikka Masala- Regular and Garlic NaanThe menu doesn't warn you that the Seekh Kabob is SPICY! OMG, I tried to eat as much of it as I could but the spiciness was killing me. They should really have some indication on their menus of which items are spicy. The rest of the food, however, was AMAZING. Best tikka masala I've ever had, but keep in mind I'm not Indian so I'm no expert. I'm only going off my experiences. Their tikka masala was creamy and I could taste the tomato. Yum! I just wish there were more pieces of chicken. Definitely make sure to get some naan to shlop up the yummy sauce. So good!! The garlic naan is perfect. I am definitely coming back!!
<review# 802,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2014,6/29/2014,102,307,8,12,9>I came here for the Yelp Elite event over the last weekend and I was very impressed. My husband and I are both big Indian food fans and had never been here before. This used to be Bistro 33 back in the day and we are often in the area to go to Mikuni next door, but now we will be returning here much more often. $8.99 for a lunch buffet of this quailty, in this location is more than reasonable and the food was delicious.First off, everything was hot and fresh, which is key for a lunch buffet. The basmati rice had saffron, which is a welcome flavor addition. I had the veggie pakoras, veggie curry, chana masala, a piece of the tandoori chicken and my favorite, chicken tikka masala. My food was steaming hot and flavorful. Not as spicy as it could be, which was great for my husband, but if you prefer things really spicy just come at night and order off the regular menu and I am sure they will spice it right up for you. Everything was super delicious and even the tandoori chicken was moist, which I usually avoid it on most buffets because that is not typically the case. My husband also got some of the rice pudding dessert and said that it was very good.For drinks we had a mango lassi, a margarita and chai tea after we were done eating. Everything was brought to us quickly by our waitress and tasted pretty good. The margarita was probably a bit sweet for my tastes, but the alcohol was strong for the size. Our tea was hot and delicious and the perfect ending to the meal. The decor here is very nice and definitely upscale for Indian food. They have a full bar, so you could even come here for happy hour and they have lots of drink specials. Parking can be a little tricky in this area, but they do have $5 valet parking shared with Mikuni next door during peak dining times. I wish they were closer to my work, because this would be a regular lunch spot for me. I can't wait to go back and hope that the consistency will hold up to the elite event, which was fantastic.
<review# 803,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2014,6/28/2014,168,144,10,12,11>Let me start by saying that my mouth is still watering from the wonderful brunch we had this past Sunday at Roxy. A group of 30 of us Yelpies get together once a month for brunch and this month Roxy was the local that was chosen, and boy am I glad because I have never been there before. We walked in and were seated at two long tables in comfortable leather covered dining chairs. The decor of the restaurant is open and gorgeous. Our server (forgot his name, boo me) greeted us immediately and took our drink order. After everyone in our group arrived we placed our order. I chose braised pork belly with eggs and jalapeno cheddar grits and the hubby had the bacon portobello mushroom omelet. We both were more than delighted with our meals. My pork belly was perfection and the grits were so good that I have dreams about them. My hubby and I shared our plates, so I ate some of his omelet and it was to die for as well. The omelet was accompanied by toast and some heavenly homemade jelly.  I was tempted to ask if they would sell me a jar of the sweet, sticky, sinful goodness for my toast at home. Bottom line:  Do yourself a favor and try Roxy. Great food and awesome service!
<review# 804,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,6/27/2014,1134,72,8,14,12>Great food and big portions!This place has been one of me and my wife's favorite places in Vacaville for the last year. Usually we come on the weekend for breakfast and its always good. There has also never been a wait here when we come. Tonight we needed to find something to eat for dinner and decided to come here and try something different.My wife gave in and still ended up getting breakfast for dinner lol. She won't let me take pictures of her food for yelp anymore either lol so ill just explain it. 2 eggs (that looks like 3-4 eggs) 4 pieces of bacon, whatever room is left on that place is filled with breakfast potatoes, and then some sourdough toast. Way more then she could ever finish and only like $10.I stuck to my plan to try their dinner out and got their tri-tip dinner. You get so much food when you order their dinners! Lol. The actual dinner plate is 4 pieces of tri-tip and either potatoes or veggies, which probably would have filled me up by itself. Before you get your plate they give you a small loaf of bread and butter, a cup of soup, and a side salad. Besides the steak, I think the bread was the best part. After all that you also get to pick between a couple desserts. All of this is just included with ordering any of their dinner options! Rediculous!Our waitres tonight was great too! She was very friendly, help recommend some things, and kept our drinks full the whole time. Everytime she passed she made sure everything was tasting ok, or asked if we needed anything. My dinner came with a dessert at the end of it, and without charging us for it, she gave my wife the same cup of ice cream that I got. Awesome!Recommend this place to everyone and if your coming for dinner, come hungry!
<review# 805,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2014,6/26/2014,174,435,12,21,14>As far as thrift stores go, this one is the best one I have ever been to! It quickly took the crown from the Goodwill in Rocklin which has held it for the last few years.I was looking for some puzzles (I know, I'm like 80) and I had this place bookmarked after reading a great review from the lovely Jana T so I decided to give it a shot!Immediately after I walked inside I knew I was in the right place. First of all it is huge inside and super organized, and second it doesn't have the signature "thrift store smell". Come on guys, you know what I mean. Like everything has been sitting in a box in the garage for a year and was just unpacked without being cleaned. Yes, that.This thrift store was made to feel like a regular store inside and I loved how bright, clean and organized it was inside. I just wish I had more time! Most of the floor space was dedicated to clothing, but they also had shoes, bags, furniture, DVDs, books, toys, games, linens, seasonal, and a ton of kitchen and housewares.To make a long story short(er), I had never been here before so I walked in without a basket which I quickly realized was a big mistake when I found eight puzzles to purchase. I walked up to the registers and one of the cashiers happily grabbed a cart for me. I ended up finding two more puzzles and then decided it was time to go.I will definitely be back here again soon! I will need at least an hour or two to see everything. I loved how I came here on a Saturday in the early evening and everything wasn't picked over. I do wish though that they had a "Juniors" clothing section because then I might not have to sift through as many clothes to find something that fits.I recommend this store to anyone! I'm not a big "thrifter" because I'm super creeped out by germs, but I loved this place!
<review# 806,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2014,6/25/2014,346,105,15,20,20>I wasn't sure where this place was, when I RSVP'ed to the preview event.  Rancho Cordova does not make me think of great dining.  However, Alex hasn't steered me wrong yet, so I left work in Roseville and ventured down Sierra College/Hazel...all the way down past 50 (the other side of the tracks!) and then down Folsom Blvd.  I have to say, the restaurant is in a great location, right off the freeway, by the dance/ rock climbing/ landscape supply/furniture places.  I'm sure it will get a lot of traffic.Lots of parking in the lots, and the building looks like a big southern plantation house, white wraparound porches, trees, the works.  It was twilight and the lights on the porch and inside the restaurant made it look very cozy and inviting.  Walking in, the lounge area is very open, with lots of seating.  The bar is towards the back, a large wraparound piece, again, with lots of seating.  TVs everywhere, so I can see this being a good place to catch a game.  The hostesses and wait staff were welcoming, lots of smiles, very polite and sweet.  I started with the passion fruit martini, which was wonderful.  Passed appetizers were fried eggplant (delicious, crispy, perfect), risotto and crab cake duo with marinara and remoulade sauces (very tasty), beets/avocado on a skewer (all my non-vegetarian friends passed theirs over to me...delicious!), and truffle mac and cheese (I could eat this all day long.)  The seared ahi bites and the steak with blackberry reduction on crostini were a hit with my meat-eating friends.  It was great to see all my yelp friends, Frankie, Patrick, Devo, Barbara, Tiffany, Donovan, Carol, Todd, Monu, Michelangelo, Alex, Amy, Diana, Cindy and Scott...good times.All in all, a great soft opening, Fire Rock!  I will definitely recommend this place to my friends, and can't wait to come back.
<review# 807,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2014,6/24/2014,122,117,18,26,24>Years ago I used to live off Florin and discovered this place. I used to buy my twin boys a dozen donut holes for $1. This was when my twins were still in car seats and the drive through was very convenient for me. The owner always gave me a few extra donut holes for stopping in. Coming here was always a treat. We moved out of the south area about 5 years ago and of course found donut shops in Elk Grove. Recently we were on Florin and were shocked to see a Krispy Kreme across the street from our favorite donut shop. We bought our usual bag of donut holes which have only gone up to $1.25. Came home and read the Yelp reviews and glad to see others were dismayed to see KK across the street as well. It just has made me more determined to support this family run shop. Since that evening I have stopped in a few more times and to sample their famous cronuts! What a delicious discovery. So flaky and light and of course sinfully sweet. A little more than your average donut at $2.50 a piece but a nice treat to have once in a while. I have only had the glazed but want to try the cream filled one too.I hope Bakers continue to be successful, the owners son actually told me many customers leave KK to come over and give them a try. Tell them you Yelp and they may give you a discount. Keep up the good work Bakers. I am a fan!
<review# 808,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,6/23/2014,165,218,16,19,19>I eat meat. I eat alot of meat actually. I probably eat more meat than just about anything else; even more than veggies although I do eat alot of them too; OH and cheese I eat entirely too much of that as well so when I discover a place that serves fresh, flavorful and generous portions of meat, cheese and a veggie I am filled with all sorts of warm fuzzy feelings & that happened today. Found a cute little flyer on my ride after leaving work one day and what caught my attention was that it was listed in bold print: Active MilitaryVeteransFireFightersLaw Enforcement Buy one order-Get second order of equal value or less 1/2 priceTo all our people in uniform we appreciate your service From a fellow Vet ^This information right here is what compelled me to promise myself I'd try The Dog House at least once. Today was that day as I was hungry as all hell & needed some substantial portions of meat, veggie and fat for lunch to hold me over until dinner. I also love and respect the hell out of Military,Veterans and ALL Civil Service uniformed officers/persons who either have or continue to put their life out on the line for everyday folks like me.POISON of THE DAY: 1/3 of a pound Cheeseburger with choice of cheeses: Provolone, Swiss, Cheddar and more however I went with my old faithful American Cheese and a side of coleslaw- Protein Style aka: Hold the bread and french fries. You can substitute the starch for coleslaw for only .75cents and the size was really substantial at around a solid 1cup if not slightly more. I love KFC coleslaw as its the perfect blend of sweetly salty addictive creamy goodness however today's plentiful bowl of slaw was as good if not better! No joke... Freshly grated is my bet if not perfectly thinly sliced pieces of crispy coleslaw and carrot in the most deliciously creamy sweet,salty with a hint of zingy dressing deliciousness. I chewed it as slowly as I could just to make it last... Not exaggerating when I say that if I wouldn't have been concerned with being caught I would have licked the entire bowl clean of any remnants of the dressing. But I restrained myself. Burger is a solid 1/3 of a pound and was FRESH fresh and well...... Fresh and cooked perfectly as ordered: Medium. Still juicy not at all dry and moist and flavor. Actually it tasted flame-broiled to me but when I asked about that I was told it isn't as they grill their meat on an industrial sized griddle. You'd never know it. Served with crispy fresh pickle slices, slices of fresh red onion, tomato and crispy romaine lettuce leaves. Of course I love drowning my food in sauces and flavors so the bottled ketchup & mustard at the table allowed me to do just that only adding to the flavor. Yummy! It was unbelievably satisfying & I inhaled them both and although I was pleasantly full when done I could have eaten more of both just based on the flavorfulness of it all. It appears this location used to be an old donut shop as remnant's of the old donut sign due to weather bleaching is present as The Dog has their banner now in their place. I was welcomed sincerely by all members of their team from the minute I first hit the door until I left. It's owned & operated by a team consisting of Darrell & Rachael, Douglas the retired Navy Vet and Mike an Army vet & kick ass cook who cooked my meat & who also created the superlative coleslaw as well as Chrissy who manned the register. I interacted with them all and it was Rachael who pipped up when she heard me trying to order sans bread/starch and suggested they make it 'protein style' for me wrapped in lettuce.. It was love at first sight for me lolIf your in the North Highlands area & or having services rendered at the VA at McClellan & looking for a new place to try some deliciously fresh eats including their homemade chili you may want to hit The Dog as just on my first visit it gave me such a homey welcomed feeling & their food was bombtastic!

I almost didn't believe it at first. I had to pinch myself several times and call my sister up, once I was sure it wasn't the result of some hallucinogenic fever dream. The most legit independent coffee shop in town opening a franchise in our yuppie burb? I asked myself, dear Yelpers, how could I have lucked out so much?Needless to say, this is now my go to neighborhood hangout (conveniently located, also, a block from my neighborhood bar, On the Y). The coffee is strong, aromatic and leaves me crack addled, but doesn't burn a hole through my stomach like some places I could mention. It's a coffee lovers dream. But it should get 10 stars just for being walking distance--it's one of those things that makes not living in midtown bearable.Also: there's this barista there who's always giving me an up and down, I really wanna leave him a tip... with my number on it. Do you think I'd get a discount if I was dating a barista here? hmmmm
<review# 810,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2012,11/21/2012,80,46,3,10,6>This place is now open for dinner!Ignoring the fact that you have to drive to Natomas, this place is a tasty and reasonably priced spot for a tasty meal. As one of my friends from the bay commented when I took him here, PBGS really emphasizes the meat in all of their offerings. That being said (and undeniably true), they do a stand up job on their breads and fries as well.The firs few visits, I originally focused on trying all of their pork belly concoctions (e.g. street tacos, banh mi, fries, etc.) and probably would have repeated those orders forever, but I was forced to branch out one eventful day when their oven malfunctioned. PBGS goes beyond its name has a damn good burger and other meaty offerings. It's something to consider as I think the pork belly can sometimes get a bit overcooked towards the end of the day, but that's the nature of the meat when cooked outside of a sous vide. Either way, this place has earned a place in my rotation of eateries I showcase to out-of-towners.
<review# 811,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2012,11/19/2012,354,195,8,11,9>If you have never visited Huong Lan Sandwiches, take the time to read my review. Especially if you go on a busy weekend.It was slightly intimidating to go in on a super packed Sunday afternoon. There were so many people and I was really confused on where the line started, even WHAT line to get in. But the employees as well as all the hungry customers waiting in line to order, were all so nice and helpful. Heres the scoop; There are two cash registers that you can order from. Doesn't matter what line you get in, however, the register you DO order at is going to be where they deliver your sandwiches when its ready. The prices are ridiculous!  SOOOO CHEAP! I bought two sandwiches, a drink, a pack of spring rolls and four eggrolls for $10!!!!!!!!!!!!! Sacramento can feed the hungry on these prices, no matter what their income! I loved everything that I bought! The bread was crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. The BBQ pork meat was flavorful and the veggies were crunchy, bright and fresh. Add some sriracha and behold, the best Banh Mi I've ever had. The veggie spring rolls were great as well. I was so delighted at the freshness of the ingredients and the sauce that comes with it and for $3 there is no going wrong. I went back the next week for another great sandwich with spring rolls and by golly look at the time!! Huong Lan, here I come!
<review# 812,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/29/2012,11/18/2012,317,342,6,8,8>What a fun event!  A beautiful day in Fremont Park, with an easy entry.  Our admission gave us a 5 slider punch card with unlimited beer tastings in our neat little plastic beer stein which held about 3 or 4 ounces.  Dad's was selling some pork sliders and a chicken meal, which looked really good.  But we were all about the sIliders!  Michel's offered a lamb slider which was very good, as did Kupros. Chops offered a pulled pork slider, which was just average.  Mayahuel offered not a slider but a ranchera steak torta with a side of salsa, chips, and pickled carrots and jalapenos.  But my favorite (and judges choice winner!) was the jalapeno slider from River City Brewing.  It was the biggest slider offered, and it was a kobe infused chuck patty with jalapeno, cheese, guacamole with a the right amount of kick.  Mmmmmmm mmm tasty!The suds part of the event was great too!  There were a number of local, and not so local breweries, and I can say I had my fair share where I cannot name them all.  But my favorites were the Butchertown Black Ale from Speakeasy brewery out of San Francisco (definitely going to have to check them out when I'm out there) 21st Amendment's Hell or Highway Watermelon, also out of San Francisco, Pumpkin Ale from American River Brewery out of Rancho Cordova, and the amber from River City Brewing.  I didn't get to try Brother Thelonious which was a abbey ale, but it must have been good if they ran out.They had some other vendors like Titan Insurance, but I didn't really notice the others.  All in all, great location, great sliders and suds going for a great cause.  I hope they make this an annual event!
<review# 813,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2012,11/17/2012,156,217,5,8,6>If you're looking for the best taco truck in Sacto, you will find Tacos Apatzingan #2 parked in front of strikingly janky M C Discount Liquor most days during lunch hours. As long as adobada's in-stock, it always ranges from muy bueno to muy excelente. But on Fridays, the adobada is spiked with roasted jalapenos, and it's especially succulent!I've been to all of the other trucks....both of 'em on Northgate, Tres Hermanos on El Camino, El Sinalorense on Fruitridge, the one by the New Asia Supermarket on 47th Ave near Stockton Blvd, the one behind the Shell station on Stockton at 65th Expwy, and the new one on Stockton Blvd south of Mack Road....Tacos Apatzingan #2 is definitely the best, except for when they've run out of my favorite meat choice or my preferred backup choice, lengua. Hey...it happens sometimes. I typically take off for lunch around 2pm.Illyana's 3-star review should be thrown out because she only tried the carne asada. Their carne asada is about as good as any mediocre taqueria's carne asada ... not so tender, nor well-seasoned. It's the kinda food that only stoners would rave about if they were totally outta their gourd. The adobada is where it's at, though. Tender inside, lightly charred outside, and roasted in a savory sauce.Apatzingan is spelled correctly on the driver side of the truck, but on the business-side, it's misspelled two different ways. But don't fret, gavachos...English is spoken fluently here. Despite being almost six miles south of my Midtown office, it's always a quick trip to and from Tacos Apatzingan #2. It's only a minute from the 47th Ave exit. Affable and assiduous, the sweet ladies on-duty churn out the tacos, burritos, and tortas briskly, but never at the expense of quality, and they never fail to get the right orders to the right customers no matter how many people are thronging around the truck.Prices are good...$1.25 for tacos, burritos under $5. I've never had their tortas, so I won't vouch for those. Only the most quantity-over-quality burrito size-queens will find fault with their burrito's length and girth. Tacos are sand-dollar-sized, but heaped with enough meat that the tortillas typically can't be folded without some chunks trickling out. To-go orders travel neatly, however, thanks to a tight layer of plastic wrap. Burritos also get wrapped in a paper plate around the foil, plus plastic wrap. If you're waste-conscious and don't need the extra anti-mess safeguarding, just let 'em know.Park anywhere in front of the M C Discount Liquor store. There's about six spaces in front, plus four on the left side, and a couple more behind the car vacuuming service that sets up between M C and the 76 gas station mini-mart. Don't park right next to the truck.
<review# 814,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2012,11/16/2012,364,232,6,12,9>Awesome, awesome, AWESOME! I've been coming to Denios for many, many years and I love how it's the same as how it used to be when I was a kid. As a kid, I enjoyed coming here with my family and browsing for toys and scrunchies while my dad looked at random old stuff and my mom buying hair ties and random t-shirts. We would always get a corn dog and those Mexican chips, my favorite! I don't know the name of the chips, but you spray lime juice and pour a bunch of hot sauce on and it's so good!Now, I like to walk around and browse every aisle for hidden treasures. My cutie is a video game fanatic and continues to find steals wherever he goes. We scored two Playstation games with new mics (Rap Central and High School Musical) for $3 each! Both were brand new! If you see something you like, grab it, bargain, and take it home because it may not be there later!My favorite reason for coming to Denios: FOOD! I love their corn dogs! For $1.75, you might as well get two! Produce is super fresh, clean and cheap. I always purchase the produce on my way out. Near the fresh beef jerky spot, there's this kettle corn spot where this man and his wife make fresh kettle corn. It is so good! You can sample some before you buy. The bag is pretty big and it's only $4-$5 a bag. I bought the habanero popcorn, nice and spicy. I also bought the raspberry popcorn, weird but very tasty! You can't miss this place. You can smell the freshly popped corn walking in!  I also like to stop at the taco truck and the tamale spot to grab a small bite to eat. Everything is so good and so fresh!Quick tip: Don't pay for parking! You can park across the street where the houses are. Just don't block their driveway. It's a quick walk to Denios. Don't forget to bring a backpack  if you plan on buying produce and don't want to carry bags. Happy bargaining and eating!
<review# 815,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2012,11/15/2012,202,116,2,11,8>After my previous review, which was based on trying a solo slice, I received a nice email from the owner, thanking me for the review, and inviting me back in. Today, I returned for round 2!QUALITY PIEInstead of a slice, I ordered a large pizza, half plain cheese and half with olives, peppers, and pineapples. This time around was much better. The care taken in making the pie really came through, and I can now say that this pizza is a cut above! They used at least a couple types of peppers, and the pineapples were fresh (none of that canned stuff used at most places). The highlight for me was the crust, which tastes like fresh baked bread - mostly soft but with a little crunch to it to keep it interesting. This pizza is well beyond what I might expect from a little storefront in Old Sac!SERVICE / ATMOSPHEREThe service is also very good. And the atmosphere is clean and fun. With only a few tables, I'm sure there are some occasions when there's no available seating, but I haven't seen it be an issue so far.SUMMARYI'm glad I gave this place another shot. Usually I go for either deep dish (Chi Fire, Zelda's) or wood-fired thin (Masullo, Hot Italian), but when I'm in the mood for a top quality more traditional-style pizza, this might just be my spot! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!
<review# 816,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2012,11/14/2012,195,127,6,9,8>This BOOT CAMP ("A general conditioning class focusing on strength, cardiovascular, and core for fat loss goal. Classes are never the same and are progressively challenging every week!") is taught by Ver Ryan Lorega. The group meets at the Gardens and Arts Center at McKinley Park every M-Sat. Bring a mat and some weights (make sure they're not too heavy or you'll be struggling to complete your reps)  I signed up for 5 weeks through an Amazon deal. It was my first boot camp experience and I was a little worried that it would be too hard for me. Well, I completed my 5 weeks and although it was challenging, Ver makes it so that you can go at your level of ability. The warm-ups are always the toughest then you move into some weight exercises and end it with abs. Ver varies the workouts so I was never bored doing the same thing every week and was always challenged. If you want to try a boot camp, I recommend BodyFoundry! You will want to go and you'll see results if you push yourself and do the exercises correctly. Ver is very good at what he does. I am definitely going to continue going to his boot camps.

I'm almost embarrassed at how catered I felt.  The service is exceptional.  I want to personally thank Teresa, the owner for sharing her story.  I am happy to support anyone who is strong enough to go through the most painful experience a human can endure and try to make meaning of it and share it with others by creating a safe haven for the community.  If you have a chance after dining at this unique spot, go on a tour of the facility.  There are offices for massage therapists, acupuncturists, sound therapists, and a lovely open garden area to experience.

Love that touch.Stephanie did wonders to my hair. It feels so soft and silky, not to mention I now am rocking some cute ass bangs. The scalp  treatment was fabulous. And the shampoo she used was great *smells like a man as she put it*. I was the last client that evening, so the place was empty when I arrived besides Amithyst and her parents (who were just adorable as well). And those feather pieces are just darn cute. Cute and adorable are the ways to describe this place. I instantly felt welcome here. I will definitely come back here. This was my first ever visit to an upscale salon (where I paid myself and my mom didn't foot the bill) and I will never EVER let anyone at SuperCuts touch my locks again.They also do waxing, facials and make-up application here. I'll have to try some of those extra services. Thank you sooo much Stephanie and Amithyst!!!!

I can't rave enough about how pleasant and welcoming all the employees are. We asked them a little about the Hindu Gods on the wall too and they were very open to talking about it with us. Usually there are tons of vegan options, but this time not as many on the buffet. But that's ok because I had enough food. The soup (whatever it was) was by far my favorite along with the dosas. The ball like desserts in goo-like stuff is really yummy too - my favorite dessert they have.

I'm a huge fan of popcorn, so I like to take advantage of getting it for FREE whenever I can.  Long live Monday Movie Madness at Tower Theater!

HOWEVER! The service on the day I went here was wretched. There were two people working, one person at the register, one person cooking the food - and inbetween, because this taqueria is a sit down, the cashier had to take a kit kat break and deliver food to the hungry patrons with short fuses. I was one of those hungry customers who waited as her lunch break passed her by as my stomach rumbled. *hunger pains*But the payoff was worth it...and I will come back. It also helps that a lady waiting with me ensured that this was an off day and they usually had more people working there. A bit of reassurance. The fish tacos were juicy (not a breaded fish taco), flaky, lemony, spicy, and street size with beans and rice that were not just throw aways! The beans tasted creamy and tasty and the rice is perfectly cooked! This taqueria might actually make me bypass Chipotle, It's that good! The service just needs to step it up and I might add another star with an updated review.

Guys-This translates to you standing out in the crowd of affliction or some big eagle crested busy t- shirt!  If you can catch a sale it is a really good deal. They also host special events at the store as well.  This place is worth a trip.  I will definitely return to buy some more clothes.

Don't be afraid when ordering the spiciness. Extra spicy should be just about right. The broth is flavorful and the meat is tasty. You can get wheat noodles instead of regular which adds a little texture. Being super Americanized and used to large amounts of meat, I usually order a side of chasu so I have something to munch on.When you're done eating don't sit there for an hour talking - this isn't that kind of place.

Despite the mere minor setback, the idea of taking advantage of the recent warm weather to do something my boyfriend and I have never done before was too hard to pass up. Soon after, we made our way to Practical Cycle, conveniently located just off the bike trail. Originally, we planned on renting two cruisers and practicing at the park before setting off on the trail. But after we mentioning to Tim at the shop about my biking incompetence, he suggested we try tandem biking instead. He assured us it would be foolproof since my boyfriend would be doing all the work. This was a moment of enlightenment, for all my life, I thought that tandem biking required nothing short of Cirque du Soleil caliber balance and synchrony between my partner and I.  But lo and behold, once we hopped on the bike and started peddling, it felt like second nature. For me, all I had to do was pedal. I didn't even have to worry about shifting my weight during turns. Meanwhile, my boyfriend said it felt no different from riding solo. We stayed out for about 2 hours, but we could have easily continued for another couple hours, were it not for the setting sun. The trail was beautiful and the experience was one of a kind. When the day was over, we both agreed that tandem biking was actually preferable to renting separate bikes because it was easier to talk while biking. If you're looking for something fun and unique to do, I highly recommend biking along the Sacramento River. And if you don't have your own bike or are interested in tandem biking, do come to Practical Cycle. Tim and his team will take care of you.

Makes sense because this park doesn't seem like a place where Nazis like to hang out. I mean, I don't want to generalize here but I've been to River Bend many times and I've never seen a Nazi. Besides, the park is grassy and hilly and has lots of picnic tables. It's better for soaking in the sun, BBQing or playing sports than practicing a variety of fascism that incorporates biological racism and antisemitism. And whenever I'm there I see a great diversity of people--every race, every age group--not the product of an ideology that requires the domination of society by people deemed racially superior.So, yeah, it's a nice place. What's also really cool about River Bend is that it is actually located on a bend in the river. So it's really easy to find. At the bend. In the river.

This place is such a blessing to so many families. On our visits there, we've seen the hospital treat a wide variety of cases. They had my daughter use a brace for her back and she wore that for several years. Each time we went to our appointments they would x ray her to see if there were any changes. The x ray technician, can't recall his name, but he was such a crack up, always making patients laugh and smile. All of the staff here are genuinely passionate about what they do. My daughter's seventeen now and no longer needs to go to Shriner's. We don't know how the outcome would've been if we never found out about this gem in Sacramento. We really are fortunate to have this hospital in our town. We are so fortunate to have come here because your child's health and well being is, "Priceless!"
<review# 833,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2013,4/5/2013,354,195,11,13,13>I've been here twice since the place has opened and I have enjoyed both my meals here. The first time I came here with the BF and friend. Our server Michelle was awesome. She was funny, attentive and helped us through the menu. She also rolled with the BF's annoying jokes and puns which is great to have in a waitress when he is around. The second time we had a male server and he was very friendly as well but alas, I didn't pay so I didn't get the little business card with his name on it. (sorry bud)I think the prices are fair and the food was very tasty. The plus side of this place is the chef's choice menu that changes every (2 weeks??) something like that...and the entire menu changes seasonally....hence the name....so you will never tire of the same thing on the menu year round. The other HUGE plus for me, is that every entree is under 475 calories....EVERY ONE! So I don't feel the typical guilt that I have when dining out elsewhere. They also make a really good dirty martini...and they serve it in the mini martini shaker so you kinda get two drinks for the price of one.....LOVE ITDefinitely recommend everyone to try it out for themselves...or don't..cause there has never been more than 5min of wait on the two Friday nights I've been here....so yeah...never mind...go to BJ's or something.... juuuuuust kidding  =)
<review# 834,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2013,4/4/2013,1353,176,13,21,16>Hey herbivores: stop searching for where to eat tonight. This place is vegan-friendly! And DELICIOUS!This place is a great change up from my typical Thai/Indian/Taco Bell route. * Start with the sambussa, also called a samosa. They are triangular, flaky, lentil-y, deep fried goodness. You order as many as you want, which will be all of them. I could eat a bucket of em, I usually stick with 2. Or 3. Or 5.* My go-to order:       # 18 - Awazie Tofu Tibbs **(taken from the menu) "Tender chunks of tofu, sauteed with berbere, garlic/ginger, and herbs, and accompanied with various mixed vegetables (onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, and mushrooms)."AND (because I'm a bottomless pit)     # 23 - Vegetarian Combination(again, from the menu) "A small combination of Misr Kik Wot (red lentils), Kik Wot (yellow lentils), Gomen (spinach), cabbage (YUM), potatoes/carrots, and fresh salad."* Food is served with a whole basket of rolled up Injera, which are flat, bubbly, sourdough crepes. Stay with me. You eat with your hands...(eff utensils, AMMI RIGHT? I'm always pro- cutting out one more step between the food and my face) ...and the Injera helps grab and transport the food to your mouthhole more efficiently. They provide wet-naps on the table! Thoughtful.* A "small" combination/portion is actually a big silver tray, filled with food, on top of more Injera. Family style. Let's get real close, dining partners.* Get the hot tea! Hella good. Or the fresh mango juice. * My ONE issue: consistently, the food is typically slow coming out. Once you get it, it's waaay forgiven, and in the meantime you can amuse yourself my studying the Ethiopian alphabet that is under your glass table top.* I have yet to try the buffet, WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE?VERDICT: GO. Vegans and Omnis alike.

This little spot is Magpie's hatchling, and I've been grinning like a cheshire cat because I can now get my most favorite chocolate chip cookie whenever I wish to take a little stroll.They sell most of the same baked items as Magpie - Inside out carrot cake cookie monster sandwich, lavendar shortcake (my new addiction - and, I'm told one of the only items in which they use that fancy/wonderful double cream/whatever it is butter... melts in my mouth), some savory items (loaded foccacia, pre-made sandwiches, salads) and coffee. They also seem to surprise with new creations like the savory roll thingy I enjoyed recently.

<review# 836,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/7/2013,4/2/2013,257,251,8,14,9>Trader Joe's is one of the few places that I go for my regular grocery shopping.  I can't buy everything I need at just one store, so I come here for milk, eggs, Greek yogurt, cheese, wine, and occasionally meats or seafood.  I'm also a fan of the frozen roasted corn,  frozen Argentinian Red Shrimp, Green Plant Juice, and certain boxed soups.The only time I might buy produce here is if I know I will be using it that evening for dinner.  Unfortunately, there have been too many times in the past that fruit or vegetables I have purchased have begun to rot within 24 hours, and became a pain having to return to the store so often to exchange them.  This was especially true for avocados, which I will no longer purchase here.That being said, this really is a nice store.  I just know what to buy elsewhere.  The staff are always incredibly friendly and helpful, and fast at checking out.  I would suggest coming here during the morning, early afternoon, or later in the evening.  The 4-6pm traffic just clogs the aisles up and it can be frustrating.
<review# 837,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2013,4/1/2013,410,518,7,12,13>My second wedding cake tasting in 4 days :)  Pretty sure I can't eat any more cake at this point...or until next week.  LOL!  All of my married friends and my mother all gave praise to Ettores and wanted me to get my wedding cake from this bakery.  When my dad found out my appointment date and time he actually called in sick because he wanted to go to my tasting!!The presentation was conducted very well.  Marybeth, our cake consultant, set us up at the bar stool area in front of the kitchen.  Apparently, that is where they have all their tastings because the computer is stationed there and the tables and booths are for customers having dinner/meal there.  I really liked the digital photos they took and the fact that my parents, fiance, and I can look at the different cakes via a slide show presentation.  Way better than flipping through a binder and sharing it!  There were so many designs all beautifully made that it was hard to decide a favorite.  Of course I came in with my own cake pictures and the fiance had his own idea of what he wanted our cake to look like.  We came to a compromise on a design with the help of Marybeth.  This chick can draw!!! She listened to what we imagined the cake to look like and she drew it!  I chose two different designs and she gave me pricing on both.While Marybeth was working on pricing we were able to taste the cakes..and OMG!!!  I was expecting little portions, but Marybeth came out with cake slices from the bakery.  All 9 of them! Princess Torte, Fruit Basket, Strawberry White Chocolate Mouse, Spiced Carrot, Kahlua, Chocolate mouse, Truffle, Red Velvet, and Chocolate Peanut butter!!!   You know, the ones you usually buy for $3!  Surprised that this tasting was free and the fact that they gave such huge portions.  Even for 4 people it was too much.  My dad's exact words after 3 cakes, "OK, that's enough.  I don't want anymore.  Stop!"  PRICING:  Wedding cakes usually start off at $1,100 for a 2-3 tiered cake with a simple design.  This place, is way more AFFORDABLE than that!!!  For a 4 (yes 4) tiered cake sized at 14, 12, 9, 6 WITH a 1/2 sheet of grooms cake WITH Fondant (you don't pay extra for fondant here) AND flowers (you don't pay extra for those either) with THREE different cake flavors for over 200 people, out the door - if paid in full $1,000!!!!!  Effin steal!  Most places charge extra for Fondant...like hundreds of dollars more.  Love that this place just gives you one price for everything!Customer service was amazing here.  My dad is a diabetic and he was feeling dizzy and Marybeth gave him a cookie, fruit tart, and soup to hold him down.  Pretty sure that was the reason why he couldn't taste anymore cakes! BEST part of all this wedding planning:  the extra special moments with my parents :)  We had a really good time tasting cakes and talking wedding stuff.  *  Note to self and others:  Remember that it is just a tasting, you don't have to eat all the cake!!  hahaha
<review# 838,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/30/2012,3/31/2013,582,450,6,13,8>Yummy Greek food in my belly, that's where it should be!  Petra Greek keeps it authentic and simple.  No need for added bells and whistles to disguise your food when what you are served is simple and delicious.  They do not skimp on the portion sizes, so if you're not super hungry you'll have plenty to share!I had the CHICKEN SOUVLAKI PLATE with French fries and it was delicious.  Grilled chicken skewers with Greek yogurt sauce and pita bread, wow!  The GREEK SAUCE is like delicious heaven in a cup!  The little salad that comes on the side is a nice touch and the French fries (you can get rice if you'd prefer) came perfectly crispy and ready for dipping into the Greek sauce.  The icing on the cake is that they are open until 3 a.m. Weds - Sat.  They struck gold opening such a delicious establishment within walking distance from many midtown bars.  Smart, very smart!
<review# 839,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2009,3/29/2010,42,177,6,5,6>So a Furlough Friday is good for something.  Perfect day to visit this hole in the wall.  Seems like half the charm of eating at Le Bonne is the conversations that spark up between the sheep, as we wait obediently in line.  I was just passing by on the way to . . . irrelevant!  I noticed the place was open at 2:00, and that there's only one guy waiting outside.  Hell yeah, I had something else to do.  But I just HAD TO KNOW why someone would stand and wait an hour for food this cat puts his hands on.  Carpe diem!  So I freakin' waited . . . for 50 minutes.  ON A FURLOUGH FRIDAY.  I had a lovely conversation with a laid-off school nurse and a hawaiian mom whose husband waited outside with a toddler son in a stroller.  When I got to the head of the line, I ordered 2 sandwiches (the soups were history by 12:30, I heard):  one with braised marinated pork loin, and one with warm brie and apple slices; total for 2 sandwiches and 2 bottles of french lemonade: $15 even.  The braised pork was really good; tender meat, a nice vinaigrette and veggies on a warm & tasty french roll baked on the premises. I shared the brie/apple with a colleague, and didn't get to taste it.  By all reports, it was absolutely delicious.I feel like part of a special crowd; you know, folks who strut around with T-shirts that say, "I rode the [insert latest and greatest rollercoaster here]."  That kind of crowd.  Good experience; don't need to do it again, until the real Soup Nazi -- strike that . . . Soup Napoleon -- gets a doggone cashier.
<review# 840,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2009,3/28/2010,83,184,1,12,5>Excellent visit.I did not have an appointment, which to the very nice lady (seemed like maybe the owner) at the front desk was no problem. She was friendly and polite, and even remembered my name when I came out. Throughout the massage I could hear her getting on the back room PA system to page out the massage people when clients arrived. This was odd, but hell, for $20 who cares.I had Jessica, she was very good. I would say it was about 85% relaxing, 10% hurt so good, 5% downright painfull but you could tel it was still working. They give you a little card at the end with their name and days off, in case you want to request them again. Perhaps future yelpers on here could name the person they got, so I could get reccomendations. I wouldnt mind trying other people.The chairs / loungers are about the most comfortable thing I have ever sat it. They start by soaking your feet, then do a scalp/face/neck/arm/hand massage. Then they move onto your feet and legs, which is the to die for part. For the last five minutes you sit up and get a deep pressure back massage. The only reccomendation I would have to change the place is to maybe make the soft music a little louder, to overcome the sound of those around you getting the slap slap parts of their massages.Be warned. This is not your hotel swedish relaxtion massage. Well, maybe 85% of it is. This is a stretching, slapping, pulsing, deep massage, but damn it feels good.Stop hesitating, just go. You will NOT be sorry.
<review# 841,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/18/2010,3/25/2010,562,500,2,6,5>I have been going here for a couple of years and have never been disappointed. This place is snuggled in behind the A & W Rootbeer on Elk Grove Florin Road near Calvine Road. It is a store front style business in a small strip mall. The interior is nicely done in a Mexican theme and is airy and light with big windows and tall ceilings. The free chips are light and fresh and they come with a bowl of bean dip which I think is really good and I do not usually like bean dip. They also have a salsa bar that is small but adequate. My favorite dishes are the chili rellanos which I think is one of the best I ever had (I have ordered it in Mexican restaurants all over the bay area) and the pork chimichanga. According to my laborers chimichangas and flautas are American dishes. My girl friend really likes the cheese enchiladas, (she does not like pork or beef and only eats the white meat of the chicken) the chili rellanos, and the shrimp tostadas. everything has always been fresh and delicious. The servers do not seem like trained professionals and can be sporadic at times, but they try hard and are very friendly. Give them a little encouragement and I think they will respond to you in kind. To me, this is just part of the ambiance.
<review# 842,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/26/2009,3/24/2010,81,212,,6,4>They haven't won me over yet, but they are close. I ordered a bratwurst, and it was alright. I'm picky about my brats and was expecting a little more. That being said, I'm willing to (deal with the heatrburn, hah!) and go back for more. I'll try something different next time. The cheese fries were delicious in that "this fake cheese melted all over here tastes so amazing" sort of way.But what is most worth commenting on is the ambiance. We went over there 11am Saturday and it had just opened. The weather was perfect and their patio was great to sit on and people watch.
<review# 843,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2010,3/23/2010,439,356,4,6,7>Every time I come here, I am always warmly greeted. Even though each time, there has been someone different to greet me, they never ever have a bad attitude. I have never walked out of this place without having had a full conversation with someone. The people here are SO nice! And that says a lot for an Indian place! The naan is excellent. The samosas are good, but sometimes I bite into something I don't like, so I have stopped getting them. The butter chicken is great, but could be a little more spicy. Aloo Gobi is excellent.You get bang for your buck here. I only wish I lived closer.
<review# 844,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2010,3/22/2010,175,211,3,8,5>It's been awhile since I've done the happy hour thing.  (I tend to hibernate in the winter)Even though it was pouring in Midtown yesterday, I was called out of my hiding place and met up with a few girlfriends after work.  I have been to Bistro 33 a handful of times and it has always had a nice vibe.They have a happy hour menu from 4-7pm with prices ranging from $3.50 to $5 bucks.   We decided to share the Dungeness crab & artichoke dip and the calamari.  Being a "vodka" gal, we were hooked up with passion fruit vodka & cranberry.  Juicy!The calamari was very good and served with Thai sweet chili aioli and a lemon aioli. The crab & artichoke dip is served with toasted parmesan crostini's with a wedge of lemon and was delicious!  So good in fact, that we ended up ordering another plate.   Now, I've read reviews about their Hot Bag O' Donuts and convinced my friend to share with me and they did not disappoint!  Our server brought out the bag and shook it up and out popped hot & tender donuts covered in powdered sugar & cinnamon.   We had our choice of dipping sauces that included chocolate, strawberry compote and honey butter.   The honey butter was the best with the strawberry dip coming in a close second.  The service was spot on and I want to thank our bartender who was ever so patient with my friend as he tweaked her drink a few times to her liking.Good friends, good conversation and good food!
<review# 845,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2009,3/21/2010,144,104,2,4,2>Ohh Zuda...how I love you so. I have been going here for a while now and can't say enough good things about it. The owners really care about the place and are always making improvements to the studio. The yoga instructors are also amazing. Each of them has a different style and rhythm - but it makes it so you don't get bored each time you go. My favorite teacher by far though is Ty. The evening classes get a bit crowded, so if you're not into crowds try to wake up and go to the 6am class. The other great thing is the amount of classes they have. You basically never have an excuse not to go. I come out of class dripping sweat, I look like i just took a shower with my clothes on...it hurts SO good.
<review# 846,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/17/2009,3/20/2010,145,221,4,5,5>Ok, so before i begin..i gotta say i did go here with about 30+ people for a work shin dig.  They really hit a pet peeve with me on the lighting. I know some people go to a dimly lit resturant and think ....oooh romantic....  I think ....oooh i cant see my food, its probably crawling with bugs.  Sitting inside the place makes you feel like your waiting for some strippers to come by with a  different sort of menu...the kind that you get charged by the hour for. My service was great...i loved the giant cups they use....think 80's pizza parlor but like four times the size. i had plenty of diet coke and it was refilled often, everyone else at my table had problems getting the server to get them drinks period...food was pretty tasty....granted i couldn't see anything so im not even sure what i ate so im going entirely by taste...theres was some spicy potatoes in a what tasted like gorgonzola sauce. that was real kickass....not to spicy but way cheesy in a sharp sorta way.a dish that had ham and red bell peppers...it was good...pepperysome focaccia bread and what im guessing was a fried ravioli - i had about four...so i guess that speaks to how much i liked them.all in all the food was worth it...especially since i didn't pay. I think ill take my girl up here and then give it a real review....because it was good enough to make me curious.not exactly the type of place i would take  a group of people....but its nice to see a decent non-chain eatery in elk grove -land of the bland.
<review# 847,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2010,3/19/2010,512,236,5,5,4>This place was extremely packed and we were able to get the last open table as soon as we walked in, so that's a plus!It took them a couple minutes for our server to get to us but when she did she quickly brought out our drinks. We're not beer drinkers so we just got plain ol' soda. It was extremely loud in there but we weren't too bothered by it, the crowd was a lot older tonight. No drunken frat boys which is ALWAYS a great thing.Alrighty onto their food, as an appetizer we got the Rubicon wings. They described them like buffalo wings so that's what I was expecting. Instead they much exceeded my expectations! They smelled sweet but had a huge spicy kick to it! They were amazing. I couldn't eat more than two because they left my mouth on fire.. in a good way though!For my entree I ordered their portebello muchroom pesto pasta. It came with a cup of clam chowder too. I was skeptical when I saw the clam chowder had carrots in it. But when I tasted it all my doubts disappeared! It had tons of clams in it and I could barely taste the carrots, I was happy because I hate carrots!Now the pasta was divine, the mushroom was marinated in the most delicious sauce.. I wonder what it was and if it was the pesto then it's wonderful! I wish I hadn't ordered steak in my pasta because it didn't need it.I was pretty satisfied! Next time I'm going to try their fish & chips.
<review# 848,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2010,3/18/2010,150,115,3,6,4>I ventured over here today with the boyfriend for a big ol' breakfast. Upon entering, the servers seemed a little disoriented but still very friendly. They said it was slower than usual, so that probably threw them off. We were seated within minutes and our drinks were out quickly.He ordered the pub grill with bangers and an English muffin and I ordered the corned beef hash with a banana bran muffin. Oh man. So much deliciousness. My corned beef hash did not come out of a can. It looks like it was made in-house and cooked to order, mixed perfectly with country potatoes. The eggs were over-easy, as I asked, not gooey uncooked sections detected. The muffin was not overly sweetened and had a lopsided home-cooked goodness to it. His food was also spot on. He slathered each of the three jams and marmalades available onto his English muffin. Each was equally delicious.Our server checked on us periodically. Our water never emptied and his coffee cup stayed full. She was a sweet lady who never pestered us, just made sure we were happy. You've gotta love that.It's a hearty breakfast that won't leave you feeling sick and regretting it all day. Everything is fresh and delicious, nothing is overly salted or seasoned.5/5 stars for breakfast! I haven't really gone here for drinking or shows so my rating rests solely on the breakfast experience. Yum :]
<review# 849,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2008,7/18/2008,801,1755,10,8,12>Is it weird that if I saw the girl in the featured Ginger Elizabeth Yelp photos at the store, that I feel like I've met a celebrity? I came here post-yogurtagogo, and despite inhaling the XXXXL cup o' yogurt (who fills those things up? that would be me...), I got a chocolate macaroon here too. This is the 2nd macaroon I've ever had in my life and I feel like I've been missing out. It was much smaller and creamier than the one I got at Bouchon Bakery. However, they made up for it with a generous slice of chocolate torte, rich and decadent - perfect for moi. Don't worry, I waited until later to eat it, but had to steal secret whiffs of it on my way to the gym as I contemplated whether I would just eat it then and there before it went "bad."I WAS going to get a cold hot chocolate and ice cream macaroon sandwich also but the girls I was with told me it was probably not a good idea after we practically rolled out of yogurtagogo, tummy's full of mochii. Would be dangerous if I am ever come here alone, this place is seriously confectionary crack and I'm addicted after just one visit.Besides having delicious chocolates, which I wish that had more variety of, the employees were super nice as they waited patiently for me to make what seemed like the decision of my life. I may have to go alone next time so no one can stop me from consuming every item on their menu.
<review# 850,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/2/2008,7/17/2008,187,162,6,8,4>Recently, I had occasion to be in Sacramento, and after checking on Yelp,  my host decided we should check out Zelda's before heading out to drink.  He said, "the reviews say the service is crap, but the pizza is allegedly awesome. It was definitely good, but unfortunately for Zelda's I've been eating pizza a bit lately, so it didn't really impress me.We walk up to the place, which has no windows and I'm thinking, awesome, this looks like a bar, possibly even a dive-y one. Imagine my surprise when we open the door to see a woman sitting at the bar with her baby on her lap. It's not a bad thing, just surprising. So while the details at the top of the Yelp page answer "no" on the "good for kids" question, I think that must be wishful thinking on someone's part. As a side note, it's a pretty cute kid. And by that I mean, she's quiet.Anyway, an employee acknowledges our presence but it isn't until she comes back to seat us that she reveals we have to submit out pizza order before we are seated. Which would have been handy to know when we first walked in. We could have been choosing instead of selecting Kenny Loggins on the jukebox. But we make a quick decision and are seated in a cozy little booth.When we sit down, this little, dark atmosphered place is packed. There's a child that is significantly less cute a few booths over, and by that I mean he's screaming over the Phil Collins we put on the jukebox. This definitely seems to be a popular place. However, by the time we actually get our food, it's almost completely empty. It takes a while, but I guess that's too be expected with pizza. In the meantime, we have our drinks. The strawberry daiquiri I order is pretty tasty (I know daiquiri and pizza, what am I thinking?). I wouldn't call the service bad or good, mostly unremarkable. We are kind of ignored all night, which I guess is bad but it's not like we need much. The pizza is definitely good, but even if I lived around the corner from it, it's not a place I think I'd frequent.They don't accept credit cards. Boo to that. I mean, I will put up with that from a lot of places, but they are usually awesome and they are usually take out.Zelda's, you did not win my heart.
<review# 851,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2008,7/16/2008,100,71,8,6,6>An East Coast native, my expectations on the subject of pizza are admittedly high.An open letter to Luigi's Slice:Dear Luigi's Slice,Firstly, let me compliment you on your fine pizzas. Your choice of ingredients is excellent, and your calibration of oven temperature is perfect. I particularly enjoy your cheese and vegetarian pizza slices. Additionally, your staff is welcoming and accommodating, especially the gentleman whose hairstyle is inspired by both Ryan Cabrera and Sonic the Hedgehog.I believe that your main problem is your floor plan. Your menu is too far from the ordering area. Your "order here" sign does not hang above an available human being. After one orders, whom do I pay? There's no one behind the register. Furthermore, once a customer pays for a take-out slice, where should they wait? I tend to stand near the back table, but I'm often mistaken for someone who's in line to order. I suggest a small bench for the wallflowers.Additionally, might I ask why it requires 10 minutes to heat up a precooked slice of pizza? Also, there is a distinct difference between a "recently cooked" and a "fossilized" slice of pizza; please differentiate.I'll retry your delicious pizza slices, as they are tasty, but I am prepared for further disappointment.Kindest regards,Your Sometimes Fan__________________Updated 7/16: I've eaten at Luigi's Slice since writing my review, so I'm obviously a fan of the end product. I also wanted to note that the owner of Luigi's Slice contacted me about my review. She noted that the MARRS 'Slice' location is new and that they're reading customer comments and addressing any outstanding issues. Great news!As an aside, I wasn't expecting a Yelp Review of the Day. This type of exposure isn't my thing, and I'm both pleased as well as physically curled up into a little ball about the possible fallout. To those that voted for my review, "thank you." To those businesses that want to hurt me, understand that I'm big guy; I've handled firearms; and 'I know people' ... if you know what I mean. ;-)And thanks again for the email Luigi's Slice! I think that we just became friends.
<review# 852,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/6/2008,7/15/2008,658,593,13,24,16>**updated 41508**So after dinner at Mikuni, we decided to go Mochii to grab some fro-yo since the first time I went, I loved it. It's still good. This time we tried the passion fruit flavor and it was yummy. Not an overwhelming passion fruit taste but enough for you to taste. There wasn't as much homemade mochii flavors to choose from this time, only three, pomegranate, almond, and coconut? We got the pomegranate mochii as a topping. Not that the pom. mochii wasn't good, it was but I wish I would of got more mochii on my cup! They have a suggestion box on the table while you walk out. I really wanted to write "Never skimp on toppings!" I couldn't even get half a mochii with each fro-yo bite I took! Very disappointed.Driving to Sacramento from Davis just SO I can try out Mochii Yogurt was definitely worth it! The placed looked so cute.. Probably the best designed Froyo placed I've been to.. The girl behind the counter was gorgeous and very sweet. The had different types of froyo and that day, they had Peach, Strawberry, Zang?, and Original. We had samples of the strawberry and peach. Love the strawberry one and liked the peach. Strawberry yogurt was very creamy and had the perfect strawberry flavor. Toppings were extensive. They make their Mochis'! They had many different mochi flavors Green tea, coconut, strawberry, orange, coconut, almond, cherry, dark chocolate, etc. Other toppings are your typical froyo toppings from fruits, to nuts, to cereal, to granola. I ordered a med combo (3 toppings for $4.95) Of Original with Coconut mochi, Strawberry mochi, and fresh strawberries. Loved the tartness and creaminess of the yogurt and LOVED the strawberry mochi! Very soft! Coconut mochi was good but not great.. It was kinda on the hard side but had a good coconut taste. Strawberries were fresh and sweet.SM $2.50 Each topping $0.95MD $3.50 with three toppings $4.95LG $6.00 with three toppings $7.45

<review# 855,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2008,7/12/2008,493,361,7,9,10>When I went to school I lived right off J street and nugget was just a stone throw away.  It became a regular stop for me during my time at Davis.  I do consider this place similar as a higher end specialty grocery store similair to a whole foods, but most importantly without the whole foods price.  Being a college student, who liked to eat and cook, you were on a tighter budget, and while one of the main complaints that most of my friends had about Nugget was that they felt that they are much more expensive then a Safeway or Lucky's (Albertson's back then.)  Then again they usually eat cereal or top ramen.  I personally think that their produce quality and diversity is much better then those two stores combined and I actually felt that their prices were quite reasonable, some would even say competitive.  The seafood is always fresh and the fish monger has all the tags with the freshness of the catch available if you inquire.  The other thing I like about the fish monger is that in a effort to inform the customer of which fish are being over harvested in the wild, they tag them with colored tags to show the level of over-harvesting that is going on.The butchers behind the counter are really friendly and when I was making a pasta sauce and needed ground lamb, which they didn't have, he was more then happy to take a  couple of his chops, de-bone them and had them put through a grinder at no extra cost.  The bakery though I must say is the best part of this place, throughout the morning at 8:00 am, 10:00 am and 12:00 pm, they would be releasing different types of bread fresh and hot from the oven.  My personal favorites were the baguette, ciabatta and brioche.  The brioche makes fantastic french toast!  *wink*  They have a large selection of wines, champagnes and beer, and quite a few specialty varieties of beer, I would often go and try some of the different brews here...  They do have a Chinese food take out station which is decent, the sushi is alright, not my favorite though and I honestly never had eaten at their burrito station.  But of course, in this area of meals, the best stop is their sandwich/panini bar.  There is always a line here, and the reason why, it is damn good. The prices have started to creep up as I left, but the number of breads, meats and cheese you could choose from left for almost limitless combinations.  My personal favorite was a honey ham and brie cheese sandwich with sprouts, avocado and tomato on a ciabatta mayo/mustard and toasted.  I filled up a number of those buy 10 sandwich get a free one cards during my stint at Davis...  I came here primarily for all of my core ingredients when I cook where I needed things that were fresh and of high quality, and while I did miss out on those buy 1 get 1 free deals on my OJ or 2 dozen eggs, this spot became my one stop shopping and most importantly, it was super close to my home.  The sandwiches, bakery and even the staff here were all amazing, I miss it now that I've moved back to the bay.  Nugget I'm begging you please come to the bay area!!!!
<review# 856,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/27/2007,7/11/2008,86,113,13,9,10>One of my favorite afternoon joints in the area. The bartender is a stand-up guy and will learn you a thing or two about the ins and outs of the greater 916, including where to find the best after hours chinese triad mah-jong game. The pool table is 50 cents and hasnt been sat/spilled on enough times to make it unplayable, (see the Old Tavern or anywhere in San Francisco). On certain evenings, the Sac State Chad and Tiff crew shows up and its butts-to-nuts tit jobs and white caps, but that's most of Sacramento so its hardly worth complaining about. My only gripe is the barman never cuts me a deal. Hey, if I've been in there all day paying your kids' tuition, let's make that next Old Crow on the arm, bro!EDIT: Last night, the barman comped me and my old lady a free shot. This place is fully legit.

All the breakfast dishes came with country potatoes.  I would normally get the Eggs Bene (my all time fav. Breakfast dish) but since I have had it before, thought I'd try something new.  My breakfast was better than average, but I think the omelet was lacking a certain amount of pizzazz.  Tom's omelet was better, he had the Italian omelet.  Our friends had the Breakfast sandy (which is what I will get next time, it was soooooo D-LISH) & the Sonoma scramble, which was a close second for flavor (anything with goat cheese & prosciutto can't be bad).  Unfortunately, the prosciutto was cut like ham & for those prosciutto lovers; you know that's real bad!We also all added on the endless mimosas for $7.  They really were endless & we ended up leaving our meal a tad tipsy which I'm sure impressed the Sunday church goers who were dining there as well.  The waitress was sure that our glasses were never empty (boy, I'm glad we walked here). All the meals were less than nine bucks & we were all very satisfied!  Overall, I've had better breakfast at other places, but not for that price with endless mimosas!  We will most definitely be back & there was talk of making it our 'regular' place!
<review# 859,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2007,12/25/2007,164,248,5,17,11>This review is for the surgery department.Last spring my then 8 year old had to have a surgery. It was relatively minor, as far as surgeries go, but as all parents know, the thought of putting your kid under general anesthesia is terrifying.The staff was so nice and reassuring. There is a lady whose job it is to talk to the kids before surgery and show them how the IV will be inserted, etc. She was not a nurse or social worker, but had been well trained in how to talk to kids about all that scary stuff. They also used a topical numbing cream before inserting the IV, so it really wasn't too bad. When they got ready to wheel him into the OR, I was so afraid that he would cry. If he cried, I would have lost it, but I think the calm manner of the staff kept him calm, and he gave a casual wave as he went through the doors. The surgery went well, and the staff in the recovery room was nice too. All in all, it was so non-traumatizing that my son says he would be happy to have another surgery if it allowed him to miss school for the day.

According to Kevin, the owner, they have gotten a lot more people walking in to sell record collections simply because having a parking lot makes it easier to bring in crates of records. So far, though, they still have to inform customers where they are to get them to come in and buy records.The records...oh, the records! There's vinyl, there are a few CDs, in genres too many to mention and at various price points, and there are also DVDs, for rent or for purchase. The rental section is not your corner video store, but rather they focus on obscure foreign films, midnight movies, horror and classic cult films. They don't have the latest Hollywood hits, but they have plenty of Kenneth Anger, Jodorowsky, Shaw Brothers, and other film-nerd satisfaction. Beats the hell out of Blockbuster.The former Tower site is now occupied by three separate businesses that sell basically the same thing that Tower used to--videos, books and records--but in new forms. A fitting role for the neighborhood, and enough stuff in a small space to keep the desire for multiple media well-satisfied.

Well that & the fact that they deliver and I have been swamped with midterms. We ordered Orange chicken, general tao's chicken, and spilt a thing of chow mein. 15-20 minutes later I could smell my orange chicken making it's way up my walkway and ringing my doorbell (the guy rang the doorbell, not the orange chicken)The food was delicious and the portion size was huge! (We had leftovers for lunch the next day, yum!) The price was great & the delivery guy was super nice. I will definitely be ordering from this place again.UPDATE: I took away some stars... It's really a hit or miss. The first two times we got it, it was great. But then, last nights... ehhh. The chow mein tasted dirty and the sauces tasted off too. It was a disappointment. I think I'm going to start trekking back on the other side of town and go to my usual Shanghai Garden.
<review# 868,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2007,12/14/2007,1,22,1,7,5>I finally got to have dinner at Ella last night and was curious after reading the mixed reviews on this site.  I was very pleased with every dish ordered.  There were two of us, and based on our server's recommendation, we ordered two small plates, a salad, an entree and a dessert.SMALL PLATES:  We ended up with the short ribs that were to die for and so tender you don't even need a knife to cut it.  It was accompanied by some root vegetables and a little bit of mashed potatoes.  The other plate was the gnocchi with broccolini and prosciutto in a cream sauce.  There were about ten gnocchi, in a delicious rich sauce with shaved parmesan on top.SALAD:  After reading the reviews, how could we not try the heirloom tomato salad.  Like everyone else, it was disappointing that for $9.50 you only got half of a tomato.  But that tomato with the burrata cheese was outstanding.  YUM!ENTREE:  We were on the fence between the halibut and the chicken and the server recommended the chicken.  It was prepared beautifully with what I would call a deconstructed stuffing.  It came with onions and bread crumbs that were soaked in the sauce.  Although chicken is not what I would typically order, this dish was well worth it.  I wish I could do this at home!DESSERT:  How could we not try a dessert?  My eye immediately caught went to the french toast.   French toast on a dessert menu?  I've never seen that, so we couldn't resist.  Four small slices of brioche french toast were topped in syrup, with a side of homemade coffee ice cream.  Along with coffee, it was a wonderful way to end the meal.I was a little worried about the price after reading reviews, but with a bottle of wine, we managed to get out of there for $135 (including a 20% tip for the great service).I highly recommend this restaurant.  The small plates allow you to taste many of their great menu options.  I can't wait to go back and try more.
<review# 869,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2014,5/2/2014,146,90,16,23,25>Dear Chef Evan, if you are reading this review then I must admit that my last meal on earth would have to be any of your breakfast items. Seriously, I don't know how a kitchen could well exceed my expectations but "Evan's Kitchen" does just that. I came here around 9:50am on the morning of Saturday February 1st, 2014. The weather was sunny, delightful and the perfect atmosphere as I join a wonderful group of 20+ Yelp buddies to indulge in a hearty breakfast.'Evan's Kitchen" is located in the ever-popular 57th Street Antique Row in East Sacramento. Here you will find a variety of businesses that include a salon, a fitness center, an antique store, and many many more stores and gift shops. But the main reason why I come here is to eat a hearty cholesterol-laden, sodium-induced breakfast at "Evan's Kitchen". Parking can be very tricky especially if you arrive after 10am and on a weekend day. Fortunately, I was able to snag a spot within 50 feet of the restaurant.As soon as I walked in, every table was literally packed to capacity. And my good friend (and fellow Yelper) Devo S. was able to reserve four tables to accommodate our very large group. This was a very tricky feat to accomplish considering how small the restaurant is. But after a well-planned talk with one of the managers by the name of Alex, he was able to work wonders and made this big 22-person reservation come to life! The interior decor is a tad bit on the tacky side but it has a nice character and charm which reminds me of eating a homemade meal and being at grandmas house.Now I am no stranger to "Evan's Kitchen"; in fact I've eaten here at least a dozen times since moving to Sacramento over a decade ago. I'm very fond of their popular artery-clogging "Biscuits & Gravy" (which I've never had before until today) as well as their standard eggs Benedict platters that satisfies even the most hungriest patron. Since I was in a great mood with great company, I figured why not order a mimosa to start off my weekend? And as many others have strongly recommended, I went ahead and ordered the "Crab Cakes Benny" (for $12.50). This eggs Benedict includes two poached eggs on an English muffin complete with their homemade Hollandaise sauce. I decided to go all out and order this with home fries but you can get fresh fruit if you want a healthier alternative.As big of a group of us as there was, our meals actually come in a fairly timely manner. I did notice our other friends that were the neighboring table get their food about 15 minutes before us. No big deal as the mimosa and conversations with each of us didn't affect the time factor. And once I had one bite of my "Crab Cakes Benny" I literally felt like I died and went to heaven. This eggs Benedict was on point and absolutely delicious! The Hollandaise sauce was creamy while the crab cakes provided a nice crispiness with every satisfying bite. I literally cleaned my plate in 10 minutes flat and didn't have any leftovers. As an added bonus, fellow Yelp friend Todd G. let me sample some of his "Biscuits & Gravy". OH MY GOD!! This was one of the few things I've never eaten before but after eating a bite of this, its got to be the best damn biscuits and gravy I've ever eaten. Its creamy, sweet, fulfilling, and is an absolute masterpiece.Many of my Yelp friends all had different meals and each and every one of them said they absolutely loved the food here. I think most breakfast joints should keep it simple and deliver hearty-greasy spoon food the way "Evan's Kitchen" does. And they have much, much more than just breakfast. Their menu offers a wide variety of burgers, sandwiches, pastas, salads, and soups for lunch. And steaks, meatloaf, seafood, and pastas for dinner. But if you want to dine here on a Monday, you're out of luck since that's the only day they're not open.Overall, I will continue to support Chef Evan Elsberry for delivering some of the best food that Sacramento has to offer. As long as they keep making delicious and hearty entrees, I will keep coming back again and again. And many of my close Yelp friends (who have never dined here before until 2/1/14) even said they will be back here again when its not as loud and crazy. So there you have it, a 5-star rating for an absolute amazing 5-star restaurant!
<review# 870,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2014,5/1/2014,209,356,14,24,21>My paycheck was burning a hole in my pocket, so I finally dragged my boyfriend and a friend to Iron for dinner last week. I'm so glad I did.I wasn't really sure what to expect, but it was simultaneously nicer and more casual than I thought it would be. It was comfortable without being too pretentious and the tables aren't too close together. It's nice to have some space.The waiters were flawless the entire time - attentive, friendly, and quick. We were seated in a large booth with plenty of room for the three of us to relax. The beignets are a wonderful reason to fill up on a bread. So addicting, and they came out still hot.I ordered the surf and turf - 4 oz medium rare steak with a lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes, and brussel sprout hash - with a PBR (just to keep it classy). My meat arrived just as I'd asked for it and the lobster tail had a great seasoning on top. I don't usually like creamy-style mashed potatoes, but these are definitely an exception. The brussel sprout hash was also delicious and I ended up almost completely clearing my plate.Throughout the meal we were checked on several times. Our bill was just shy of $100 for the three of us, with the other two ordering more than one drink, which we felt was definitely a splurge night, but worth it. While you do get quality food that justifies the prices, it is still not exactly cheap eating. I would love to come back here for a special occasion or when I have a little extra money in the future, and I definitely need to come for brunch.

Because I'm now reincorporating carbs into my diet, I decided to splurge on the French toast with quince apple and persimmon. Just divine. It was perfectly sweet, perfectly buttered, perfect perfect perfect. My only gripe is that the serving was on the small side, given the price. Eh.While we were waiting for the food to arrive, our server was telling us about all these vegan options... but I didn't find those on the menu. That really confused me. Is there a different menu for dinner or something? I was here for Sunday brunch, so maybe that's a separate menu. Who knows. The guy was unclear. Too bad. I would've preferred to eat vegan.

We decided to be adventurous and give it a shot!Walking in, the interior of this place is beautiful. Everything is nice and clean with plenty of open space. There is a great quote from Pavorotti-- the one about taking a break for food-- and the staff is super friendly and nice.Onto the food:We started out with the ricotta gnocci which was just ok; your standard gnocci dish in a spicy pomodoro sauce.However, the real winner was the fresh bread that comes with your meal. It comes with this olive oil/balsamic dipping sauce, and it is just to die for.Then, we moved on to the salads. A "small" salad is actually pretty decently sized, so if you are looking for a little green before your pasta, a large salad would be overkill.Now for the main event-- the Pasta. We ordered the basil tortellini, chicken and roasted tomato spaghetti, and  chicken parmigiana. Let me start off by saying that the actual noodles were some of the best I have ever had. Truly exceptional, we asked the waiter about them and she said that they were all hand made in the restaurant daily-- Wow.Basil Tortellini-- great sauce decently strong basil flavor, but not overpowering. I would have loved to see some pinenuts thrown in here. However, the Tortellini was undercooked as the edges were still hard.Chicken Parmigiana-- Chicken was excellently cooked with a nice breaded exterior. Noodles came in a non spicy pomodoro and there were some green beans on the side. No complaints here!Chicken and Roasted Tomato-- This was the real winner. It came with a bunch of gorgonzola and pine nuts, which was exactly what I wanted. Chicken was a bit dry, but if eaten with the chunks of gorgonzola became very tasty. Every bite of spaghetti and bits of roasted tomato and pine nuts which gave and excellent flavor profile over a garlic butter sauce. MmmmmFor dessert, we had the lemon mouse, which was heavenly and the pistachio gelato, which was more pistachio, less gelato.All in all, Aria was a solid dining experience. Think of it as Paseano's older, better looking sister.
<review# 874,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2014,4/27/2014,262,283,8,15,13>Was in the Marketplace vicinity to check out how bad the line was for Yogurtland's free froyo after work; that line was way too long of a wait for me. However, in circling the lot for a parking space, I noticed the sign lit up for Krush Burger right next door! I'd only heard about Krush in its SactoMoFo context and hadn't had a chance to try it at Food Truck Mania events - so this was serendipitous! Turns out it was officially its first day open, soft opening was over the weekend.I opted to go for the two minis + tots + drink combo to share with Ani T. while she tried another flavor mini burger a la carte.  Mine:  Cowbell (smoked Gouda, bacon, crispy onions, BBQ sauce), Pacific Coaster (parm-crusted crab, pea shoots/microgreens, tomato, lemon caper aioli). Hers: Ninja (Korean shortribs, Asian slaw, sriracha), fountain drink (similar fancy machines as in the South Davis Dos Coyotes, times two).  Ours: Sweet potato tater tots with the ancho honey dipping sauce. Verdict:  The Cowbell burger was on point, how can a BBQ bacon cheeseburger go wrong? The Pacific Coaster cost a little more (seafood, duh) but I'm sure Spongebob would approve of this California version of Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty. The tomato slice did make it a little slippery to grab hold of (and some precarious first bites) but the crab was fresh. One tiny piece of crabshell was easily forgivable. I didn't try the Ninja personally but it was spicy and the size satisfying. The sweet potato tots were salted and came out piping hot. The inner sweetness was cut well with the ancho honey sauce and there was definitely a big enough serving to share between two people. I'm not a huge beer fan, but they do carry Angry Orchard in Crisp Apple! Also a variety of shakes looked good too. Davis surely is transforming into a mini version of greater Sacramento, what with Burgers and Brew, Mikuni, Paesanos, De Vere's, Uncle Vito's, Crepeville, Sushi Unlimited, Jack's Urban Eats, and now Krush. They may be chains, but at least they stay local.
<review# 875,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2014,4/26/2014,244,170,8,16,14>I had a little time to kill before work, so I thought I'd swing in here.  They are closed on Mondays, which is usually when I need a sugar boost, but I thought I better try them out while I had time.  There are quite a few flavors and two display cases.  I settled on a Bacon bar-nice combo of sweet maple and salty, crispy bacon.  I'm generally not a fan of maple, but this worked for me.  The second one I tried was a Blueberry-Lemon raised.  This was  a standard raised donut, with a blueberry-lemon glaze, with pieces of blueberry in the glaze.  The icing was a tad too sweet for me.  It had a nice blend of sweet and tart, but I'd have liked a little less confectioner's sugar.  If I had stronger coffee, it may have balanced things out.  All in all I paid $3.75 for two donuts.  The bacon bar was larger than my usual place and the raised was standard sized.  I don't think that was bad, but I don't buy donuts that often so I don't really know what "market value" is.  I like that they have adventurous flavors and the regular stuff we're all used to.  There's coffee anda refrigerated beverage case.  The blonde woman behind the counter  (possibly the owner?) was really nice.  She multitasked a dozen donuts for another customer and my two at the same time.   She was very welcoming and genuinely seemed nice, not the perfunctory "thanks come again" attitude that seems to be running rampant.  I'm not sure if they took note of the comments about the size of their donuts, but all of the ones I saw in the case were standard size or larger.  I'll definitely be back to try the peach fritter and check out the scones.

Me, the lover of all vegetables and hater of all meat, was shafted. It was almost to the point where I thought it was some sort of personal assault. But my bad luck turned around one day. The clouds parted in the sky and sunshine hit my face. I finally met Mother. And she is one damn good Mother! Kind of like Mother Earth meets Mother Teresa.Finally, the lettuce lovers get our own place for a change, sans gross meat. I love our veg options in Sac, but there just aren't enough of them. Sometimes I'm vegged-out on them and need a change. But, now I get to add this Big Mamma to the mix and she sure is scrumptious! Everything I've tasted has been a homerun. The veggie burger with homemade mustard was not only good the day of, but still delightful the next day for lunch. The broccoli was the best version of those little trees (as my Mother called broccoli when I was young in a attempt to make them appetizing) I've ever tasted. The most heavenly item that you cannot leave without sinking your teeth into are the brown butter cookies. My husband and I talk about them every day. I even dream about them. I could go on on and on about the food, but words will not do it justice. Your taste buds just need to go get some Motherly Love!Whether you eat meat like a caveman or not, you really should wander down K street and check out the former chef of Ella. I'm so happy you came back to Sac Chef Thiemann. We needed you!

<review# 879,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,10/31/2014,582,450,9,22,15>Two visits in 2 days... so glad I waited to review!My first visit was just okay.  Not by fault of Smack Pie but more for my lack of experience with their ordering system.  It takes a time or two to get the system down.  Creating your own pizza can be somewhat artful and takes some planning if you want to get it just right.  Your first time through the line can be a little overwhelming.  The pressure of making on-the-spot-decisions can negatively effect your pizza creating abilities.  My advice... take a minute to look over the menu so that you feel prepared for whats to come.You're going to need to choose your crust, sauce, cheese, meat (optional), toppings, and finishing drizzle.CRUST:  You start off at the beginning of the process... with the crust.  Unless you specify that you want GLUTEN-FREE ($2 more), you'll get their delicious original crust. SAUCE:  Then you choose your sauce.  Red sauce, white sauce, pesto, BBQ, buffalo sauce, olive oil.CHEESE:  Then cheese... shredded mozzarella, fresh mozzarella, Parmesan, blue cheese, feta.MEAT:  Then meat... pepperoni, spicy pepperoni, salami, Canadian bacon, Italian sausage, chopped chicken, buffalo chicken, and bacon.  TOPPINGS:  Choose your toppings... most pizza-friendly veggies, garlic, fresh basil, dates, celery, apples, and grapes.  All of the potential for an amazing pie.FINISHING DRIZZLES:  ,,,to drizzle or not to drizzle.  You can finish your pie with a drizzle of balsamic, various pestos, BBQ, different ranches, spicy buffalo...  My first visit I ordered the Classic Margherita.  The pie lacked a quantity of ingredients. Sparse pieces basil, sad and mushy tomatoes (Roma tomatoes would be a better choice), and a lack of fresh cheese.  My second visit... FANTASTIC!My second visit I was prepared.  Buffalo sauce, shredded mozzarella, blue cheese, chopped chicken, celery, red onion, and mushrooms.  Seriously fantastic!!!My pizza was crisp and delicious.  I heart was won over!Really great service, delicious pies, and a nice beer selection.  A perfect place to bring kids!  $8.95 well spent!
<review# 880,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2014,10/30/2014,161,382,11,14,9>The short: I'll admit I don't care for Chinese food, but this place is addictive!The long: So honestly Chinese food is something I generally do not eat due to health concerns. I've had friends who worked for the health dept and have said as a rule of thumb that they are without doubt the nastiest places they inspect across the board. So I usually avoid them. Then I heard over and over and over again about Frank Fat's and how it is Sacramento's oldest restaurant and it is just amazing and I had to give it a shot. So I did and WOW am I glad I did. Now this is not the typical places that used to be a Taco Bell or something that was converted into a Chinese restaurant. It's actually kind of hidden between a parking garage and some other business which I have no idea if it is open or not. So from the outside you can blink and miss it, but the inside is a different story. In fact it almost looks like something that would have been in a kung fu movie from the 80's. It is really quite cool. The service is spot on and super attentive. They are very knowledgeable about the menu and will help you make a good decision if you ask. You should know that the portions on the entrees are HUGE and you could easily split them between 3-4 people. I've been back a few times since my original visit but I can say without a doubt this is one of my favorite spots in Sactown and if you go try the salt and pepper calamari because it is a specialty and for a good reason.What works: Amazing food and attentive serviceWhat to improve: Not too much to work on here
<review# 881,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2014,10/29/2014,494,74,11,17,18>Being one of the busiest movie theaters in Sacramento, they have done a great job keeping it clean and updated. I'm a big fan of watching DVDs at home (cheapo) but if I with the treat my grandson, this is the spot. Not only is it clean and filled with many movie props, the customer service is excellent. The ticket sales windows will always let you know when they're available, even if you're not in their line. The snack bar take customer service to the top. Little things like wiping down your soda cup before handing it to you makes a world of difference. The only drawback to this theater, is beyond their control. The parking lot, flat with super anxious driver and super anxious pedestrians darting through the vehicles.
<review# 882,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2014,10/28/2014,489,900,15,24,22>Mama mia, that's-a spicy a-meatball!! Ok, not really spicy, but some of the best damn meatballs in the best damn sauce I've ever had in my life. What the hell took me so long to try this place? Oh, right, SacTown has 487 different pizza places from which to choose...luckily for me, I was wise to purchase an Amazon Local deal back in January for Masullo, so I HAD to try it, and before my deal expired on July 8. So, along with Brian B and Holly M (unfortunately, Todd, Donovan, and Claudia had to drop out), we set up a "date" to try this place. Actually, qualify that: it was MY first time there, but they had already been there. Whilst waiting for our table (yeah the place is small, but turnover is decently paced), Nick and Priya (who, like me, had never been to Masullo before) just happened to show up so our party of six that dwindled down to three became five, and then Scott decided to swing by...a lively and lovely party of six!I had to get the meatballs, which were even better than they looked. $12 for three, and worth every penny. Enough delightful sauce left over to sop up with bread or pizza crust...soooooo good!ALL the pizzas looked great; I went with the basics; pepperoni (aka, the American on their menu). I loves me some thin-crust pizza, and this was as thin as it gets. Some of my fave pizza EVER. $13.50Wasn't gonna order any dessert because Scott swore he was too full, but then Holly went and ordered a bowl of the Italian cherry ice cream, and Scott saw that and said "Ooh, that looks good...I'll get some if you split it with me." Dude, don't have to twist my arm! Plus, Johnna S had written this stuff up like it was the best thing since sliced bread, so I really just HAD to try it. OMG, she was right...the cherries are so tart, but totally balanced by the vanilla ice cream...pucker up, buttercup! I think we may take a trip down to Vic's some time today to indulge in this delight... or come home with a whole gallon of this tart-cherry delight, tear off the lid, grab two spoons, and eat it all right out of the container while watching a "House of Cards" marathon (three episodes left of Season 2).Anyway, Masullo is as good as my Yelp buddies Johnna S, Todd G, and Diana C, and Clay W proclaimed...if you haven't tried this Land Park gem, do yourself a favor and do so. I'm sooo glad we finally did!! :)
<review# 883,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/15/2014,10/27/2014,346,105,14,20,17>Ella is my go-to place when people ask for recommendations...for a special date, business lunches, happy hour.  On the corner of K and 12th, the place is elegant with floor to ceiling windows and lush cream drapes, dark hardwood floors, rustic hightop long tables in the bar area, gorgeous lighting, and intimate seatings in the rest of the restaurant.  The kitchen is open to view and adds a rustic yet elegant touch, since the chefs and sou chefs are professional, understated, and very well mannered.  There is valet parking for those that don't want to brave the street meters, and garages close by.  After Ella, take a walk along K street mall and explore the new restaurants in the area, the wine bars, and take in some people-watching.  We have had the dubious pleasure of watching the zombie hordes stagger by on their route around town (Second Saturday Art Walk), as well as well dressed families stroll around on their way to a theatre performance.My last visit there was as pleasurable as my first, which says a lot, given that service can be spotty at so many restaurants.  The high standards of Randall Selland come through loud and clear, stopping just shy of stuffy.  We got there right as the doors opened on Saturday evening, at 5:30 and were given the option of sitting in the main restaurant or at the bar.  I chose to sit at the long hightop tables in the bar area, since we were dressed pretty casually.  The servers brought over water right away and unfolded napkins for us, black for me since I was wearing a black dress, and white for Nick, since he was wearing grey.  Thoughtful...I see this so rarely these days.We had the bourbon cocktails to start, and the cheese plate.  Nick professes to hate blue cheese, but somehow, every time he's with me, he eats a great blue cheese.  The West west blue was divine, with honeycomb on bread, as was the Nincasio, a delicious bay area cheese.  We shared the chilled corn soup with grilled rock shrimp...so incredible, Nick asked for more shrimp.  The manager brought some over and explained the cooking style to us.  He was very pleasant, and made one more appearance later to inform me that the bacon monkey bread with the bourbon walnut ice cream had bacon all the way through the bread, not just sprinkled on top as we had imagined.  Our server, Stephanie, was wonderful, the perfect balance of professional and friendly, checking up on us, but keeping her distance, making recommendations, and on one occasion, gently but firmly telling me to trust the pastry chef when I wanted to substitute the walnut bourbon ice cream from one dessert for what I considered a bad choice: corn ice cream.  I'm glad I listened to Stephanie, my dessert was phenomenal: a blackberry cobbler with corn ice cream.  Our meal was light yet filling, and came in under $70.  A nice and affordable treat at a great restaurant.

It's a perfect addition to a neighborhood that needed a little sprucing up with more restaurant and food choices. So here it is, and guess what? It's really good!I had the opportunity to come to Sammy's for a Yelp Event and had the best time! It has a huge wraparound bar with TV's which I loved and plenty of tables and comfy booths. Our server Chelsea was fantastic! She offered up many helpful suggestions and was very patient and attentive with us. She also was very knowledgable about the menu and was able to answer all questions.For Vegetarians and Vegans, the menu offers up many different selections which is a nice breath of fresh air compared to the one or two options we are used to. Yay! I was able to try the Vegetable Fried Rice, Mushroom Pizza, Baba Ghanoush, Mediterranean Dip Sampler and Walnut and Fig Salad. My favorites were definitely the Baba Ghanoush and the Mushroom Pizza. So crispy and flaky was the crust on the pizza and the Baba Ghanoush had SO much flavor! The only thing I didn't like was the Vegan Margherita Pizza because it was dry and the crust was like bread, not crispy at all.For the meat eaters at the table, the Coconut Shrimp appetizer got high marks and was quickly eaten up as well as the Pork Pot Stickers and the Hot Stone. The definite favorite of the evening was with no doubt the Lamb Shank. Everyone at the table couldn't stop raving about it and it don't last more than a few minutes before it was gone.For dessert we ordered the Messy Sundae and the Mini Donuts which our server Chelsea let us know were roasted, not fried. How cool! I definitely loved the donuts (but when don't I?) and the chocolate and strawberry sauces they came with. The sundae was good too, just not as good as it looked.I would definitely come back to eat and drink at Sammy's again... Hopefully soon! What a welcome addition to the neighborhood.
<review# 885,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/19/2014,10/25/2014,574,469,25,27,21>I have this theory about shopping. If you are shopping-FORANYTHING-and the crowd you're shopping among resembles that which you may find yourself among at the DMV and/or Divorce Court, behold, friends: You have struck solid shopping gold. Once you start feeling like you might catch something you don't want, it's time to cash in. Everybody from everywhere is here for a reason!This is how I found myself shopping here at World Class Textile a few months back, when I proclaimed to the Yelp masses in a tip: "I think this is my favorite place in the world." I mean this place is a fucking treasure trove of damned textiles. If you can't find it here, it's time for a trip to San Francisco or New York. And we aren't talking quilt blocks. We are talking ROLLS and ROLLS of very VERY competitively priced textiles for real clothes of quality GOOD to EXCELLENT. I have waited, you see, to review WCT to see how well the garments hold up, because I don't want to feed you bad information.I also wasn't sure how to proceed with the review, in general, admittedly, because I didn't want to sound like an asshole, as Anthony Bourdain does in his wildly popular CNN show, "Parts Unknown," traipsing through the Third World eating and drinking to his heart's delight, and then, once satiated, commenting on local culture and tradition from a place of privilege. Indeed. No offense, Tony, but you're kind of a dick.That said, I must be kind of a dick too, because when I am telling you how great this place is, I cannot seem to evade the elephant in the room: which is their OFF-THE-HOOK customer base and the effortless way in which the gentlemen running this show handle these wild fabric-loving women. It is actually entertaining after you get over the initial horror of it all.The first two times I came, I purchased nothing. I could not stomach waiting the first time, as the woman ahead of me called several different credit card companies to approve a gigantic (not to mention, already cut) purchase. I had to pick up my daughter, and I could not wait for 45 minutes. The second time, I had another woman literally "handle" me, as she followed me throughout the store, commenting in another language on everything I looked at or touched. The only words I recognized were "sad" and "ugly." So I took off. What can I say? Black is my favorite color. (Haha)The third time I bought about 14 different types of fabric. I have since been back a few times, and I have yet to be disappointed. I recently bought upholstery fabric here. I have received many compliments on my reupholstered furniture. The upholstery section is, however, a bit lacking, which I understand, as this isn't your 16-plus-dollar-a-yard crowd. At all. (And 16$ for a linen-blend is a STEAL, btw.)Everything else is incredibly affordable and well-cut. And the staff could not be nicer. They cut pretty fairly. Their serger thread is cheap as hell. They don't have many notions AT ALL. So go get that somewhere else. Meissner's on Arden has everything you need for your machines and for your prep work. This is pretty much insane amounts of fabric and serger thread only. Definitely WORTH A LOOK IF YOU SEW!

Eating outside is definitely in my future.  I tested their latte and soon I'll go straight coffee to really enjoy the barebones of the beans! I accompanied my latte with a delicious PRAGEL! Have you heard of this? It's made from pretzel dough and it's rolled into a bagel shape, slathered in herb cream cheese. What?!?

I chose a pork, bean, and cheese pupusa and also loroco one. I mostly just tasted  the good amount of cheese in the loroco one (saw some green particles), but it was fresh tasting and satisfying. The pork, bean, and, cheese one was tasty as well and pretty beanyI also got a fried yucca with chicharon appetizer ($6.75). How can you pass that up? I'm not familiar with Salvadorian style chicharon. Flavor was present, but it seemed on the dry, extra crispy side.Inevitably a Mex/Salvadorian restaurant on Northgate has to be compared to La Flor De Michoacan (crazy delicious).  La Haci's pupusas stand up nicely. I've had tangier curtido, but the salsa was great and took care of the zing you want on pupusa. Service was super fast too, not a surprise with sparse customers (it's new). Plenty of interesting items are on the menu including several more pupusa choices, plaintains, Salvadorian soups, Mex items, and dinner plates.  Mexican folks were in there eating Mexican items which is saying something since there are a million choices on Northgate. I declare it work checking out.  Tucked away in the DD's shopping center parking lot is where you'll find it.  FIIIIIRST

I GUESS I should mention the kick ass ride a few of us lucky ones arrived in.  Our Rockstar transportation provided us some VIP treatment, where we arrived in style (and to some great tunes thanks to the iPod connection).  And nothing says a classy wine event like a pole dancing fight between myself and Michelangelo. Yes, it got REAL up in that van! Real sexy, that is. Scribner offered yummy tastings of their wines.  I enjoyed the Pinot so much, I bought myself a bottle. The desert wine was really refreshing and my +1 bought a bottle of that too! I wish I followed the leads of others and opened my bottle there with a selection of their goat cheeses and crackers for purchase.  There were some beautiful spots to sit and waste the day away. Music by Dinorah only added to this dream like environment. Her voice is heavenly!But forget the goat cheese and crackers, there was beef brisket bite things. It's a technical term, look it up.  Whole Foods provided light, refreshing, healthy food choices that complimented the wine selections.  And you know what complimented those healthy selections?  BACON MAPLE CUPCAKES. Yes, real slices of salty bacon topped on a creamy bed of frosting. It's like a food sexual innuendo! Mama like.I'm sure I would have liked the Chiropractor services as well, but I didn't get a chance to test it out.  They were a pleasure to speak with, however, and I love my flashy ring!All in all, I left here flushed with sun and liquor.  Not only did I enjoy myself, my +1 really was impressed.  Another stellar event by Alex and the Yelp crew!
<review# 890,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2011,10/6/2011,48,252,15,51,46>When the Java Café closed here, I hoped that a French or Italian bistro would soon take its place. After a seemingly long wait, my prayers have been answered. The admirable result is Fabian's Italian Bistro. Located in a block of shops at Fair Oaks Blvd and Madison Ave, Fabian's is a rebirth of casual dining for the local community. On the night of our visit (the fourth night after the opening) there was a lively crowd. It was a soft open, but the congenial staff already had a good handle on the place. The noise level was energetic but not loud. The beer and wine list is well-chosen and affordable. This is no spaghetti house, but the chef does offer inventive takes on lasagna and mac & cheese. The menu is tilted toward well crafted Italian street vendor favorites - sandwiches, pizzettes and a selection of panini (grilled sandwiches). My initial dish was a delicate yet spicy sausage and peppers sandwich. It was good and reminiscent of those found in any big city Little Italy. Fabian's promises to be a neighborhood gem that any neighborhood would be lucky to claim. (Update: it turned out I was right. Fabians is a great place with solidly delicious food.)

I was impressed by the super friendly staff and I loved that they were fully stocked on the entire line of Bumble and Bumble products.  Fast forward to my appointment.  I was scheduled with Janelle at 5:30pm.  First and foremost, she was on time and didn't keep me waiting past my appointment time, which was very much appreciated!  She already knew what I was in there for, and was very detailed and listened to everything I had to say.  I had mentioned to her that I was wanting my hair to grow out a bit, and that's why I was there only for a bang trim.  She did an awesome job with my bangs and took her time making sure it was perfect.  Also, I know this might sound weird, but I love how she broke the ice talking about her 4th of July trip.  She seemed very comfortable with me, and vice versa, I felt very comfortable with her.  My trim only cost $10.00, not including tip, and she mentioned to me that now that I'm a client, my bang maintenance trims will be free from now on.  I do intend on making Janelle my go-to hair girl from here on out! Needless to say I'm a fan and will be back!

He loves it so much we had to take a tour of the museum every day of the Gold Rush Days (because they so kindly let everyone in for free then). When you first enter there is a train engine and it looks pretty cool... then some model trains (the kids can make one go with the push of a button)... then round the corner and, as my son put it, "Whoa!!" The exhibits are so beautiful and well done. Even a non-train enthusiast will dig it. There are several cars and engines that you can get up close to and inspect or look through the windows or even board. Some of these old trains are truly a work of art and will appeal to your inner steampunk or period history buff. Upstairs there are model trains and even some more cars! How'd they do that? There is also a play area for the little kids who are itching to get their hands on some toy trains after being subjected to all of the untouchables behind glass. The docents are generally friendly and will answer your questions and lend an ear to the train nerds who are dying for someone to chat with. And they don't give the kids stink eye!

Struck with the hand of god I found it only fitting to aid in his release of woe, for thy brotherins constipation was growing.

<review# 894,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2011,10/2/2011,432,335,17,12,13>There is only one reason my husband will dare to wake me so early on a Sunday morn: Farmer's Market. He says the produce prices are a steal in comparison to the supermarket, so I begrudgingly oblige. Grrrr! I like to spend my Sundays sleeping in my luxurious bed until noon, so on these occasions he'll bribe me with the promise a visit to my favorite coffee shop first (only a few blocks away). Ahhh, much better. Fully awake and caffeinated we make our way over. Holy Mutha of Muthas. This place is jumpin jumpin! I'm not a fan of crowds and this market gets pretty crowded with midtowners, downtowners, mothers with children, young families, old pushy Asian woman (yeah, I SAID IT), etc. The chaos starts bright and early at 8:00 a.m. and ends around 12:00 p.m. under the W/X freeway - every Sunday throughout the year. If you time your arrival just right, you'll catch a glimpse of Mayor KJ and his fiancee (flanked by the MIB). He smiles and waves, greets the common people. Anyway...there are endless vendor tables selling almost everything from fresh seafood and meat, lovely flowers, colorful fruits (we love Ramos farms) and veggies, bread, bakery items, olive oil, lavender (check out the picture of him in a field of lavender - shirt off hahaha), nuts... Speaking of nuts...just on the outskirts of the market there are a few preaching about the "End of the World" and "Christianity" and such...so beware.After awhile, I tire of fighting my way through the crowds so I find a relatively quiet spot to kick up my heels and people watch. Yep, this place sure has character!

I'd intended to try Shine long ago after reading how  unpretentious it is.The vibe reminded me of Mondo Bizarro (formerly Butch N' Nellie's) or that lovely Natomas gem, Maestro. Basically, feel free to come in and sit for hours.Mid-morning weekday service was slightly green, not exactly seasoned baristas. It was dead except for me and one other guy who looked like he'd probably heard someone yell "Last Call!" just a few hours earlier (not that there's anything wrong with that ;) Needless to say, the servers were probably bored out of their craniums, so I think I'll cut them a little slack.The seating area is loaded with cushy, comfy, CLEAN seating. Several racks were loaded with magazines, newspapers and books. Found quite a few back issues of the surprisingly well-written Midtown Monthly, a local free mag that's quickly becoming a favorite of mine.The spinner rack filled with beautiful photography turned into blank greeting cards was a nice surprise. At only $3 each, I'll take those over a sappy pre-written Hallmark any day. Coffee was great!
<review# 896,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2011,9/30/2011,257,251,4,12,10>Our breakfast this past Saturday was simply AMAZING.I love dining at places where the chefs focus on making each dish fabulous, instead of just churning out mediocre plates one after the other as though it were a factory assembly line.  You can see and taste the effort that these guys put into their food.  $60 is expensive for 2 people to have brunch, but it's worth EVERY SINGLE PENNY.  These days a lot of people equate a good restaurant as having huge plates heaped with meh-average food for cheap.  If that's what you want, go back to Denny's.  The dishes here are not like that.  They have, IMHO, perfect proportions of delicious and filling food.We started with the bottomless mimosas, which are made with Spanish Cava and Odwala Orange Juice.  They tasted better than any other place we've had downtown, that's for damn sure!I ordered the Poblano-Cheddar Biscuits with Country Sausage Gravy, and my boyfriend ordered the pork hash dish.  The biscuits were dense and had a little kick to them- so, so, so good.  I'm a bit of a gravy snob, and Tulí's was yummy.  I got a few bites of my man's dish, and oh man.. that pork hash was so GD tasty!  If you like hash, get it.  If you don't know if you like hash, get it!I also have to rate the service, which was truly top notch.  Our server was extremely sweet and quick.  I loved that the chefs want to know how everything was before you leave.  I'm hoping the one I talked to understood what I was mumbling in my post-foodgasm.So far I've had brunch and lunch here and both were outstanding.  I have heard that dinner is where it's at, and if that's the case I'm not sure I can handle the goodness!Our experience here really started the weekend off in a most fantastic way.  Thank you!!Ps.  My bf loves you Tulí for cooking his eggs the way he loves them.  He was thrilled and commented more than once about how almost every other place messes them up, but you guys did it perfectly.
<review# 897,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2011,9/29/2011,93,72,12,11,13>This is the first time I've Yelped about something other than a dining experience but it occurred to me, I suppose even before my stylist brought up some good points, that  a salon is somewhat of an experience as well.  While I joked that I may only give zero stars, then assured him that it doesn't matter since I only write about restaurants, he said something along the lines of If you use the website, you write reviews, you should review our place too. Or something like that.  I was probably drunk.  After which I repliedFuck you.Or maybe I said "good point" I can't remember. I just moved to Sac so finding a new salon was priority number 783 which I got to eventually.  Magic Salon is open and welcoming, each station adorned with cartoon personalities, pink Christmas lights, stickers, a line up of PEZ dispensers or better, a Scott Pilgrim sticker.  In essence, it's totally hipster without really being hipster, mostly it's just genuinely cool.  From the purple ceiling fans, to the zine I got to read while my hair dried, to the fact that my hair stylist played Weezer's Pinkerton during my haircut simply because we were talking about it.My stylist was Casey, a long haired, musician with a Weezer t-shirt and a strong affinity for the Smashing Pumpkins.  I did an all over color, an awesome fucking red that actually looks kind of burgundy in the sun, straight bangs, and some layers in the back.  I adore the new style and he seemed quick, efficient, creative and easy going.  My hair has great bounce and shine, my bangs look great, the color is perfect and the conversation was delightfully filled with horrible jokes and friendly exchanges about live shows, music, and... ahem... the Smashing Pumpkins... gross, Casey, gross. Despite this, I will certainly be back for the quality, affordable cuts (100 bucks for all over color and full cut) and interesting folks.  Ever since my awesome haircut I'm feeling FRAIL AND BEDAZZLED.

<review# 898,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/15/2011,9/28/2011,474,133,35,36,37>This was my third time eating at a Five Guys and the first time at this location. On my third time I am starting to think it isn't quite as great as I initially thought on my first and even second visit, but it is still very much a heavy weight contender. Everything about the burger from the flavor of the meat to the bun to the toppings and sauces you choose for yourself are great. One last note on the burger, I go with the single patty and that is all the meat I need. The two patty burger would probably be too much even for a rabid burger eating carnivore such as myself. As for the fries, who doesn't like home style, just a little bit of skin left on, cooked in peanut oil fries. There is nothing worse than finishing your meal and wishing you had just two or three more fries. This probably will not happen to you here. Even the small fry is overflowing and with the the single patty burger, is way more food than I have ever been able to completely finish. In fact I was thinking that if for some reason I were to find myself homeless and hungry that I would probably hang out around a Five Guys because people are bound to have fries left over. I do not understand why this place continues to get comparisons to In-N-Out and why some people feel that this so called East Coast institution is a threat to their West Coast way of life and their sacred West Coast institution. I give In-N-Out their due and will say they're definitely getting it done in the fast food burger market, but they're not playing the same game as Five Guys. Five Guys does not have a drive though and probably could not prepare their food fast enough to sustain one. You have to order at the counter and you might as well get your real seat because it is going to be 5 or 10 minutes before your food is ready. These places are not in the same price point either. Solo I can skate out of In-N-Out somewhere around the $5 range and Five Guys is going to be double that. What do I get for double the money you ask? I get a bigger burger with more meat, a higher quality bun, way more fries and overall more of a restaurant style meal rather than a fast food one. To me the comparison of In-N-Out and Five Guys stops at the fact that they both sell burgers and fries.

It is industrial yet cozy inside. You can see the entire kitchen and Jaymes carefully makes your sandwiches just right while as you wait.They have some cute cartoon-y art on the walls, butcher paper on the tables (with crayons to draw) and get bonus points for the Simpsons chess board. There is plenty of seating inside to eat, play chess, and chat with a friend. If you have to leave, Jaymes will wrap your sammies in tin foil.We had 2 sandwiches, which were both fantastic. Jaymes has a knack for combining flavors together that really compliment each other. One was a roast pork, persimmon and goat cheese, and the other was ham, brie, and apple butter. Both were excellent and although they may seem pricey, it's totally worth it.
<review# 902,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2009,2/6/2010,149,559,8,10,10>This place is the Jameson whiskey of Chinese food. It's not fancy, but the food is delicious every time, and its an exceptional value. Don't order a Jameson if you want a cosmopolitan (God forgive you) or a cucumber gimlet with organic tarragon. New Station offers an extensive menu of old school Chinese food: straight up, no chaser.You will get worse Chinese food for more money at most restaurants (I challenge anyone to find a good Hong Kong Style chow mein priced less anywhere in California) . If you're looking for spicy salt squid, beef in a clay pot, pork spare ribs - classic Chinese fare (or something entirely new - the menu is 8 pages) - this is a great spot.They are also open until midnight , even on Sunday. The service is friendly and attentive for the most part. They can be a bit slow on  water and tea refills sometimes. Servers also put up with a lot of crap from assorted Broadway riff raff and obnoxious customers. That crap would put you in a  bad mood, too. Anyway, this place never disappoints, if you just want some good food at a good price. If you're looking for something fancier, there are a lot of options elsewhere.

I called a few furniture stores including Big Al's. They said they had a couple of gliding rockers available. When I entered the store was I greeted by a ganster called Big Al? Actually no, it was a short, squat man with a name I soon forgot. Lets call him Hector. He quoted me two prices for the two rockers. I made him an offer he couldn't refuse. He would have been off his rocker to not accept it!And now my wife has a gliding rocker to rock the baby.
<review# 905,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/29/2009,2/3/2010,61,271,2,5,4>Tucked away in a mostly empty strip mall behind BJ's Brewery on Laguna Bl. is this little family-run restaurant.  Most of the business spaces nearby in the newish area are empty.   While this makes it a place of respite from the busy-ness of Laguna Blvd, I can't help but wonder how anyone would find this restaurant on their own with no nearby place to pull potential customer traffic through here. I had been here before when it was Daphne's, and I admire the changes they've made to the inside furnishings and decor.   They've done much to counter the box-y strip mall space to create a comfy environment with warm tones.   Gone were the fast-food tables with the fixed, pivoting chairs.  In their place were padded booth benches and cushy, padded chairs.  I appreciate a restaurant where everything looked clean and well-kept, even the bathrooms.Over the booth tables, the ceiling had been "dropped" to accommodate small spotlights overhead that did much to create the  warm, friendly lighting.  The paint on the dropped ceiling sections matched that of the little track lighting and "worked" for the space.  It's way too easy for an establishment to simply use the overhead flood lights illuminate the boxed space and let it go at that,nevermind the high school cafeteria feel that gives to a space.   This business owner went through some effort to make a warm-toned place to enjoy a meal.The menu has Vietnamese food in addition to west coast standbys like hamburgers, tacos, and burritos.  There were two of us there on a Sunday afternoon.  When we entered, there was only one other group dining.  However, in the course of our time there, the place got busier until half the tables were filled.The pho bowls on the menu were listed in two sizes: small and large.  The difference in size between one and the other was a mere 35 cents!We ordered a large bowl of rare beef pho and a plate of pork and vegetable spring rolls.served with peanut sauce.  Service was friendly and prompt.  The server came by to greet us warmly when we arrived.  She also checked up to see if we were enjoying our meal.  Our water glass was kept topped off,The food was served after a reasonably short time.   The soup in the pho was savory and delicious.   There's nothing like a  good, made from scratch soup base for pho on a crisp, late fall or winter's day.  The soup was flavorful and quite savory!    The noodles were perfect.There was the familiar plate of basil, bean sprouts and sliced jalapeno peppers to put into the bowl.   All were very fresh, as though just picked from the garden. There was a bottle of plum sauce and a bottle of hot chili sauce for condiments.   The spring rolls plate was generous in size.  Between it and the large pho bowl, there was enough food to fill two hungry people to the point where we had to wait and digest a bit before leaving and getting back on our bikes for the ride home.I have a feeling that I'm going to enjoy having a good Vietnamese restaurant that's local!  There's enough variety in the menu that this might become my local "goto" restaurant for when I feel like a burger, too.  I would prefer that they put in some sort of bicycle rack in front so that people out for a weekend brunch ride would have a good place to park & lock.01/04/2010 -  I stopped back here last evening for dinner and had the mi Quang special:  wide, yellow noodles in thick soup with pork ribs and grilled shrimp along with a plate of lettuce, mint, cilantro, and a targe sesame cracker to break and sprinkle on top.   ~Wonderful~ flavors!   Service was quick and friendly.   She took the time to explain all the specials and what region the dishes were from in Vietnam.I also noticed that they've added blue lighting on top of the floating ceiling on the side wall.  New plants up there, too.   Nice touches.

I always loved their grilled meats, and honestly the thing that I have been craving lately, and I think I might go back soon for is the lentil soup. Oh my god it is wonderful, it is just like my grandmother used to make right up to the fresh lemon you squeeze on top. Even when I went however the prices were pretty steep for the food that you got, and also I like rice but please do not give me enough rice to feed 10 people next to my one skinny Kebab. I love the sebze they serve. It's very similar to Turkish style. This is the plate you get at the beginning of the meal with onion, mint, basil, green onion, and feta cheese. One secrete I have to share is many people from that part of the world tend to save the mint and basil until after dinner and chew them to freshen their breath and usually eat the onion and cheese with the bread or wait and have it as a nice and tangy addition to the kabob dishes. I see I have to go again. YUPPIE!....
<review# 907,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/6/2010,1/31/2010,63,206,13,8,5>Before I get started: LOL @ the reviewer who was bitching about not finding a vegetarian option here.Here's a tip, sweetheart - when the name of the restaurant includes "BBQ" there is a really good chance that you're not going to get a lot of vegetarian food.  Complaining about that is like me going to a vegan restaurant and complaining that I couldn't get a porterhouse.I'm not a Korean BBQ expert by any stretch of the imagination, but as a novice I really enjoyed this place.All you can eat meat for under $20.00 is an excellent deal, and when I've gone the service has been quick and attentive.  The interior of the restaurant is attractive.Essentially when you order the all you can eat, you get a large pile of marinated, thin cut raw meat, which you then grill yourself on the gas grill in front of you.  The staff will also bring you an assortment of vegetable side dishes, mostly kimchi or kimchi like items, pickled, spiced or marinated veggies.The place is well lit and well ventilated, so the smoke from your grill shouldn't be a problem, and the grills are clean - in fact, they will offer you a grill change partway through the meal if the grill starts to accumulate grime as you cook.One warning: after 9:00 on Thursday they have Karaoke, which is a little annoying if you're not into that kind of thing.

There's really nothing about it that I don't like, but there's also nothing really about it that, when I want to go out, makes me immediately think of Harlow's. I really hate the fact that it's $10 to get in, regardless of who is playing or what's going on. I've NEVER seen a band there that's good enough to pay $10 for. $5 maybe... but never $10. That said, I love that the people that go to Harlow's are ready to dance. The dance floor is always full and that is ALWAYS a plus for me. Drinks are fairly cheap, and they have a great selection of beer. Racer 5 on tap? HELLS YES. But there is an extremely high douchebag to non-douchebag ratio here. I have yet to go to Harlows and not have a guy with a popped collar and blindingly white shoes hit on me. So... yeah. Harlow's can be really fun. But there's just no part of me that wants to rave about it. It is what it is. I'll go if my friends are going, but I will likely never suggest it as a potential destination.

The bartenders are so helpful and friendly. They didn't seem annoyed when I asked for samples either. I tried a gingerbread beer and a pomegranate cider. Ciders are three dollars on Sunday so I jumped on the good deal.However the gingerbread beer was amazing and would totally get it next time. It was hard to narrow it down while scrolling through the iPad that is their menu. So neat!My boyfriend got a limited release stone vanilla porter which we normally get at bevmo. It's normally amazing but fresh from a tap and it was incredible. . We got two beers for ten dollars, great service and a sunny patio to sit on. If that's not five stars then I don't know what is
<review# 910,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,8/11/2014,63,206,7,12,10>What a fantastic evening.  It's been a few years since I've been to the Waterboy.We were having a special event for a friend, tried for a 7:00 reservation on a Friday but couldn't get in until 8:00, really not unreasonable considering how popular the place is, I'm glad they actually take reservations unlike some popular places.Showed up a little early and got seated a tad early.  The meal was absolutely fantastic and the service was on point all evening.We started with the antipasto plate and anchovies, both of which were delicious.  We then moved on to the beef tartar, which was absolutely perfect.  Next we had the artichoke bruschetta, which was unlike anything I'd ever had before, fantastic.  It was topped with a perfectly constructed tomato/bean puree which I've never had anywhere previously.Our entrees were steak and two orders of the day's special, quail.  All 3 were perfectly executed, my steak was a perfect medium rare, accompanied by fried brussel sprouts and spicy arugula.  Just great. Finally for desert we had honey cake, apple crostini and lemon tart, all of which were delicious.Great, great meal.  The Waterboy should be at or near the top of any list of midtown restaurants.
<review# 911,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/24/2014,8/10/2014,132,253,6,16,7>Let's start off with the fact that I have ALWAYS wanted to try Sushirrito in SF. For a while I kept seeing my friends post pictures of sushi burritos on Instagram and was just under the notion that EVERYONE was going to SF. Well, I was wrong. Hah, and I digress as well. Also, do not be discouraged by the long stretch or residential areas you will be passing up. It's kinda out there and quite the drive. I came here at around 2:30 with another friend. The set up is similar to Chipotle (minus the whole, build it yourself ordeal).There are panels on the wall with their menu and since there was no line we took our time reading through and deciding what to get. The cashier was super nice and asked us if it was our first time and told us to ask him for help or recommendations if we needed it.I got the Sashimi burrito, my lil sis got the Yellowtail, and we ordered the Volcano nachos to share. The burritos we got range from $7-$8 while the nachos was about $6.We got our food in about 10 minutes or so? Not a bad wait time, but there was also no one else in the place minus a few folks that already had their food. The cut the burritos for you (thank God, cause I knew I couldn't finish the whole thing.) The food comes in to-go boxes when they serve you (whether you're leaving or dining in).The burrito is pretty substantial. The rice to meat ratio was actually phenomenal. I was expecting a whole bunch of rice and very little fish.However, this is essentially and oversize and glorified sushi roll (not that there's anything particularly wrong with that...)The Sashimi burrito came with salmon, tuna, shrimp tempura, little egg roll wrapper crispies, avocado, sprouts, and a whooole bunch of some wasabi sauce/cream thing. Although good, here is my gripe about the whole burrito situation. You will never get even filling distribution. You either have some sashimi and rice, some shrimp, but never everything all together. In addition, there were too many sprouts for my liking and the bottom of the burrito is open so ALL my sauce dripped down to the bottom and made a huge mess. The flavor was good, and the fish was definitely a lot more fresh than other places.Now, the volcano nachos were something I was on the fence about trying. Having read reviews I was a little skeptical. But, I am already eating a massive sushi roll, might as well. The chips are covered with a saucy concoction to replicate cheese. It's topped with ground spicy tuna and jalapenos with a scoop of avocado on the side. While interesting and tasty, I don't know if it is something I will try again. It was kinda of hard to eat overall and maybe just isn't the best food fusion.My lil sis didn't seem to have any complaints about the Yellowtail. We both only ate half and maybe about 1/5 of the nachos.  For what I paid, the portion size was definitely worth it. This might be a try once and that's enough type of deal though. I'd rather just eat normal sized sushi.TL;DR: Oversized sushi roll, but decent and fresh. Would've probably passed on the nachos if given a do-over.

I hadn't returned to give the place another chance and now I wish I had earlier.I was getting my hair done next door and I was falling asleep in the chair so I decided I needed a latte and maybe something to snack on. I headed over to Edwin's (foils in my hair and all) pretty much because it was my only option. When I walked in the owner was so incredibly friendly and helpful. I spotted a yummy looking chicken pocket in the pastry case and he offered to hear it up, place it in a handy to go box and even asked if I needed to take some silverware with me. For my caffeine fix, I decided to go with a vanilla latte and it was perfect. I am bumping this place up to 5 stars to compensate for years of my sad one star review. This place deserves it - Great service, great latte, great chicken pocket.
<review# 913,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/5/2014,8/8/2014,648,305,11,16,14>Perfection in the Pocket! Spotless store and stellar employees. Yogurt flavors are changing maybe weekly- you'll be surprised- and always a dairy free/sugar free selection. Are you kidding me with the variety of fresh fruit, more than one type of mochi, and bursting boba?! This place is IT. Self serve, pay by weight. Not in the mood for yogurt? Check out the root beer float/cone station- fabulousness.  I like to change things up, so enjoy the wide selection of super fresh toppings. If you're a frequent visitor, be sure to get a stamp card. They almost always have a BOGO coupon in Pocket News or surrounding local mags. Look for specials on Wednesdays and Fridays; there is a double stamp day, and a kid special on Fridays...Oh, and now they serve SHAVED ICE. This is truly one of our favorite spots, and I cant wait to to the monsters again!

I was astonished by the awesome decorations this place has. Moreover, the staff was overly friendly. We ordered the pancake, beef stew, and fish in oil.Pancake 4/5Its crispy and the sauce compliments the favor of the pancake.Beef Stew 3.5/5They give you a lot of food for this item. It can serve 3-4. Fish in oil 4/5THis was quite unexpected. The flavor was so different that I really enjoyed this. Eat this with rice or something because its overly oily. Overall, its a good place to try.

<review# 915,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/20/2014,8/6/2014,474,133,10,11,9>With lunch options over the last year and a half consisting of Subway #1, Subway #2, 7-Eleven, Del Taco, Round Table and for additional variety, Subway #3, a new Sandwich Spot was a welcomed sight.  The location, in what would seem like an unlikely spot, is in a small, run down and long ago forgotten strip mall on a not so appealing stretch of Kiefer Blvd.  Never mind the location though or the fact that this Sandwich Spot has bars on the windows because I am coming here for a sandwich (preferably to go) and not to hangout, drink lattes or socialize with the natives.With the rapid expansion of The Sandwich Spot and the growing popularity, I am sure most people by now know what to expect from this franchise.  You will not find anything fancy here, but you can count on a fairly extensive offering of very solid sandwich choices that are on the upper end of the mainstream sandwich market in terms of quality.  The BLT is my personal standby from any of the Sandwich Spot locations and the one from my most recent visit at this newest location met all expectations.  The bacon was crisp and the bread and vegetables were fresh.  Aside from the sandwiches and standard bags of chips, you can get a side of macaroni or potato salad.  I'm not a fan of macaroni salad in general so I will not weigh in on it, but will say that the potato salad is truly among some of the best that I have ever had.
<review# 916,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/10/2014,8/5/2014,133,338,12,14,12>Coming to Hong Kong Islander for dim sum is a refreshing change.  My family, friends, and I always go back to our standard location happy garden, and it has remained our staple for dim sum.  We've gone back for YEARS.  I hadn't been into Hong Kong Islander since I was a little kid, so I didn't know what to expect going back.  The outside is so deceptive!!! When you walk in, it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL and expansive (I walked through the front dining room into another big room where my friends were sitting already). My go to orders by which I use as my litmus test for dim sum awesomeness are:- Har Gow (shrimp dumplings)-Woo gok (panko fried taro)Both items were spot on!  Aside from being beautifully decorated, their selections are great and I was able to have things that our other staple dim sum spot never offers - as in duck, and a deep fried puffed donut with sugar- which we all shared and was very fresh and warm - our server had put in a special order for us and ran back to serve it to us as we were winding down our meal - perfect timing!  Don't think you have to speak Chinese to get special treatment here.  I was the only Chinese person at the table and my caucasian friend did all the ordering for us and we did fabulously well.I am alerting my family that we have found the ultimate dim sum spot - good selections, great service, nicely decorated, and TONS of space to be seated.
<review# 917,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/31/2014,8/4/2014,202,243,11,11,12>This punny theater is in an adorable Victorian house. Having always wanted to check out the inside of Midtown's most beautiful homes and being a big fan of both dessert and live (inexpensive) theater, I was happy to finally be able to attend a production here. I was only able to find out the schedule of shows by signing up for their e-newsletter. I don't know if there is another way. We saw "Opportunity of a Lifetime" for $10/ea one Friday in January. And well, there's a reason it only costs $10. But if you go in expecting a bunch of amateurs doing their best/having fun and a stage with close to 0 of the perks of professional theater (like lighting, staging, costumes or scenery), you'll be entertained. Plus, at intermission, you get to have as many slices of cake (Costco, I believe) as you can stomach and all the coffee/tea you want.   So, it's not a fine evening to broaden your mind with quality acts for the ages, but if you feel like supporting aspiring actors and writers and eating some cake, Thistle Dew will do you just fine.
<review# 918,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/31/2014,8/3/2014,112,134,6,9,11>This just might be the best Vietnamese restaurant on Stockton Blvd. How could I have driven here countless times and not have given them a second thought? Perhaps because the previous restaurants in this spot have been horrible. Or perhaps because of my general belief that restaurants need to specialize in something. There's Pho An Dao (go here for their Pho!), Banh Cuon Tay Ho (go here for their banh cuon!), and Quan Nem Ninh Hoa (go here for their nem!), but what is "Bon Mua" other than a pretentious sounding "Four Seasons"? When I walked in, I noticed something... different. Unlike many other restaurants on Stockton Blvd., this place is tidy, has tasteful decor, and is not terribly understaffed. When they promptly brought out the hot tea, I strangely did not feel the need to wipe down my tea cups before pouring tea. Bon Mua is one of the few restaurants to offer banh beo ($6), and they do it right here. I've only seen it at Quan Nem Ninh Hoa, and there, the dried "shrimp" isn't even shrimp! How do I know? I went with a vegetarian friend and asked them to make everything vegetarian. When their banh beo came out, it had "shrimp" on there, and when I inquired about that, they said it wasn't actually shrimp at all! Bon Mua isn't shy about showcasing the shrimp here. It's not the dry type, but fresh, with nice visible chunks. The nuoc mam was nicely sweet and not too pungent. I liked it a lot.I also tried their variation on Quan Nem Ninh Hoa's DIY spring rolls, only I tried the more elaborate combo special ($17). In addition to Ninh Hoa's grilled pork, there was also grilled chicken, chao tom (grill shrimp paste on sugar cane), and grilled beef slices wrapped around green onion. Everything was on point, and there was more than enough for two. Their sauce isn't as good as Ninh Hoa's but it's close. Basically, if you just want the grilled pork, go to Ninh Hoa, but if you want variety go to Bon Mua.Their rice plate was also very good, possibly the best in Sacramento. Everything was fresh, made well, and I was amazed on what they could put on a plate for just $8. I didn't expect much from Bon Mua, and I especially didn't expect my standards for Vietnamese restaurants to be elevated. Definitely worth a revisit--I'm hungry after writing this.
<review# 919,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2009,12/14/2009,154,299,3,5,8>So I'm a big fan of more regional style airports. You know the type - Big enough to get a couple flights from the major carriers, and service 2 or more major metro areas, but not suffer from being so huge and monstrous that it's such a hassle to use them.Well, SMF, you just won my gold star. This was my 2nd time flying to SMF via SNA (John Wayne/Orange County Airport fyi) and both times have been very wonderful. The closest I can compare this to IS SNA, so let's do a quick run down on why this beats the pants off of Good Ole John Wayne.1: Free Wifi. As someone who's eventually plugged himself into the whole networking deal, but had been studying it for years, this is a biggie. It's a great way to pass the time, do business, relay important info whilst sequestered for your eventual departure. SMF has this. SNA does not (for the general populace*)2: Clean Layout. This is a push, since SNA is pretty clean too, but it's always appreciated (Compared to Palm Springs, though, *whew*)3: Shorter Security lines. SNA deals with that whole business of, within a 5 minute window, you can either get through security in 5 minutes, or 30. Everytime I've gone through SMF, I was in and through TSA's deal within 10 minutes of entering their lines. You can't argue with that.4: Better food courts/Shops/amenities. Ok, so you are going to pay the captive audience luxury prices here, but SMF has way better selection. Golf, Mobile Entertainment, 2 sports bars, nicer restrooms, better seating... You can't beat that.That's all I have for right now, but that is more than enough to make me prefer SMF rather than SNA for a new home base (soon... soon)

I really was not too picky on what needed to be done - I just did not want my hair black any longer and I did not want to cut too much off the length.I ended up being in the salon for 3 hours but it was well worth it. I ended up having the color removed, then dyed and highlighted and I loved the outcome. I have another appointment in six weeks with Lily.I will say when they did the color removal process (i.e. bleach)  some of it leaked onto my shirt and ended up bleaching the back of my shirt. I gave them a call and told them what had happened. The person I talked to was super nice and she told me I could come and pick up cash for the shirt or they could put a credit on the account. Luckily it was an inexpensive shirt so when I told them the amount of the shirt the desk person said they would give me the price of the shirt plus an additional $10 credit on my account. That is excellent customer service in my book.

This place has Kangaroo, Buffalo, Ostrich, Elk, Wild Boar, Alligator (sometimes), ANgus... etc!!! Well, i like places that are different and this place stands out. Food is great and the prices are reasonable for what they offer. The variety here is cool too. The service, on the other hand, is hard to come by with the owner and his brother running the place. Nonetheless, they are Friendly and very talkative. I would come here in a heartbeat if I was hungry. Definitely a place I would recommend for a different taste of food.

The look and feel of the place couldn't be any different from Zelda's - new, shiny counters and bar and tables and chairs, high windows with lots of natural light, lots of friendly young folk waiting tables and slinging booze. I love Zelda's for the dark, dank old schoolness of it, but I like what Chicago Fire is offering too. We sat at a table one day and just got piss drunk drinking Peroni in tall chilled glasses and eating their delicious pizza. The thin crust margherita is really good. The pan crust sausage is also good. Surprisingly though, my favorite things on the menu are the salads. I have ordered both the Antipasto Salad and the Spinach Salad and truly cannot decide which I like more! You can order them by the plate or family style. The family style is a good deal - they give you a ton of salad for like $7. The antipasto has a heaping pile of ham and salami, a mound of fresh shaved mozzarella, pepperocinis, black olives, tomatoes and onions. Yum!All in all Chicago Fire is a great place - especially for groups. I hope they don't hurt Zelda's business too badly but in all honesty it is not a true apples to apples comparison because both restaurants bring something completely different to the table.

I've had gowns altered, jeans hemmed, zippers replaced, etc. and they always do a professional job at a fair price. Pant hemming is just $7! For BOTH legs! I know!Four Seasons is always busy and sometimes there's a short wait for a dressing room for fittings, but they're busy because they're good. Usually, it takes about a week or so to get something back unless you need it sooner. The ladies who work here are very smiley, nice and efficient. (Yes...smiley is a word!) You're in. They pin you. You're out.Word of warning though...cash only. They might take checks. Not sure because I never carry a checkbook with me anymore. But they definitely don't take credit cards. They get the job done!
<review# 927,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/7/2009,12/4/2009,148,83,,8,7>When you open the door, you're met with the smells of India: garlic, cumin, curry, and spice. Inhale. This is one of my favorite experiences of Indian cuisine. It's truly a five-sense experience. The smells. The warmth of your hand wrapped around a spicy cup of hot chai. The bright colors and patterns adorning the space. The high hum of the traditional music. And importantly, let me not forget the tastes...You can order from the menu or head straight to their expansive buffet ($14/person). I always opt for the buffet to enjoy a flavor-frenzy without end. I choose the spiciest red sauce for dipping and adding to more mellow dishes. I like all the breads, but naan is my favorite. The yeasty, warm,  chewy bites truly comfort, especially when covered in rich sauces and lentils. I love Kaveri's chana masala--a hearty, tomato and heat sauce covering tender garbanzo beans in new flavors that shoot across your mouth with every chew. I also adore their dal, another tomato-based sauce, but lighter on the heat and more subtle on the spices, yet fulfilling for its simplicity. The eggplant curry also ranks high. On this occasion, they used the small, Asian eggplants, cooked until tender with their stems still on, paired with mellow curry flavors and perfect for sopping up the heat of other spicy dishes.No Indian meal is complete without a handful of fennel seeds and sugar from the dish at the counter. This is an instant shower burst for a hot mouth. The perfect ending to a perfect meal.

<review# 929,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/22/2012,12/25/2012,642,604,12,28,20>My boyfriend and I decided to eat here for lunch during its grand opening.  The restaurant serves Pakistani and Indian style foods, which we really enjoy.   This location is probably the fourth restaurant that has opened in this building.  I hope this one will be successful, because we found the food to be top notch.  When we first entered, I noticed that the interior was clean and newly painted.  It was a slow time of day, so most of the tables were open.  There isn't much interior decorating done yet, except maybe new window curtains.   No TV or other visual interests are up yet, so the only thing to look at is the traffic on Stockton Blvd.  We had just missed out on the excitement of a traffic accident that was being cleared away.  Typical for the high speed drivers of Sacramento! We were seated right away and given menus.  Our waitress was very helpful and nice explaining some of the dishes we asked about.  Water is served in a "pour yourself" glass decanter that was room temperature.  Of all the delicious looking options available, our choices narrowed down to Prawn Masala, which is a shrimp curry cooked as a red sauce containing green peppers, onions & spices, Aloo Palak is a spinach dish that contains large chunks of potatoes and spices, Vegetable Biryani is Basmati rice mixed with lots of vegetables and saffron, and finally we tried 2 types of Naan: garlic and onion.  It took quite a while for our food to be served, but you could hear them working hard in the kitchen.  A good sign of getting freshly prepared food!  Once the dishes arrived, it looked and smelled so good.  We dug in immediately, filling our plates.  Those first bites were very reassuring that our whole meal was going to be a successful lunch.   Every dish was so flavorful and had the right amount of spices and heat.  I did notice that a lot of oil is used in the dishes, but I guess it is necessary for the recipes.  We'll see how our stomachs handle it later!  Ha! Ha! In the mean time I give it thumbs up for a quality Indian/Pakistani restaurant.  Now, it's a contender with another local Indian place we frequent!

(unless they went up recently) so they had a special for a full body massage and a foot massage for $59 so yes 2 full hours of relaxation!!  Well I was only planning on the foot massage but when I was going to pay I asked if I bought the special if I could use the hour body massage another time she said no had to be same day OH well send me back in ;)   I had enjoyed 2 full hours of relaxation on a whim! Eva Rocks!I was so relaxed when I left I didn't want to drive home just sit in the car and take a nap. Check this place out the current deal allows you to buy 10 foot massage tickets for $190 if you want to get a full body massage you just use two tickets good at all locations.  Happy Massages Everyone.

We walked our dogs here last weekend; there was just a handful of people with whom we shared the park and nearby trails.From the southwest entrance, you'll enter onto a large, flat field the dogs will want to sprint across (ours did). Along the left side is the levee and a more stagnant slough of the American River.If you want to walk along the levee or its trails, you'll find lots of interesting trees and wildlife. Do know that coyotes are present. Also, this is the post-spawning season, so your dogs may go crazy over the smells and even want to eat or roll in a dead salmon. You were warned!One mile west along the levee will take you to the La Riviera/Watt levee entrance. If you go east, you will eventually get some nice views and access points to the American River. You can jog several miles in this direction and the scenery is worth it!

The menu is typical of a Mexican Taqueria, including seafood entrees and menudo on the weekends. I ordered the fish tacos (2 for $5 or something like $3.49 each). My husband got typical carne asada and chicken tacos.The fish tacos are great! The portion of fish is fairly large and is accompanied with a lime crema dressing, pickled onions, cabbage, lime and there appeared to be a couple other things on there I can't remember. The combination of flavors were yummy and I was full after 2 tacos. If you dine in, you are treated to served chips and house salsa. Their house salsa is perfect! a perfect amount of spice, not too watery, not too thick...and lots of onion!!!!We are hardly in Lincoln, if ever.

I'm not suggesting it's cheap or overly casual, only that it strikes a perfect balance of quality bistro dining without ever feeling overpriced or pretentious. The Entrees--The flank steak is one of my favorite dishes... EVER. Seriously, we joke that it's the "emotional steak" because it will bring tears of delicious joy to your face. One caveat though, be sure to order it medium rare (or rare)... that's just my own personal steak agenda. It also comes with an au gratin potatoe side that is equally awesome. A sizable block of paper thin sliced potato and creamy heaven.  The Tapas--These are a delicious variety of upscale bites that are a fantastic deal as starters. The change from time to time, but the grilled octopus as well as the meatballs are two of my favorites.The Drinks--Nice variety of cocktail options (I love "The Girl with the Ginger Tattoo") and they are priced modestly at $8. Beer is also great here, with nice local taps and surprisingly reasonable prices ($4-5).After seeing so many restaurants come and go over the last few years, I think David English deserves some recognition for what he has accomplished here. That guy seems like one of the nicest and hardest working chefs in Sac. On every visit to his establishment I've watched as he tirelessly works the floor doing everything from cooking and prepping, to greeting guests and running food. I'm pretty confident you will share my sentiments once you give Press Bistro a try.
<review# 935,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2012,12/18/2012,209,356,15,17,14>Was driving down Fulton in search of food and noticed the giant Grand Opening!!! sign and another sign boasting giant baked potatoes. Sold. Nearly crashed my car hanging a hard right to make it into the parking lot. I don't screw around when it comes to giant baked potatoes.Eagle Bar-B-Que is located inside the International Food Market. They function out of a small counter to the right of the door, and some outdoor seating and a giant wood burning BBQ are visible as you walk in. The guy behind the counter was incredibly nice and friendly, and brought us samples of his beef brisket, lamb, and chicken. They were all amazing, but it was a brisket kind of Saturday.You can get your BBQ craving satisfied with a sandwich (they were like $6 I think), or a combo plate ($9ish) that comes with coleslaw or potato salad, baked beans, a soda, and a roll. You can also buy the beans, potatoes, and salads as side dishes. I was already salivating over the thought of a baked potato (and egged on by the skull-sized potatoes sitting on the counter) but the beef was irresistible. I managed to choke out some hella intelligent question like, "but...but can I get like, meat ON the potato?" Turns out my brisket crazed eyes had totally missed the last combo plate option - stuffed potato. He pointed it out and my response was something like a "god yes" moan. My combo plate arrived and was literally enough food for three meals. Meaning, I literally ate leftovers twice, equaling out to three meals off this one combo plate. Not bad for less than $10. The brisket was tender and just fell apart and had a great flavor. I'm actually not a huge fan of coleslaw but this stuff was good, not too goopy nor too runny. The baked beans were your standard side dish. The potato was done perfectly and wasn't all sweaty. It was piping hot and stuffed with cheese, butter, sour cream, and chives - a delicious, delicious heart attack waiting to happen. I will be back. Probably sooner than is healthy. Probably to try the ribs and get some lamb.
<review# 936,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2012,12/17/2012,291,553,5,17,10>After a nice meal at the Waterboy, for my mom's birthday, we decided to take a quick walk and look for some dessert.  We walked right past Tidbit and noticed an 'open' sign.  None of us have ever heard of it, so we decided to go in and check it out.  Turns out, it's a brand new place.  The owner said that they actually just opened today but still had some details to work out and that they are hoping to start serving food Thursday.  Even though they had already put things away and cleaned up for the night, the owner was nice enough to offer us each a scoop of sorbet, on the house!Tidbit offers several 100% non-dairy sorbet flavors: grapefruit, mango, pear, guava, passionfruit, etc.  There are a few other frozen yogurt/gelato shops in the area, but Tidbit stands out with all of these fruity flavors.  While waiting for our scoops, we took a look at the menu.  They'll be offering burgers, sandwiches, wraps, and salads during lunch.  For dinner they have entrees including cioppino, tri-tip, salmon, and chicken alfredo- all fairly priced at $8.25.  The entrees sound pretty tasty and the prices definitely seem fair.  I hope to come back to try out the food once they're up and running.
<review# 937,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/26/2012,12/16/2012,432,335,13,17,15>Estelle's is a much more sophisticated version of La Bou...no, wait...to even attempt to compare the two is already in bad taste.  Why?  Because they may seem similar, but Estelle's is on a level of it's own.Food items are prepared ahead and discarded after 4 hours.  This might bug folks that like to have their items prepared as soon as they put in an order.  Doesn't bug me though.  I've stopped in a few times for lunch and each experience has improved by leaps and bounds with each visit:    -Caprese Sandwich on a french roll for $5.75 (a little heavy on the pesto) and a pasta salad with red onions and red peppers (zingy zippy, but a smidge too much oil)-Tarte Flambé is like a French pizza w/Arugula and cherry tomatoes on top.  Hidden beneath her skirt were shrooms and a crumbly cheese (Feta? Goat?).  Portion size was twice what I expected for only $3.50.-Lunch combo for $7.25 - 1/2 tuna salad (enjoyed the addition of sweet red grapes) on a croissant and a bowl of corn chowder w/"croissant biscuit" on top! The croissant crumbled to flaky bits in my mouth as soon as I took a bite (LOVED THAT).  So heavenly and light.I knew I had to try out the bakery items so I could give a "whole experience" review:I had a butter croissant, creme fraiche blueberry muffin and orange almond brioche.  I took a sample bite of each.  Again, the butter croissant was amazing, light, the brioche had delicate hints of orange zest and toasted almond, and the muffin was moist and supple with blueberries bursting through with each bite.  The creme fraiche totally elevates the body of the muffin, giving it a rich and slightly creamy texture.  They also carry Temple beans so of course I needed a latte to complete the "icing on the cake" feeling I was experiencing.I imagine that there are only a few type of guys that would be satisfied with the menu here:  guys that wear skinny jeans, guys secure with their feminine side and guys that have been dragged and nagged into eating here by their GF/wife/significant other.  YO FELLAS!!!  If you are looking for belly filling food portions, preferably deep fried and dripping with meat, also giving you the most bang for your buck - I suggest you do a 180 degree turn and take your ass to either Burger Inn, Dad's on J or Bud's Buffet - all within a 1 block distance from Estelle's.YO LADIES!!!  If you desire high quality, local ingredients, at a reasonable price, then this is the place for you.
<review# 938,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2012,12/15/2012,1211,148,26,26,27>First off, there's something you probably should know about me.I don't really like sandwiches.So how in the world did The Sandwich Spot get a 5 star from me?Because they managed to CHANGE MY MIND!I came in here recently all clueless on what to order. But they have a big and descriptive menu which was very helpful. I went for the sandwich called "The First Tee" consisting of roast beef, cream cheese, and bomb sauce (a spicy ranch). And of course there's also the basic stuff like tomatoes and lettuces included. You pick the bread of your choice and add on or take out whatever you like. I got my sandwich, a can of Arizona ice tea, and a bag of chips for a little over $10. Not bad.Once my sandwich came out, and I got to try it...my taste buds went absolutely bzzzeerrrrrkkk! THIS STUFF WAS INCREDIBLE. I mean...damn. Give me a piece of bread with cream cheese, and I'll be one happy camper. Or even just the cream cheese! But giving me a fresh piece of Dutch Crunch bread that's deliciously crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, loaded with all this amaaaaazingness just totally placed me in a euphoric stage. I just really wished that I haven't sat right by the window where everyone can see me chow down the whole entire thing.This was like...wayyy...WAY better than Subway. I'm not sure if that's like a crime to even be comparing the two. If it is, I'm sorry. Don't hurt me. I just don't eat sandwiches like that to be knowing all the other places. BUT MAN, talk about love at first bite!This sandwich will, no doubt, be haunting my every dreams for the next few weeks.
<review# 939,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/1/2009,1/19/2010,9,8,16,6,6>Ahhh Weatherstone.  Now this is a place that I WANT to love....It's like the 8th grade all over again, I just want to fit in. I want to be part of their cool laptop club...(dream sequence) There I am, lounging around the place sipping on coffee with an intellectual gaze in my eyes. Here I sit surrounded by the typical coffee shop noise, a faint smell of leather and great local art.  With the simple grace and purposeful aloofness I put  headphones in my ears and stare at my Mac computer with steely determination. I am cool. I am hip. I am creative. For some reason, I just don't fit.  It's like I somehow lack the Weatherstone gene. I am the type of person that likes to applaud.  Weatherstone patrons are more of the snapping type....  Another fact that proves that I could never be Weatherstonian...their coffee doesn't taste good to me.  It has a burnt aftertaste that can only be describe as quintessentially Weatherstone. Before their very recent remodel they kept their pastries at mouth level, uncovered and next to the cash register...hmmm, my friends consider me an earthy girl, but that is just gross. I'm sure we can thank the Health Department for that. Overall, it just doesn't feel that clean. The back patio is littered with smokers, flys, dogs and kids. Yuck! It's bad when you can't tell the difference between patrons and our local vagrant community. The food is very good and tastes clean and fresh. It takes a while, but it's generally worth the wait. Outside of the small portions and exorbitant prices I do like the food. As I mentioned, Weatherstone did undergo a recent remodel in which they finally covered their pastries and brought in beer in wine. Come to think of it, I might actually find my niche propped up on one of their new barstools.  My biggest gripe? HEY YOU! Mr. Guy-behind-the-counter.  Yeah it's me again. Yep, my boyfriend lives right across the street. Yep, I came in here everyday for months to drink your crappy coffee and get 3rd degree burns from your tea. Why? I wanted to be one of you. But instead, like Cyndi Lauper, I was snubbed... 'Time After Time.'  A blank stare. As if I was a foul smelling tourist with a facial disfiguration....every morning. How is it that you never recognized me...?  I would smile with that 'I'm a regular' smile, yet still...nothing.  You, Mr.-guy-behind-the-counter leave an even more bitter taste in my mouth than your crappy coffee.
<review# 940,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2009,1/18/2010,168,456,3,5,2>Very trendy atmosphere - everything is white and well lighted; I especially like the open kitchen layout.  The store front with the Vespa's and clothing is confusing, but the dining area with the communal tables is nice.  I enjoyed a wood fired pizza ($12)  that was delicious.  The spinach salad ($7) was excellent.  My dark chocolate gelato ($3) was exactly what I was craving!  I would definitely recommend sharing a pizza and salad, but get your own dessert!
<review# 941,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2009,1/17/2010,74,46,2,12,4>I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. I got a massage as a gift for Valentine's Day. In one word: amazing. In the meditation room that they take you to before you get started, they had sparkling cider, chocolate covered strawberries, cheese platter, cookies, fruits, and optional champagne. Plus a spa & dry sauna out back on the patio (unfortunately it was too cold out to use that day).Then the massage...oh, the massage. Victoria was my masseuse and she was extraordinary. I'd never had a massage before and their Signature Blend was absolutely perfect for me. I really couldn't have asked for more.The whole atmosphere is just really awesome, and the staff is so incredibly nice and helpful. I wouldn't go anywhere else, ever.
<review# 942,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2009,1/16/2010,81,146,5,6,5>Serendipity.It was a crowded afternoon at Temple Coffee in Sac Towne  after the Amgen Tour prologue, and I shared a table with a fellow coffee fanatic. We had a chatter about all things coffee including the unfortunate closing of Java Jay in Roseville.  He told me to check out Bloom in Roseville if I was ever in the neighborhood.  I responded something along the lines of :"As if."So there I was four days later looking to get lunch for my baby mama who spent the night in the new KP medical center in; you guessed it Roseville.  I just happened to pick the one retail development that this gem of a THIRD WAVE COFFEE SHOP calls home.Believe every accolade the previous reviewers have offered about this fine cafe.  The brothers know their stuff, and are passionate about both the preparation and presentation of connoisseur grade coffee.Take it from some one who likely knows and loves coffee more than you or anyone you know:  Bloom is worth the trip.  Especially if it's only the two minute detour off I 80- exit 105a.
<review# 943,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/1/2009,1/15/2010,105,90,8,9,6>If you've just recently escaped from Witch Mountain, then this place might seem like your run-of-the-mill breakfast joint.  For the rest of humanity, it's a fascinating mess. Mannequins, clowns, toy trains, knick-knacks, bric-a-brac, and anything else you can think of lines the walls and ceiling.  The booths are broken and the waitresses are broken down.If this were just a review on interesting spaces, Cricket's would get a five star rating just based on the creepy cool factor alone, but alas, the food doesn't live up.  As breakfast places go, it's fair fare. Nothing to email home about, but nothing to turn your stomach either.  The eggs and bacon and sausage and pancakes and biscuits are all just fine without being exceptional.I'd go back, but only to shock my friends that hadn't been before.
<review# 944,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/2/2009,1/14/2010,12,121,,4,4>My girl and I went here to meet a buddy after work for a beer.  After viewing the menu online, I went with the idea to try some food too.  It was a Thursday night and it was very crowded.  It took a while to get seating, but managed to get a guinness while waiting; speaking of waiting... the wait staff were excellent.  Although very busy, they were on top of things.  The food was average to excellent (try the lamb sliders).  The stew was fair.  The guinness for some reason seemed a bit ~weak~?  It has a nice, but somewhat mixed decor... somewhat like this review!   My preference is to shy away from too trendy and really noisy so I'd have agree with some previous reviewers and to go to Bonn Lair for pub fix (or another pub).
<review# 945,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/8/2009,1/13/2010,51,33,3,7,6>I love this place!!! The "ALL YOU CAN EAT" from open-3pm is the way to go and only $10!!! The food is freshly cooked and whenever I'm there I go all out with no shame! I practically order everything on the menu. I always get hot and sour soup, hong kong style chow mein, fried rice, honey walnut prawns, sweet & sour pork but with the sauce on the side, fish filets in black bean sauce, and more soup!! There's alot of selections and what I like about this place is you know its freshly cooked and its just not sitting there all day like regular buffets but who knows maybe its sitting in the back!!! The servers are great and always checking in for beverage refills and if we want to order more. Yesterday me and 3 other girlfriends went for brunch and ordered basically everything I mentioned above and more and had probably 4+ refills of hot and sour soup and by the third refill the server brought us a big bowl (it was the funniest thing). I bet other customors were surprised with how much food we ordered and demolished every bite!I never feel rushed when I'm here as the workers are very welcoming because we were here from 12-3 yesterday just chatting away and laughing like hyenas. I apologized to our waiter for sitting there too long and he was like "You can stay here until 5 if you want". We ended  up paying around 50 or so for us 4 because we always try to tip well because they are so nice and cool here! Another plus is they actually have good fortunes in their cookies! Let me try to remember everyones, mines was something like " Happiness will always accompany you," which went with the mood cause we were having such a good time! Here are the others, "your courage will bring you honor," "self love is your first love and last love," and  "you'll always be succesful in your personal affairs," which applied to each person. I know it sounds silly but one girl is always breaking hearts but never has had her heart broken which is why the "you'll always be succesful in your personal affairs" applied so well to her. I wont spend the entire time explaining each one...haha. Always a good time at Eastern Empire!
<review# 946,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2009,1/12/2010,42,177,4,4,4>Not the cheapest, and the selection looks a little skimpy.  But the shrimp tacos (grilled shrimp at that) are excellent.  So's the variety of the salsa bar.  Try the avocado salsa; delicious.  Real laid-back atmosphere; hot tortilla chips while you wait for your food, delivered to your table by a sweaty, bearded, jolly dude with an amazingly friendly disposition.  This is a true hole in the wall.  Just the kinda joint I love the mostest.
<review# 947,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/7/2009,1/11/2010,145,100,4,6,6>soooo .. i'm a Food Network addict .. and i watch it around the clock .. one of my favorite shows happens to be Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri .. this guy is the king of finding all the best comfort food in town, mostly places that have been around for generations .. so when i overheard "Sacramento, California" on an episode that played last night, i had to pay attention .. i was like "whaaat, in SAC?! FINALLY!!!" .. and that prime rib almost killllled me .. i HAD to have it ... so i called my man and asked him if we could make up over some bomb ass comfort food, care of Guy Fieri (we had gotten into a fight earlier that day LOL) .. it is in a weird place ... Broadway & 5th .. a bit of a odd location with whack parking, but we came in when it wasn't busy .. most of the servers were chillin at the bar and had a good relaxing attitude .. probably cuz they were on a beer buzz? ;) hehe just kidding .. i only say that cuz i'd be on a beer buzz if i worked at a bar and it was a chill Monday night .. so, i HAD to have some kinda meat .. it's holy week and i'm catholic so i can't have meat for 3 days until Easter Sunday. So i'm eating all the meat i can until Wed! ;) .. anyway .. this place tends to have most of their best stuff on the specials menu, so u just gotta catch it! I realllly wanted that Prime Rib, but it won't be there til Thursday (tear) so i opted for the Smoked Brisket Sandwich .. my babe had the Garlic Steak Sandwich .. the rest of the menu is simple, but i bet it doesn't taste simple .. this is definitely a simple place with great food .. When the sandwich came out, i was a little worried ... that sh!t was so thick, i had no idea how i was gonna get my mouth over it ... the fries were moneyyyy .. i'm glad i ordered ranch on the side cuz the batter they dip those hand-cut fries in .. mMm .. they are fried to perfection, not TOO crispy where u can taste the oil and not TOO soggy where it's limp .. juuust right. =) the fries alone would have made me happy! I agree with Jason B. with the garlic steak .. the steak part of it was amazing, but i wasn't too impressed with the "garlic" aspect of it. My man claims it was something i could have made at home for him (haha), but that brisket sandwich was on hit, son!!! mMm .. i could tell the meat was marbled cuz of the juicy parts that i found with a little bitta fat (i'm an indulger, so sue me.) and that sauce they had on the side for dipping was like a liquid bbq baste&glaze thang mixed with some steak juices that mMMm... *licks lips* .. seriously. i'm so glad i chose it. it was worth the $15 in my opinion, i mean, it's BRISKET. ;) i'm coming here again to try the rest of the stuff Guy Fieri featured -- seafood soup, featured fishes of the day, etc. .. i'll up my rating to 5 stars once i try that Prime Rib ;) i'm gonna try to come in during Lunch, it seems like a better time to experience the real ambience ... all i could think of was my brothers masticating the meat dishes they have here -- definitely a good spot to take any man or men in your life (bros, dads, cousins, grandpas, husbands or bfs) .. it can't get any better than meat and beer for them ;) hehehe ... foooood coma status. real talk ;)
<review# 948,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/6/2009,1/9/2010,61,181,4,6,7>Not my favorite place for pho, but Pho Dynasty will probably give a few Stockton Blvd pho joints a run for their money.  A large bowl comes with a heaping mound of noodles, plenty of broth, but unfortunately really no meat.  The broth is tasty and the noodles were soft but not overcooked.  Prices are very reasonable especially for a $1 difference from a regular to large bowl.The restaurant is clean and service was prompt and friendly. If you find yourself hungry after a workout at 24 Hr Fitness or grocery shopping at Bel Air, skip Carl's Jr, Togo's, and Wingstop and head over to Pho Dynasty.  They use check presenters and even accept Visa and Mastercard payments!  What other pho place does that?!?
<review# 949,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/28/2009,10/5/2010,154,299,3,7,4>I've been here a few times for bar review, as well as just going to see what it was like when it wasn't flooded with 1L's. Just for drinks mind you, so I can't talk about the food. Drink prices were pretty good, and the Bartenders were cool (at least to me). They at least know how to work their lines as opposed to some other places I've been to, so that automatically gets it 4 stars for me. To bid your time between drinks, there are a plethora of pool tables, and lots of private, cubby like tables to have a secluded spot (or get table service). I've been able to get out of here for less than $25 for 5 drinks (a few beers and a couple above-well cocktails plus a good tip).All in all I like the place. It's a bit of a walk from my place in midtown, but oh well. Parking is a little bit of a hassle around here, but such is life in midtown, so get your quarters ready or learn to find parallel park and walk.
<review# 950,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2010,10/4/2010,418,300,16,11,9>We searched and searched and searched for the perfect couch for our living room. It took nearly two years! It was difficult to replace my old comfy bachelor couch. So many memories of girls gone by..,.you know ill-conceived passes and nervous fiddling of a bra strap. Maybe that's why my wife insisted we get rid of it. She fail victim to the bachelor couch a time or two. TMI Right? We were looking for a couch that fit our lifestyle and a color that would go with the rest of the room. By lifestyle I mean we have a cat with claws and a baby boy with bottles of liquid. We went all over town from store to store. From uncomfortable to ugly. From one furniture salesman to another furniture salesman. They follow you like a shark follows a distressed tunafish. Very annoying. ...So it was the end of a long hot day and we saw Furniture For Less across the street from Beck's. I was like, "We may as well take a shot at it". We went inside and no sales sharks followed us. We immediately saw a bronze colored couch that looked like what we've been searching forever for. Next was the sit on it test...and and and it passed! We liked it so much we added the love seat too! Great price. Now I have some ass-sitting and TV watching to do on my new couch and sofa. Time for a Weeds Marathon!
<review# 951,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/6/2010,10/3/2010,702,960,8,13,14>3.5 stars. Not bad for a shopping center frozen yogurt joint! Located on the second floor of Downtown Plaza, this is in that quaint spot where you would expect Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to pop out. At .40 cents an ounce, it isn't exactly cheap, but the consistency and quality is there. There are six flavors, today's were:* Sexy Dark Chocolate (as opposed to Chaste Chocolate?) - Didn't taste exactly sexy to me, I've had better. Strange aftertaste.* Plain Ol' Vanilla - Actually quite good* Strawberry - Sugar-free, sweetener is Sucralose* Irish Mint* Eurotart - Not too sweet, quite good. This name always cracks me up, in another country this name would conjure up images of a Eurotrash hottie. * Mango - Non-dairyPlenty of toppings, not as many as Big Spoon, lessay, but it is the quality that counts. They had my favorites: Heath bar, Oreo cookies, mochi, Snickers, M&Ms, etc. More sophisticated fare with the occasional gummy worms and gummi bears thrown in.Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. You can't pour your own samples, but someone will magically appear from behind the back to get you what you need. Minus half a star for the whipped cream topping. It tasted like non-dairy whip. And the chocolate let me down. Otherwise, with the pleasant fall weather coming up, this is a great spot to take a shopping break for froyo al fresco.
<review# 952,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/28/2010,10/2/2010,249,49,21,19,13>Never have I had the urge to go to an all you can eat joint... alone.It would just be me and my aesthetically pleasing food (seriously, they make 'em really pretty).  I wouldn't have to be courteous and offer the last piece to my friends when in reality I want to just strike like a Jackson Chameleon's tongue then throw my head back and laugh victoriously.  None of that polite arguing would take place, you know the kind that seems to go on forever..."Take it.""No you take it." "Seriously eeeeeeat it, I don't want it."(Silent stare meaning "you better eat it.")"Shut up! I know you want it.""Oh. My. GOSH.  Just eat it.""Fine!" (picking it up slowly as the other person is dying inside.)I like how the rolls come in smaller portions (4 pieces) as opposed to the normal roll size (6-8 pieces).  This detail allows you to try more of the menu, which you definitely want to.  My friends and I were 5 away from trying the entire dinner menu of rolls!  Oh, sweet gluttony.  Also, the sushi hasn't been floating around on a miniature boat for who knows how long;  it's all made to order.  I really loved the Azukar roll and salmon carpaccio.The staff was very attentive and quick to fill our waters- always a good sign.  Christine, our waitress, is super sweet and she's honest about what to try and what's not worth taking up stomach space. If you see a girl sitting alone and eating with sunglasses on, don't judge me... I mean, her.

<review# 954,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2010,9/30/2010,910,555,10,11,7>Please allow me to attempt explaining how good this place is...I had a lunch date here with a close homegirl today and we parked on the street and put 30 min in the parking meter.  We waited in line for a good 30 min with more and more anticipation for those scrumptious little sandwiches as each person walked out with one on their plates.  We finally got our food and sat down at a table outside, a few yards away from the car, the car within our line of sight.  As we approached our satisfying finish, we walked to the car only to find a horrifying parking ticket tucked underneath the windshield wiper!!!  How did we forget that we only put in 30 minutes for the meter?!  But more importantly, how on earth did the officer give us the ticket right in front of our eyes wihtout us noticing?!  There's only one answer.  Our food was that good; we were trapped in a world of our own.I applaud this one man run restaurant; his need to capture this French tradition makes this place all the more authentic.  You know this place is good when it still makes bank even after only opening on weekdays for lunch!!  The French Onion Soup is amazing!!  He starts with cutting pieces of bread at the bottom, he pours the soup into the bowl and he tops it off with cheese that melts into the soup..what'd I say? AMAZING!  And we ordered the Smoked Salmon and the Warm Brie and Prosciutto Sandwiches and though they look small, they were very filling!  Two sandwiches, two soups, and two sparkling pink lemonades took us back $26 which is pricey but worth it!  The sandwiches themselves average $5-6 each so the gourmet sandwiches are DEFINITELY worth every penny.  Speaking of penny, he washes his hands every time he handles money now!  Woo hoo!
<review# 955,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2010,9/29/2010,518,148,11,9,11>Ok, this review is mainly for Drag Queen Bingo although I have to say...the burgers here are quite satisfying. And the fries are quite tasty. But I digress. It's all about the drag queens. Went here Wednesday night for a fundraiser like no other. Here's the way the evening went....Walked in and was met by two of the best drag queens I've ever seen. Beautiful makeup and hair. Gorgeous dresses. Amazing shoes. They immediately welcomed my party and I and shuffled us off to purchase bingo pages and libations.Once seated, we noticed a certain theme about the bingo games. For instance, when the bingo caller calls out O-69 everyone yells in unison, "Shot! Shot! Shot!" at which point the staff brings out $1 shots of what they refer to as 'bong water'. Sorry, no bong water for me. I'm driving.And if you win a bingo game, God help you. This is the best. You have to don a wig and feather boa and run around the restaurant while everyone chants "Pelt the bitch! Pelt the bitch!" and throws their wadded-up bingo sheets at you. Hysterical!Lots of innuendo and out-right vulgarity. So fun and so funny! The best part was when KCRA showed up for shots for their 11 pm newscast. The crowd loved it and was of course, so over the top!When I went to leave, my new drag queen friend Rusty Nails decided that I shouldn't be going home so early and he/she was going to call my husband and tell him that I wasn't coming home. Thank God he didn't have my home phone number. Although....that would've been kinda funny!Can't wait to go back for their next fundraiser!
<review# 956,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2010,9/28/2010,187,255,2,4,5>Love, love, love it here.  Right in the midst of downtown Sacramento, it's the perfect place to grab a drink, sit down, relax with a book,  or iphone (if you're like me!) Went here this past Sunday morning and were warmly greeted by the 2 people working.  When one of the guys working found out we were first timers, he was so nice in explaining the menu, (which was pretty simply and straightforward), but we definitely appreciated the gesture. Loved that the service was so friendly!  I ended up getting the Thai coffee and my hubby got the Thai mocha.  Wow! Both drinks were served piping hot and delicious.  We'd never tried any of these drinks before, so we didn't have anything to compare it to, but we were super impressed by the taste and the richness of the flavors.  We've also tried the Thai iced teas there and those are simply phenomenal.  I've never had a Thai iced tea like the one I've had at Temple; just amazing.  Definitely coming back!
<review# 957,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2010,9/27/2010,202,160,6,7,8>The food? A carnivores DREAM!Service? Impeccable!Portions? Always enough to have leftovers.The flavor? OMG, it's like they have someones grandma who is from Louisiana in the kitchen slaving away, committing elder abuse by having her work all these hours and selling out her family recipe!!. Love it!After reading a few reviews about the service, has it ever occurred to some people, that you are a BAD CUSTOMER? Some people come in with shitty attitudes and expect to have a personal SERVANT rather than SERVER, when a place is full. Understand it's not always a servers fault. the kitchen fux up an order or slows things down, yet you take it out on the server. Check your attitudes at the door and learn to be UNDERSTANDING. Low class people I say. If you as a classy, understanding customer comes in knowing that sometimes SHIT HAPPENS at ANY establishment, maybe you wont be so hard on the ratings.But I digress......I'm a customer for life at this restaurant. No doubt.Even though its 20 miles from my house, I am looking forward to the next time I come back. If you live close, I suggest you GO!!
<review# 958,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2010,9/26/2010,826,495,3,8,8>When a co-worker offered to watch our kids for a night and allow my wife and I to go out for a real date, I was quick to accept. And since my co-worker lives in Loomis, I immediately decided that we should try Crush 29 and then catch a movie at one of the nearby theaters.After leaving the children at my friend's house, we headed back to Roseville and found the place. Although we didn't have a reservation, it wasn't an issue as the restaurant was not crowded when we arrived at 5:30, giving us plenty of time to eat before heading to a 7:00 movie.The restaurant itself is beautiful with the outside patio with chairs and couches, the round center bar and seating area, a fireplace, several rooms for dining, and even what appeared to be a few private rooms.The hostess took us to our table and the waitress appeared quickly. It was funny because when she asked if it was a special occasion my wife stated that it was our first date in two months and the waitress mistakenly thought it was our second date. We quickly explained that, no, we've been married for 9+ years, together for 13, but with two small children don't get out much on our own.For dinner, we started by splitting the strawberry pecan salad. My wife followed with the blackened ribeye and I had the prime rib. To drink we had a bottle of cabernet sauvignon from Provenance Vineyards which was a better deal than buying wine by the glass and only a few dollars more than buying the same bottle directly from the winery. I also really liked the fact that if you don't finish the bottle, they cork it and let you take it to go.The food was delicious although we both agreed that the salad could use more feta cheese. Both my wife's steak and my prime rib were perfectly cooked and the smashed potatoes had an excellent texture and were quite good. As a fan of prime rib, my personal preference is for a tangier horseradish sauce and I was a bit disappointed in the blandness of the horseradish provided, but this is a minor quibble.Service was excellent, although from the time the manager asked if my wife would like the rest of her meal boxed to go, we were asked the same question by three more servers before our waitress appeared with the already requested box.As for the atmosphere, we were there early so we avoided the trendy bar crowd discussed in other reviews. However, even with the small amount of people there at the same time as us, I can agree that this is clearly a hot spot for the area.If we'd had more time, I would have loved to stay and try the creme brulee and other desserts, but as we were headed to see a summer action blockbuster, we passed and instead had popcorn and sodas at the theater.I would definitely return to Crush 29. Its a great place for a special occasion or just a fun night out.

<review# 960,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/13/2009,2/21/2010,464,293,7,6,7>Prior to Cultive opening up, this well frequented 19th street location was occupied by a 2nd tier smoothie franchise (ie - NOT Jamba Juice). Since I live around the corner, I frequent this little hub of commerce quite often and consider myself a regular shopper at Safeway, Fresh Cleaners and Melody Salon. The smoothie place could have easily been on my hit list, but they managed to be the slowest smoothie makers known to man. It must have been required that their employee (singular since I never saw more than one person working at a time) shoot up some black tar heroin before work because every time I went there it took at least 20 minutes to get a mediocre smoothie. I would watch in awe and frustration as the employee moved in slow motion and confusion, and oftentimes wanted to slam past them and make the damn thing myself. On my final visit before I swore the place off, I actually asked for my money back because it was taking so long.So, it delights me to see a business open up that not only serves some delicious frozen yogurt - tart and regular - but seems to totally have it together. They have a great location, so I imagine they will be very successful. The fruit is fresh and the toppings bar is A+ clean. The employees are friendly and helpful. They have 8 flavors that rotate out. So far I have tried Vanilla, Dutch Chocolate, Cake Batter, Pomegranate Tart, Mango Tart and Cookies & Cream. Frozen yogurt is my reward for going to the gym and being a good girl, so I imagine I will end up being a regular at Cultive.
<review# 961,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/1/2010,2/18/2010,518,148,4,13,11>What a great little bar. Tucked into the alley across from the Firehouse in Old Sac, we almost missed it. Once through the doors, you walk into a dark, yet vibrant little bar with a great vibe. You got your regulars sitting at the bar that look like they've been parked there a while. The bartender knows them by name and you can tell they all have a lot of history. The decor is....interesting. Eclectic. Red velvet damask wallpaper with gold leaf mirrors behind the bar. Very bordello-ish. I'm pretty certain it's looked this way for at least 20 years. I liked it.Bartender was funny and loud and quick-witted. Perfect for our group. She could sling 'em and also made a mean Bloody Mary. We'll definitely be going back soon!
<review# 962,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/11/2009,2/16/2010,145,309,4,7,5>Interesting family style concept for a steak house. Let that sink in for a minute - everything is meant to be shared. How it works: The menu suggests the number of persons each dish can feed. The 14 oz rib eye, NY and T bone are priced in the low $20's and serve 2 people. Each vegetable serves 2; sides 2 etc. The meat is brought out on a sizzling metal plate and set on the brick trivet. The server cuts the meat into strips and you then pull over what you want to your plate. The sides are placed on the table. What we had when we dined there was the steak Carpaccio which came with something I never heard of Black Garlic. I am used to a more salty version and this one is more sweet. Wedge salad was unremarkable. Ribeye steak was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Baked potato OK and ice cream. Because we brought wine the evening was an affordable $50+ and good value. Pros:Ambiance is nice. Light woods with indirect lighting. Booths are large and can seat six with cushy leather backs. The tables are movable which means the inside person does not have to scoot like crazy to get in. The food is reasonably priced. Nice bar area. No corkage or cake-age fee so bring your own wine! Tips for a successful dining experience: If you are like me and my husband we like our meat at different doneness. We ordered rare (for him) and when our meat arrived he pulled all that he wanted to his plate while I left mine on the metal plate to continue to cook til medium. Cons/room for improvement- They offer event space upstairs but do not have a catering menu. No Happy hour! Some menu items are locked into some poor choices for example Ice cream w/strawberries in December is more like ice cream with straw than berries because they are not in season. Wouldn't it be better to say seasonal fruit and give yourself an out?
<review# 963,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2010,2/15/2010,92,271,6,7,8>5 stars for being the best European Bakery in it's immediate area!   This place can put a smile on an Emo's face. I have yet to actually try any "real food" from this place, but who can blame me? Getting so caught up eating sweet delicious and light feeling deserts is enough to keep this piggy from even getting to the actual meal.    When ever the family decides to throw a dinner party, we always end up getting some pastries and cakes from Ettore's to go with the after dinner coffee. It is such a great bakery to have in the area. The variety, the taste, the service... all so very pleasing. It's wrong to only go there and try a couple items. You must get several to take home with you to feed your cravings for the next couple of days.   I am not a European pastry buff, but I am a connoisseur when it comes to sweet om nom nom ness. I often get desert for my appetizers, that way a hearty meal can never ruin my desert! ...and if there is room, there is always room for desert!
<review# 964,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/20/2010,2/14/2010,702,960,17,15,17>People, please don't part your Cadillac Escalade in a spot marked "compact", m'kay? Especially when yours truly who drives a REAL compact has to park  next to you and squeeze myself around your behemoth and find myself in a one-inch puddle. Yes, this means YOU lady wearing the black  hat! Whew, just had to get that off my chest. I am a sucker for marketing promotions. This means that I clipped out a coupon in the Bee for either free hummus, dolmathes or falafel. It's just free. But like you're really going to drive ALL the way out there for a couple of measly falafel balls, right? So I tried their gyro ($5.99) while I was there.Having sampled gyros from Greek eateries deep in the heart of Australia (did you know that Melbourne has the highest population per capita of Greeks outside of Athens?), I knew what a good gyro should be like. This gyro was mainly meat. And the only choice of meat was a reconstituted skewer of 80% beef, 20% lamb. Normally I would balk at this, but seeing that Sacramento isn't exactly known for its Greek spots, I tried it. The result was a gyro that was mainly meat and not much else. Granted there were a few slivers of onion, a confetti-like sprinkling of lettuce, perhaps a hint of tomato, but it was mainly meat. I just couldn't stomach it.Next the freebie dolmathes. I asked if they were made on the premises (they aren't) but I figure someone out there is making these by hand, right? Well, they did not taste canned, which is a good thing. They came with a serving of tzatziki which went nicely with the remainder of the gyro.Also, gyros are not easy to consume. In fact, don't ever try eating one of these on a date. I got mine to go and was disappointed there was no napkin in the bag. It got messy. As for ambiance, etc., Opa! Opa! has a very clean feel to it, not exactly oozing charm, but more on the modern side. Next door is Sweeties - their dessert shop - which looked tempting. I'll have to try them out sometime when I'm not full of meat.
<review# 965,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2009,2/13/2010,574,469,18,13,12>Haiku Review:Pizza and ChickenTotally delicious, dude!Open until 1!-----Regular Review:I'm pretty sure that as I was entering this place, a couple of dudes were dropping off a stolen vehicle in the adjacent lot. I pretended I didn't see them but that definitely switched the mood. Whatever. None of my business, but if you're looking for your newer model silver vehicle, it's worth it to check the lot out.It turns out that "Pizza & Chicken Love Letter is the U.S. brand name of Cheogajip Chicken Korea." Whatever it is, it is totally good, dude. I was pissed that I couldn't find a menu anywhere online, so I put my time waiting to good use snapping pics of them menu so you all wouldn't end up like me: waiting.Now, you can't come in here being a hater. This isn't for you foodies. I'm sure that some of you foodies would like it, but I'm guessing the majority of you would not.To find out if you like PCLL, answer the following questions:Do you like pizza?Do you like chicken?Do you think potatoes and pineapple on pizza sounds good?If you said yes to ALL of the above, this spot is for you, baby. If you answered no to the third question and no to the second question, go ahead and bypass. You will not like this place.For the record, I FREAKING LOVE THIS PLACE!! No joke! But I love pineapple and canadian bacon on my pizza once in a while. To me, that tastes DELICIOUS. If you enjoy pineapple and canadian bacon on your pizza, you will LOVE this.I ordered the popcorn chicken, with the sauce on the side (I don't like anything swimming in sauce; that's a no-no) and the last pizza pictured on the wall. The chicken's texture wasn't right to me, but I still ate it. But the pizza, on the other hand... let me just tell you about this pizza.The pizza's crust is stuffed with what they call potato mousse. Thankfully, I didn't see that until ten minutes after I placed my order, or else I would have never ordered it. That mousse is really just mashed sweet potatoes, and with the crust it was sooooo good. I love sweet potatoes. Johnna like.The pizza has a strange amalgamation of three different sauces; one is red, a bit of one is white, and a smaller bit of one is clear. I gotta admit, when I got home and open the box, I was turned off by the strange sauce layering. I am essentially a traditionalist when it comes to food. But I finally took a bite and it was gloriously good. The pineapple, potato, corn and sausage mended perfectly with the sauces and potato-filled crust. Cheese everywhere, yummy,... hooray!This pizza will become as bad as bacon on my not allowed to eat list. Just give it a chance. The service I got was very, very good for a pizza place. But if you're freaked out by pineapple on your pizza, it would be best for you to go somewhere else. This isn't for boring or overly refined palettes. This place is for people who aren't intimidated by something new, or by stolen cars being dropped off less than 150 yards away.
<review# 966,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/2/2009,2/12/2010,323,1092,8,11,9>Outshining some somewhat stiff competition, Masullo may be my new favorite pizza place in Sacramento.  While Masullo, like OneSpeed (it's most comparable competition), has somewhat slow service, Masullo makes up for it by being NICE.  Being nice and polite goes a long way if you are going to make me grumpy by taking a longish time to get me food.  They also really aren't anywhere near as slow as that other place.  We had our salad and drinks right away, though the pizzas we ordered did take their sweet time in getting to us.  The food was fantastic.  Our fennel and arugula salad was simple but well put together and our two pizzas were delicious--and I'm picky about pizza.  I'm also not normally a thin crust fan, but they do it right (not too crisp, not too floppy).  We ordered the Despina and the Eileen.  I particularly liked the Eileen (oyster mushrooms, sage, bacon, cream sauce).  I will go back just for that pizza.   And despite reviews talking about how loud things get in their cute little cement box of a location, it seemed much, much quieter than Hot Italian or OneSpeed.
<review# 967,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2009,2/11/2010,97,108,10,8,8>I've been a yelp member for over a year now and so far I've been content just reading others reviews, but this place has inspired me to finally write my own. God damn. It's Amazing. Every Wednesday is Top Chef night at home and this means that I go out in search of the most delicious food I can find and bring it home at exactly 10 pm so I can watch Top Chef without being tempted to eat my TV. Last week I stumbled upon Magpie and got the chicken with wine for two based on reviews. I was skeptical because I'm not a fan of chicken at all but I thought it was worth the try... and it so was!The chicken was so moist and tender and so flavorful. The potatoes and vegetables were amazing. And the sauce... OMG the sauce. I saw the layers of olive oil floating around but I drenched my chicken anyways. The best part was that the food actually tasted like it was good for me. You can taste the quality and care. AMAZING. Oh and I had a carrot cake cookie while waiting for my food. Rich and sweet and delicious. I'll definitely be back for the rest of my Top Chef dinner nights. I love you Magpie.
<review# 968,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/24/2009,2/10/2010,53,209,4,12,7>After hearing much about Mulvaney's, and in my head discounting it as another trendy midtown joint with more style than substance (all this without actually trying it...guilty as charged!), I finally heard enough foodie vibe about them to give it a try.  What the hell was I waiting for???  The converted New Helvetia (itself a converted firehouse) has equal portions cozy charm and cacophonous crowding.  Fortunately, the attractive patio was available, and we reposed in relative quiet for our meal.  The evening began with a tomato and house-made mozzarella salad.  Now, I find the "insalata Caprese" thing completely tiring and uninteresting, as it usually consists of pulpy off-season tomatoes with watery second-class mozz and acrid low-rent balsamico; this version had none of those flaws.  Instead, late-season juicy tomatoes rode alongside still-warm, magnificently creamy cheese for a delightful first course.    By now, I'm enjoying myself, so I go completely off the rails and get a second course called "Moons Over Foie-Hammy," a clever Kelleresque composition with a crispy disk of house-made pancetta cradling properly seared foie gras, with a cute couple of sunny-side-up quail eggs and toast points.  The charm of the whole dish, in addition to its overall deliciousness, made me forget its lipid content.  The entrée was a duo of grilled quail, marvelously seasoned, atop a barley "risotto" with chanterelles.  While the risotto suffered a bit from underseasoning and lukewarm temperature, the toothsome, substantial quality of the barley made me wonder why more local restaurants don't make this version and give up on the original rice-based one which most of them can't help but overcook into mucilaginous porridge.  My companion's pork chop, about the size of Shaq's fist, was both brined and smoked, totally delicious.  Desserts (why the hell not, at this point?) featured the signature "Ding Dong," Mulvaney's proprietary version of the execrable but nostalgic Hostess product.  If this rich, velvety chocolate concoction is any indication, I hope to see Twinkies, Sno Balls, and Fruit Pies on future Mulvaney's visits.  Unfortunately, a chocolate bombe with coconut mousse had no detectable hint of the advertised cardamom and bore an unpalatable, stale taste of the refrigerator.  Strong kudos need to be given to Mulvaney's wine list, which features a number of great items seldom found on area lists, including gems from Siduri and Zepaltas.  Overall, Mulvaney's made a strong first impression with us, and I have no problem recommending them to anyone looking for enjoyable cuisine with a strong locavore emphasis and expert conception and execution.
<review# 969,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2011,9/7/2011,147,109,10,10,9>Oh, Shoki!  You have outdone yourself, my friend.  The new location (spacious as compared to the original) is clean and inviting- as soon as you walk in you're greeted with a warm "Irashaimase!" (I think, is what they're saying- as it means 'Welcome' in Japanese) and it suddenly feels like home.My particular encounter was during a lunch rush and there happen to be a group of 15 (yes, 15, we thought it was ridiculous, too) so the place was hectic and staff overwhelmed, to say the least.  It took three of us about 20 minutes to get seated even while two tables were available for 10 of those minutes.  Maybe they need some more time to get their bearings in order? Hence the one star deduction.Despite a developing frustration in the beginning, Shoki really made up for it by serving up that oh-so-delicious spicy ramen.  And that broth, holy goodness, that broth!  Whew, so good, make you wanna slap yo' mama!By the way, extra brownie points for the PARKING LOT!!!
<review# 970,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/24/2010,9/6/2011,119,121,6,9,9>I'm starving. There's nothing good in the fridge. Any sort of dinner entree on hand is frozen. And to top it off, it's dark and stormy outside and the idea of going out for dinner isn't appealing. Solution? Delivery pizza! I'm surprised I haven't already reviewed this place as Hot City is typically my go to pizza lately. They're nearby my neighborhood and I love that they deliver on a moped/scooter, it's kinda fun. The service is friendly and although I've never stayed to eat in, it's a small, nice enough place. As for the pizza itself, I'm a big fan. I love the whole wheat crust. It's something I would make if I was doing homemade pizza (I'm pretty granola...I like whole wheat everything). The toppings are fresh and their creations for specialty pizzas are tasty. I've never had something here that I didn't like. I would say more, but the delivery guy is pulling up in front of my house as we speak! Mmmmm.....
<review# 971,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2011,9/5/2011,154,26,6,8,9>Seriously been thinking about Hoicin's Sampan crab all night and day. Last night I went with a few friends. We ordered your standard array of Chinese food, hot & sour soup, veggie fried rice, pork chow mien, sweet and sour pork, etc... I get delivery from Hoicin almost weekly, so as always I was pleased with all the dishes. Fresh produce and freshly prepared, and most important- no dirty grease flavor. The menu is huge, I'd like to be more adventurous next time! But this night was special for me- I fell in love with a crab and haven't been able to stop thinking about him. I think I was even licking my fingers in my sleep. "SAMPAN STYLE CRAB* - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - seasonal price our signature dish! slightly battered, chopped, deep-fried to perfection, stir-fried with garlic flakes, salt, chopped chili & our homemade premium salty spicy XO sauce." The 5 of us ordered two Sampan crabs at $25 per. There's a live tank, order the crabs and watch them disappear into the kitchen. They were coated in a yummy unforgettably amazing batter, deep fried and brought out immediately. Within a few minutes were cracking away at the sweet steaming goodness and all had dirty greasy crab hands. Heaven. H-E-A-V-E-N!!! All cell phone calls, text messages, check-ins and facebook posts were ignored until those crabs were safely in our bellies. When they were gone I tried to resist the urge to lick the coating off the shells- but nope, I was in love. The waitresses were very sweet and helpful. The very second we'd clear our small plates they would be removed and replaced with a clean one, sometimes without me noticing. The restaurant seemed cleaner than other Chinese places around town. Nice cloth seat covers, tables with lazy susans. Very clean bathroom. Our group left a 20% tip and we all still wanted to each throw a few more bucks in. I have to say this is the by far the BEST Chinese in Rancho. I can't stop thinking we should have ordered that last crab...
<review# 972,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2011,9/4/2011,356,378,10,15,13>I've never been to a Japanese restaurant that's as innovative as Kru. You may question how some flavors would work together in a dish, but when conglomerated together in your mouth, the taste is shockingly perfect. I guess that's why Billy deserves to be paid the big bucks. Plus the presentation of the dishes are just beautifully done that it's hard to take the first bite!    Skip the rolls and nigiri since you can get that at any average Japanese restaurant and try the small plates instead. What blew my mind were the green tea and brown rice smoked duck and the sashimi tapas. Trust me, my tastebuds were overjoyed to experience something out of the ordinary. The duck was cooked medium and the drizzled dressing was light, sweet yet mustardy. Intriguing but so darn good. The sashimi tapas were the chef's choice of five fish, all created very differently. They were absolutely amazing. Each fish was seriously distinct in flavor from the others. I literally tasted five delectable dishes!   This is not a place I can go on a regular basis as my pocketbook would go broke quickly. But I'm sure I'll be making a stop here again since I already know what I'm going to try next time!
<review# 973,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2011,9/3/2011,410,518,17,18,10>Because I'm half mermaid and super curious because of the lack of informative reviews (except maybe for Harp T..not tryna hate at all!) and no menu to be found; my cravings and curiosity took over and I HAD to try this place out. Too bad my piglet posse couldn't join me for the feast. So here's the low down...If you've been to Boiling Crab (BC).. it's kind of the same deelio...sea food in a bag, but this place put the bag in a bowl to conserve the sauce. Different twist on the flavor though!!! And literally on the same street as BC. Pricing is comparable to BC if not CHEAPER. Check it out, check it out:1. Chicken Wings (7 pieces): $5.99..Fried with a side of ranch. Only one flavor. Pretty tasty...I ate 5 out of the 7 in the basket :) the BF made me share last minute when he found out there were only a couple left..hahaha!!2. Shrimp 1lb for $9.99: The BF ate the entire bag with the special house sauce (which I think is just fish sauce, lemon, cilantro, and maybe something else. Couldn't figure it all out) and I maybe ate two pieces. Personally not a big shrimp lover. .. I came for:3. Dungeness Crab $29.99: No not by the pound! Any crab for $29.99, which could be a good thing or a bad thing. Great deal if it was in season, but not so great when it's not. Keep in mind that at BC it's $13.99 lb. I'm not going to blame Firehouse though. Dungeness Crab isn't in season and even the ones in the supermarket aren't as fatty as I'd like. With the house sauce and the juices from the bag, it was still a tasty meal.4. Clams: $9.99 lb.. The clams were thee BEST CLAMS I've ever tasted. Hands down!! BC ain't got nothin' on this!! The clams were HUGE, saucy, and juicy. I dipped it in the special house sauce and ate it with rice....heaven..heaven. I think I heard a conch shell playing as I happily ate. This is the dish that I'd come back for....oh yes, I'm comin' back...I know my piglet posse would want to try this place out and they're definitely not going without me!! 5. Rice.. $2 It's regular white rice. But it comes in a big coffee mug with about two cups of rice piled high. AND real spoons. Not the Styrofoam cups and plastic spoons that BC gives you from Costco.6. Water is FREE! Good thing, because I'm pretty sure I didn't drink any. lol7. Domestic Beers are $3.00 and Imports are $3.50. Not bad, not bad at all! I had two Stellas, while the BF had two New Castles. Cost of the total meal (with tax and 16% tip included) $87.44. Which I think was totally worth it. I mean, I did eat 5 out of the 7 chicken wings, didn't share the dungeness crab at all (yes, the whole crab), ate all of the clams except for maybe 2, because I was generous enough to let the BF taste what was in my bag, two pieces of shrimp (just so I can say I tasted it), and two beers. Date night was definitely a success!My stomach is definitely protruding right now. If I was an A cup, my stomach would be a B cup right now..hahaha! Definitely gymin' it hard tomorrow!!* Final note:  I noticed one table had surgical gloves on to eat.  Not too sure if they brought gloves on their own or Firehouse provided gloves.  Our waitress didn't offer us any.  Although, I'd prefer to eat without a hand condom anyways.. I think it just taste better :)
<review# 974,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2011,9/1/2011,910,555,18,23,21>I find myself often raving about restaurants where I went to college; San Diego.  Then, the other day, Ricky N. had asked me..."you don't have any restaurants worthy of a solid 5 stars in Sac, do you?" and I came to the realization that...I really didn't!  And then..there was River's Edge.I probably would have never found this place if it weren't for Groupon and, although Groupon has some pretty good deals, I've never discovered a gem through them.  Now I can't say that anymore.  I can't wait until the next time I have a hangover...so I can eat here!  Lol.First off, their customer service is beyond incredible.  Every one of their staff members are quick, friendly and genuine.  It was pretty busy so it took awhile for us to be seated..however, everything else was a smooth process.  They even bid you goodbye as you're leaving!Now on to their food: they have the recipe to cure hangovers, believe it!  We ordered the Fair Oaks Benedict (ham, Italian ground sausage & grilled onions) with country potatoes - $11.99 and the Monster Burger (breakfast sandwich with a fried egg, bacon, hash browns, cheddar cheese, country sausage gravy on a toasted bun) - $9.99 with their famous stuffed hash browns (stuffed with bacon, sauasage, onions, sour cream, Jack and Cheddar cheese) -$3.25 for upgrading to stuffed. SOUNDS LIKE A HEART ATTACK WAITING TO HAPPEN, RIGHT?!  Well, if I had a heart attack shortly after, I'd die with a full and happy stomach. =)Fair Oaks Benedict: their hollandaise sauce is homemade and fresh!  Eggs poached to perfection over a buttery muffin..I'm just sad they don't have Crab Cake Benedict!  That would truly be heaven.  Their country potatoes were average, I enjoyed their hash browns much more..which brings me to their...Monster Burger & Stuffed Hash Brown:  That's some crunchy ass hash browns and I love crunchy!  And when I bit through that burger, the layers of oozing, yolky egg with crunchy hash brown and juicy meat just made my eyes widen and mind go "mmmmmm..."And finally, I ordered a large white mocha per a fellow Yelper's recommendation and she was right!  Better than Starbucks!!  I only wish this place was closer to my house, I'd probably come before class for coffee every day....Although their prices aren't too cheap, you get what you pay for.  This isn't Denny's type food people!  And I don't mind because their service and their food sure deserve it!
<review# 975,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2011,8/31/2011,702,960,21,29,20>Okay, yet another spot with mixed reviews that I was eager to test out! Hard to tell this was the old Taco Bell of yore that I used to frequent as a teenager. Gone is the orange and red colored measuring stick label alongside the door that measured your height in case you robbed the place. Gone are the brown hard plastic seats.So, keeping in mind that this is NOT Zelda's, but a relative (her younger sister), it is the lighter, newer suburban version. Where the register counter used to be is a small bar. Two flat screen TVs for your sports-viewing pleasure sit atop the bar area. Three beers on tap replace the Coke machine. Wooden booths dominate the window side of the wall (like Zelda's), however these are done up in a light pine. Perhaps because of the light finish, you could spot remnant crumbs of the previous diners lurking in the corners. A cushioned seat would also help; I'm not old by any means, but I'm starting to feel my sitting bones more these days. You can get specialty pizzas, pesto being one, and you cannot do a half-n-half job. It's all or nothing. We opted for the large combo which came with green peppers, mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni and onions. Delicious! It came to $22.75 and this family of three could only put away half of it. So we had enough for lunch the next day. The crust has the same crunchy and delicious texture as Z's. Love that crust. Yeah, so maybe I don't know nuthin' 'bout Chicago pizza, but I do know that I love this crust. I grew up with it! Service was down to earth, youthful and much chirpier than Z's. (I know I should stop comparing the two, but it's hard not to!)You can get 32 oz pitchers of Bud Light for $4 and small glasses for a buck. They also serve Bogle wines, but I didn't spot a cocktail menu. Really enjoyed seeing the wall of photos that show the family. Makes you feel like you're sharing the pizza experience. Yes I'll be back to try another pizza! Once I finish off the first one...

<review# 977,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2011,8/29/2011,98,172,26,22,47>I actually live right around the corner and had no idea what this place was. There's no sign, no posters, nothing, accept that little red open sign. So on my way home everyday I use Boxwood as a quicker way to get to Del Paso, and I always noticed that that place is packed out, any time day or night. One day I stopped in and the door guy asks me for my id (like my bald head doesn't just scream "of age!") Now there are two doors and I'm in between them talking to this fellow, he checks my id then asks me if I know what kind of place this is...I'm like, "No that's why I'm here because this is obviously the place to be..."He says "This is a gay bar...."Now as he says this, he steps to the side and I can actually see inside the club, my eyes were immediately drawn to the huge flat screens playing soft porn. Men of all different sorts were chillin and doing their bar thing. So the door guy sees my reaction, guesses I'm straight and opens the first door again like I wouldn't come in after hearing that.So naturally I go in, and not only do I order a Miller Highlife, I shoot a game of pool. Because you don't try to pigeon hole me into being a certain way. Just because I'm a 27 year old straight black male doesn't mean that I can't, or won't for that matter, set foot into a gay bar...

Yes, anything outside of downtown is a trek in my book.  This is a place where both my orange-chicken-loving kids, and my Hong-Kong-style-chow-mein-loving self can all be gastronomically happy, happy.The combination plates are huge - in addition to your main selection, it comes with soup (hot n' sour or egg flower), rice (bbq pork or steamed), chow mein (the fatter soft noodle kind), and TWO, count em' . . . TWO, yummy crab n' cheese wontons.  I usually order this combination plate with orange chicken and they very delicious Hong Kong style BBQ pork chow mein - which is loaded with veggies and wonderfully large and tasty pork-love.  These two dishes fill us up . . . with plenty of leftovers (except for the orange chicken, which my kids devour).  In addition to my said fondness of the HK chow mein, I also LOVE their salt n' pepper spare ribs and bbq fried rice.  And to top it all off, the service is fast and friendly.They almost make me wish I worked in Elk Grove, just so I could get to sample their lunch specials too.  P.S.  For those with kids in tow.  They have kiddie books nicely placed in a basket at each table - now, that is indeed a nice touch.  Well, it kept my little one's mind off wanting to play with my iPhone . . . Mommy's new toy.
<review# 980,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2009,1/17/2009,257,300,9,8,7>"It'll grow back."  That's what I kept telling myself.  Over the christmas break I convinced my husband that I needed a hair intervention, put scissors in his hands, and let him cut my precious locks.  In my defense, I was fed up with how long my hair was, how it kept getting in the way, the way that one single matted dreadlock kept forming in the back of my head when I'd wear my winter coats.  Also, our winter house is at 4500 feet above sea level, so perhaps I had a touch of altitude sickness.Anyhoo, GT was supposed to cut me some sexy bangs.  I had pictures and grand ideas of what it should look like.  I came away from the mirror with tears in my eyes.  A MULLET!  My husband gave me a mullet.  In the middle of the desert it really doesn't matter what your hair looks like.  So I weathered the mullet with my usual blend of cool blase and utter hysteria, until we got back to Sacramento and after a week of going to work and meeting clients I realized that either the husband or the mullet was going to have to go.  I called around to my usual salon and it was going to take three weeks to see my usual stylist.  Having read the reviews of DEEDA on yelp, and liking the name and the building in which DEEDA is housed* (these things are important to a good haircut, no?) I decided to entrust the fix-job to Karen, haircutting specialist.  Did I mention that I had to go to an art opening at the Crocker that night?  Yes.  I needed good hair, and fast.Poor Karen.  "It'll grow back."  She said, and began surveying the damage.  "Too bad he...um...went so far back...over here..." she said finally.   I chugged some red wine.  Do whatever you think you can to fix it, I said semi-calmly.So she began chopping.  A foot of hair hit the floor.  I bit my bottom lip.  Good god, what am I doing?  "It can't look any worse," I said cheerfully while draining the wineglass.Karen spent an hour working her magic, and I spent the better part of the hour appreciating the stylist stations.  The owner confided that a family member who designs Anthropologie stores assisted in the design, and that the wood is reclaimed from the lumber yard in Oakland.  The building itself is gorgeous inside, with grand old wood ceilings and raw red brick walls.  Back to the mirror:  Karen cut a crapload of hair - and yes I had to keep the tears back - I LOVED my long hair - but as she kept snipping and shortening and layering and fixing, the former mullet turned into a short, bouncy, sexy "do" with great bangs.  I looked fabulous at the Crocker opening (my husband's work was in the exhibition so I needed to look my best), and I looked fabulous at the gym the next evening (critically important to look your best while running on a treadmill), and I looked fabulous at breakfast this morning.  The only stipulation I made for the cut is that I be able to wash it, flip it, and go, and the cut works perfectly with my five-minute-morning-mirror routine.  It isn't every stylist who can take a really horrible whack job like me - I mean like my mullet - and make pretty.  The icing on the cake:  first timers get 10% off, so my better-than-sex haircut cost a measly $40.  Rock!!DEEDA make pretty, thank god.
<review# 981,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2008,1/16/2009,268,316,7,15,14>Ah like it, Ah like it a lot...This place is a cheapskate paradise! Talk about bang for the buck. For $7.50 you get half a chicken, rice, and a side. A full rotisserie chicken is like $7 right? and doesn't nearly taste as good! Lumpia is 4 for $2.50 and this fried plaintain & jackfruit called turon is only a buck for 2. The value here is outstanding.I was able to order two combos in a way to try many things. We were able to try the following: grilled chicken, fried chicken, longanisa, pork lumpia, and fried rice. I added on a turon to try since the kids like fried banana in the past.The chicken was very good overall. I preferred the grilled chicken over the fried actually. I think the reason is because the fried chicken is very similar to the crispy skin chicken you get at chinese restaurants, so the flavor was familiar. Each type of chicken comes with a different sauce. The grilled comes with a sweet BBQ sauce which was awesome. The fried comes with a thicker gravy type sauce which reminded me of american brown gravy but had some added flavors, possibly anise? The meat was moist and the breast meat was not too dry. The grilled chicken was marinated nicely and had lots of flavor. The crispy chicken skin was just that, crispy and tasty.The lumpia came with a sweet and sour dipping sauce and were most excellente. The longanisa was sweet, moist, and superb. I could eat these sausages all day long. I would recommend the fried rice over the steamed rice. it was not "fried well" in the sense that it was still very moist and fluffy. It had peas and carrots in it and a light flavor which didn't compete with the rest of the meal. Let's say it is lightly fried. I didn't eat much of the Turon but one bite was sweet and crispy and the kids seemed to enjoy it.Service was friendly and courteous. I went at an odd time (4pm, Tues) and the place was empty. They prepared my food fresh so it took 5-10 min to get it, but I'm definitely happy to wait for food cooked to order.Once again I must emphasize the bang for the buck. We fed a family of 4 for under $20 and had a little bit of leftovers to boot. Get over there and bring your pocket change, you'll love the value!
<review# 982,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/7/2009,1/15/2009,15,29,2,4,5>It's too bad there's not more demand for what they do, because I feel like this joint could be better. The meat pies themselves are phenomenal. Greasy, meaty, dough-y good. However, the dine-in options are so limited. They didn't have black pudding to go (got held up at customs), no Irn-Bru, and I had to get the Haggis to go. Will report on the Haggis after this weekend. The folks are super duper nice, which is a big plus.

People/bands from out of town that I want to show the child abuse clown to2. People I've drunkenly slept with that I have no intention of ever speaking to againSince PC  is roughly a block and a half from my house, it's ideal to walk to after a night of booze-soaked debauchery.  It's unintentional crapness is usually enough to impress any kitsch-hungry out-of-towner and always makes me proud of my wonky little city.As far as the food goes, stick with breakfast items.  It's called Pancake Circus, not Tuna Melt Circus or Meatloaf Circus, and there's good reason for that.  I prefer the Spanish Omlette with Sour Cream, and a side of pancakes.  The waffles are excellent as well, and the prices are fair for what you get.Now if we can just get all the waitresses to change their names to "Flo" and "Marge"...

Their burritos are good for lunch or dinner (and they come at an affordable price). If you have a group that wants to eat the same thing with you, you can always do the Giant Super Burrito, which can feed four people.I once ate it all by myself so I could make their "wall of fame." This "wall" is filled with pictures of people who finished off the entire Giant Super Burrito. Well, when I finished, the girl working the register took my picture with a disposable camera and it had no flash. My picture is still not up on that wall, which means I will have try to accomplish that feat one more time.Anyway, if you want some real Mexican food with some kick, this is the place to go to in Davis.
<review# 986,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2008,1/11/2009,8,40,3,4,5>As a rule, it's best not to try and show up last minute for flowers on those special occasions when said items are in high demand. Nevertheless, my ability to follow such simple rules seems to have been impaired recently, and as such, I found myself milling around East Sacramento in the very situation I knew better not to be in.In my quest, I happened upon Stems. The aptly named little store did not disappoint. Despite a diminished selection, obviously depleted from the run on supply of the previous day, I managed to select (with some assistance) a beautiful and diverse arrangement of some really fresh and colorful flowers (gladiolas, berberas, roses, heather, snapdragons, etc.). Most of Stems' prices are listed on a sign behind the counter, and glancing at it, it was clear that I wasn't going to be leaving without ponying up some major coin since this was a fairly large assortment of flowers. I had a pretty good idea of what this arrangement might cost, but figured I'd wait to see what they came back with as a total for everything we had pulled together. After just a few minutes, I was informed that since I was practically cleaning out her stock of various varieties, she'd be nice enough to give me a bouquet price, rather than a piece by piece price, which clearly would have been more expensive. The flowers came wrapped very nicely, and have so far held up well in the vase.  While you are waiting for your flowers to be arranged, you can browse the various gifts in the store (soaps, vases, etc.) All in all, very pleased.I'll update once I give them some time to break in...

I ordered the green chicken curry with rice, and it was sublime - a thin curry, which I prefer, with lots of tender slow-cooked chicken.The best dish, though, was the crab fried rice: the serving was not enormous, but that's because it was perhaps 50% lump crab meat! And ... FRESH! It was wonderful, rich, flavorful, and I would be happy to eat it every week.This is one of my new favorites, and I hope enough of you decide to try it out so that it sticks around - even if only for my sake.
<review# 990,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/17/2007,8/23/2008,63,181,10,4,6>As a first-timer AND out-of-towner at Old Soul Co. on Saturday (thanks for the forewarning, Gretchen), I was determined to mask all of my confusion regarding the MO at the counter and feign the seasoned confidence of an L Street alley cat so as to avoid becoming the object of paralyzing ridicule by staff and patrons alike. I had a Sacramento resident and occasional Old Soul customer at my side should I happen to fumble and need guidance, or drop my change all over the floor in fit of anxiety, stoop over to pick it up, whack my head on the rolling pastry shelf and require medical assistance.Fortunately the scene and service I experienced were nothing like this. The lone patron holding court (or, rather, couch) was a laptop- engrossed gentleman who looked up and smiled, and the girl who helped us was a little shy, a little charming and a little apologetic for her inability to answer all of our questions. I won't hold the last against her as admittedly we grilled her with some tough ones. For instance, "What is it, besides the artificial food coloring, that makes red velvet cake so darn alluring?"Of course the red velvet cupcakes had sold out (and they're not my thing anyway) and, in fact, every baked good had sold out with exception of an attractive quiche in a cast iron pan and what looked like the last double chocolate chip cookie. "Looked like", I say, because of the lack of signage, but it looked good and it's what we ordered and attempted to split into two equal-size edible portions.  "Did she just take the bigger half for herself?!" the little bit shy, little bit charming and little bit apologetic girl said to me, proving herself a little bit funny, too.The Old Soul mocha is my reason #3, or at least my Sacramento reason, to ditch the Peet's mocha when I'm in town. Smooth and mellow without sacrificing flavor. A really, really good one.The full baked goods menu looks promising. (Well, again, I didn't look at anything; a physical menu doesn't exist and there was no product to behold, but I could sense it -- the cookie we sampled was top rate.) I look forward to returning and sampling more of it in the comfortable, low key environment that Old Soul provides.May the future old lady in me never usurp my old soul.
<review# 991,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2008,8/22/2008,464,293,24,9,11>Being a drunkard means having grand illusions about what drunkenness is and does, and a lot of romanticizing about alcohol and perhaps some of the good times you have had while boozing. You know what I mean - you think about that cold glass of beer and how refreshed and glamorous you will feel, sipping a cold one and laying out on a boat in your bikini. 6 hours later you are sun burnt, have a mild concussion from hitting your head on the boat motor, and are lying in a fetal position in a pool of your own vomit trying to figure out where you are.Fantasy versus reality I suppose is a good way to put it.This sentiment pretty much sums up the Depot for me: when I think about the Depot, it seems like a really fun place in my mind, filled with pool games, drag queens, Depeche Mode videos, $2 you call its, a robust smoking section, bad ass trivia on Wednesdays....When I get this giddy sentiment, I go to the Depot and am seriously let down. The queens don't do their makeup very well, the video bar is more uber gay Erasure than kinda gay Depeche Mode and the toilets reek. Like that girl lying sun burnt and cold on the bathroom floor, the Depot leaves me wishing I'd stayed home.Don't get me wrong - I like the bar. Everything is just less fun than I imagine. I really like the concept of a video bar - it gives you a good source of entertainment while you imbibe, ranging from old SNL skits to new Justin Timberlake videos and everything in between. Oh, and the drinks are strong. Real strong. And the Happy Hour is happy. And the smoking patio is smokin! I am really torn I guess. I cant even give this place less than 5 stars because in my head I love it so much. I think maybe there is some dead indian burial ground underneath the Depot, or the corner of 20th and K has some mystical latitude and longitude that drives me to worship this place....I feel like Im rambling....I need a drink!

I had heard this legend about a place where servers endlessly come by your table with "swords of meat" ready to be sliced for your consumption. And my first time at By Brazil didn't disappoint. Since then, I've been to a handful of other Brazilian steakhouses, ALL in SoCal. So when I heard a "churrascaria" opened up in our very own Sacramento...I HAD to visit it.At first glace Taste of Brazil isn't in the best location. It's right next to a money loan center, a "Flaky Cream Donut" shop, Weiner Works and an 7th Day Adventist Book Store (which along with books and CD's also sells vegetarian food -- curiously amusing to me). And the restaurant itself is pretty small. They've done a good job with the space they have, but I hope that the restaurant does well enough to move to a better location/space.There isn't too much to rave about in the hot/cold salad bar area. Two kinds of rice, two kinds of beans, some salmon, greens and a pretty bare salad bar. But we weren't really there for their buffet area, so after we got our instructions, we went to the hot buffet, piled on the rice and beans and waited for the "swords of meat" to come. And come they did...The "gauchos" or servers came out in rapid-fire succession. "Excuse me sir, would you like some (enter meat of choice)?" Chicken, sausage, pork loin, pork loin encrusted with parmesan cheese, top sirloin, beef ribs, pork ribs, filet mignon wrapped in bacon, chicken breast wrapped in bacon, bottom sirloin, leg of lamb and the prized "picanha" or "rump cover". All of them slow-cooked on a rotisserie seasoned with kosher salt and garlic. The meat came out so fast, half-way through the meal I ran out of rice but I didn't want to get up for fear of missing the server walking around with filet mignon wrapped in bacon!Almost all of the meat was delicious! My favorites were the top sirloin, the bottom sirloin, the filet mignon wrapped in bacon and the picanha. Bits of kosher salt encrusted the edges of the meats and when sliced the juices and fat dripped down the sword. The cuts came out perfectly medium-rare and tender in the middle, with just enough seasoning to compliment and not take away from the taste of the meat. The chicken and the sausage both underperformed compared to the other Brazilian steakhouses I've been to, but that just meant the next time the servers came around with those meats I graciously declined.At the end of the night, I was stuffed and satisfied.Even though the salad bar was unimpressive, the service and the meat were amazing. It's definitely a lot of money at $29.95 for a weeknight dinner, but it's definitely worth it at least once. If anything it's worth it just to have an evening where your own table becomes the personal carving station for three different carvers and twelve different meats.

Even good restaurants didn't strike his fancy. After summer break he would come back plus 15 to 20 pounds muttering about the sad state of food outside Turkey.I don't really agree with him, but having eaten here I see where he got the idea.The meats, whether stewed or grilled, are amazingly savory and rich. Appetizers continue the trend, as my hummus was amazing and my lunchmate's eggplant even more amazing.Those of you that don't like lamb... you will enjoy it here.The reason I'm giving this place three stars instead of four is because the prices are atrociously high. I would not consider this place a good deal at any time except for lunch where you can get the 12 dollar prix fixe which is a great deal.
<review# 996,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2008,8/17/2008,10,2,3,2,5>A club sandwich is a simple, almost trivial thing. You can buy one anywhere. A reliably mediocre, safe choice when faced with a strange, untested menu. And that's what I was presented with at Corti Brothers, a venerable Italian grocery store where about half of the entire floor space appears to have been dedicated to its gargantuan deli counter.If the phrase "independent, Italian grocery store/deli/wineshop" tingles your yuppy-sense, use caution. The neighborhood, though I'm sure is perfectly safe and friendly, isn't what I'd call picturesque. The store's flickering flourescent-backlit signage gives the joint a certain dilapidated and abandoned feel. Inside of the store is clearly managed by someone who cares so much about stocking the shelves with the good stuff, that he spent $0 on decoration or renovation. And the whole place had a kind of turn of the century smell to it, and I don't mean year 2000. They happened to be closing soon when I had just gotten there, but I doubt I wanted to hang out there for much longer anyway.So, instead of spending hours trying to decipher the myriad of choices offered at their massive deli counter, I decided to play it safe and run away. Rather than finding out more about the dazzling, exotic, and some dubious items on display, I ordered what they called a "French Club Sandwich". And in five minutes, I was out of there, headed back to my hotel room, to consume what was surely a safe, predictably mediocre dinner.Holy mother of God, was I wrong. Juicy, full of different textures, bursting with flavor, it immediately made me regret years I wasted eating anything else. Here I am, two weeks later, and it brings tears to my eyes, just writing about it. Never before in human history have smoked turkey, Jarlbourg cheese, thick crisp strips of feather-light bacon, and velvety home-made mayo conspired together to form this awe-inspiring thing, this sublime beauty, this thing that is surely from heaven, but sold in a smelly run-down grocery store in a crap-hole of a stripmall.If you happen to be in Sacramento, give it a try. Do try to ignore the fact that it's not pretty. Do try to overlook the fact that the fanciest joint in the vicinity is a taco bell. Your patience will be rewarded once you get to the deli section. Do try their wonderful offerings, some familiar, some exotic, full of colors, shapes and smells. If you just wanna grab something and run, may I recommend the French Club Sandiwich?

I know, I'm being a bit cantankerous. Come on people, get it together. I tried the Dolmas (of course), the Taramaki (Tarama in Turkish), Humus and a gyros salad. My companion had the Greek hamburger patties. The gyros Salad was OK. I'm glad I got the dressing on the side. Also you can't really mess up lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and meat on a plate. The Dolmas were only OK. I couldn't tell if they were canned, but they were so bland I wanted to cry. The Tarama I Was excited to try since it's a food of my childhood. It was so salty that I couldn't eat it, and guess what...it's from a jar. Yea A JAR. No thanks, Tamara is only best when made fresh. No wonder if was so salty. The humus was OK. The hamburger patties were pretty good, but dry. Of course if you put enough spices on something you can hide a lot. I'll eat here again for a gyros place I guess, but I'm not going to try to get anything else. I'll just be frustrated and angry I am spending money on things I can make better at home. It's decent for people who are not familiar with Mediterranean or Greek fast foods. The Pros, It's clean, it's open late, and in an convenient location to walk to. Con, Canned fast food type of food. Tastes OK, but not awesome. Hard to find parking.
<review# 1000,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2010,10/15/2010,3276,1443,10,15,13>THE GATEWAY TO MY DREAM TRIPS AND WORK JUNKETS!  I fly a lot in my job with the State of California since I train our Licensing Enforcement and Investigator staff all over the State.  I also visit family and college buddies in Portland, Seattle and Vancouver, and I head back East to visit old flames and high school memories back in D.C., Baltimore, Phillie and NYC.  So opportunities present themselves QUITE frequently to check out a LOT of other airports.  [BTW, I hold a SouthWest Airlines COMPANION PASS status to those in the know....]THE SIT-REP  (Situation-Report)At LAX, I find nothing but congestion and chaos (it's a ridiculous 20 minute "Tijuana taxi-ride" just to get to most of the car rental agencies).  SFO is subject to constant TCA delays.  OAK is a bit better than SFO, but if the Bay Area is slammed by massive traffic problems, it's a massive headache no matter which airport you try to get to.  Both Reagan (D.C.) and John Wayne (Orange County) are subject to restrictive noise reduction / take-off angles that leave your stomach back on the ground. And there just isn't enough room to write here about (1) the "cesspool" known as JFK airport (though apologies to the awesome president it is named after), where you could very well find yourself sitting in a jet on the tarmac and/or taxiway for HOURS waiting for the Control Tower to realign it's prioritizations between domestics flights and a sudden congested influx of international flights; nor (2) the "cesspool" known as London's Heathrow where jaded, petty, sullen Security personnel can "imprison" you in their "guest facilities" because they don't like the way your VISA looks and then they send your ass back stateside that unnecessarily costs the passenger large sums of money to re-process, only to find out that if you had gotten another English security officer, there would have been no problem to begin with.   (Quick fix here?  Fly into PARIS, and chunnel over to England - avoid the aggravation).  Anyways, I DIGRESS since this is supposed to be about SMF....  Let me just say that Sacramento is very very VERY lucky to have an airport as clean, efficient, professional, well-infrastructured, and as easily-accessible as SMF.    Yeah, SEATAC might be BIGGER & BETTER with a really cool ATRIUM full of restaurants, vendors and shops, but SMF has a really nice atrium area as well and you don't have to walk nearly 1/4 of the distance to get to your gate.  SMF also follows the LAS VEGAS (McCarran) and ONTARIO airport models of having a separate Rental Car Terminal which makes it easier to switch agencies at the last minute or to get a replacement if overbooked. Because some people may travel infrequently, they may be more impressed with how BIG an airport is, how many SHOPS and EATERIES are in the airport, and how incredibly awesome the DECOR and ARCHITECTURE look.  NOT ME.  I measure "How awesome an airport is" in terms of TIME, and to be more specific, time SAVED in traveling:CORE CONSIDERATIONS:*  How fast can I get between an airport and the local downtown area?*  How fast can I get from the Long-term Parking / Rental Agency to the Airport Terminal?*  How fast can I get through Luggage Check-In?*  How fast can I get through Security?*  How fast can I get from Security to the Departing Gate?*  How many / How close are the Restrooms / Starbucks on the way to the Gate?  (Yeah, I know I know, even as I'm "relieving" my body of a resevoir of one kind of fluid, I'm already thinking how to fill it up again!  I just really really need my caffiene sometimes!  Especially if I have been hitting a fancy schmancy club until 2AM and still have to do the zombie-walk of shame to the airline gate by 7AM...*yawn* )Some extra considerations:*  If there IS significant waiting / downtime, is there FREE WIFI to be utilized with my wireless-enabled laptop?  [And this is why I give SMF a high 95% and BUR only an 85% - there is NO FREE Wifi in Burbank.  "Shame, Bob Hope Airport, shame!"]*  If need be, I can take the YOLOBUS 42A and 42B between downtown Sacramento and the airport for only $2.  Beats any $40 cab ride any day of the week.  The only better bus option exists from downtown Seattle to SEATAC for $1.75.  (But Seattle has no free wifi either (unless you sneak it from the Admiral's Lounge while sitting in the far far Starbucks in the C Terminal - hence only 85% also).THE LOWDOWNThus SMF remains my favorite airport to travel into and out of and I look forward to the day when we can take a trip together to SoCal or even back East to a NYE in NYC, or break out the speedos in Miami, oh yeah!  Second thought, I think I am a more stylish, better dresser in FRIGID weather...

Sure it's also nice to get good service from time to time and be able to order liter size beers, but it's all about the food with this place.     I recommend that first time patrons order a 1/2 pound Kobe burger with either garlic or carne asada fries. This artery clogging delicacy with its juicy meat that melts in your mouth like an oral escapade is sure to please even the sluttiest critics. Flaming Grill serves up 10 different kinds of meat like elk and buffalo, but also offers feathery options such as ostrich and chicken.     ...if you like it big(that's what she said), delicious(that's what she said), and filling(...ehem), then flaming grill is the place for you!

Holy smokes!  They were slammed with flavor, extremely savory.  The soft tortilla was not overburdened by too much stuff going on - just the right amount... but the flavor!  It was like an explosion in my mouth.  You gotta try these puppies!  I also purchased a "Vietnamese Bahn Mi Sandwich" for $10.  Galangal (which is a root that looks like ginger but has less of a peppery taste than ginger and more of a citrus influence), kafir lime and lemongrass marinated mushroom with pickled daikon, shredded carrot, cilantro and ginger sriracha mayo all stuffed into a baquette.  Delish!  Everything I've ever wanted in my Bahn Mi, just no meat.  What a freakin' concept. It's served with Potato Wedges which were great, but I was focused on the sandwich.  I also ordered a Blueberry Lemonade (fresh squeezed) for $2.50 which was wonderfully refreshing.    To produce great flavors without utilizing a meat product is a talent.  They have succeeded here at Sugar Plum.  The menu is extensive for what I thought was a vegan bakery and I can't wait to get my rear back in there and try every darn thing on their menu.  You can check out their website for a menu along with descriptions of each item.  Really delicious fodder that is somewhat expensive, but, for me at least, well worth the extra $2-3 that I would have spent somewhere else.  So, go on... treat yourself.  You never know unless you try!Shout out to Melissa (the owner) who was super accommodating, answered all my fifty questions with a smile and even... whoa... genuinely  thanked me for coming in!  I know, I know!  Can you believe it?Enjoy and thanks for reading!

They caught said dude within a half hour and had my roommate and me identify him.

OK so I gave a 5 star, and Santouka got a 5 too, but Santouka pwns them all, but it's not in Sacto, so does this make sense?I had the house special ramen, large, and boy was it special and large. Usually at the other places I find myself a little hungry afterwards, but wow I could barely finish this one! The broth was very tasty and rich in flavor, it reminded me of the Santouka Shio, which I absolutely adore. Nice touches included half a boiled egg, with that slightly undercooked yolk that is just oh so special, and a curled piece of calamari with this spicy fish sauce embedded within the roll. One thing missing was the shinachiku, which I was slightly sorrowful over, but I got over it once I started delving into the noodles. Noodles were firm yet tender, with enough snappiness to deflect any criticisms. The chashu was fatty, moist, and firm enough not to break apart as you pick it up. And the piece de resistance, you don't get this ordinary asian white spoon, you get the super deluxe giant wooden ladle! There's not other way to drink your broth in style.We tried the shrimp and asparagus yakitori and both were grilled and seasoned nicely. Are you hungry yet?Service was great. The waitress was very friendly and great with the kiddos. She was able to encourage one of them to eat by bribing with some dessert.The menu is simple which makes it easy to order.

This resulted in my turning 24 and no longer being allowed to drink. Kind of adds insult to injury. Rather than order another Shirley Temple and embarrass my poor roomie the way I had delighted in doing at 3 Fires, I stuck to Coke. Which was a bummer. I wanted a martini. And judging from the state that roomie was in after her second kamikaze, I wanted one of those too. I'm guessing they make their drinks strong. Getting down to business, now...the waitress was super sweet. She was obviously regretful at not being able to serve me alcohol, and made sure my Coke glass stayed full. I actually ended up getting sugar-drunk. And the happy hour appetizers were yum-o. We had a $4, $5, and $6 plate. The macaroni and cheese was creamy and flavorful, with nary a hint of Velveeta in sight. The mixed fry was okay, though I would have preferred more tempura shrimp and less of the green beans and onions. It ended up being a bit too heavy and greasy....then again, it was a basket of deep-fried stuff. My favorite, however, was the ahi poke. Ohhhh so good. Fresh fresh fresh with the perfect kick to it, laced with avocado. And I'm pretty sure the potato chips it came with were homemade. And if they weren't, I don't want to know. I'm looking forward to coming back to try the trio of fries. I've definitely had a good experience with the happy hour small plates (and the desserts sound delicious), and now I really just need to try one of their drinks. And since I finally got my act together and renewed my license, they'll be seeing more of me soon.

Silva's Sheldon Inn is quaint and country bistro feeling, like a restaurant in Sheldon (where you can still find horse stables and guys in chaps) should have. The food however is top notch. Their house specialty is the Portuguese Beef Skewer appetizer, and it is a MUST try! The meat is so tender and well seasoned your mouth will water when you bite into it. Their appetizer menu also includes Baked Brie, Prawn Tostada's and Dungeness Crab Cakes. The sauce on the Crab Cakes will make you feel like you are on drugs...absolutely heavenly.Everything was amazing; to be honest, this was one of the best meals I have had in a long time.

I just got back from having lunch here and couldn't hardly wait to let everyone know how good it was. I had read all the reviews, it was on my list of places to get to. Then last night I ran into the owner and his son in Nagato Sukiyaki(I eat out alot what can I say) super nice people, and it sealed the deal. Don, the sushi chef, tells me to try it. Thank you Don. They have a ton of different burgers, I went with a bacon cheddar but not beef, they have buffalo, hell yeah. Burgers come with fries, not like at some places where you have to order them separate, which is a pet peeve. And to top it off, a Ginormous beer. They have a great selection of beers and the one I got served was as cold as can be(can you tell I was starting to like this place). The burger shows up and I realize why the guy across from me is leaving with a to go box. The bun is perfect soft inside to soak up the good stuff crusty exterior but not to much so. 2 thick slices of bacon and a little crispy cheese from where the Cheddar cooked up on the grill. The veggies were fresh, tomato was perfect. The guys kid brought me a knife and told me to cut the thing in half, great tip! The salty bacon played perfectly against the fatty cheesy burgery-ness. Stuffed to the gills by the end of this thing. Don't pay attention to the location, dont be a snob, who cares that you sit outside, its a burger joint. Put your best pair of flip flops on, find a place to sit, toss back a couple super cold beers and kill a fat burger. Cheers.

I could eat just that sauce over rice if i could.The carnitas was up there too, but I've got a penchant for the carnitas at La Favorita. I've tried the Machaca before and it was decent but not outstanding.The decor is what I would call Mexican Kitsch. Reminds me very much of the restaurants I frequent when in Tucson. My dad said it reminded him of the inside of a cruise ship. I think it contributes to the down home feeling, and reduces any chance of pompousness from the establishment.No reservations might make it tough to get a table during peak times, which is why I do the early bird. They've made their parking lot el giganto, so no problemo there.Try it, like it, and this ain't no bull.
<review# 1011,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2010,7/22/2010,100,90,11,5,9>I get flat tires a lot. It's kinda my thing. Some girls get all the guys. I get all the flats. And my father totally loves it when I call and cry to him each time it happens. Yes, I'm that girl. And yes, for the record, he has attempted to teach me to change a tire several times. I'm just too scared to do it. I'm afraid I'll screw it up and my tire will pop off on the freeway or something. Anyway, Andre's my man. The first time we met, I had called him over to my apartment because I'd discovered my flat in the morning while trying to leave for work (okay, my neighbor discovered it. I'm that oblivious.) At first I wasn't too hot on him- I felt like he was being condescending because he thought I was your typical little prissy girl who knows squat about cars (only half true, thank you!) As he was discussing my tire options with me, however, he ended up being a totally stand-up guy and even led the way to a tire shop as I followed slowly  on my spare tire. Not only that, but he hung around while my tire was being replaced and talked to the guys to make sure I was getting what I needed. Completely above and beyond. Our second rendezvous was the result of my managing to run over something sharp on Alhambra Blvd. I was stranded in a parking lot (on the way to an interview, which was really special) and hadn't even realized that I'd called the same place until Andre reappeared. Since it had only been a couple of months since my last flat, we recognized each other and the reunion was joyous. Well, for me, anyway, since I knew I was in good hands. He's completely professional and friendly, and explains car stuff to me in layman's terms, which I've discovered is not so condescending after all. Tonight, a full THREE weeks after my last flat, what do you think happens as roomie and I are trying to pull out of the Target parking lot? Yep. Another flat. My fourth one in three months. All of my tires have been flat now. It's really cute. Anyway, Andre was off work so they sent Steven. I didn't want to like him because I have trust issues and have become very attached to Andre, but he ended up being really nice and efficient as well, and after we drove off, he even followed us over to the gas station across the street just to check up on us as we struggled to put air in my tires (novel concept, I know) in a dark alley in the back. Now, if you know me you know I'm not exactly a fan of men thinking women are helpless little creatures or that we need to be looked after and have heavy things carried for us. I go dutch on my dates, I lecture my students on the difference between "Ms." and "Miss"...I'm getting my Master's in Gender Equity for heaven's sake. HOWEVER....however....the fact of the matter is that we are two young, smallish women who don't exactly look like we're packing heat. We were in a dark lot- at night- behind a gas station, completely out of view of the street in not the most amazing part of town. And we obviously do not know much about car maintenance....not because we're women, mind you, but because we just don't. So I very much appreciated Steven's presence, and felt it was very courteous of him to make sure we made it home okay. So in conclusion, four stars for Andrews. Unfortunately, gotta knock them a star because the guy who answered the phone tonight was not at all helpful and forgot to ask me the make and model of my car (kind of helpful in a full parking lot) and my phone number. It sounded like he was giggling with his buddies instead of doing his damn job...I actually had to call him back to make sure he got my information. But I can deal, because that guy isn't the one helping me on the road anyway. So Andrews will remain my go-to for all my tire-changing needs. See you in probably about a week or so, guys!

What gets me going here are the DJs that swing through.  They are crazy.  Crazy good that is. I have an appreciation for Level Up.If you're tired of Top 40 and wanna dance to real Hip Hop and a few break beats, consider this place.  Let's just say that most DJs at Level Up are bound to give you a taste of Mos, Common or  Roots, then drop some SWV on you.  Then they'll kick it back up to something like KRS-One and a Busta Rhymes oldie.  Maybe you just wanna chill with a strong drink in hand while bobbin' your head to some real beats.  You can do that here.  The thing is, I have yet to get a hold of their DJ schedule (if there is one).  I've come in and left immediately on some occasions when I've heard nothing but mind numbing rave music, and stopped in for a few hours when the music was just right.  Maybe having DJ Riff Raff was just pure luck for the one Saturday night.  DJ SourMonkey (lol, what a name.  He's an old buddy of mine, so I won't tease too much) spins on Thursdays, I believe, and mixes both underground and Top 40.  No, you're not going to find a crap load of scantily clad girls romping around and freak dancing all night ('cause that's the only way some girls know how to dance),  or about a hundred guys practically wearing the same button-down shirt.   The crowd here is sometimes large, sometimes small, but quite diverse. You'll probably get a glimpse of some real dancing, too.       Well, I'm gonna figure this out and let you know.  I have faith in you, Level Up!  Keep bringing the good shiz.

Mix in some Soju and you have yourself a good time. But how... how can I have this in Sacramento?!Well, first stop... Koreana Market. Looking like a modified version of your local safeway, inside you'll find a decent selection of Seoul Food items. This is my go too place when I get a craving for Maxim instant coffee, or itching for a decent selection of K-Ramen. Major Manufacturer Kimchi, with their own concoction Kimchi there as well... not too shabby.Also, since Sactown is known for having a Russian enclave or two, they also carry enough Russian foodstuffs to knock out two pelmeni's with one perogi. I don't know enough about Russian cuisine to say if the stuff is all good or all encompassing, but having sampled some of the fares for offer here, not too shabby (considering I have to cook it myself).All in all, it's a not too scary place for those looking to dip their toes in to Korean food. It's not as jammed pack with K-goodness as I'm used to in my SoCal markets, but the variety here is more then enough to make up.Also, I didn't have any problems with the produce here, on any of my visits. Then again, I might just have good luck in that department. Anyway, I'll be coming here for the foreseeable future. Now if only it were a little closer to midtown...
<review# 1015,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/20/2010,7/18/2010,307,75,4,17,18>I can't think of a better choice as my first review on Yelp than my alma mater.  And boy... do I have A LOT to say, so bear with me and I promise my insight will be somewhat useful (I hope).We all have our reasons for picking the college we want to go to -- for me and my upbringing (aka "b/c I'm Asian" lol), I had to go for the best ranked school I got accepted to and for me that was Davis.  I was born and raised near Long Beach, true SoCal girl and had NO CLUE what I had gotten myself into.  Needless to say, I was miserable my freshman year.  BUT NOW, having gone through 4 years and a quarter at UC Davis, I am so proud to call myself an Aggie.  The secret?  Find your niche.  Curious about a campus club/job, an internship, Greek life? GO FOR IT!  If you don't try for it, you might regret it, and who really wants to be THAT person 10 years after graduating going "Man, I wish I had done this and that in college!"As an undergrad, I was like super UCD girl sans cape/secret identity.  I worked at the Coffee House, the "food court" at the center of campus and The California Aggie, the school's student-run newspaper.  After I attended my first football game, back in the day of Toomey Field, I was hooked on Aggie athletics and eventually found my way to an internship with their marketing and promotions department, aka "Aggie Pack."  I also joined a sorority but please don't think of me in THAT way.  Yes indeedy, I almost did it all!  Aside from what I got to do, UC Davis offers their students SO much more and I assure you that you too will be able to find your thing, as long as you don't let hesitation or fear get in the way.  College is all about figuring out who you are and meeting new people -- UC DAVIS is one of the BEST places to help you do that.  We're a big campus but we have a small town/cozy feel.THE OC'S FINAL THOUGHTS:- GREEK LIFE:  It's not for everyone but determine that on your own and not from other people's opinions and stereotypes.  Like with any stereotype, they're there b/c it may be true but not everyone follows the stereotype (aka me, the Asian -- I didn't get the best grades and my study habits were HORRIBLE, but hey, "C's earn degrees!" lol).  I went through Formal Recruitment which is held in the fall before classes start and I checked out all 8 national sororities.  Yes, I joined a "white sorority" but if you're more comfy with a cultural greek house, Davis has many to choose from for both girls and guys.- AGGIE SPORTS:  I am so proud that Davis finally has a really cool football stadium.  Don't miss out on these games FREE FOR STUDENTS.  Don't forget to check out men's/women's bball in the Winter too.  At these games, the student sections are packed with cheering fans and Aggie Pack tosses out free stuff all the time!  You might get to catch a pair of Aggie tubesocks (they're tubular!) or even score a WHOLE pizza (to share with your fellow Aggies, of course).- DORM LIFE:  #1 Tip:  Avoid "dormcest" as much as possible.  "Dormcest" is basically hooking up/dating someone in your dorm.  You can only imagine how awkward it'll be if the relationship doesn't last till you guys move out at the end of the year. So be careful!  #2 Tip: Don't be afraid to leave your door open when you're chillin in your room.  People WILL walk by and say hi or stop by to hang out.- THE COW SMELL:  Yes, Davis has a dairy barn on campus (in fact, I lived in the dorms right next to them, Tercero).  No, by living in Tercero your clothes will not smell like cow.  The whole town kinda smells like cow during certain times of the year and it's sad to say but... you kinda get used to it after a while (I think).- THE NIGHTLIFE:  "CHUG CHUG CHUG!"  Yes, there are parties almost every weekend.  We DO have a "Fraternity Row."  But be careful, Davis Cops do enjoy breaking them up SUPER early and it really doesn't help when the freshmen walk in HUGE groups down the street -- it's like drawing a bullseye for the po-po.  Yes, the cops CAN/WILL ticket you for a BUI -- biking under the influence.  ** Disclaimer ** -- I am not promoting/encouraging or condemning underage drinking (we all know it happens in college).  For those of age, there is downtown Davis, scattered with bars here and there, some popular ones being Froggy's (a personal fave of mine) and Ket-Moh-Ree, a Thai restaurant by day and a "clubbish/bar" by night.- YOUR MAJOR:  I majored in psychology with a bio emphasis and minored in exercise biology.  What am I doing now?  Trying to get into marketing/advertising.  I know grades are pretty important but don't try to stress over it too much.  Chances are, if you aren't trying to go to med school, law school, etc... your grades aren't the end of the world.  Don't let a crappy professor define who you are and label intelligence or lack there of.Remember... it's up to you to make the most out of college, whether you choose to go to UC Davis or not.

You plug it in and it does cool stuff on all types of material. Yeah, whatever.So I found a coupon online to get 20% off one item and off we went. Located in a depressing strip mall, it is next to the Twice as Nice Furniture shop and SaveMart grocery store.The prices here are very reasonable. I don't know about the quality, we'll see how long this tool lasts. But you can find everything from your standard wrench sets to car jacks to LED flashlights to gaudy garden gnomes. It's not huge like a home depot, but much smaller -- like Trader Joe's. Sign up for their mailing/email list and get sent their special coupons. I was very tempted to pick up a 10-pack of stainless steel solar lights for the yard. It was only $20, but I didn't know how bright they were. I did buy a small wire cutter for $2 to do my jewelry. No, you can't buy bathroom fixtures, tiles or pipes here, but there is a little something here for the DIY in everyone.

<review# 1020,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2009,3/4/2009,57,111,5,5,6>Happy Cows make Happy Burgers!I recently found myself at Burgers and Brew (Pillbug wasnt there this time) this past weekend.  At first  I was a little hesistant to be paying around 10 bucks for a burger.  After all, how good can a burger really be? Low and behold...JUDGEMENT FAIL!  This was actually one of the better burgers I've ever tried in my life.  Trust me, I've tried a lot.  I ordered the bacon jalepeno burger and man....this burger is frickin HUGE!  I think what caught me by surprise was the fact that the bun on the bottom was crispy as opposed to the typical softy bun that breaks apart easily.  The bottom bun was crunchy so it added a nice little twist to the burger.  The patty was moist and had some nice seasoning.  This isnt your typical bland patty thats pulled out of the freezer  like most other places.  My only disappointment with this burger was that given that its a jalepeno burger, I was expecting a bit more spice.  I do enjoy my spicy food.  =)The garlic fries that came along with the burger is nothing too special but I did ask them to put some chili on top of it.  I was feeling experimental that night. It wasnt too bad but nothing worth bragging about.  I think what really surprised me was the milkshake.  Although its not on the menu, you can ask for a neapolitan milkshake and they will make it for you.  It took some time to come out but man was it worth it.  It really hit the spot after packing down that monstrosity of a burger.  Nice way to end the meal.All in all, if I was looking for a good burger, this would be one of those places that come to mind.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.  Maybe I'll take Pillbug here one day...

Everything you get there - conchas, empanadas, cookies, cakes - is delicious and fresh.  And everything is very inexpensive - a dozen assorted pan dulces is cheaper than a dozen donuts.The "bisquetes" are especially wonderful - these are slightly sweet biscuits that can be heated in a toaster overn at home and served with butter or jam for brunch treat or midnight snack. I think they are better than the famous Los Bisquets Obregon in Mexico City. I'll say it.La Esperanza also sells soy chorizo in the refrigerator case - it's much better and cheaper than the kind they sell at Sac Food Co-op. It's not "healthy" (still has around 14 grams of fat per serving) but it is vegetarian, and has less than half the fat of regular chorizo.

So glad when I saw a recommendation for Hair Plaza on a yelp thread yesterday.Sweta was very nice, very quiet. She almost seemed surprised when I walked in and asked for threading. I told her that I found her on Yelp and she asked that I write the website down for her. I hope she gets more business after this review because she really does quality work.Her mother in law, Vijya also does threading in the same shop.My eyebrows have grown in for about two months now. I pluck the strays but I'm afraid to mess with the shaping because I've been known to demolish my eyebrows. I was waiting until my next visit back home so that I could stop by and have my eyebrows threaded by Deepa in Santa Clara. I decided I couldn't wait anymore and saw the thread about this same service just down the road from my apartment. For $11.00 I got my eyebrows and my forehead threaded. After she was done threading, she put some sort of gel/lotion on my skin and massaged my forehead area a bit. She advised that I grow out my right eyebrow a bit ... that one's always been a bit hungry ... haha. Great Service + Great Price ... go on and try it ... you know you want to!I'll definitely be back each month :)EDIT: Visited a second time today for a full face threading. Will run you about $30.

Thank you Temple!! I was skeptical having ordered a medium, which comes by default with only 2 shots of espresso, that this coffee would wake me up.... and somewhat disappointed because the Americano I ordered was pricier than what I'm used to. To save some change, I didn't ask for an extra shot and thank goodness because I don't know how I would keep still for the rest of the day. It's too bad they don't have a menu online so I could take my time to check out their specialty drinks, but from briefly looking it over in the store, it appeared as though they had alot of creative drinks, ones you would definitely not find at your neighborhood Starbucks. Everything was more expensive, and it sucks that they take Cash/Debit only, but I would come back to try the less traditional drinks. For the price I paid, I could've gotten an additional shot at Peets so I will probably be sticking with them for my daily dose of caffeine. This is a local joint you should check out at least once, and if you have some extra $$$ lying around, you could make this your usual coffee joint. I might up the rating to 4 when I try their other drinks, but for now, in order to afford my caffeine addiction, I'm going to stick with Peets.UPDATE: It's 7:30AM and I miss my extra-hot (extra-expensive) Americano from Temple :( Starbucks is just not cutting it today.... It suddenly seems so tasteless in comparison...UPDATE #2: Ok... I came back a LOT sooner than I thought, and I loved how hot my Americano came out. Nice flavor, and less acidic than last time. It tastes so smooth and sweet..... I can't even tell that the sugar-free vanilla is sugar-free! (Cut me some slack, I gotta make some concessions if I want to keep eating the way I do.)  Upgrading their rating from a 3 to 4. Since I'm sure all you yelp-ers were as curious about their mysterious menu as I was, here is what I can remember:"=====Drinks=====They have your usual Latte, Americano, Mocha, Iced Coffee....I noticed vanilla costs 60 cents here (compared to 30 cents everywhere else). The espresso drinks use Element 114 - it has a nice chocolatey smooth flavor. They have another option called Ethiopian? and that one is 60 cents more because its rare. I didn't try this one because the lady at the register recommended this for cappucinos. To put things into perspective, a traditional Americano is $2.25, and a regular Americano (filled with more water) is $2.85.=====Traditional Drinks=====DEPTH CHARGE: Our single origin 'grand crus' coffee that is made to order and brewed to perfection espresso.CHAI LATTE (Organic): An Americanized Indian beverage.

Odd, I know. That said, I've had my share of extremely traditional Chinese food to the "Chinese buffets" that serve chicken nuggets and jello in the "salad" area.For the Sacramento region, you can count on one hand the Chinese restaurants that do it up right and I'll go as far as to say that I'll throw Mayflower into that mix. New Hong Kong Wok, New Canton, (the old) Lai Wah and Jumbo may be our city's last hopes. (I'll throw in Hong Kong Cafe for good measure too.)So how am I comparing? Well it's not the ambiance. (We all know that if the chopsticks hit the floor - leave them.) And it's not whose lobsters have longer antenna (sign of freshness). I guess I have to go with pure flavor. And here, Mayflower does a great job.Now I'm not talking Americanized "sweet and sour  pork" and vegetable chicken. I'm talking about dishes that tend to differentiate one place from the next. A good Chow Fun or Hong Kong Style House Chow Mein, a Sizzling Rice soup or Hot and Sour, Half Fried Chicken, Shrimp and Lobster Sauce,  a whole Steamed Bass and/or a Spareribs with Chili Garlic or Spicy Salt. Maybe some shredded jellyfish, a chicken claw or cured tofu plate if you really want to get into it.And honestly, Mayflower does it up right. The lobster sauce is one of the best around. Plenty of aromatics, lots of flavors. (Goes great over rice.) And, their Spareibs with Spicy Salt is always great. (Keep in mind, these are chopped up, not the American form of a whole-bone spare rib.) The Hong Kong style chow mein is textural (crispy thin noodles with lots of goods to top it off.) Really, everything I mentioned above is executed very well.But, if you're looking for the kind of food you could pick up at a Hot Wok in Bel Air then I will honestly say I've never ordered it here. But assumably if they can nail the good stuff, I'm hoping they can whip up a competent batch of it just for you.Sihk faahn!

I'm a napkin sleeve person if there ever was one... and I'm saying this was not cool. This was straight-up "stank".going to Vallejo's again would most likely be one of those, "well, if i have to..." situations. or maybe ill just do take-out.

I've been enjoying the one in San Francisco with friends for years, so my first visit to the Roseville location was without surprise. Both were adorned with the same quirky decor. (Although the photographs in the SF location did seem to have phalluses as their common theme. Hmmmmm.....)Winners: Garlic bread. Chicken Marsala. Angel Hair Pasta with Prawns (Saturdays/Sundays only). Ravioli. The desserts are overpriced, but will not disappoint. Bottom line: go here with friends to have a good ol' time. But don't bring a date here expecting a quiet romantic evening, because it's not gonna happen.Oh, and please don't drop kick my kids. They're actually very sweet.
<review# 1033,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/11/2007,8/30/2007,1800,1375,4,9,10>Watched The Joy Luck Club on the big screen?  I can do better than that.I lived the Joy Luck Club experience.I was raised in a strict Japanese household where practicing the piano several hours a day was a norm, absolutely no TV (unless there were nature programs on PBS), and books were placed into my hands the minute the milk bottle dropped.So saying, I've had a pretty close relationship with books most of my life.  Yes, I confess, I am pretty much a book whore, irregardless of the establishment: large, small, local, international....if they sold books, I'd inevitably wander in, seduced by their powerful ink driven vibes and authors clamoring for attention with telekinetic powers.This little store (part of the Barnes & Noble clan) is no exception.  Part of the large Downtown Sacramento mall, it is nestled quietly on a small corner facing a courtyard that usually houses special sculptures and children's exhibits.  When I use to work Downtown, I usually paid a short visit here in addition to picking up my lunch with a couple of friends.  They have a great assortment of current magazines and newspapers as well as Fiction and Non-Fiction.  A smaller children's books area takes up the back space and I've found their Philosophy section quite fulfilling when I'm needing that little encouragement in the mental facet.  I've also found great deals after Christmas when the tables in the center of the store are heaped with 50% books ranging from cooking to interior design.  I bought a great Feng Shui book for only $4.99!  Another good lunch hour read was Being and Nothingness by Sartre.  Yum.Great place for that bookworm or curious in need of finding that specific book in a hurry or magazine/newspapers to get you through the workday.Staff here are friendly, receptive, and helpful in looking for specific items.
<review# 1034,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2007,8/29/2007,177,474,2,4,9>The Crocker is the oldest Art museum west of the Mississippi.  I write that thinking I probably need to cite something, but when I google, I get "oldest art museum in the Western United States" and "One of the oldest art museums", so probably it is.UPDATED: Mildred Kemper is the oldest museum west of the Mississippi.  That sentence was updated in the months since I wrote this review!  All the googles of Crocker + oldest will give you The oldest art museum in the American West.  Which sounds even cooler...I always liked the Crocker.  Some of my fondest memories from field trips occurred there, as well as some raucus games of Red Rover in the park across from it.  In addition, one of my ancestors, Fortunato Arreola, is often featured in the California Room (the gallery above the ball room.)  He was born in Vera Cruz, Mexico to a Spanish family, and he ran away and married a Mexican Indian woman named Isabella.  She had 11 children, 3 survived, one was my great-great-grandma.  So.  It's neat to go there and see his self portrait and his works that span from the Mexican Volcanoes to the Santa Barbara Coastline and beyond.  He was well traveled on the California Coast apparently.I seriously do not know how many people can trace their ancestry back that far unless they are Mormon, and even then, how many of those were artistes?  I thought so.  Crocker Rocks.
<review# 1035,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2007,8/28/2007,130,334,5,1,3>This, to me, is what a coffee shop should be, or as close as one can get. Sure, I'm a bit picky. I want my coffee shops to be low-lighted (not completely dim- that would make it a bar) enough to be relaxing, but enough to be able to read a newspaper. There should be books, newspapers, and magazines available in the event I show up alone, and/or really don't want to talk to anyone. There should be plenty of comfortable chairs and couches. Big overstuffed couches just in case I can't get my caffeine injection fast enough and have to lie down for a minute or two. Oh, and there should be jazz music playing- preferably Dave Brubeck. There should also be a mind boggling supply of different types of coffee and tea. So many that you're tempted to recreate Robin Williams' grocery store scene in the movie Moscow on The Hudson.Oh yeah- and free puppies and kittens with every purchase, and they should shoot rainbows out of their butts as they fly over the counter into my arms.Oh wait, that's an Amsterdam coffee shop. Never mind.Temple, as I said, is the closest I've found to what my definition of a coffee shop should be. It's low-key, jazz music seems to always be playing, there's plenty of reading material to be found, comfortable seating, a wide selection of beverages to chose from (and please, if you haven't made up your mind by the time you get to the counter, do step aside for other patrons- thanks!), with table-side delivery if your order takes a few minutes. Everything that I want in my coffee shop is there, including a strange soul-warming feeling when you walk through the door on a cold, rainy, winter morning.Simply put, they found their niche, and have attracted a solid base of customers by doing what so many other coffee-places fail to do- serve great beverages in a comfortable setting. I highly recommend stopping in, even if they won't give me a puppy.

Really?Me: Well, I guess you're a tourist, aren't you?Mom: Oh yeah, I am.Now, back to Moxy.  The store was packed with goodies without being too overbearing.  Some of it was a little kitchy but it suited our tastes. Got a fabulous, little silver dog tag (for Mr. Mister, the world's most handsome dachshund) that read Lady Killer with a heart and dagger emblem.  Also picked up a lounge lizard mug, some fun stationery and birthday cards, and a dress or two.  The woman behind the counter was really pleasant and gave us a little background on the store - the same owners have had it for around twenty years.  This is a (secret) Sacramento institution!Previously, I had only been driving around Old Sac (really fun, btw!  Driving on the cobble stone feels like being in a car during an earthquake but without the pesky fear of thinking that the world will soon end) with the intention of browsing but couldn't find any parking.  However, now I know how easy it is to get there by light rail and that Moxy awaits me.  I will be back.
<review# 1037,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2007,8/26/2007,63,181,1,6,8>I used to be a cake girl. The Real Pie Company affirmed something: now I choose pie. Three times out of five. Make that four times out of five in the summer time. Sacramento summer time, not bay area summer time which doesn't really exist.Were this my neighborhood pie shop the ratio of pie to cake slices eaten would increase even further. And if Crixa Cakes were not in my neighboring city I might stray from the cake for good. (With exception of the tres leches cake from Delessio and, of course, any serious chocolate cake topped with a layer of ganache.)The owner of Real Pie greeted us upon entry and immediately offered up samples of the Upside Down cake which was made with a summer fruit I admittedly can't recall. I was already gazing at the pies in the case -- lattice-top, galette, pot pie. Most of them contained fruit although there was a fantastic looking chocolate walnut which caught my eye.My hope was to try both a savory and a sweet pie but the vegetarian quiche had sold out and only the chicken pot pie was left. We decided on the nectarine blackberry lattice pie and the owner, impressed with our process of selection -- dismissing rhubarb because Christine doesn't like (a spin-off conversation about rhubarb and celerey ensued); mango because Michelle doesn't love (a spin-off conversation about mango and South America ensued); apple because it's not in season; chocolate walnut because it's too heavy for a summer afternoon and, finally, dismissing none of them since poor G. is vegan, graciously threw in a small (two-serving) orange meringue pie studded with dark chocolate bits -- this one from the separate refrigerated case. I'm not a meringue fan. Or I wasn't. Now it seems I might be.(Pie, by the way, is a social food. It gets people, strangers, talking, like dogs get strangers talking at the dog park. I figured that out here, at The Real Pie Company, not at the dog park because I have a cat, not a dog.  I also eat cake but I don't discuss cake with strangers. Whereas I -- all of us -- apparently have an innate ability to talk about pie. Curious, isn't it?)We chose well with the nectarine blackberry pie. Nectarine is my favorite fruit and it's perfectly showcased here; the expertly-picked fruit bursting with ripe, true flavor in a top notch flakey, butter-made crust.  Here's another thing I loved. We asked the owner where they buy their fruit and he kindly indicated a sign mounted on the wall which lists and thanks all of the growers who supply the shop with every gorgeous seasonal fruit used in their pies. In a region like Sacramento where so much good food is grown, this should be a standard practice among area businesses, not a rare one.All future visits to Sacramento now require a stop here for pie!

I guess I kinda like that little rule.

We began by ordering breakfast which for me was the BBB which I will get to later.Next thing I know, out comes Gary, the owner of The Shack.  He proceeded to give us an extremely fascinating, informative lecture on Belgium Beers.  His enthusiasm was contagious and as he would introduce another Trappist Brewery to us he would open another beer introducing it to our virgin taste buds.  What a fabulous experience.I had gotten ahold of him at the last minute so he had to run off before too long but not before he handed us off to another well trained beer connoisseur.  I cannot believe that I learned so much about so many great tasting Belgium Beers in such a short time.  I was so impressed.  Thanks Gary, you were wonderful.  I will definitely be coming to some beer tasting nights in the future.  Hopefully we can arrange for some more tasting parties too.As for my BBB, it consisted of a bacon, red onion, and jalapenos scramble on a buttermilk biscuit topped with gravy and was accompanied with fried potatoes and red beer.  It was not pretty as you can imagine but it was delicious and I would definitely order it again.  The tomato beer was interesting as well.

I can only imagine the great views of the river from the patio.The upstairs burger bar where you can watch the chefs cook the small plates, was closed off for a private party..which was kind of what I went there for in the first place.......will surely eat up there next time.My date and I had a special appetizer made for us which was incredible. The wasabi/soy sauce was super hot but delicious and great with the ahi tare-tare and a gigantic prawn.The clam chowder here is as good as it gets. It was soo good, and smelled so good, I forgot to take a pic of it! I almost licked the bowl clean. I wanted to dive into the damn bowl and marinate in it.We decided to order the slider small plates, with fries. Probably some of the best fries I've ever eaten. You know how that perfect fry is crispy on the outside and warm and soft inside? Pearl on the river NAILED IT.The sliders were tasty, and shockingly filling! We had to take sliders and fries to go home (oh darn!)Didn't have room for dessert this time, but most def next!.

This place is technically NOT bikram yoga, but HOT YOGA that follows Bikram poses, as stated on the website, which might be why some hardcore Bikram folks may be getting all upset over "being able to leave the room." As a health care provider and someone who's done bodywork for over a decade, I personally find their approach more open, friendly and healthy than the "stay in here and risk heat stroke to get rid of your toxins/go past your comfort zone to the point of injury" attitude that many purist Bikram studios exhibit. They have a relaxed yet disciplined vibe towards the practice that keeps people coming again and again. I cannot say enough good things about this place.I still totally love Bill and Sandy. And the energy is awesome here. It's simple, kinda hippy, and to to the point. And they are just so incredibly friendly. If I could give 10 stars, I would.

The restaurant itself is open and inviting. A garage door separates the outdoor tables with cushioned benches that provide enough support for me bum. Inside, there's plenty of seating, and tvs everywhere for those die-hard sports fanatics needing the NFL package on Sundays. As long as they play hockey on one of the tvs I will be content. As far as the food goes, everyone who I have eaten with has loved the food. I have sampled other people's food and certainly was not disappointed. The chicken wings were perfectly spicy and very meaty. I would like to see a little more originality on the menu, but I guess that's what to expect at a sports bar with lots of brahs (bras & bros). The happy hour is very decent, and staff were all very nice people. I am pleased that the owner has really expressed interest in wanting to make people happy with this place. That, itself, is very obvious. Girls wearing bras during Sunday football sounds like every man's dream restaurant! Like David O. said yesterday, "come for the beer, stay for the boobs." As far as other reviewers complaining about being overwhelmed by the "bro" population at the bar, I happen to think that's the most ridiculous thing you could complain about. It's almost on par with vegetarians going to a BBQ joint and writing negative reviews about the lack of vegetarian options on the menu. Leave it at this- it's a really good place to watch sports with a decent menu. If you're there to make new friends, and by new friends, I mean hipsters, then yeah, you will probably get really pissed off by all the Affliction wear. But that kind of thing won't typically ruin a restaurant experience for me, so I had a blast. Fin.

Or flourless chocolate cake. Or, just dunk your Esther's cupcake in a glass of milk. Actually, that last one sounds awesome.I've been wanting to try this place for some time now, so I stopped in the other day and ended up with coco velvet. On my drive home, I told myself, "Get home, make some lunch, and then enjoy the cupcake. Hands off until then." That was a no-go - as soon as I stopped at the first light, I broke the sticker seal on the box and stuck a pinky into the frosting... Heaven. Butter, cream, sugar, in perfect proportion.My first experience was so delicious that I had to go back a few days later. I kept thinking about it all day, but I didn't manage to look up the store hours until it was 15 minutes until they closed. Shoot! I ran to my car and sped (literally) over there, just in the nick of time. About half the flavors were sold out, but I got coconut and vanilla ones for me and my boyfriend. Just as delicious! Those things are HEAVY for little cakes. Moist, buttery, sinful, but also somehow light - perfect for the first warm Friday night of the spring.At this point, I've also tried chocolate ganache (droooool worthy - more please thank you), lemon (tangy and good, but not my taste....give me chocolate), German chocolate (yippee!), and chocolate (simple and delicious).When will I go back? Very, very soon. Grad school sucks, so any time I can find small indulgences - like the cheese at Whole Foods or these cupcakes - I'll make it a weekly routine. My hiney might not thank me come swimsuit season, though....

I came here after the Oscar night at the Sheraton with a group of Yelping friends. While I can understand the 3 star or less reviews, due to the layout and design of this lounge. It could get crowded and cramped here fast on a busy night. Fortunately it was a Sunday night and we were able to enjoy a more laid back, no waiting atmosphere with plenty of elbow room, and some strong cocktails. The main attraction here is the large saltwater aquarium filled with interesting fish AND a real live mermaid!  The mermaid is normally very elusive, rare and an endangered species. I must admit to having some preconceived apprehension as to the living conditions for all the sea life on display. But it appeared that the fish tank was clean and well maintained. The fish looked healthy. The mermaid seemed to be happy and content in captivity. She often swam back and forth, smiling, waving to onlookers, blowing kisses, and showing affectionate hand signals to the occasional patron. We were not allowed to feed the sea creatures, so I can only hope they are at least served all you can eat sushi daily. And the mermaid got to drink beer throughout the evening. Hopefully no sea life were harmed in the making of the Dive Bar. Or I would definitely be joining a protest group for the humane treatment of these animals. I did enjoy this place and want to come here again on another Sunday night with my fish loving friends!youtube.com/watch?v=GdYV
<review# 1046,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2011,1/14/2012,361,68,5,7,5>Ali Baba.. oh the memories! This place was basically a staple during my lovely stay as an undergraduate at UC Davis. I'm not sure if there exists any one student that has never heard of this place. Over the years, the appearance has changed and what it looked like today during picnic day was drastically different from the years during my time, but the food has stayed consistently good!The first thing I had here was the burgers and oh my, they are good! Combo that with their big steak fries and you've got yourself a yummy lunch for a reasonable price ($5-$7). The Kebobs are pretty worthwhile as well. I'm not a big fan of Gyros so I can't provide a fair valuation of that section of their menu. However, I've saved the best aspect for last. Ali Baba's has daily specials where they serve a different Mediterranean dish each day, with the exception of the Fesenjon on Friday and the weekends. Furthermore, I think they knew this dish was going to be my favorite, so serving it on the best days (Fri & Sat) was just fitting. Fesenjon is better known as Pomegranate Curry with savory chunks of chicken and I have to say it's nothing less than an orgasm in your mouth, or at least in mine. I loved this dish so much that there was a period of time I had lunch here EVERY FRIDAY for a few months straight. I could not get enough of Fesenjon. It was a fairy tale Mediterranean dish for me. Of course the story didn't always have happy endings. I remember a few times they ran out of Fesenjon before I could get my hands on it, and boy were those angry/hungry days!! Over the years I met the ex-owner and then I ended up taking classes with him. He started the restaurant as a UCD student and it was quite an interesting story. I've been trying to get the recipe for Fesenjon from him.. maybe I should pursue that goal a little more, so I can enjoy my favorite dish more than just once a year! Overall:- Great Location (Across the street from campus)- Nice looking place but a little small- Great food for reasonable prices- FESENJON ROCKS!! If you haven't tried Fesenjon, you are missing out! If you tried it and hate it, you're just weird. But that's okay, I still love you, and I love this place!

The staff were super helpful and informative during the planning process and were gracious enough to let my crazy crew pretty much have a run of the place. We took over the back patio (which is awesome, but you can't drink out there past like 10:00pm or something), then it got cold so we came inside and took over the jukebox, pool table, bar, and some tables. I even heard a regular complaining to a bartender about all the rowdiness. A single tear rolled down my cheek when she replied: "Shut up and drink! She just graduated college." Boo yah, bitches!!!!!Oh, and they have delicious food, stiff drinks, a good beer selection, a slammin' jukebox filled with oldies, and pool tables.

<review# 1050,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2012,7/30/2012,87,39,8,9,5>Before coming into Ding How, I was not a fan or even ever tried vegetarian food. Why go for the fake stuff when you can have real hearty beef and pork and chicken? However, after a coming to Ding How, I realized how wrong I was. Vegetarian food can be in fact incredibly delicious and tasty when made right. And it sure was made right at Ding How. The food here is absolutely scrumptious! It definitely changed my mind about vegetarian food. My friend and I ordered the vegetarian string beans with beef (spicy) and hot & sour soup. At first look, the beef looked exactly like real beef. However the texture of the "beef" was not so beefy. It had a really chewy and you can actually tell that is wasn't meat. But I have to say its the best your going to get with imitation meat. It was stirred fried with sting beans and the string beans were cooked perfectly. Some places over cook the string beans but here, it was a perfect crunchy cook. We wanted it spicy and the cook gave a good amount spice. We also got hot & sour soup. It was yummy. It was almost creamy with a lot of stuff in it including mushroom tofu, bamboo shoots. It quite spicy too, I didn't even have to add any ground peppers.  It is a full service restaurant; It actually quite fancy. The host/waiter was wearing black slacks and white button up. We came in and the waiter sat us in a booth. It was only him running the tables, but the place is really small maybe 6 tables good for 2 and about 4 tables good for four. He brought us water and hot tea, while our tea cups, plates, and utensil were already on the table. We had a couple question and he answered us clearly. We actually order the vegetarian Mongolian beef adding string beans but the chef came out and ask us if we just wanted the vegetarian beef with string beans with the spiciness of the Mongolian beef. Of course, that is what we got. Food came out really quick, thank goodness because we were hungry. Our waiter kept on coming by to check on us and and water was always filled. For being in Davis, this place is actually decent. It has a huge vegetarian menu so for all you Catholic folks in Davis, give this a place a try on your no meat Friday on this Lenten season! Price is not bad either. $16.50 for large soup, string beans and beef, 2 rice and 2 hot teas (I don't think they charge for the hot tea though) .

Jack's is one of those spots where you grab a menu while in line and tell the folks behind the counter what you want.  You can also custom order salads or select from their salad creations. Their greens are fresh, varied and never soggy! I totally had the "Atkins lunch" ordering a small salad with tri tip on the side. It was a lot of meat! You are allowed six toppings if you make your own salad and can obviously pay for more. They have tons of options, I won't remember them all, but the ones I got were:* Cranberries* Walnuts* Bleu Cheese* Red Onions (note to self: don't get this again when you have a meeting straight after)* Croutons* Beets* Garbanzo beans* Grilled mushroomsGreat spot to take folks as there is something for everyone, carnivores, vegetarians and omnivores alike. They also have comfort foods like mac'n'cheese, mashed potatoes, etc. Unfortunately the day I was there, I had the butt seat. Everyone who was waiting in line had their butt in my face while I was eating. I mean, not like it was intentional, but my personal space definitely felt invaded. If I was a pickpocket, it would have been convenient!
<review# 1052,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2012,7/28/2012,97,283,7,9,8>In an assuming parking lot that I've passed dozens of times over the years, stands the most adorable silver bullet trailer containing the cure for the current triple digit weather ... shave ice.  The Mr. found out about these ladies through Groupon -- which I have to say is the best thing they have done for their business because if it wasn't for that I don't think anyone would have even known they existed. Not only did we score two $10 Groupons which pays for 10 large shave ices, it's close by to our house, AND they're in one location as a opposed to a  food truck which is like a moving target with limited hours.  I ordered their Serrano Sunrise with ice cream which I'd have to say was pretty good and to be honest I can't remember what flavors are in it.  The ice was extremely soft and fluffy just like Hawaiian shaved ice and their ice cream at the bottom was superb. If you are expecting Hawaiian style all around for this business you won't get it here. Besides the ice itself there are no azuki beans or traditional Hawaiian flavors. Four stars for two totally fixable gripes :1. My large Serrano Sunrise  wasn't very large. Normally when I order a large shave ice anywhere from Oahu to LA to Sac it's an embarrassing size large, like as big as my babies head OMG how the heck can she finish that large. This place does not pack their ice at all so by the time they pour the syrup on it, your large just shrank into a small. Size matters LOL.2. The ice cream at the bottom melted way too fast so I didn't really get to enjoy the prize at the bottom. I've taken a lot longer to eat shaved ice while the sun is beating down on me at noon with ice cream at the bottom still intact.  So I say freeze the crap out of  the ice cream long enough so that by the time I get to the bottom of my cup, it's just soft instead of full on melted.  All in all a really cute little joint with a nice setup of tables and chairs under the trees. Then afterwards you can check out the consignment shop in the same parking lot.

From beginning to end, our waiter was perfectly on top of everything, including menu suggestions and wine pairings. My boy brought me here just after Christmas for a special dinner. Something in the back of my mind kept screaming "He's going to propose tonight!!" That might've put me in a slightly giddier / more nervous / more excited sort of mood, but the bone marrow appetizer, my walu entree, and our sorbet were some of the most perfect food I've ever eaten. Especially the walu - I was completely stuffed after because it was so rich and buttery that I couldn't put my fork down. Even now, my mouth waters thinking back to it. Salty and perfect.And he did end up proposing - at his house after this lovely dinner :)

And by "had" I mean "made" -- I was in need of coffee quickly, and she had some from Insight. Generally, I cannot replicate the wonder of the Old Soul or even the Peet's at home, with my own basic tools and less-than-basic skills. This coffee was delicious. Often times you can either have bright coffee, or a complex flavor -- this was seamlessly both. Being able to produce this in the comfort of my own home (or the home of a friend I've imposed upon) is huge. It means I can do so without having to go anywhere. It means I can do so naked. It means a lot.This morning, I was inspired to check out Insight on my way to work. The space is fantastic, as others have attested to. There are repurposed auditorium seats that face the giant windows, with extended window ledges for your coffee or books to rest. It's a beautiful spot to watch the rain or read a book with full light.Love. This places feels like love. I don't write hokey things like that often, but I'm inspired by this place.

(2) PHO: (i) I had my pho with rare steak on the side. Man, dip the rare steak into hot soup... delicious! The beef is so soft! Super soft and it melts onto your mouth! (I beat the put a lot of baking soda on their beef.), (ii) Broth: hey, not bad, taste really good! I detect some chinese-5-star-spice in the broth.. and that's the magic!(3) EGG ROLLS: Delishhhh!!! It came out cold, but we had the lady rewarm/re-fried our egg rolls and that was perfect! Egg rolls came with delish-y fish sauce, lettuces, and pickled carrots!

Lines are out the door.   I'm the duke (for a projected 5 more minutes) because I've stopped a couple times by only to bounce after hearing the wait times.  It's a setup, by the time it's your turn to order your biological scarcity response makes you want to order everything on the menu at once. I didn't though.  I just got a 2 meat place with ribs and brisket. yelp.com/biz_photos/EJEK  Good way to judge BBQ, eh?  Both were very tender and clearly tasted smoked.  The rib meat slid off the bone with ease.  Good stuff. Of note Dickey's soda fountain features CRUSHED ice.  The condiment station has 3 sauces and also giant pickles that you can serve yourself.  I enjoyed both the original and spicy  sauces equally.  Free soft serve ice cream is a fun touch kids will love.  Sides appeared to be of good quality from what I see.  I thought the fried okra was as good as any I've had.  I also enjoyed the jalepeno beans.  The service was great- quick despite the long line and even taking care of the chain ordering lady in front of me who kept adding items after her order was rang up.   I noticed the meat guy quality controlling and tossing stringy meat.  Right on, dude.All around good stuff priced about right for casual BBQ spot.  BBQ is never cheap though.  It's like Indian food that way.  Do it!
<review# 1058,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2012,7/21/2012,451,183,6,8,8>So.... I dig this place for their Taco Tuesday deal. Well, now I do anyways. I knew about their Tuesdays before, and came here with my twin sis, and our twin friends. We walked in and it smelt like bad fryer oil. Like, really bad. I had to walk right out before the smell permeated my clothes and hair and ruined my night. NO tacos eaten. Fast forward a month and my twin sis and friend were out taco Tuesday tasting. They stopped in at Azul and ordered tacos for me to go. 2 chicken tacos received and 2 bites taken. Tacos ditched being waaaay too spicy! Yuck. Fast forward another month and Yelper David O. suggests we all without Vday plans join him at Azul for cheap tacos. Ok, I have no plans, and my Valentine was Jessica T. We went, no David O, and we ate.First, we grubbed on the chips and salsa form the salsa bar. I like the chunky green one. Then,  I had the chicken and veggie tacos. Again, yuck! to the chicken. That spicy chipolte taste is no bueno for me. Good thing I ate the veggie one first and seriously enjoyed the beans, rice, bell peppers and onions that were sitting so nicely on top of 2 corn tortillas. Washed it down with a cold Pacifico that was only $2.50. 2 people, 4 tacos, 2 beers,  total price =$10. My valentine picked up the check. Jessica T, I heart you!

I'm so excited that we got a CREAM store in Davis. It's such a simple concept: choose two cookies and your choice of ice cream. That's it? I mean, there are a lot of other items on the menu such as shakes and what not, but let's be honest, most people come for the ice cream sandwiches. It's also what CREAM is known for. Each sandwich is $2.99 if you're paying with card and $2.50 if you pay with cash. BRING CASH!!! It'll save you a lot of money overtime because unless you're not from around here, you're probably going to be coming back many, many times. ;P There's quite the selection of cookies and ice cream (I think at least 10 kinds of cookies and 10 flavors of ice cream. Don't quote me on this though). You can mix and match cookies if you'd like. I've tried the snickerdoodle (favorite!) and turtle cookies with mint chip ice cream. YUM.Those who are on different diets may think, "But I can't have this cookie or I I can't eat ice cream." Don't worry because there are gluten free and vegan options for cookies and ice cream!. CREAM is open late on Thursday, Fridays and Saturdays. I believe they close at 2am. I foresee many late night trips here after going to the bars. Cheap sweets after drinking? Hell yeah. Of course, this place is also a great place to go after watching a movie at Regal Cinema directly across the street. The employees here are super nice and attentive to everyone walking in. They make sure customers get served ASAP. Overall, this is a great place! I'm definitely going to be trying a few of the other menu items when I'm feeling adventurous, but for sure will be back for the ice cream sandwiches!

It's way outside my zip code and unless I'm making a trip out to Roseville, my visits to zpizza will be limited  :( My hubbie and I dined here and both got their special- 1 slice and a drink for $3.95 or a slice for $1.50! We were starving so we opted for an additional side of garlic bread...not as flavorful as the pizza so I'd probably opt out and just order another slice. There was a limited range of pizza available for the daily special- pepperoni, cheese, and their version of the margarita (dubbed the Napoli). We chose the Napoli and were not disappointed!! I usually am not keen on white sauces and if I knew beforehand that it was a white sauce, I probably wouldn't have ordered it but I would have really missed out. It was sooo good. The creamy garlic sauce amped up the flavorful of the basil and tomatoes and made me crave more but the garlic bread was on its way so I chose to just stay the course. Another great thing about their pizza is that it doesn't leave you feeling bloated or heavy. It's light but filling and is oh so tasty! The guy manning the register and oven (pretty impressive!) was super friendly and patient with us as we perused the menu. We will DEFINITELY be going back here when we are in Roseville as the other restaurants that we have tried out here have left us with a rumbly GI tract as we drive back to Sac. I highly recommend zpizza to anyone who is hungry in the Roseville area!!!

Went with my coworkers the other day.  Took us an hour 'till we had an epiphany to have Thai at Rose Garden.  Vibe was like we were on a double date quading up some Thai Tea and talking about Candy Crush, vacations to Florida on a humid summer, and somehow a yacht?  I dunno... but the waiter was cool enough to give us some time when we were off meandering in conversations.  Anyway, like I said years ago... Their food is always good.  They have lunch menus if you just want a quick minute of exotic euphoria from Thai food.  I usually stick to Pad Thai, Pork Laarb, Green curry, Lemon Chicken, Tom Yum-King, or the Thai fried rice.  Either way, you can't go wrong.

Our fantastic voyage included nearly 50 crazy (and heavily intoxicated) individuals on a trip from Sacramento and the North Bay and back. All throughout, Corbin and Robyn from Baja escorted us around like the transportation superheros they are offering up trivia, beer and wine service on the bus, prizes, various rap battles, and an impromptu stop at a grocery store for more beer and snacks. Basically, we put them through the ringer and the evening was flawless. These guys are at the top of my list next time the occasion calls for a limo or bus.

However, I can recommend against ordering the Rabbit Ravioli if you are at least slightly hungry or have any sort of metabolism; you will burn it off before your check arrives. $16.50 for THREE small pieces of Ravioli. This is basically an expensive, albeit very tasty, appetizer. I have also tried the Lamb Burger which is also $16.50 but appropriately proportioned for the price and quality. I did cough a bit after biting into a hidden pocket of cumin, which I don't think the burger needed in the first place. I wanted a whiskey drink, so I ordered the Boulevardier (Bourbon, Sweet Vermouth, Campari) yelp.com/biz_photos/the-  I could tell each was precisely measured, which left it weak and syrupy. More bourbon would thin it out and make it a bit more enjoyable, but it sure does look nice on the table, if you care about that sort of thing. It's a nice environment with friendly and attentive staff so I will come here again, but not for dinner, and I probably won't order another $8 specialty cocktail unless I bring a flask.

And since I was hanging out in the Rancho one night I was able to finally scratch that itch. When you pull up into the parking lot you will notice the friendly neighborhood liquor store next door with your standard loitering dude standing at the door, with all the time in the world. Once you get past that you enter into a little piece of Seoul, with kitschy decorations that seem to chirp like an Amazonian rain forest. There's even live TV showing Seoul's gray skyline which serves as the backdrop for TAN network TV. I really did feel like I was magically teleported to the heart of Seoul.I was pleased with the quality of the food, but the little plates of banchan that looked fiery red were not very spicy at all. So I was missing a little bit of heat that my eyes saw but taste buds did not. The bulgogi was tasty and not too sweet, but it wasn't quite the same as some of the tofu houses in Alhambra serve up thin that melts in yer mouth. My bibimbap (I love saying bibimBAP over and over again, much to the chagrin of my wife) was very nice, with nice crunchy faan jiew at the bottom after being seared for a little while. I did love the runny egg that poured out its yolky goodness over my seared rice. The kids loved the cold buckwheat noodles and we did not have any leftovers.Service was nice but a little slow, but I was OK with that, I was not in a rush. The ladies were very pleasant and I enjoyed talking to them.So there you have it....You can't go wrong, with Mo Du Rang!(P.S. Bi-bim-bap, BiBimBAP, bib-bim-baap, BIBIMBAP!)

I'm glad I made the special trip because the baos tasted yum. I bought two BBQ pork baos, a curry beef and a chicken bao. Compared to the ones I grew up on in the Bay, the BBQ pork pieces at ABC were chunkier and less sweet but still good. The reason for the star off is that my roomie said the BBQ pork one he had was too fatty, like it was made out of pork scraps. That's no fun. But the curry beef bao was legit though, thoroughly curried throughout the minced beef. From reading other reviews, I guess I came to a new location that is far more cleaner than what it used to be, which I totally appreciate. They also sell sweet baked goods like muffins and cake rolls. It's rare that I have random bao cravings but it's pretty fun to trek to get some at ABC.

I was excited to take advantage of the great Living Social deal I'd purchased, wherein we would received two drinks (any cocktail, beer), one appetizer, and two entrees for $27. Plus, I thought the new Cornerstone was in the exact same place the old Cornerstone was. Not quite...it's actually located in the "Dream Cafe" location previously occupied by Taqueria Taco Loco and then River Rock Tap House. Found parking right up front at 5:30pm on a Saturday. Good start. Walked in and no one acknowledged our presence, so after a few minutes we just sat ourselves. Not so good. The guy that came by was pretty nice and noticed right away that we had the coopin, so asked what drinks we wanted. I tried the Angry Orchard cider, which was great. Hubby opted for a Pinot Noir, which apparently shocked our server dude, but it was good. For our appetizer, Hubby wanted something non-fried, so we went with the chicken sliders...which are fried! Oops! But that's our bad for not asking first. They were decent. For our entrees, Hubby went with the hot turkey sandwich ($8.95) which looked great and was piled with turkey, gravy, and mashed potatoes. I opted for the rib-eye steak ($13.95, getting the most out of my coopin!) with a loaded baked potato. My steak was cooked to medium-rare as requested, but it was pretty fatty and not the highest-quality piece of meat. I only ended up eating half of it, though I polished off the extremely loaded baked potato, though.All in all, with soooo many great options around, I don't know that I would make a special trip to Cornerstone for dinner. I will give them another chance, and try them for lunch or breakfast in hopes they can redeem themselves. I totally believe in second chances and really hope my next experience will warrant a higher rating.

The hip little strip that Mama Kim's occupies is part of that transformation. The place just oozes cool, from the moment you approach and hear the live jazz flowing out to greet you, to when you leave and pass an inviting art gallery next door.The dining room was full when we arrived, so I asked if we could sit at one of the high tops on their patio. The patio area is very unique. More enclosed than outdoor, it's a good option for diners who want a little more elbow room, but still want to be a part of the festive scene. There's a few tables and a very plush sectional that provides a comfy spot to rest your tush if a table is not available. The patio is also a good option if you're more interested in talking with your fellow diners than you are in just listening to the music. Don't get me wrong...I think live music for brunch is a rare and beautiful thing. But it was loud in the restaurant and seemed like it would be hard to converse. If you're forced to brunch with the in-laws, that might be a good thing :)I ordered the King Crab and Spinach Benedict while the BF went with a special of Smoked Trout Hash. We were both instantly impressed with the colorful presentation of the plates. Beautiful slices of pineapple, kiwi, and berries accompanied our entrees. The Bene was a little disappointing. One of my eggs was over-poached, denying me of that glorious liquid gold flow of yolk. There was maybe a scant 1/3 cup of crab meat total on my biscuit. Unfortunately, with a whopping $19 price tag, I expected a little more. I will give them points for a tasty tomato hollandaise, a side of creamy fingerling potatoes and, of course, the pretty fruit.The BF was very pleased with the hash, but a side of sourdough toast never materialized after our entrees were dropped off by a different server. Our waiter only reappeared at the end of our meal. It's a fun brunch spot with pretty good food. Just be prepared for higher prices and slightly lackluster service to go with those breakfast tunes.
<review# 1069,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/14/2010,11/15/2010,129,310,7,7,8>Come on, people.  Are you really knocking them down a few stars because their prices are "higher than Winco and Safeway"?First of all, the name includes the words "Farmers Market".  Just like you shouldn't expect to find bargain prices on Quaker instant oatmeal at an Asian market (trust me on this one), you shouldn't expect to do your normal weekend shopping here if you're watching your budget.Think niche market....fruits, veggies, bulk bins and specialty deli and bakery items.  Great rotisserie chicken, fat-free bite-sized meringues and fruit leather.  Entire aisles devoted to gluten-free items.  And the ability to buy spices by the ounce instead of a whole jar.The service here is great, from the merchandisers to the management.  The store is clean, everything is well organized, and checkout is quick and painless.  Did I mention it's 3 minutes from my house?  4 stars.
<review# 1070,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2010,11/14/2010,1059,313,3,13,10>Eating "healthier" does not necessarily cost more. I don't necessarily look at Trader Joe's as a health food store but more like a better quality food store and lots of choices to experiment with. I find that they have many things we use every day (better quality) at cheaper prices. Some things are a little more expensive but I'd have to say a lot of those items are not absolute necessities but more like "treats". I love Oreo cookies and their version of those are the Joe Joe's, they are around the same price but leave out the trans fats. :) They taste slightly different if you have one then the other but if you just have those... they are just as delicious. "Cheerios" (Joe's O's) are a lot cheaper too and taste just fine. I really enjoy going through their cheese selection. I've tried many for the first time because they just look so appealing. I'm a little sad that one of my favorites, the "cowchego" cheese is no longer sold. This seems to happen a lot with the cheeses but then that opens up the chance to try something new. They are always very helpful and very polite. The place is very clean, their produce always looks very inviting. I am a Trader Joe's Fan BIG TIME!
<review# 1071,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2010,11/13/2010,180,228,7,9,8>Thank goodness their $5 Kettle One vodka Bloody Mary special was a one-off occasion. Otherwise, I'd have to make the trek to Midtown every Sunday, essentially missing NFL Red Zone in the process, to get faded off of the most well-balanced breakfast brews I've had the pleasure of sipping.Best. Bloody. Mary. Evar. Marinated pearl onions, green beans, pepperoncini, and green olives swim in a spicy concoction of Tabasco, tomato juice, plus smooth-as-silk Kettle One. And don't get me started on their Eggs Benedict. Oh, you do want me to get started? Fine.My Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict was orgasmic. Their hollandaise, made with whole grain mustard, was lightly spooned over a hard poached egg (customer's choice) on top of smoked salmon fillets and crusty sourdough toast, served alongside fried breakfast potatoes. Not a dash of salt, pepper, or Tabasco touched my plate as additional seasonings or condiments were unnecessary.  It's the best breakfast I've had in at least two years and it's the first time (in a long time) that I've been able to taste each ingredient in itself. Each bite reminded me what a great idea it is to get up early on a Sunday and have brunch.The smiling Kettle One girls offered up samples of their newest citrus and orange vodka offerings (which is always a plus) and the staff was attentive and kind. To think I've driven past this pub thousands of times and never once stopped to try it out. Amazing. It's just another reminder to slow down and take in your surroundings -- you might miss those hidden gems hiding behind much larger chain restaurants. It's also a reminder to check out the 'Event' section on Yelp! I may have never tried De Vere's without it.Vodka specials or no vodka specials, we're going back as soon as possible. I love a homemade breakfast but with the family-friendly environment. sports on the televisions, and amazing food, I have no reason to not make the trek back on a Sunday to L & 16th.
<review# 1072,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2010,11/12/2010,209,356,7,10,12>This is home away from home. My favorite bar - maybe even my favorite place to be - outside of my own home.The bartenders are quick, skilled, creative, and cool. If Brandon is working, ask him to make you a "fucking delicious". You won't regret it. The bouncers don't take bullshit, but if you have a good attitude and aren't causing trouble, they're fun to chat with out front. The juke box rocks, literally.Plenty of seating, great porch. Could use a little repair here and there, but they've come a long way just since I've become a bar fly a few years ago. The ladies restroom is WAY better than it used to be.Their kitchen is super cheap, almost always open, and delicious. I usually get the grilled cheese with garlic fries, but everything else I've had is good too. They BBQ here a lot on Sundays, and make holiday themed meals from time to time, like corned beef, cabbage, and vegetables for Saint Patrick's Day. If you're all dolled up and looking for a night out on the town, dancing and ambiance and all that, this is not your place. This is a dive. We look "scary", we listen to the Misfits and Slayer really loud, and we don't kiss your ass.If you're looking for some cheap drinks, fun people to hang out with, and a good porch to smoke on with a cat to pet, you're home.

They were totally accommodating and put up with out scatterbrained group. Every single person we'd invited was either currently a server or had been before so our commentary is legit :]First and foremost our drinks never went empty as the server gave us a couple pitchers of water. We ordered our alcohol at the bar to keep the bills simpler. The appetizers and salads came out right away. The baked artichoke is bomb! Zesty lemony and parmesan oiliness baked right in.Our pizza arrived about 30 minutes later as most of us ordered deep dish. It was fresh, tasty, and the dough wasn't too dry. Four of us killed a large with no leftovers in sight. It was getting pretty late when we were done eating but they still brought my husband a big birthday sundae anyway. We kept checking in to make sure they weren't sick of us since it was past closing.The server split all our tickets since we told her beforehand how we'd break it up. She made it super simple, a huge plus in my book. 18% gratuity was added in but since the prices were so reasonable we all went 20-25%. My husband and I gave her an additional $20 for putting up with us :]
<review# 1074,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/5/2010,11/10/2010,554,328,2,14,10>I was very impressed with this new restaurant. I went on Saturday around 8 pm - the restaurant was full but the hostess managed to find us a table for 5.While the hostess was setting our table up we were waiting in the front. Every server who walked by stopped to ask if we had been helped yet. It was great service even before we got seated!The food was great.  I had the a salad that had tomatoes, croutons, onions, a light dressing and a grilled calamari steak. It was delicious. My main dish was risotto with chorizo. For desert we shared the 2 different dishes. I cannot remember the names but one was a caramel flan and the other was like little ice cream sandwiches with chocolate sauce. They were both excellent.All of the staff was extremely friendly and I will definitely be back to try more dishes.
<review# 1075,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2010,11/9/2010,113,112,6,10,10>It has been a really long time since I have gotten my hair done. Frankly, I've been too broke, too busy and too scared to look for a stylist. I did a little yelp stalking as any bright person should do when looking for a business to trust. I skimmed through talk threads and reviews and decided on giving Amithyst a try.I told Amithyst my whole hair story how I used to be blizonnnd and had been gradually going more and more close to my natural color. I told her I wanted a color boost and a *gasp* short hairstyle. I have ALWAYS had long hair, so the thought of chopping it off was exhilarating and terrifying at the same time.I really must say she made me feel amazing the entire time I was there AND gave me an awesome cut and color.  I have been getting constant compliments on my new doo and will undoubtedly be back.... She's a master!Full disclosure: I got a discount for mentioning her website. Check out the offer on her yelp page and website. First time clients receive a free cut with color or 20% off of their first cut. (this is a current offer as of 8/24)
<review# 1076,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/3/2009,11/8/2010,564,42,2,7,3>What a mixed bag of reviews.  So, i think the food is inconsistent. the service can be as well - maybe it's a staff turnover thing.  Typically though you can get a good sandwich, a decent bowl of soup, salad and breakfast fare of the carbohydrate variety.  Here's the deal - Panera has loads of seating with free wifi and plenty of power.  And, you'll never get the dirty look for hanging out for a long time just nursing a cup of coffee.  if you're meeting up with others, say four people with laptops - this is the place to do it. (assuming you're not in midtown and can't make it to theurbanhive.com) Parking is ample and free.

<review# 1078,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2010,11/6/2010,1117,776,3,8,6>I have heard nothing but good things about this place and have always been meaning to give it a try.  So a couple days ago I decide to make a trip down ... and I was glad I did.First walking in the place looks small, but don't let that fool you.  The selection they have at Oto's is fantastic!  At the entrance they have their produce section, which also included some kimchee, which made its way into my cute half-cart.  Up and down the aisles you will find just about everything so organized and ready for you to take home.They have just about EVERYTHING you could think of at this marketplace.  One of the best things about this place is that it does NOT reek with the smell of fish and it is CLEAN; which I love.Also, during my visit to Japan I fell in love with the way they had a bunch of bento boxes always ready to go ... and low-and-behold this place has the same concept going on.  You can purchase your ready made bento boxes/sushi/etc in the store, and eat it in their dining area.I paid an average of about $4/item at this place, but it was well worth it.  The quality of the foods and selection of their items was great.It is safe to say that I will definitely be returning to this market, and will recommend it to friends -- you've earned yourself a faithful client.  Keep it up!
<review# 1079,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2012,4/6/2012,290,371,11,13,13>No wonder everyone has been checking-in to this place (multiple times a week)!!! I'm not a huge fan of doughnuts; usually I can easily pass on having one... but I think I would seriously go out of my way to have another Doughbot Donut! My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out and find out what all the hype was about. After checking out the daily menu on Facebook at home I had my heart set on trying the Blood Orange doughnut. We received a friendly greeting when we entered the store and were memorized by all the gourmet flavors available and cart of deliciously looking donuts. After one bite of my blood orange doughnut I was suddenly hypnotized and understood why everyone was raving about this place. The glaze from the doughnut melted in my mouth and I had to take a second look to see if mine was plain or filled. Every bite of the doughnut was so moist and you can truly taste the blood orange flavor crammed into the doughnut and glaze. Three minutes later after my doughnut was done I snapped back to reality and left with a plan to break into my piggy bank only to return for another doughnut soon.
<review# 1080,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2012,4/5/2012,570,275,8,17,14>I have a beautiful, precious, and happy dark tortie sitting on my bed currently. This new cuddle buddy of mine is such a wonderful addition to my family, and I'm so happy to have her.It was really important to me that when choosing a cat I supported a non-profit shelter.  Sacramento has some really great choices for finding amazing animals that need some serious love. After my visit, I more strongly believe in the power of shelters over animal stores.After reading extensively about Happy Tails in the paper, and learning about their free adoption New Years "Black and White" event, I knew I'd found a great agency.First, coming here, you are almost overwhelmed with the amount of adorable, loveable kitty options.  Seriously, how can so many love bugs not have a home? But as I traveled through the halls of Happy Tails, it became apparent that these kitties DID have an amazing home. These cats are clean, taken care of by vets on a regular basis and clearly loved by the kind people who spend their days with these cats. The volunteers here really strive in creating a happy and safe place for these abandoned babies. The love within this facility is really apparent, and I'm 100% happy in my decision to support this place. After being walked through and introduced to several different cats, I found the one I loved the most. She wasn't apart of the free adoption event, but my concern wasn't about the cost. I was given the time here to find the one with whom I connected with. I was more than happy to write a check. A special note: they only accept cash or check. Thankfully we had ONE check left to adopt her. It was meant to be!Plus, Happy Tails GLADLY accepts donations. Even if it's just kitty food, which a proud kitty owner came to supply Happy Tails with a box of Fancy Feast. Something so simple like that goes a long way. Why hadn't I done that before?On a side note, I didn't come onto Yelp to judge.  I'm here to write a review for my love for this fantastic shelter.  But people gave this place 2 stars because of their no outdoor cat policy? Seriously? Happy Tails clearly has the best interest in the animal at hand. To complain about the indoor/outdoor policy is failing to recognize that this shelter is attempting to better the life of the animal, and not you the human. By keeping the cat indoors, you extend the life of the animal considerably.A happy match was found, and I hope to return for another kitty friend in the future. Thank you, Happy Tails!
<review# 1081,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2011,4/4/2012,390,173,7,21,23>Biba is one of my culinary heroes. When I first started cooking, she had a show on The Learning Channel, aka TLC. Some of the lessons still cross my mind when I'm in the kitchen- "You can always add, but you can never take away"  (salt) or "If you don't like this, use whatever you like" (just about any ingredient). She was such a fantastic teacher that I wound up buying her cookbooks as fast as they came out. And still do. Most recent, Spaghetti Sauces, went on sale earlier this year. Some of the cooking segments that she did for KCRA are available on YouTube like this one for salmon fettuccine: bit.ly/sYPxiC I've been to the restaurant twice in the last couple of months and both times it was swamped. Sitting at the bar is a very comfortable option if you're dining solo or with a friend. There's about 8 spots and it's first come, first served. The bartender was very friendly even when she was trying to do 20 things at once.If you want a table, this is one of the few Sacramento restaurants I would recommend making a reservation, no matter what time you're coming. Even with major construction going on around the building, they were booked solid one recent Friday afternoon. There's valet parking available on the Capitol Ave. side.Every day there is a stuffed pasta and a ricotta gnocchi special. I tried the ravioli stuffed with a pork mixture on one occasion. The pasta is served very al dente, so be prepared for a toothsome bite. The filling was tasty, but just a little dry.Next time was the gnocchi served with a lamb ragu. Light, melt in your mouth pillows were tossed with a perfect coating of the savory sauce. Delicious, it had me wishing for a second helping.Minestrone was good, but for $8 I was hoping for something more exceptional.Portions are small. I have a hard time being too critical of this because I tend to think that after many years of American marketing, my idea of what a normal portion size is might be a little skewed.They introduced prix fixe menus for lunch and dinner that seem like a very good deal, each including soup or salad and an entree.Recent renovations have added a classy, contemporary touch to a dining room that was a bit dated. It's a very comfortable atmosphere with polished, friendly service.I got a chance to meet the renowned chef/hostess. Gracious, approachable and always beaming, she is the epitome of an Italian grand dame. Known to mingle, deliver meals from the kitchen to the servers or straighten bar stools, she is also very happy to take a picture or sign a book, which are available in house. Truly a class act.
<review# 1082,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2012,4/3/2012,433,220,23,19,17>I think I love everything about this cafe. They really have a great thing going here and all their acclaim is well deserved. The fact that all the meat they offer is all natural is a real plus for me. Also, something about the fact that not everything on their menu is available all the time is also kind of appealing. Do YOU always have Kangaroo, Lion or Crocodile on hand? Me neither! I was hoping to try the Yak burger but unfortunately it was unavailable. However, they DID have grass-fed organic Texas Longhorn, which wasn't on the menu, so that was a total win! I would have probably chosen that over Yak anyways because I love Longhorn. I've got a Longhorn myself you know.....no, not in my pants, my family really has one! Oh and I love that when you ask for jalapeños on your burger, they load it up with FRESH ones! No jarred peppers here. I had a side of garlic sweet potato fries which were great, but next time I will probably opt for regular sweet potato fries. I don't know; I love garlic, I love sweet potato fries, I don't like garlic fries. But if YOU do, you will love these. The staff here are incredibly friendly, helpful and professional. I was told the wait would be 20 minutes, which is fine for a Friday night, and was seated in precisely 6.2 minutes. The servers seem to all work together, so different people will gladly refill your water which is very nice. I will return in approximately 2 months. This is only because of the high calorie content of their delicious food - I don't want to get back fat.

Jim Jeffries was the headliner.  I was impressed with the comedy club staff and the comedians.  My service was pretty good considering the place was packed. I ordered cheesecake but never got it.  A mix up in the kitchen and no cheesecake. Not a big deal.  Other than that my service was great and I received a full refund for not getting my cheesecake. The comedians were very funny. Jim Jeffries was totally funny! ***side note do not heckle the comedians they get paid to do this for living and you don't*** Our heckler got slammed with a ton of jokes from Jim Jeffries, it was hilarious and pretty embarrassing for the hecklers.

This place is a winner for getting off the grid, and for people within a dining party who have varying cuisine preferences.Longer version: This place may save your relationship. Ok, maybe just my relationship. Boyfriend always wants sushi and I always want Thai or Vietnamese food - now we can each get what we want in one place without compromising. Sure, I can order udon at a Japanese place to try to get a noodle fix, but I'd rather just eat exactly what I want. I was a little concerned that Bee-Bee's extensive menu might be too ambitious, and the raw fish quality might fall by the wayside, since most sushi lovers seek out a sushi place for their needs. Not so! The sashimi was legit, and the prices were good. Vietnamese spring rolls were delicious, and had a solid amount of shrimp. The Thai eggplant stir fry dish was also excellent, and there is a brown rice option. Service was fast and friendly.Location is odd... I really hope they make it!

<review# 1089,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2010,3/31/2011,472,178,26,15,18>I never thought I would be the person who says "I want to give this place a 4.5 out of 5." But alas, here I am. I rounded down to 4 for reasons listed below. Part of that also has to do with the fact that the menu is typed in Comic Sans. *shudder*Came here on Saturday night on a date, we got a bottle of pinot at the bar to start and then took it to our table on the patio when it was ready.I started with the mixed greens salad with an aged lemon vinaigrette dressing, and my date with the roasted red pepper chipotle soup. Both were amazing. The bread was warm and soft with a nice thick crunchy crust. The butter had some sort of salt sprinkled on it and I love salt so I was all about that. For the main course I ordered the vegetarian angliotti, which is like a ravioli but more of an oblong shape. It had figs, pepitas, parmesean and herbs sprinkled on top, and inside the angliotti was some type of ricotta filling. These were AMAZING. However, the serving size was pretty small for a pasta dish. I KNOW I know you guys are gonna be like "Well this is a fine dining place not neverending pasta bowl from Olive Garden!" And I realize this to be the case but I only bring this up because my date's steak was the side of my hand and I have big hands. He ordered the rib eye medium rare and he said that it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. He felt bad that my poor pasta was so small that he flung some spinach and fingerling potatoes from his plate onto mine so I wouldn't starve. I had room so I wanted to order dessert. I am not a huge dessert person but I was still hungry and also PMSing which I found out the next day so naturally the apple turnover was calling out to me.Now, no offense to Mulvaneys, but I have had better apple turnovers at a farmer's market. The crust and the filling were both completely bland, bland to the point where I didn't even want to finish the rest of it, even though I was still hungry. I was initially going to order the vanilla bean cheesecake and after eating the turnover I decided that it would have been the tastier option (probably). Now maybe dessert isn't their strong suit, but I was able to enjoy my cup of coffee after the dinner and that rounded out the evening pretty nicely.We went to 58 Degrees afterward and I had to refrain from ordering macaroni and cheese since I was STILL hungry. Didn't want to be "that girl" on the date. LOL...

It turned out to be amazing......a hint of ginger and lemongrass! Turned out to be the star of the meal.And better yet.......$10 all together, yea, that cheap! In loveeeeeeeeeee

<review# 1093,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2010,3/27/2011,253,90,20,11,12>My parents sometimes enjoy reading my reviews, so this is a little embarrassing. But I actually think this a great, well-run shop.I've been here a couple times for my own enjoyment as well as for when I need to buy amazing and embarrassing bachelorette party paraphernalia. Take a look at the awesome cake I constructed using one of their super convenient cake molds! I guess that the best way to write this review without shaming my parents too much is to say they have really great selection, the people who work there know the products well, and it's just a cute little shop!
<review# 1094,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2010,3/26/2011,92,271,5,9,8>Vaghe'an azash khosham miad!     Delicious food, really good service, great atmosphere, and reasonable prices.      It has been a while since I've completely satisfied with every aspect of my visit. The steaming hot Sharhzad soup filled my mouth with joy, just the way I like it(that's what she said). The plate of herbs and cheese were rich, Persian ice cream was light and lightly sweetened, and the entrées were simply gratifying.      The restaurant is clean, with the scent of fresh flowers on every table, and has good lighting, room temperature, and atmosphere. I was impressed with the service. Our drinks were always filled, the follow up was consistent, and they offered to box our left overs for us despite being busy.                                                                                   Berma'id!!!
<review# 1095,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/8/2011,3/25/2011,244,170,5,12,12>After reading the article in the Bee, I knew I had to drop in here.  It's a nice and airy little shop.  When you first walk in, you see the gelato almost calling your name.  My friend and I checked out the dessert case.  They were reasonably priced and portioned, especially considering a lot of places try to charge you way too much, for not enough.   After being tempted by so much in the case and not able to pick only one dessert, we went back to the reason we'd come.  The Stud Muffin!  We ordered two of those and were surprised that it came with a side salad, with a choice of Caesar Vinaigrette or Ranch.  The staff was really nice, answering all of our questions.  And asking how our meal was once we'd dug in.  I've noticed alot of places don't do that anymore. We got our muffins promptly.  The flavor of the mashed potatoes and the meatloaf were really good.  I liked the lightness of the meatloaf.  It wasn't as densely packed as I'm used to.  The portion of the salad was really well balanced.  I've decided to give up baked goods for Lent, so I'll be back here first thing after Easter.  I can't wait to try the scrumptious looking strawberry cupcake and the banana cream pie.
<review# 1096,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2010,3/24/2011,249,49,11,13,11>Could this be the park of all parks? I'd definitely say so!Surrounded by a sea of suburban tract homes is the gorgeous Morse Community Park.  Just when I thought Elk Grove was building nothing but houses and restaurants, a jewel of happiness was made in the midst of it all.  With its playground, open water park, baseball field, basketball court, skate park, split dog park, tons of paths to roam on and even more grass to spread a blanket on, how could you not fall in love with this place?  It's so clean, spacious and obviously well maintained.  I've already started spreading the word about this park and will continue to be a frequent visitor.Dog park review: My friends and I sat on top of the tiny grass hill with Prince Nemo -a chubby, perfectly named Shih Tzu that loves sitting in high places per his human- on Sunday around 7pm.  As we sat there watching over about 15 of the Prince's jesters rolling, romping, and tummy-scooting, I couldn't help but notice how well-behaved all of them were (not to mention entertaining).  Ok, maybe Lulu (my Westie) was barking a bit too much, but I think she was learning a thing or two from the others about good doggie manners.  Not only were the dogs model citizens, the owners did well to keep up the positive vibes by enjoying friendly conversation and keeping the grounds poop-free. Both small and large dog sides are appropriately sized and contain  a hill, water fountains, poop bags, benches and young trees that have yet to provide real shade.  I've only been to a few dog parks, but I've noticed a common trend- large dog areas always have cooler agility play things!  No fair.  Here, there's a "dogwalk" (looks like a small bridge), and the small dogs get a board with a hole cut in it.  Woohoo?  I'll cross my fingers for something a bit more impressive for Lulu to refuse to understand, hahaha.  So far, this is my favorite dog park.  2 paws up!
<review# 1097,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2010,3/23/2011,133,189,12,19,14>Happy grand opening, Phono Select! They blow any Sacramento record store out of the water, hands down. It isn't even debatable. They know who they are catering to and they are already doing it right.It is located across the street from the vegan mini mall in a very cute brick building. Inside they have created wonderful mood lighting, accompanied by sweet tunes that make you want to bob your head and hand them all of your cash. You can find many styles of music (i.e. Asian R&B, soul, hardcore, punk, etc ...), some awesome zines and vintage band posters - just to name a few. The staff is pretty dang awesome, too. Some have been in the business for quite some time and they sure know what's up. I'm delighted to have a store like this in Sacramento and I'm excited to watch them grow.
<review# 1098,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/20/2010,3/22/2011,100,90,11,12,9>This place makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.Yes, the food is amazing. I love the brie, baguette, and smoked salmon. The chocolate creme brulee was so rich that...wait for it.....I actually couldn't finish it. The dishes here are simple and amazing...the kind of food that makes you feel chic just by eating it. They even make mayonnaise delectable...and I hate mayonnaise. But the real reason why I absolutely love Cafe Rolle is the lovely, lovely men who work there. They are the most welcoming, charming people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. They greet you as friends, as though they've been waiting for your visit. This is customer service at its finest...even calling it "customer service" feels wrong. It feels more like having dinner fixed for you by men who are wooing their way into your heart. Dining at Cafe Rolle really isn't a meal- it's an experience. You will leave sufficiently wooed. Really, the French deserve more credit. Cafe Rolle, La Bonne, brie, brulee, crusty bread, swoon-worthy accents....what's not to love? And let's not forget how they saved our asses during the Revolution.
<review# 1099,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/14/2006,1/21/2007,164,248,1,2,1>Cheap as cheap can be. Of course you have to pay up front, no credit cards, and they once melted the beads off of an expensive top. They told me it was the manufacturers fault. When I tried to take it back to the store, they told me it was the cleaners fault. I give up. I will still use Save-on for inexpensive clothing, but nothing beaded.
<review# 1100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/18/2006,1/20/2007,16,63,,3,1>Cute boutique in midtown sac. Obviously lots of denim, but they have cute tops, purses and accessories too. And so the boyfriend doesn't have to wait outside, they carry mens stuff too. On the more expensive side, but they have things you otherwise would have to go to SF for.
<review# 1101,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/2/2006,1/19/2007,28,157,6,4,2>There's a Target, JC Penny, Mervyn's, Pac Sun, Foot Locker, Game Stop, and some other clothing type stores.  Nothing too special about this place.  The only reason I'd really come here is because it's close to Davis, and it has Pac Sun.  However, the department stores they have are small, and some of the shops in the mall are rather small too.  This is probably the best place for high school teeny boppers to hang out.  Avoid coming here at night during the weekend.  I went on a Friday night and behold, annoying high school kids everywhere.  Seriously, they were everywhere, like a freaking plague.  Man, I'm so glad I'm out of high school, no offense.
<review# 1102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2007,1/18/2007,34,45,1,2,4>I've never been to this place at night, but can we talk about what a great place this is for hangover breakfast?  I'd recommend the Eggs and Sausage and Biscuits and Gravy.  Also, Allan never writes down your order and never screws it up--this always makes the meal more exciting for me.  Also important to note, this is a bar so you can always chase down your breakfast with a beverage of your choice.
<review# 1103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2006,1/16/2007,5,1,1,8,4>5 stars is alot of stars, my friends.I say be careful out there with the stars..... be sure the business is a benchmark standard in their category, a bellweather, a beacon of excellence in their category.Dad's qualifies, partly on the basis of carving out a niche that is somewhat of its' own category.A soulful and homey neighborhood deli that dares to be artisanal with their ingredients, to be hi-end without being hi-brow. A place where there is true passion for the quality of the food, but where the disassembling personalities of the principle proprietors (Zach, Ally and Sam) make it an everyday casual experience for the neighborhood citizens enlightened enough to drop by for good food and good karma.I will tell you, I didn't get it when the joint first opened (more than a year ago, but not sure exactly when). I live in the neighborhood, and had intersected somewhere with Ally in the bar/food biz, and heard about the new venture. I went in, and was unimpressed, a little unsympathetic to the titanic struggle underway with a cramped bad layout and apparent inexperience with "big time" food service to the masses....Fast forward to 6 months ago, and a revisit thanx to rave reviews from my friends (thanx Alec Binion and Jason Griest). Armed with better-tuned senses and sensibility, I started my love affair with the business, which grows each day.Simply, these folks have REAL BIG hearts, and soul, and feel for people and real simple good/great food.OK, my first review, and I'm wearing out fast.... I simply don't have an excellent beg/middle/end to this whole diatribe-- but most glad I wrote this gobbledygook, as I will leave you with the essence of the thing.......Good things happen to good people, and what goes around really does come around.Try Dad's, you will be a little richer and better for it.

<review# 1105,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/5/2007,1/14/2007,32,69,6,3,1>Went here for the Kings game last night.  WOMEN BEWARE!!!  The ladies restroom has been gutted and the only working restroom is the men's room, and it's as bad as any woman could imagine.  The odor was foul... I think is smelled like someone urinated all over the place a long time ago and they never cleaned it up.  Water was all over the floor and let's just say that trying to use the toilet required lots of balancing and squatting skills.  I quit drinking beer because I didn't want to go back to the men's room.  The Limelight does have great food and the people working there were really nice about turning up the volume of the Kings game.  Also, if you're single and are looking for an older card-playing man, this is a great place to get hit on.  The ratio of men to women was probably 15:1 at least!  But if you're not single and do not like older card-playing men or using stinky men's rooms, then pick another joint to hang out.
<review# 1106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2006,1/13/2007,0,4,2,3,2>The only skate shop in Sacramento worth going to. Owned by pro skater Mike Rafter, this shop is core. It's small but has everything you're looking for (clothes,skates, parts, accessories). Screw going to fake shops like Surf & Skate and Ground Zero where their employees can barely grip a deck or even stand on a skateboard, Flatspot knows whats up and has a super friendly atmosphere with kids coming and going constantly, hanging out watching videos or just showing Rafter (Crafter) new clips/photos. You even get a free show from the crack heads strolling down the street when shopping there. Be sure to bring your lady friends cause Olipom is next door and has a ton of vintage stuff.
<review# 1107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2006,1/12/2007,89,621,,5,1>I hosted a work holiday party here for 35 people this past weekend and I just want to say that David and his staff did a great job!! We had a pre set menu, that was very reasonably priced and the whole staff really out did themselves.

<review# 1111,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/20/2010,11/3/2010,175,211,3,9,7>I met a friend here last Saturday evening on his suggestion as he lives a few blocks up and wanted to try this place. He snagged a table while I found easy parking on 33rd. My first impression is although small, it's cozy and tastefully decorated with a nice vibe. I really liked the local art that was on the wall. I was quickly greeted when I walked in and took to the table where my friend was sitting. They brought cucumber infused water along with sourdough bread. Quinn was our waitress and was wonderful & attentive. She gave us time to look over the menu. I decided on the steak pasta and my friend ordered the pan seared petite filet. Quinn gave me wine suggestions and I choose a white which the name escapes me, but it was good n' crisp. My entrée had fettuccine noodles with heirloom tomatoes and generous cuts of steak on top and was very good. The petite filet was done medium and exactly to my friends liking and he cleaned his plate.  We topped off dinner with cheesecake with fresh blackberries. I keep reading all the great reviews about the Whiskey burger. Next time, that burger is mine!
<review# 1112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/5/2010,11/2/2010,410,518,13,10,6>I've seriously eaten everything on the effin menu as of today!! For my 7th visit since the soft grand opening I decided to go out with a shabang! A Shabang Lobster that is! MoFo was HUGE! 3lbs for $50. Deliciousness all over my face and arms. Difficult to eat, but thank goodness I'm half mermaid. I can break through any sea shell...and I don't need utensils. Thank God my table was in the corner where no one could see me, because seriously; I tore that lobster up. I saw my spoon once; when the waiter put it on the table but didn't use it once. Mermaids don't eat with utensils :) From the Gumbo, the fried catfish, sausages, cajun fries, sweet potato fries, corn, etc. EVERYTHING is Delicious! My Top faves: 1. Lobster 2. Dungeness Crab 3. Shrimp 4. Crawdads OK, after today I'll stop counting how many times I've eaten here. You can just check out the wall that says, "Chris and Tracy". I've written down the dates of each time I've visited :)
<review# 1113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2010,11/1/2010,324,135,12,11,10>I really can't knock this place. I've ordered plates to go in the past and have always enjoyed the food. Recently, I finally had the chance to take a seat inside Sandra Dee's and get the full effect. I wasn't disappointed.The service was excellent. I went with my volleyball team--eight of us total--and there were at least three other tables in the dining room with parties as large. Our waitress was attentive, we got our food within a reasonable wait with extra napkins and our waters were always full.Sandra Dee's has one of those menus where reading each offering creates a mental checklist of everything you want to try. Sadly, you soon realize you can't order the entire menu at one sitting and have to agonize over what you'll select for this meal. Yeah, it all sounds that good. For me, it was fall-off-the-bone pork ribs lathered with a rich, tangy sauce. Side one was a creamy mac and cheese which, while good, was admittedly a little too creamy for my taste. Side Two was stellar red beans and rice--a spicy, steaming, slightly gooey mix of awesomeness. I'm no BBQ aficionado by any stretch but good eatin' is good eatin' and this was good eatin'!Now, I've heard they have a $6 lunch combo at Sandra's and, as close as it is to my work, I may become a regular. To the chagrin of my volleyball team, of course, as pounds of fried chicken, pulled pork sandwiches and hush puppies start to outweigh my athletic ability. Literally.Eh. Fitness is overrated anyway.
<review# 1114,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/6/2010,10/31/2010,439,356,8,9,14>I think I've just fallen in love, and instead of falling in love with a man...I've just given my heart to a bar and the lovely brunette bartenderess that made my drink. I came with some friends after a dinner at Burgers and Brew. At first I was a little apprehensive. I had read some of the reviews and they seem to be mixed. I am allergic to shitty service, hipsters and douchebags and honestly I was quite afraid that I was going to have to sneeze all night. I expressed my concerns to Davis O. while eating dinner, and he assured me that I could leave the kleenex at home. I walk in and am immediately taken by the beauty and ambiance of the place. That might sound a little cheesy, but when a place actually puts forth the effort to design their establishment with TLC, it can't go unrecognized. Two friends were already at the bar, and when the rest of us arrived we walked up and were immediately served. My friend was told he has to try a drink called the Horse's Neck, so that is what he ordered. When I was asked what I wanted, I said just something sweet and fruity. David had said that the way the drinks are made are especially cool to watch, so I made sure my eyes never left the bartenders hands. I watched her make my friends drink. The way she moved and the way she peeled the fruit was stunning. Then she moved onto my drink. I was completely mesmerized as I stood and watched her slice some cucumber and strawberries. She then proceeded to mull them and strain them into eventually what would be called "The Whitney". She handed the drink to me and said that if I didn't like it, to let her know and she would make me something else. I've never been told that before. Most bartenders seem to frown and scoff at the idea of a patron not liking their drink. But alas, this was not the case. And my drink was a mouth full of light, crisp springtime. It was delightful. We found a table and all sat back and enjoyed our drinks. I spent most of the time just looking at my surroundings. The Shady Lady has a sort of beauty and class to it that it really quite unlike any other place I've been. I almost was expecting Frank Sinatra or Louis Armstrong to walk through the door any minute. Maybe next time. We did see a few hipsters and a few of the db kind..but they all seemed to be just part of the crowd. Nothing to frown about at all. The service was great, the drinks were great, the people were great, the decor and ambiance was great...Everything was great..I will save the last star for when I finally get to hear the sounds of Harley White Jr Orchestra.
<review# 1115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2010,10/30/2010,562,500,10,17,13>Careful, with its little tiny sign, you may drive by without ever seeing this place.  Turn onto the side street and you will discover this little old house turned into a restaurant has plenty of parking out back.  Entering 'this old house' you discover it is a clean, charming, white table cloth kind of a place.  There is a small room turned into a bar and a couple of other rooms turned dining rooms.This place is true first class service with a smile.  They offer one, two, or three course meals.  I ordered the heirloom caprese style salad with a balsamic reduction dressing.  It was pretty good although the tomatoes could have been sweeter and I could have used just a little more cheese.  For my main course I ordered a steak that may have been the most tender steak I have ever had and the sauce that came with it was excellent with just a hint of sweetness.  Make sure you drag your slices of steak through the sauce before letting them melt in your mouth.  We were running late for my girl friends hair appointment so I got my third course, which consisted of cheesecake, to go.  I would say it was a little disappointing compared to the rest of the meal.  Next time I am definitely going to try the crème broulee.The Wizard says "check it out".
<review# 1116,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/19/2010,10/29/2010,354,195,7,5,5>I'm pretty sure that this is the place where smiles come to die. Sounds pretty harsh but when my mom, sister and I came here for a lunch we opted for to-go rather then dining in due to the lack of happiness and customer service. We were seated promptly then sat, and sat, and, you guessed it, sat. No menus, no water, no clue. They had a buffet going on and since I had never eaten here before I didn't know if I walked into a buffet only place. I had no way of figuring out the way the place works since none of the servers were coming over to talk to us or take our order. Did I mention no one gave us menus?Finally, a man with a water pitcher came to our table after about 5 minutes of waiting and I asked him what the deal was, buffet only? How much is the buffet? Are there menus? Can we get this to-go? The answers were given in an Indian version of Ben Stein, with no cheer or care in his voice. Here's what I did get out of him; they do serve buffet, lunch buffet ends at 2:30pm and picks back up at 6pm. They do have menus but apparently they don't hand them out unless you ask which I thought was odd, and we didn't ask them if we could get a to-go order we just told them we wanted it to go and they didn't argue about it. Their menu was extensive and had much to choose from. Their prices however were a little on the steep side compared to the amount of food on your plate, especially when it came to the two vegetarian dishes we ordered (one was an eggplant dish the other was potatoes and peas both were around $11.00 a piece) The order of lamb tikka masala was a decent size but a still a little steep in price ($13.95) All entrees come with Basmati rice.We didn't get one smile the whole time we were there. Not one "Can I fill your water while you wait", and not a single "Thank you, come again." However, when we got home we saw that they wrapped our order in plastic wrap to prevent those sauces that stain for life from escaping their container, which I thought was very considerate of them. Not to mention that all the flavors in the dishes we got were spot on and very good. I think I would prefer more of those vegetarian dishes though because the actual lamb meat was a pretty dry despite all the delicious sauce covering the meat. Basically, I might, and I use the word might very strongly here, be back for some more vegetarian dishes, but could I PLEASE get a smile?
<review# 1117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2010,10/28/2010,124,81,4,13,10>I'm a vegan but after a horrid experience with Art of Food, I had no desire to eat at a raw restaurant again.  After receiving a $25 gift card to Green Boheme from my uncle, I was a little bit reluctant but after a long day of garage-saling with my friend Toni, I was hungry and wanted to treat us out to a refreshing meal, so we gave it a try!We decided to split two entrées with each other so we ordered the no-sea tuna sandwich $7 and the macfeta tomato pesto slices (can't remember the name!) for $13.  Both dishes came out at the same time had about a 30 minute wait.  Let me just say, the faux tuna sandwich was SO good!  It came with a side salad w/ faux-ranch too and was very filling.  So good for the price, that I'll probably have to come back for more.  The macfeta (macadamia nut faux feta cheese) fresh tomato slices drizzled with pesto was very delicious too but for the portion and price, I would say not as worth it as the faux tuna sandwich.  I was very happy with the meal overall and found the owner to be very nice.  The meal totaled to about $22-$23 meaning I had about $2-3 on my gift certificate but the owner was nice enough to give me cash back.  I was very thankful for that.While there, we noticed what we thought to be a homeless guy walk up to the owner and asked if he could do any work for money or food.  He swept leaves outside for a few minutes and the owner was kind enough to give the man a slice of cake and a drink to-go for his labor.  It seemed like a very sweet thing for the owner to do and it didn't go unnoticed.One of their employees was very nice too and struck up a conversation with us during our meal.  He kept bringing up the subject of honey which was a bit bizarre though, but nonetheless it was an interesting conversation.  He seemed like a very nice guy and a loyal employee who had been eating raw for quite a while.Green Boheme you have redeemed the raw food experience for me.  4 1/2 stars.  Well done!  I've already recommended you to a few other vegans who are interested.
<review# 1118,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2010,10/27/2010,253,90,10,6,7>Step away from the pad thai. Don't even think about reaching for another piece of food!So my diet WAS going well. Sometimes I try convincing myself of things like eating 5 lbs of food in one sitting isn't THAT detrimental to my overall health. Well, it just so happens that my daily jogs aren't nearly as enjoyable when the food baby starts bouncing around, causing my eyes to nearly pop out of my head. I digress.Okay so this is my favorite Thai food in all of Sacramento. Unfortunately it's only about 10 minutes from my house, so the weekly cravings have given Bangkok Garden a permanent spot on the dinner roster. The red curry beef is absolutely delicious and makes me salivate just thinking about it. Same with the pad thai. The drunken noodles are a perfect way to hit the spot when you are ready to have a thai food eating contest and fall asleep shortly thereafter. The mango curry is so flavorful and probably one of my favorite things on the menu as well. Last week for lunch I ordered the red beef curry and pad thai to go, and the guy working there gave me three sets of utensils. He must have secretly known that I was needing more plastic forks because normal people can finish 8 lbs of food in one sitting, right?
<review# 1119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/23/2009,12/2/2009,574,469,16,17,17>If I lived closer to 16th Street, I would be a fixture at Simon's. I love the dated juke box, the lighting, the service, the drinks, EVERYTHING. The Chinese food is shockingly good. It's not better than Hunan House in Galt, but it is dangerously close. This is probably my preferred Chinese in Sacramento. If you think there is better Chinese in Sacramento, please shoot me a private message to tell me where the hell it is.But unless you're somewhat in-the-know, you don't come to Simon's for Chinese food. You come to Simon's for cocktails. When I worked at a bar down the street, we would come to Simon's for drinks at the end of our shifts. I don't know about these days, but you would see a lot of politicians, suits, and eclectic others that made for EXCELLENT people-watching, especially between 2pm and 8pm.At night it becomes a sort of high-end dive. It's an EXCELLENT date bar. I have gone on many a pleasant date at Simon's. It's easy to steal a kiss, hold hands, or whatever without feeling like everyone is staring at you (and probably wishing they were you.) On the most recent date, my date ditched me, as in, left me here alone without saying good-bye, but I still had a fairly decent time without him. For the record, my date did eventually come back, but I have to say, that was a strange feeling. I have never been abandoned out of nowhere like that so I was not a happy Johnna. Back to the review of Simon's.So aside from being able to suck face a baby bit and not having to worry about having a great time if your date accidentally leaves you stranded, there are other reasons to bring a potential mate here. The lighting is perfect. It is hard for someone to be downright unattractive here. It's also pretty private. This is the type of place where you sit at the bar, and you feel like you're the only two people there, even when the bar is totally packed otherwise. There is also this crazy phenomena where there is always a barstool available here. You don't have to plant a coat or purse to get a seat. You will be able to sit, even on St. Patrick's Day. Remarkable, no?These qualities, I'm sure, make Simon's excellent for informal business meetings as well, something I'm sure many Sacramento "lifers" are aware of.Finally, there is patio out back where you can smoke, but I'm not 100% sure if it is always open. It is pretty much as nice and pleasant outside as it is inside. Another plus for you casual smokers is that they sell a few different packs of cigarettes right at the bar. This is also good for you regular smokers, so you can tell the damn "casual-smoking" bums that they can support their own damn "casual-smoking" habit by buying their own casual smokes at the bar.Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, Simon's has all of its bases covered. If you have a date you're really into, this is one of the best places Sacramento has to offer. A+ S.W.A.K.
<review# 1120,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2009,12/1/2009,71,109,11,18,11>HMMMMMMJudging by about 6 of the initial reviews listed for Gatsby's, my BS meter shot WAY up. But after visiting Gatsby's myself, here's my take. The UniquenessThis place used to be a Benihana type restaurant, leaving behind 2 Teppanyaki grills. So... you get to witness your burger being cooked. Kinda reminds me of what Bandera does with some of their food prep.  Loving what they have, the modern grill combo + early to mid 20th century styling... works.The Fire BurgerThe beautiful details, hmmmmmm. A true (ok, hefty), 8oz. patty, cooked to my liking (medium rare). By comparison, Red Robin's has refused to cook the burgers to my preferred temperature. Typically because the cooks I experienced were possible crack heads. The burger veggies were fresh, which included the nice touch of grilled, about to caramelize onions. The avocado amount seemed just about the right amount - a decent, thin slice. IMO, other burger joints have overdone the avocado, and sometimes, I've tasted more avocado than burger. The added jalapeno was nice. Again, a seemingly correct amount -just enough to "hurt" when biting into the burger. Good $#!+. Additionally, the bun was a high standing, great tasting, gourmet bread. Just enough to be able to COMPRESS everything into mouth fitting size, also becoming enough to soak in the juices, as the burger went into a dripping Carl's Jr. mode.The ChipsCorrection. That's HOME MADE potato chips. The last time I experienced home made potato chips, was in the 70's, made by a hole-in-the-wall place called Chris's Hamburgers, on 18th street (between Mission and Valencia). At Chris's though, you had to get past the extras - the dead mosquitoes that perhaps happily committed suicide in this thick, greasy goodness. To me, thanks to Gatsby's, the home made chips is heaven placed in the middle of fiery *ahem* Sacramento. At Gatsby's though, you MAY have to ask for the dead mosquitoes, but I'm pretty sure the chips come with sea salt. Nice.The Peanut Butter and Chocolate ShakeTopped with whipped cream and a cherry, yet another item filled with good $#!+.Word to Yo' MamaOwners of this joint, I'm giving you tough love here. For cryin' loud! Drop your pride, drop to your knees and CLEAN THOSE TOILETS. And clean them several times a day. Are ya too uppity for this task? The toilet bowl and urinal of the single person bathroom had the rings of fermentation, consisting of urine and gray matter (perhaps dust) in there. My initial impression of this place was that of such a clean, classy looking joint, until the wash room had that unwashed look. Someone had to point this out, but "EWWWW!" Something to guage by, about 3 years ago, I went to this super high volume restaurant, who proudly displayed their official(?) score of 98 near their bathrooms. yelp.com/biz/park-chow-sRequest #1. More Napkins PleaseAs previously mentioned, these burgers wonderfully go into Carl's Jr. mode, and more napkins will be necessary. I saw this neat contraption at of all places, one of my favorite taqueria dives. It was rather high tech for this place, but the napkins are ready, ONE sheet at a time, at your disposal: lehigh.edu/~infsv/images Consider thse stacks at the tables. The napkins come out one at a time, and peoples' greasy paws touch mainly the napkin, not the holder itself.Request #2. Go HawaiianIt'd be a huge plus to my heaven if I saw your home made chips go Hawaiian style (much thicker, much more crunch).Positives+ A friendly, cordial, accommodating staff.+ A clean, bright restaurant during the day.+ Overhead lighting per table - though I never got to see the effect yet.+ A decent start up menu :)+ Full, sit down service.+ The 8oz. patty felt... generous.+ Location Location Location yelp.com/biz_photos/E7v-+ Even the mayo is home made.Negatives- The prices per burger/fries plate need to be knocked down a dollar or two. Fire Burger + Fries = $9.95. Shake = $3.75- The bathroom. EWWWW!The VerdictOK. Now I'm starting to believe those suspected ;) reviews. And I also do see the potential for Gatsby's to make some positive adjustments. If weren't for a few details, to tell you the truth, I would've given this place 5 stars for the food alone. I'll probably check out Gatsby's again some time in the future. This case remains open...
<review# 1121,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/20/2009,11/30/2009,702,960,8,8,7>This review is actually for 3.5 stars, but since I'm feeling generous today I rounded up. The yogurt consistency is meltier than I would like. Also, there were only five flavors - call me spoiled, but if there are six dispensers I would expect all of them to contain different flavors. I do like their "tart" option though! I had no idea this place existed! A 2-for-1 coupon tempted me to come here seeing it was not too far. Also, I'm a sucker for 2-for-1 coupons. You know, I think business owners actually read these reviews. I read the latest review in which Ted S. lamented on the lack of marshmallow sauce. Well, Ted, we got marshmallow sauce. Also Justin B. commented on the canned fruit aspect. Let me tell you Justin, there were frozen berries - strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. No canned fruit to be found. Mind you, it was not FRESH fruit, but when your yogurt is frozen anyways, they kind of go nicely together. The decor could be improved, yes, but for a corner strip mall at a busy intersection, there isn't too much you can do. Also I like the face that the afternoon sun is behind you and not baking you if you sit outside. You get a nice view of zooming cars, wide parking lot and the backside of Adalberto's. Oh - while I'm at it, it would be nice if mochi were a topping option. I am going to check back in a few weeks to see if it magically appears...like all the other Yelp suggestions!
<review# 1122,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/1/2009,11/29/2009,323,1092,7,11,11>We ended up at Giovanni's last week on a Thursday night.  They have a family special on Thursdays where you get four soft drinks, a salad, and a large pizza for something like $20.  Not a bad deal at all.  Since there are only two of us in our family, we subbed the soft drinks for a beer.  So to start with, if you aren't ordering the special, skip the salad.  The lettuce was frozen and there ain't nothing worse than frozen lettuce.  Plus the toppings were sort of lacking as well.For our pizza we ordered the Don Giovanni, a simple sausage pizza.  In my opinion thin crust pizza is hit or miss.  When it's not crispy on the bottom and the whole thing turns to mush as you eat it, I end up gagging by the end of the meal.  This pizza did not suffer from that malady.  As Giovanni himself made sure to come to our table and point out, he cooks his crust crispy--the way they eat it in the Bronx.  The pizza was great.  The grilled peppers and sausage were flavorful, it had a good amount of sauce, and it stayed crispy throughout the meal.  My only critique of the pizza was that it was a bit oily.  Not necessarily too oily, just bordering on my comfort zone.  Giovanni is a really nice guy.  Like the kind of nice where you want to give him a hug when you leave and tell him that he's trying too hard to make you happy.  Because he really does.  He was working the register and the dining room the whole time we were there--talking to customers and making sure people were happy.
<review# 1123,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/16/2009,11/27/2009,53,209,2,6,6>You know the drill: it seems like you can't open a frickin hot dog stand without the tag lines "local," "fresh," or "sustainable."  Like "California cuisine," "Caesar salad," and "jazz," these terms are already threatening to become so indiscriminately applied that they lose any shred of their original meaning.  Additionally, someone needs to tell many of these places that it does no good to use fresh, local, organic, etc. ingredients if you overcook, overwork, or otherwise defile them in unimaginative or substandard preparations.  Also, just because something's local or organic doesn't' automatically make it taste better, and we diners tend to want food to taste good.  Magpie is a small restaurant and catering outfit in a dandy rehabbed building along R Street that promises to stick to the mantra.  The apparent difference here, (from my first visit, at least) is that they really deliver, keeping to the spirit as well as the letter of the creed.  Entering the building for lunch, I spied the menu, a long handwritten paper clipped to a support beam.  Promising, since it indicates a constantly changing menu, hopefully inspired by whatever's good at the moment.  Enticing pastries and prepared salads tempt from behind the glass, and a small but respectable local wine selection is prominently displayed as well.  Let's eat!   A cup of bean soup was well-seasoned and full of flavor without being heavy.  My Fra'mani sampler featured two halves of a sturdy, rustic bun; half bore a salame rosa adorned with roasted red peppers, while the other featured salame Toscano with pickled red onion.  The sandwiches were exemplars of parsimony, without a bunch of mayo, lettuce, etc. to interfere with the deliciously nuanced flavor of these truly fine meats.  In other words, Magpie's staff seems to know enough to let the star ingredients shine, an approach still too often neglected for the sake of a "more is better" aesthetic.  Riding shotgun was a small salad of lively greens with shaved fennel, coated in a daringly fennel-centric vinaigrette.    Prudence kept me from eating more, but I plan to return to sample their other offerings whenever possible.  If this visit is any indication, Magpie is firmly in command of their cooking, and deserves a place among the city's best destinations for casual, affordable eats of integrity.

Why?Do you know what I did last night?  I played dodgeball with a delightful mix of guys and gals.  We won, nbd, and brought the celebration over to the PIne Cove that sponsors the league.  Once we got there I wanted to hop in and play some flip cup with my league mates, but unfortunately I couldn't lose any games of beer pong and had to stay at that table. Don't you hate it when that happens?  Am I asking a lot of retorichal questions or what? Oops there it goes again.I wasn't sure about joining this league, I actually saw it on this thing (yelp delivers again).  But then I read all these wonderful reviews, which turned out to be accurate, and I thought: Anybody who's down to go play some co-ed dodgeball and then go to the bar and play some flip cup on a wednesday night is alright with me.  The people are what really make this league.Besides, what do you really have better to do on a wednesday night then make some friends, run around playing some dodgeball, and then go have a couple brewski's? Thought so, do it.  Oh ya, I guess they got kickball and capture the flag, too.  Some of my teammates do that as well and say it's just as fun.
<review# 1125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2009,11/25/2009,149,559,4,12,8>Breakfast pizza is the most genius food you can bring in to a morning office meeting. Everyone will be delighted by delicious, fatty food that isn't sugary. It's a great ice breaker for a tense morning meeting, too. A co-worker recently brought in several kinds, and they were a huge hit: it's like an unpretentious quiche you can eat with your hands.There a variety of kinds, but I recommend one with bacon. It's perfectly crispy, whichis a rarity even for regular pizza.Perfect for hosting your own Sunday brunch party, too!

She answered all my questions and made me feel very comfortable about the experience. Did you know there's a massage component?! I love the way  my skin felt during and after the facial. I have to say, I walked in open-minded but not sure what to expect, and I left on cloud 9. I think at some point I even fell asleep it was so relaxing.Here are the steps as it feels to you (Because you can't see anything and you're only experiencing other sense):- calm music- cleansing- more cleansing- examines your face with a bright light (she covers your eyes)- more scrubs and stuff- microderm treatment- extraction of individual issues- more scrubbing- massage of shoulders, neck, arms, hands, fingers-- simply delightful!- toners, lotions, sunblocks. They feel like silk going on. I'm pretty sure the scent of witchhazel naturally woke me from my  massage induced nap. Then she'll explain what she used on you and why. There are products for purchase available. I'm not sure I'll go back as often as she recommends (once a month!) but I do think I'll be back for another in a few months and I recommend you do too!
<review# 1131,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,10/9/2014,237,146,22,27,27>Oh my.. where to start?! As many now know, this place was formerly Kamon. The new owners took over late January. With new owner comes a new renovations.  The bar side is even more spacious than before. Not to mention a lot more pleasant to look at. The ambiance is very relaxing and sometimes even club-like. My favorite days to come to the bar side is Saturday when the infamous Ben squared are working (both bartender names are Ben LOL).Sushi.. Mmmmmm.  I use to not be able to eat raw fish but now I can't have enough.  The sushi here are very fresh. As they say, from farm to chopsticks.  My favorite use to be the sexy angel, but now I have a new personal favorite. After the menu change with new rolls and a few tweaks, my new favorite is now the Alaskan. It has avocado, cucumber and crab salad inside topped with salmon and lemon slices.  For an additional kick and flavor I eat mine with a generous drizzle of chilli oil and sauce with garlic and Sriracha.  After trying this roll for the first time,  I order it every time I come here now and I never grow tired of the taste. My favorite roll off the special roll selection is the Bao Bao roll. Beware,  this roll is HUGE. Come hungry if you plan to order this roll. It's both flavorful and filling.  This place has the best happy hour in Midtown.  It lasts an entire 4.5 hours, from 2:30pm-7 (everyday!!). You have appetizers and rolls for only $5. Sake bombs go for $1.95! Most of the happy hour rolls are basic, but they don't skimp on the size. You get a full roll for the reduced price.  Sadly they only have one vegetarian roll on the happy hour menu. the green machine is still the second best of the veggie rolls. My top selection being the veggie dream. The ramen here is good for the bucks. I love the variations it comes with. You get to pick between regular or spinach noodles and then a further selection of which broth you would like,currently they have five (pork, soy, black pepper, tonkatsu,  and miso).If you have not been here yet,  what are you waiting for?! Servers here are so cheerful and attentive.  It brings a smile to my face when speaking with them.  This place is an easy five stars for me. Definitely my only stop for sushi and Japanese food. :)
<review# 1132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2014,10/8/2014,160,301,10,17,14>One word: underrated!!!! Stopped by for lunch while we were in the area.... I had this place bookmarked and read tons of great reviews for this place.. but I didn't expect it would go above and beyond the hype! They have a ton of sandwich options here, all which can be turned into a salad, comes with chips and salsa or the seasonal side (spinach pasta today). Or you can do a half sandwich and half soup or side. I opted for the tri-tip half sandwich with baked potato soup. YUM!!! The bread is so soft. If you're a fan of crunchy break-your-teeth bread, you won't like it here. The tri-tip was juicy, just enough sauce... so tender!! The soup was hot which is a good sign, but the taste was nothing special. I wish I had the homemade chips and salsa instead, because I tried my boyfriend's and it was delicious! I can't wait to return here. They're changing to a bigger location down EG Blvd even closer to where I live so I know I will be a frequent customer. Never underestimate the hole in the wall businesses!
<review# 1133,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2014,10/7/2014,205,192,10,14,12>I've seen many Yelpers post about this Vietnamese sandwich spot, but until recently, I never ventured out to try this place.  We were running errands on a Sunday and needed a quick pre-workout sandwich.The place is really a togo location.  The seating that they have is very awkward.  It was like they had 5 tables and 15 chairs, pushed it to a wall and that is the dining area.  Majority of the space is designated to the kitchen.The menu is very limited.  I did not mind it because if feel that items are fresher when they are focused on a few items.  Selections of sandwiches are: Dac Biet, bbq pork, shredding pork, steamed pork, and a vegetarian.  They do lots of togo orders and sell a lot of the steamed pork roll.  I am very particular about my steamed pork (being from San Jose) and appreciate flavorful steamed pork.I ordered the Dac Biet with extra pate.  The meat was soft and fresh.  The flavor was perfect.  It was reminiscent of a sandwich that I would get from San Jose.  The pate was flavorful and creamy.  It was so addicting that I wanted to buy a can and more bread to eat.  The bread was baked perfectly.  It was crunchy enough on the outside that it didn't cut the roof of my mouth, but it was also soft in the middle.  The perfect French roll.  The veggie tasted fresh and it really brought the sandwich together.Duc Huong you just got a new fan.  I will be going here from now on for my Vietnamese sandwiches.

The place is not very big, but its perfect for that after dinner craving for something sweet. In fact their saying is, "Where sweethearts and sweet tooth's meet!" Its pretty cute if you ask me.The lady working the front register (Mari) was so welcoming and friendly. I felt like I've known her for years, even though we had just met.  We had fun picking out our cake and ordered a couple of teas. They have a great selection of different drinks to go along with your scrumptous dessert. Oh man, and taking a bite from that cake was so amazing!!! It just melted in my mouth like a perfect wedding cake but on a much more minature scale. I want to be Alice in Wonderland and have cakes like this all day. Alas, I had to leave. Most of their inventory is done outside this establishment since their isn't anywhere where they can actually bake the goods on the premises. I can't hold that against them, but if your looking for a true bakery you might have to try elsewhere. But you can be sure we'll be back again! They even have frozen yogurt!

It turned out to be everything we had hoped for and more! The food was fantastic and the portions huge. The service and friendliness of the owner and staff were just fantastic. By the time we left they knew our names and we knew theirs.Highlights of my meal included the mussels in this heavenly broth (I tried to drink it with my spoon discretely, it was so good), the crab cake on top of my filet mignon, and the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection!We also tried the escargot but it was quite mild and I think I prefer the zing of the classic butter and garlic. I clicked like on their FB page and now I get updates on all their prix fixe and lunch specials which look great! (but is going to make my wallet get really light)
<review# 1136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2014,10/4/2014,78,67,11,10,8>Come for the beer, stay for the people. This bar really has a unique charm that makes you feel like you're in small town Europe. The atmosphere is quite special and feels cozily intimate. The Irishman fixture at the bar slurs a cordial greeting to you as you enter and you immediately make more friends than you can remember the names of. All while enjoying a large list of tap and bottled beers.My favorite patron is the fantastically carefree and recklessly hilarious Betty. Betty, 74, is a daily regular at Bonn Lair. A loquacious piss ant, she tells the most hysterical stories and is happy to offer you her negative opinion on anything. Every sentence that comes out of her mouth is littered with profanity and she really doesn't care. I'll become a regular here just for Betty.

They close their indoor seating earlier, but the drive through is open 24 hours. Good thinking because most people who try to get food in the middle of the night are just too lazy to cook, but they don't actually want to sit inside a location.We got their pork burrito and their shrimp burrito and it had all the fixings including guacamole and sour cream. Next time i will ask for no sour cream because they were pretty generous with it. Their chips tasted super fresh and their salsa was amazing. Always affordable and an extensive menu to choose from. Its also in a decent area so i don't have to worry about any riffraff when coming here. The employee working here was nice and we got our order really fast and were on our way home in no time.

<review# 1138,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/2/2014,10/2/2014,134,45,11,17,13>Sunday Brunch My sister and I decided to give Cafeteria 15L a try for brunch. (I've been for Happy Hour) My sister doesn't live in town but whenever she comes to town, she is always asking me about what new place I've been to or want to try. I've been wanting to try Cafeterias Brunch for some time now and it saddens me to say that I won't be running back anytime soon. I am glad to say that I've gotten to try it out though. As soon as we sat down, we were given waters and shortly after our waitress had come back to take our drink orders (The Morning Glory was a delightfully light alcoholic brunch drink) so she was on it. I opened my rolled silverware to find a dirty linen napkin with food stuck to the knife and crumbs inside of the napkin. I mentioned it to the waitress and she quickly apologize and returned with a new set. I love water but ended up not touching my water. (Totally felt bad because we are supposed to conserve water but it had food on the outside of the cup -not sure if it was inside too- so the water just sat there). The reason this review has 3 stars is because of the BOMB Chicken & Waffles!!!! Ah-Mazing combination from the pecan butter, Tabasco (not at all hot) seasoned chicken and of course the waffle. I've only heard positive things about the chicken and waffles so I had to try it out! My sister and I shared a plate because it is a descent sized portion of food. Our waitress was ever so kind to ask the chefs to make it so that we could get 2 pieces of chicken that still equaled to the portion sized and we were most definitely satisfied with the amount of food. The waffle was almost cold which made it kind of difficult to enjoy with the warm pecan butter but I managed to make it work. The chicken was wonderfully seasoned and Scrumptious!!!! Mmm mmmm Good! Overall the food was good and that's what matters. I will probably return for Happy Hour but not for Brunch.

Also a fine selection of draft and bottle beer all reasonably priced.____________________________3) CHEESECAKE!!! Ridiculously good house made cheesecake.If you ever wondered what cheesecake SHOULD taste like, I suggest you grab a slice here. Actually, it's more like a MASSIVE SLAP, than a slice. The entire table was blown away by the unexpected surprise of super fresh Brick House cheesecake.____________________________4) SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE!!!!We rolled up with a rather large party and our server delivered incredible service the whole night without a single issue. She was patient, friendly, quick, responsive, and just plain awesome. Split checks, no problem. Change my beer order 3 times, no problem. Extra plates/napkins/waters/more beer/etc etc etc etc etc NO PROBLEM! We honestly received the kind of attention you expect to get at a 5 star restaurant. ____________________________5) ATMOSPHERE (ohhhhh... ahhhhhh...)Beautiful interior! Lots of cavernous high ceilings with exposed beams. An interesting giant two story iron street light towers over the  entrance lounge area. Oh, and bricks... lots of pretty historic exposed brick. Would be a great date spot as well as family dinner location. They have plenty of modular space to arrange tables to accommodate larger groups as well as some more intimate booth areas.____________________________CONCLUSION?Although I live in the grid, I'm definitely going to make Brick House a destination next time I want to get off the beaten path for a solid meal and great service. I hear they have an impressive breakfast menu (mmm pancakes). If you want to get off the grid or live anywhere near Elk Grove, you really should set aside a night to try Brick House.

<review# 1141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2011,11/5/2011,562,500,19,22,19>I keep hearing people talk about Sandra Dee's like it is some dirty step child transplanted from the south.  In my opinion they are sadly mistaken.  If you want southern food, go to the south.  In my opinion Sandra Dee's is a very good example of a west coast soul kitchen.  At one time I had probably been to every soul kitchen in the Bay Area and what you find at Sandra Dee's is a good representation of what I have come to know as soul food.I have talked to Sandra about where she got her inspiration to open her restaurant and was amazed to find out it was Flint's Ribs in Oakland.  To me, Flint's was the taj mahal of ribs.  It is hard to mention their name without an "amen" at the end since they were probably the closest thing I will ever get to heaven.If there is one thing you must try on Sandra Dee's menu, it is the barbecued rib tips (amen) with a side of hot links.  They are so good it is hard for me to ever order anything else.  The meat is tender and juicy with a really nice, rich, smoky flavor and the barbecue sauce is delicious.  Make sure you order the extra spicy sauce for your ribs to give them a little extra kick.  The hot links are spicy enough on their own so you might want to stick with the mild sauce on them.The other must try item on the menu is the fried chicken.  They use a spice rub and then they deep fry the whole chicken much like you would deep fry a turkey. They usually overcook the catfish but it is still pretty good if you bring your bottle of sriracha. I come to Sandra Dee's to fulfill my need for carnivorous overindulgence.  I do not come for the sides but if there is one side dish that stands out for me it would be the spicy corn.  Caution, it is quite spicy.As far as the desserts go, I wish she would do away with the mini sweet potato pies.  I do not like mini things that are not meant to be mini.  Bake a sweet potato pie and give me a slice please.  On one occasion Sandra Dee brought me a complimentary slice of the best red velvet cake I have ever had.  I have been dying to try it again but every time I try to order it they say they do not have any.  Don't be such a big tease Sandy.
<review# 1142,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2011,11/4/2011,253,90,10,9,8>This is hands-down my favorite pizza place in Sacramento. My first experience where I met my devastatingly handsome boyfriend was at the Folsom location, but this one is just as good. The pizza is fantastic. I've never had a bad experience with anything I've ever ordered. The two pizzas that I'm quite fond of, are the Chicago Fire combination deep dish pizza, and the original thin crust with pepperoni. They put the pepperoni under the cheese so it's like a surprise comes with each bite! And oh em gee do I love surprises! Their salads are not over-dressed and the portions are pretty big. One of my friends has become addicted to their chicken wings, and swears they are the best thing on the menu. The moral of the story is that if you like deep dish, go here. Possible side effects may include: uncontrollable salivation, immediate sleepiness after consumption, and visions of euphoria.
<review# 1143,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2011,11/3/2011,141,309,5,13,10>What's this? A cool-looking place, that's affordable, with outdoor seating, opening up in my sleepy little stretch of Arden Arcade? Do my eyes deceive me?Well, my stomach certainly doesn't! This place is yummy, and I've only ventured in for two quick lunches - first, a takeout order of a spicy beef shawarma. It was spicy, delicious beef with veggies in a warm, freshly made pita half. Next, for a quick lunch with mom - we got two kebabs and mmmmmmed as we gobbled them.I saw them setting this place up for months and was excited to read Teresa's review, which tipped me off that they're now open. I stopped by, hungry, eager to check the new place out. I've met a bunch of their employees, who are all incredibly polite, smiley, and helpful. I need to go back for a longer visit to check out the goods, but I saw:In front, umbrellas with chairs and tables (sadly, with the view of Watt Avenue).To the left, a bakery, restaurant, and drink bar. To the rear, a store with all kinds of undiscovered ethnic goodies and fresh produce.To the right, HOOKAH! I'm not sure if they were for sale or for rent, but if for rent, that could end up a fun little joint for myself and some friends. They also had some flowy looking clothing and other miscellaneous supplies.They still have a good amount of open, unfilled counter space, especially within the bakery counters, so I think they're waiting to fill more when more customers venture in. So venture away, my friends, so they'll keep cooking up the good stuff!
<review# 1144,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/29/2011,11/2/2011,153,70,10,10,8>Out of all the places I've had bookmarked to try, Cafe Rolle was definitely on my list the longest and was the closest to me... and I had no idea. I figured it would be closer to midtown, but I guess I should have paid attention to the rules of the grid.. 1, 2, 3, A, B, C... And 5357 H is awefully close to 6000 J (CSUS).. Luckily for me, I am not a geography major. I'm an Asian woman, and I proudly accept the fact I can't navigate myself out of a paper bag.I am happy I found my way over here though, because the food here is so yummy! The first time I ever came here, I ordered the hot smoked salmon sandwich, which is DE-LICIOUS! I ordered to-go, because I wanted to eat at home...My second time here, I came with my man and ate in. We got there around peak lunch time, so there were a few people in front of us.  We were contemplating ordering to-go, and the waiter said everyone who was waiting wanted to sit inside.. and if we wanted, he could clear a table for us outside. Ok, why not? He grabs our order, sends it to the counter, and gets a table ready for us with our own little water containers. I don't remember what my man ordered, but I know I got the stacy's favorite.. which is my new favorite.. Just watch out, the garlic kicked my butt! I think I chewed through a whole pack of gum that day.The people who work here are super nice, and really attentive. J'adore cafe rolle!
<review# 1145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2011,11/1/2011,642,604,12,13,10>My parents surprised my sister and me by renting an RV for us to use and drive up to our cousin's wedding in Red Bluff, CA. The best idea my mom could have ever come up with! We were faced with having to transport 300 cupcakes, a large cupcake tier display, a top wedding cake, 6 large containers of butter cream icing, (that had to be stored in a huge ice chest), countless pre made, delicate fondant flowers, 4 adult passengers, a dog, and of course, suitcases with dress clothing that needed to be hung. The motor home we were issued was just awesome! It was large and spacious with all the modern conveniences! It could sleep 5 people comfortably. There is a private bathroom, shower and wash basin. Cute kitchenette with double sink, propane stove & oven. A microwave, small refrigerator & freezer. A nice stereo system for the radio or CD player. There was also a hook up for TV, but there wasn't one present. I guess you have to bring your own or maybe rent it additionally. Water heater, air conditioning or heating thermostat controls are all in one easy, accessible location. We could even expand one side of the RV for additional space when parked. This vehicle was self contained! You could have the lights and appliances on even when the engine wasn't running which would use about a gallon of gas per hour. The ride was extremely comfortable and even our fragile cargo survived, through a stretch of bumpy road work. I can't say more at how much fun using this RV was for the 4 day usage. And I also can't say how much it cost my parents since they wouldn't give out that information, but they are certainly in the low income bracket like most of us. So it must have been pretty reasonable for the price of this luxury! Don't tell any one, but staying in the motor home was my favorite part of our trip!
<review# 1146,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2011,10/31/2011,287,110,9,16,12>Wow, just wow!Let me start by saying that fancy-shmancy places like this usually aren't my thing. However, I've realized--after helping a good friend of mine plan a birthday event here-- that I may have to let my inner snazzy girl shine more often!The place is a bit pricey, but it's well worth shelling out the extra dough if you can afford it. You're not only paying for quality food and stellar ambience when you dine here. You're paying for technique. Yeah, I said it--technique. The food they're serving up at Lounge ON20 is straight up Top Chef style. They're deconstructing, molecular gastronomy-ing,  and all types of cool shit. Upon leaving this restaurant, one can't say, "well that was a waste. I could've cooked that on my own." Eh-eh, those words will not come out of your mouth. This isn't the down home, simple food you grew up on. I mean, really, did your mother know how to sous vide? Can you turn mango puree into the consistency of an egg yolk? Let me see you make a Tapatio foam. Yeah, I thought so. You can't, can you? Chef Pajo isn't only impressive for the food he serves up, but also for his down to earth nature and friendly disposition. When planning the event, he walked us through choosing a special menu and possible set-ups of the area we reserved. The end result was delicious food and a hang out area that had ample space to sit and/or stand and mingle. All of the above would've made for a perfect night, but the greatness didn't end there. Chef Pajo took the time to come out and demonstrate his molecular gastronomy skills by showing us how to turn mango puree into what looked and felt like egg yolk. So cool! A few of us even got to try it out ourselves--fun!!! I'm happy to say that this swanky spot is now on my radar as one of the coolest restaurants in Midtown. Great location, too!
<review# 1147,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2011,10/30/2011,249,49,8,12,10>Vic's is POPPIN' (with popcorn). Sometimes when I come in, the store windows are fogged up from the freshly popping kernels. I feel like slapping my hand onto one of the panes and dragging it down like in that steamy scene in Titanic. Then, I'd shiver profusely while wrapped up in a blanket. Speaking of shivering, last Halloween I decided I wanted to make those "spooky" popcorn hands with the candy corn nails for some clients. Well, I couldn't just get any popcorn; I had to find the good stuff (after all, I'm representing a company... couldn't make us look bad). I came to Vic's guided by the recommendations of some friends and am happy I took their advice. I used Vic's delicious kettle corn for my project. When Christmas rolled around and I just needed a boat load of snackage to feed an office of 12+ staff, I bought the XL bags of Vic's Mix (caramel, cheddar and gourmet white) which hold approx. 22 cups or so. I tied up a sparkly ribbon on them suckers and I was good to go! They all loved it.     Customers can try pretty much any flavor they carry. There's a ton to choose from, too. I don't know if there's a schedule for the rotation of their more "special" flavors, but it's pretty cool to see how creative they get with popcorn as their medium. Did I read somewhere about a bacon flavor?? I haven't tried it, but c'mon, that's cool! Let's just say Vic's is like the Jelly Belly of the popcorn world.One thing that kinda' tainted the experience for me during one of my visits was a guy (he wasn't the owner, I asked him) working the morning shift the week of Christmas. I ordered that boat load of popcorn (10 XLs and a medium)  and he didn't even offer to help me bring 'em to my car. Keep in mind, only two XLs fit very snug into your average size plastic shopping bag. He was the only one working and there was another customer, but a polite "sir, would you mind if I quickly help her bring these to her car? I'll be right back to help you" would have probably done the trick. Not only that, but he messed up on the total of my purchase and when I came back to get it fixed, he messed up the change. I just left because I didn't want to deal with it anymore. Two nights prior, I ordered the same amount and the two young ladies offered to help me out to my car right away, which was a nice gesture. They were really helpful with all my questions, too.A few tips: + They have those "buy 9 XLs, get the 10th free" cards.  + Kettle corn is around $0.25 - $0.50 cheaper compared to the other flavored popcorn. They have something mistakenly marked on their register buttons and on one of their signs that doesn't account for that. Make sure to mention it.+ The gourmet white popcorn may seem like nothing special, but it's surprisingly tasty for plain popcorn!
<review# 1148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/13/2011,10/29/2011,794,137,6,12,10>Get your tootsies in open-toed shoe condition here.  This place is always VERY clean, sort of minimalist modern chic decor, and the ladies are very friendly and meticulous.  It's also affordable, and best of all, it's easy to get an appointment (even on a walk-in basis).  They have tons of chairs for both fingers and toes, and even though it's always packed, I've had an easy time getting in even at the last minute on a weekend.  And, yay!  They're actually open on Sundays!  Not many nail salons are, and that's a huge perk for me.  The selection of colors is very extensive.  They have OPI, the axiom gels, and a huge array of Essie (my personal favorite).  The nail polishes are always fresh.  You won't find tacky old polishes on the shelves (like some places in town).  My first time there, I went in shortly after having surgery because (1) a pedicure was sorely needed, and (2) I thought it would make me feel a little better.  The ladies were so nice to me and made sure I was comfortable.  I looked like hell and felt like hell, and a simple pedicure was a much needed pick-me-up that brightened my day.  So thank you Melody!  You bought yourself a loyal client with your kindness and good will.Plus it's right next door to a froyo place, so you can enjoy some frozen delight while you get a pedicure.
<review# 1149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2010,12/16/2010,45,96,4,11,8>Sactown's most dynamic bartender is back and has clearly created the place he's always wanted. Definitely up a notch in classiness from the Raven (but I still love that place, too), and its total opposite in terms of natural light (that is sunshine, not the beer!). But if you don't like sports you may not like it here -- his projection screen takes up an entire wall and the picture is incredible so get ready to see some sports players' sweat up close and personal. I'm really excited about football season now.This not your father's stinky sports bar by any stretch. The decor is very classy and the food is darn good. It's bar food done very tastefully. I loved my veggie burger -- the sauce on the very tasty bun tasted like a cilantro pesto of some sort and I thought, a chef at a sports bar who doesn't brush off the veg menu options? Nice work. The atmosphere is convivial, as cultivated by everyone's friend Jimmy, and I really think this is a perfect addition to East Sac. I'm looking forward to going back!
<review# 1150,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2010,12/15/2010,44,132,4,5,4>My boyfriend is a huge fan of this place and is always talking about it. Since I've been on a sushi kick, we decided to go for dinner. For $15.95 you can eat all the sushi your body can handle. I ordered all of the veggie rolls they offer - which is only like 4. The Veggie Walnut is hands down the best. For dessert, you best be ordering the fried bananas - sprinkled with a little cinnamon and sugar its perfecto!Our waiter was super friendly, smiley and attentive. There was another guy working who was the complete opposite, I'm glad we didn't have to deal with him as much.I think for me it's a better deal to come at lunch for $12. It's not the best sushi I've ever had, but it's yummy and I'll be back.
<review# 1151,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/31/2010,12/14/2010,71,119,1,9,4>My wife and I took my visiting sister and brother-in-law here for dinner Sunday night and came about very, very satisfied. This was actually the second time my wife and I have eaten here, and it confirmed our assessment of the place: excellent food coupled with decent service.This place has a wide variety of Italian food options, including a respectable array of vegetarian options -- more than just the token spaghetti with marina and pasta primavera you find at some Italian eateries. (They do not, unfortunately, have vegetarian lasagna, a shame since they tout their lasagna as being voted best in Sacramento.)We all ordered different items, and we were all quite pleased with our selections, which were generous in portion. My wife (the vegetarian) ordered fettuccine alfredo, which was quite tasty: nice mild, creamy sauce and perfectly cooked noodles. I  thoroughly enjoyed by chicken parmigiana: The chicken was tender with a crispy coating, sitting atop a mound of spaghetti and nicely spiced marinara sauce. I would have liked more cheese on the dish -- but then, I really like cheese.My sister ordered the pesto pizza with assorted veggies, including artichoke hearts, tomato, garlic, and mushrooms. The pie was very flavorful with superb pesto sauce and fresh veggies. We ordered the thin crust, which frankly seemed like regular crust, not super-thin crispy crust you find at some pizza places. That was fine, though; we all liked it.Finally, my brother-in-law ordered the aforementioned lasagna, which was really tasty too. I figure the sauce was the same that I enjoyed with my spaghetti, except it had the beef in it. The other ingredients were tasty as well.Accompanying the entrées were some uninspired salads, compromised of iceberg lettuce, croutons, and a sprinkling of cheese.  They were perfectly fine for what they were, though; everything was fresh.The meals also came with garlic bread, and they gave us a large portion in a basket instead of giving us each a single piece. That was nice: It meant we were able to bring home extra with our ample leftovers.The service, meanwhile, is fine, y'know? They're friendly, they take your order correctly and bring you what you ask for, etc. They can be on the slow side, though, insofar as checking to offer drink refills, taking away extra plates when entrées arrive, or giving you, say, knives for your food. These are fairly minor issues, mind, and I'm quite happy to give this place four stars.
<review# 1152,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/21/2010,12/13/2010,78,80,4,9,6>Update: a few small issues necessitate a slight revision of my former glowing review. Five orders in, the flowers are still stunning - true artistry in the floral arrangements. The issues I've encountered:On an order for a client, I requested a receipt be sent for our accounting department so they could reconcile against the credit card statement. No receipt was sent, so I had to call and put in another request to get one.For the same arrangement noted above, I requested the price range of $75-85 (under a $100 budget after tax, delivery, etc). Obviously I'd not seen the receipt, so was dismayed to find when I saw the company credit card statement that the arrangement came in at $125.  As our client is a non-profit, we try to keep unnecessary expenses like flowers to a reasonable amount - so going over budget by 25% reflects poorly on me.Finally, for an arrangement we ordered for a co-worker, I was able to see the flowers over the long term, and was surprised that some parts of the bouquet looked wilted on the second day. I know hydrangeas are relatively delicate, but I usually expect bouquets to look fresh for more than 24 hours after purchase.I'm not sure I'll write off East Sac Florist for good, but with SO many closer, more convenient options - I'll think twice next time.
<review# 1153,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/10/2010,12/12/2010,148,83,5,9,8>Bandera is cozy from food to atmosphere, yet also sophisticated in its simplicity. The wide wood-paneled walls offer a rustic, pioneer feel, yet the crisply-dressed staff in white chef coats embody the classiness of this joint. The waiters don't miss a beat. They don't shout your name when your table is ready. They simply collect you from the bar and cheerfully escort you to your table. If you drop a bit of sauce on the white paper table top, they swiftly wipe it away as if it never happened. (Oh, if only someone could come to my house and do this!)You might expect to pay a pretty penny for service like this, but the price is fairly reasonable. You can order a sandwich or salad for around $12-14. But if you've got a little more to splurge, enjoying some variety from the menu is highly recommended. The ala cart menu, for instance, offers a single enchilada for $6. My husband and I split it as an appetizer. It comes Christmas-style with two sauces: red and green. Both are excellent. The red isn't your typical enchilada sauce, though it certainly has the similar spicy notes like you'd find in other red sauces. Yet, lurking amidst the pleasant heat is a mysteriously round flavor that I couldn't quite place. Not caraway. Not cumin. What was it? When I asked, the waitress told me it's a house secret. I can see why. It's wonderfully unique. As an entrée, I ordered the blackened fish sandwich, which is moist and filling and could compete with most good fish sammies. The Thai-inspired coleslaw that comes with it is outstanding, filled with loads of cilantro, peanuts, and bit of sweetness. That coleslaw alone is worth returning for again and again.Bandera also offers a nice selection of fresh (not sugary) mixed drinks and a rounded selection of microbrews to complete the meal.  (Sorry, I didn't look at the wine. But if it's in keeping with the rest of the menu, I'm sure it's quite nice.)For simple, yet creative food served with the highest of quality, I couldn't recommend Bandera more. It makes for a lovely night out.

Something about bathing in the hypnotic glow of the theatre's beautiful and historic neon sign transports me back to the days when going to movies was a much bigger part of the culture. I imagine Bogie talking about "a hill of beans" with Bergman in the same sort of spot. The Tower is a place for cinephiles seeking quality indies they won't find at the 18-plex down the street. If you're looking for comfort, look elsewhere. The theatres are crammed into makeshift rooms with uncomfortable seats. The lobby is musty and could use a little work. There is a lot of potential, but again, this place is all about the flicker on the screen. On a side note, check out the adjacent Tower Cafe for some all-over-the-place international grub. I'll save that for another review...
<review# 1155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/1/2010,12/10/2010,70,158,4,7,7>I've been going crazy to find pork spring rolls just as great as Brodard at Garden Grove, California. I've been day dreaming about eating spring rolls ever since then. I'm not the type that likes spring rolls but these pork ones are so darn good, it will convert you.Finally ended up eating here after a friend suggested it to my boyfriend and I. Hallelujah! It's just as good as Brodard's spring rolls and you get to make it yourself. It's fun, interactive, and delicious. We made the mistake of ordering other dishes, mine being a soup that I can't remember the name. It was good, I just wish I could've finished it but I was stuffed from all the spring rolls.To me the 2 person spring roll dish is really filling, so I would order that first and if you still feeling hungry order more. The sauce is so great too, mmmmmm. I have to admit that I didn't try the pickled pork that came with it... I'm a bit scared and I'm satisfied with just the pork on the stick.We asked the server what to do because we were thinking it would be embarrassing if we started to make it and did the wrong thing. He was nice and helpful. One of my new favorite places. Everyone that loves vietnamese restaurants or at least spring rolls should try this place! **I just remembered something. The tables are small for more than two people, we ordered the make your own spring rolls and two other dishes. When our third party came, our order took up his side :( I just wonder how they fit four people ordering 2 spring roll dishes??? This place might be a problem for big groups.

We went and sat in the Gold Rush section and had a clear view of everything, but I wouldn't mind just getting lawn seats next time. Just make sure you bring something to sit on. Check the website for different deals and promotions. We went on Tuesday and when you bring a kraft singles wrapper the tickets are buy one get one free! (only for three certain sections, though.. GRR website didn't say that). Like I said, there really isn't a bad seat so it doesn't really make a difference. They give away things during the game to get fans pumped, too. This particular time the river cats pitcher struck out a particular player so everyone got a ticket for a free appetizer at streets of london (streets has food? what??) or Bislas. Sweeeet!Even if you aren't too big into baseball (like me), give it a shot!

We picked out some obscure bottled sodas and paid, then waited for a little longer than expected.  This was okay, because they had a bunch of midtown publications for me to read while we waited (these come in handy for Midtown newbies!).  Anyway, when we finally got our sandwiches, we were SO happy.  These are DELICIOUS.  Everything just tastes fresh and homemade and amazing.  The marinara sauce was excellent, my chicken was juicy and delicious, the meatballs on my fiance's sandwich were SO TASTY, there was plenty of cheese on both of our sandwiches, along with tomatoes and pepperocinis, which complimented the sandwiches SO WELL.  The bread was fresh and flavorful.  Absolutely no complaints from me with these delicious sandwiches.I'm so excited to return and try out some of the meats and Italian dishes they have (like lasagna!).  What a wonderful little find, I'm very pleased. :)

There it was, a shimmering beacon of hope in a sea of lunch desperation. How fortuitous was it that I happened to be mailing a package at the central post office and saw the Happy Go Lucky cart standing conspicuously caddy corner? Why, drinking from too many aluminum beer cans must have fogged my memory! This place was once on my list of must-visits and somehow became buried deep in the recesses of my to-try cuisine list. Now, like Cortez finding a river of gold, like Shackleton making it to the South Pole, like grandpa discovering Viagra, I HAD FOUND IT!!!! The decision was made immediately to abandon yet another repetitious sojourn to one of my stagnant lunch haunts and, instead, make the journey over to what should be, had to be, MUST BE, a treasure trove of veggie delectables. As I stood in line at the post office, pondering whether Mr. Flattop Postmaster had actually cut off his braided rattail (nay), the anticipation and excitement inside me grew at the prospect of Happy Go Lucky. Would it be everything people had said? Were Notdogs on the menu? What about soy bean rights? Running like a first-grader about to pee his pants, I lept across the street and reviewed the five lunch items displayed in full color on the lunchboard. They were all worthy sounding, and after making smalltalk with the very affable owner and further discussing the options with him, I went with the much ballyhooed terriyaki bowl. Oh, my quivering tastebuds rejoiced at the prospect of new edibles as I fantasized about devouring the meal while walking six blocks back to my windowless cubicle, box sealed tight. I had not even taken my seat amongst the towers of paper before I sourced a fork and tore open the lid of the recycleable lunch carton, revealing al dente steamed veggies, gloriously bursting brown rice and a heaping mound of soy chicken. Fabulous. Oh, I thought, savoring each chomp more than the last, blessed be the tattooed friendly man at Happy Go Lucky for thou hast created a vegetarian. Ok, I'm not there yet, but you've definitely well-earned a repeat customer.
<review# 1159,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/4/2013,6/20/2013,1214,515,9,19,18>I hadn't tried the Plum Vegan since the place first changed hands about a year ago. Back then, my sandwich was a bit dry and I was worried the new ownership wasn't gonna get things right. After all, serving vegan-only food means you start with one strike against you (lots of folks won't ever give it a try) and it takes a lot of creativity to crank out burgers, reubens and the like - sans meat - and have people coming back for more.So what's changed?- The old bathroom door has been relocated to the hallway. Big improvement.- The back patio has been cleaned up, with a nice fountain along an entire wall. Gone is the "'smokers' alley" feel. You can really enjoy a meal back here!- The whole restaurant is clean. Nice to enjoy vegan without feeling you're at a Deadheads revival.Their standard, the sweet potato panini, remains delicious and as good as it ever was. The reuben is amazing, and considering the vegan-ness of it, is 5 stars for me.You can't compare this to a $6 burger or a taqueria pound-plus burrito. At close to $10, their average sandwich isn't cheap, and it's not a belly-buster. But you get a meal that's delicious, won't leave you comatose, and you're doing something great for the earth (unlike that other cafe that was founded on "Earth Day").The experience is worth the price, and I'll definitely be coming back to try more entrees!

So, when I want to take him out for a long walk and maybe a picnic on a shady lawn, public parks are really not our best option.I discovered City Cemetery when I was in high school. I liked it because I could go here to be left alone and write in my weird journal and eat my weird sandwiches. As an adult, I come back often to walk the dog, walk myself, and picnic. It's quiet, beautiful, and always about 10 degrees cooler than anywhere else on a hot day. Few people, even less dogs, and everyone keeps to themselves. If you aren't freaked out by the concept of cemeteries, it's wonderful.
<review# 1162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2013,6/17/2013,432,335,24,28,24>Stick a fork in me because I am DONE!  I am happy.  Euphorically happy.  Tummy satisfied.  We walked in a little past 5:00 p.m. on a Friday and had the whole run of the place.  Lena was our saucy sassy waitress extraordinaire!  She was on it: hustling and bustling as her section filled up quickly after we were seated.  We had a Groupon (paid $12 for $25) and it was well worth it!  We started with spicy fried calamari w/side of spicy dipping sauce. This was a hearty sized appetizer and the calamari pieces were fried perfectly and dusted with spicy seasonings.  Me and the Kiddo were all "hoo haah" breathing and sucking down our glasses of water by the time we finished that appetizer.  Hubs had the Chicken Wing Thing with a side of spicy greens, a side of creamy potato salad, and a cornbread muffin.  The chicken was PERFECTION: moist, tender, crisp, expertly seasoned.  Kiddo had the Chicken Caesar salad- so much shredded chicken!  I had the grilled Jumbo Prawns (7 pcs.) with a side of creamy Mac and cheese and a side of lovely green beans.  A Hush Puppy was thrown in with the grilled prawns for good measure.  A side of tartar sauce, cocktail sauce and lemon wedges came with the plate.  Grilled Jumbo Prawns:  succulent, sweet and juicy!  Didn't dare to drown them in tartar sauce, no.  Simply squeezed lemon all over and took delight in every single bite.  Room for dessert?  Sadly, no.  We were stuffed and rolled out of there pre food coma symptoms.
<review# 1163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2013,6/16/2013,642,604,19,26,26>Imagine if you will a culinary destination that combines Vietnamese style vegetarian cuisine, with an enlightened journey to health, wellness and the Age of Aquarius.  OK, so it wasn't quite an out of body experience, but the food was very down to earth in more ways than one!  Delectable morsels of fresh vegetables, fruits and tofu, were prepared in enticing variations of dishes that made decision making a difficult process.  The intention of the restaurant owner is to represent the teachings of Budha, respect animals & nature and show concern for the environment.  With this in mind, we now have a sanctuary that is a dream come true for the vegan, vegetarian and the meat curious alike.  While the menu seems small and limited, it covers a variety of surprising options.  Not only are vegetables the featured focus, but some of their recipes are created to resemble and even taste like shrimp, Peking duck, beef, chicken, even ham!  The owner of this quaint and cozy restaurant, "Mai", greeted my boyfriend and me as soon as we walked in.  She was very personable and genuinely pleased to have us as customers.   She enthusiastically explained the dishes on the menu and what each offered.   After some discussion, we narrowed things down to splitting a papaya salad, which consisted of a mound of shredded papaya, topped with tasty pieces of sweet & spicy bits of unknown something's, along with chopped peanuts and cut lettuce.  The shredded papaya had little flavor, but when mixed with the other toppings, gave it a pleasant combination of tastes.  A soy based dressing also accompanied the salad.  Next, I ordered as a main course - "The Seven Treasures", which had delicious fried tofu triangles seasoned with salt & pepper, mixed with lightly sautéed red & green bell peppers.  A generous serving of steamed rice also came with it.  I found the tofu and peppers to be very good together, although I can only eat so much bell pepper before I get bored with eating them.  Joe K. ordered the "Bun Hue" that contained noodles, mushrooms, vegetables, and tofu in a flavorful broth.  There were even faux ham slices mixed in, that actually had a subtle flavor of ham.  He really enjoyed this variation of a popular Vietnamese dish.  When given the choice, I will most often eat vegetarian dishes and skip the meat flavored foods.  But I have to say, that this place strives to make your experience not only pleasant, but has a way of awakening your senses to a higher plain of dining heaven!
<review# 1164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/2/2013,6/15/2013,92,91,9,7,8>So I gave it another chance, mostly because Boiling Crab was packed and my mom really wanted to try out Boiling Crab, I took her to the closest thing to BC. Firehouse Crawfish. It was also packed, but at least I wouldnt have to wait an hour. We were seated by an attractive waitress. Service was not that good. I felt as though they ignored us and were busy helping out the younger ppl. That's fucked up. But.......the food was good enough that it didnt matter to me. 5 stars because I was bloody impressed. I obviously didnt know what i was doing because i ordered the fusion, original, and thick blast. Eventually she told me I should just get the original and explosion and combine it to make a fusion. Make sense......So after a very complicating ordering process we waited.....and waited for our food. My dad is an impatient ass foo, and kept on complaining "Where is the food!? Tell them to bring the fries out! I'm hungry!" Eh......old people.So food came out and SHIIIIIT. I ordered an Explosion 3rd degree and that shit was SPICY! I could feel it in my throat. I was tearing up. My nose started running and my face was just red. Holy shit.........but kept eating it cause it was delicious. Eventually, I just couldnt take it no more and poured some of my Dad's original into my explosion. Helped.......but still painful. Omg. The corn was amazing. I like that they put corn with the sauce, not like BC where they put corn in a separate bag. That shit cray. I can't believe that I couldnt even finish my food this time, so of course I took it home.....and ate it at home. Bad idea, cause I was so full I couldnt even burp. But anyway, I just want y'all to know that it was amazing. The shrimp was crisp and delicious compared to the first time I went. And the fact that I had tons of eye candy made me enjoy my food more. Fusion is definitely my new favorite sauce. Thick blast is a bit heavy for me. 3rd degree is pretty spicy, but if you can handle it then sure. I'm sticking with 2.
<review# 1165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2013,6/14/2013,129,149,3,15,9>I attended the soft opening for the new Bento Box location in Midtown Sacramento on 2-16-2013. I have not been to the other Bento Boxes, but from what I can tell, this will be their flagship, higher-end location. My first impression: I loved the style of the place. High ceilings, modern industrial furniture, beautiful bar and sushi bar (and both were very large), stunning fountain. It had a very crisp, cool, refreshing feel to it. I definitely liked that there were tons of tables but they were spaced in a logical way so that you don't feel like you're two centimeters from the next table. They made a great use of their space. They only had a limited menu for the soft opening, but I definitely enjoyed what we were served. The Bento Box (their signature, of course) came with rice, a vegetable I was told changes daily, a crisp salad with creamy sesame dressing (that wasn't overdone with mayonnaise like some Japanese restaurants do), the main entree (in this case, a tasty Thai chili grilled chicken), and a fortune cookie. Prior to the entrees we were served a "Jale bomb," which consisted of battered/fried jalapenos topped with tobiko and sushi sauces on a bed of daikon "noodles." Then we were served a "taster" of their California roll, which was made with black rice, a healthier, more nutrient-rich rice. I ordered the Oregon roll in lieu of the Bento Box, which was made up of crab and avocado and topped with salmon, tobiko, and what I think was some kind of citrus sauce. I loved that sauce, it was unique and added excellent flavor to the salmon. Service-wise, I was there for a soft opening, so they are still working on their operational flow... we did feel very well taken care of, however, but that was also because all the employees were there and they outnumbered the guests! Of course, we got there right at the beginning, so everyone very earnestly approached us. My companion and I were greeted by several nice ladies at the front and seated at the bar for a drink. The bartender graciously explained to us the limited drink menu of the night and had been prepped with the appropriate knowledge for explaining the offered wine and sake. The managers (and possibly owners?) came and talked to us briefly. When we were re-seated at a table, our waiter Kirsten told us about the menu and what she thought were good choices. I liked that she explained to us just how quick the sushi can be made and then, appropriately, served my sushi entree at the same time as my companion's bento box. At this time, the sushi chef actually came out and greeted us as well and educated us about the "black rice," which I had never heard of, and its health benefits over regular white rice. He was super friendly and genuinely cared about what we thought of the sushi. Overall, I had a wonderful experience at the soft opening and I can't wait to try their regular dinner menu and specialty cocktails. From what I could gather, they seem like they have very reasonable, appropriate prices that will easily win out over Mikuni's or Sapporo's, which in my opinion tend to be overpriced for what you get. They seem like they will be a great place to get a quick sushi lunch, or a nicer sushi dinner without having to pay asininely high prices for mediocre food. Instead, you'll get good, fresh fish with excellent presentation and top-notch service. They will offer a champagne taste on a beer budget and that is a distinction that will set them apart from the other sushi restaurants and keep people coming back for more. Good job, Bento Box, you've satisfied this Yelper and I'll be seeing you again soon! Five stars for a well-handled soft opening event! Hopefully, those five stars will remain after I try standard dinner service. Hopefully they can compete with the likes of Kru, which is noted for being a gourmet Japanese/sushi restaurant. While the bento box might seem a little bit casual, it will all depend on the quality, presentation, and variety of the food. I have a feeling this place will, at the very least, offer high-quality sushi at comparable prices to lesser sushi bars. For fancier gourmet entrees, we will wait and see!
<review# 1166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/21/2013,6/13/2013,90,109,9,20,13>I am Chinese.  I like Chinese food.  This is one of my top three places to eat authentic Chinese food in Sacramento.  Cons:- Located in strip mall, the atmosphere is not so inviting.  Large windows along with sports/Chinese TV and the kitchen is kinda part of the dining room (think The Kitchen, without the show).  Really small, cramped dining room.  I can't blame them, Chinese people like to eat together so they have to have a couple of big tables but these really cramp up the place.  On the other hand, if you show up with 10 people, they have a round table with the lazy Susan on it for ya.- Service is kinda spotty and could be taken as rude.  Usually 1 or 2 people working the restaurant so if it gets busy, you could be begging for service.Pros:- Food is excellent.  This is authentic Chinese food.  The flavors are spot on.  This is the kind of place for people not so familiar with Chinese food to try some authentic Chinese food.  Have you ever had something called the "Clay Pot" or Bao - this is the place to try it cause it is good.- Good selection of fresh vegetables.  Contrary to popular belief, Chinese people eat a lot of vegetables and that is a standard dish to order.  They have typically a selection of 3-4 fresh vegetables.  Just ask what is fresh and in season.- Food comes out fresh.  Some reviews were complaining about dishes coming out one at a time.  You think they are 8 guys back there cooking the 8 dishes you ordered simultaneously?  Um no, they bring the dishes out piping hot as they come off the wok, genius.  I mean, piping "burn your kids mouth" hot so watch it.- Dishes we ordered this time:     Stir Fry Snow Pea Sprouts with Garlic (like full cloves, like 10 full cloves)     Clay Pot with fish and tofu     Fujian Fried Rice (great for the kids, includes a sauce over fried rice)     Fried taro     Some kind of eggplant stir fry - don't know the name of that one.This is a restaurant that I will take Chinese visitors to Sacramento to.
<review# 1167,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/5/2012,6/12/2013,290,371,10,16,11>After months of waiting we finally got a chance to check out Bacon and Butter. Even though the place is currently rated 3.5 stars I really wasn't sure what to expect from all the mixed reviews on Yelp. However, I admit I've only heard good things by word of mouth. We arrived around 11:00am and there was a short wait of only 30 minutes. I'm not sure if this is normal for a Sunday or there was just less of a wait since the CIM was in town (at the end of the block actually). After four of us were seated in a nice spacious booth we were warmly greeted. I decided to try one of my boyfriend's favorites- biscuits and gravy and have a (naughty) vanilla latte. The service was great and presentation of dishes was done very well. My sunny side egg couldn't look anymore perfect on top of my gravy covered biscuit with slice of bacon on the side. I enjoyed the flavor of the smokey homemade gravy with the biscuit and egg yolk so much it was gone in no time. I did notice my dish looked a little smaller than my boyfriend and two other friend's. For the price, they could have thrown in another biscuit or slice of bacon or both!I had a couple bites of my boyfriends breakfast burger. I admit his burger looked and tasted really good. I could have probably still finished half of his burger and potatoes after my breakfast. The burger patty was thick and stacked with fresh cheese, arugula and egg. The mixture of juices from everything were quite a creation.The vanilla latte was good then just alright. There was a lot of ice so it got watery half way through breakfast. The flavor of the coffee seemed kinda light to the pour of alcohol. I know that's not necessarily a bad thing but it was a latte and during brunch. I think I added a little sugar to suit my liking.Overall I'll return to Bacon and Butter. I'm curious about some of the other things on their menu and love that they use fresh local ingredients. This was a pretty cool spot for brunch, hope we're just as lucky next time and don't have to wait too long to get our grub on.
<review# 1168,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2013,6/11/2013,149,373,7,10,6>From time to time the gods will smile down upon us and give us a place like El Papagayo.  As I stuff my face with baja tofu tacos, I smile back with thanks (cilantro in teeth) and praise all that is holy that I will never again be subjected to subpar cheese enchiladas and the boring veggie burritos whenever I craved Mexican food.    When we heard about vegetarian tacos I was intrigued and worried.  I've had tofu tacos before and they had been disappointing.  So imagine my surprise when the tacos tasted quite delicious!  The Baja Tofu Tacos came on a plate of refried beans, rice, the usual sour cream/guacamole/lettuce garnishment and two tacos.  The tacos were corn tortillas stuffed with fried tofu cubes, cabbage, pineapple, and the most fabulous red sauce that I think they call "diabla sauce."  If this combination frightens you, there are many other non vegetarian options on the menu.  However, I beg you, give it a try before you decide it is too "rabbit food" for you to eat!  BF got the Champinones Rancheros Tacos and while I thought they were quite good, they were nowhere as good as the tofu tacos.  The tacos were filled with sauteed mushrooms, onions, cilantro and salsa.  They were a bit soggy and the flavor just wasn't as good as the tofu tacos.  We had also heard about their infamous salsa bar and sure enough, it did not disappoint.  We were promptly greeted at the door by a lady who also brought us water and a large basket of chips.  She pointed us towards the salsa bar and I hurried over to check out the goods.  There was a large pan of pickled jalapenos and carrots, and 5 other salsas, including that creamy looking green one that is my favorite and a mango/cucumber one that was exceptionally tasty.  While I cannot vouch for the non vegetarian options, I can say that their food is quite good.  Judging by the amount of patrons El Papagayo had in their dining room on a Sunday night, I would venture to say that many others have discovered this gift of gods, El Papagayo.  I will soon be back to explore the rest of the expansive vegetarian/vegan menu and I will most certainly come back on a Wednesday night to stuff my inner obese house cat with all you can eat vegan tacos.When the gods are good to you, you do not crap in their faces.  You would be crapping in their faces if you do not go and experience the tacos (vegetarian or not) of El Papagayo.

<review# 1172,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2007,3/18/2007,43,92,,3,2>I had the California Crepe with Chicken, filled with huge chunks of chicken breast, avocado, provolone?, and other good stuff. It was very, very good, but next time I don't know if I'd order chicken to be added. It seemed good without the extra chicken. The order came with roasted potatoes, which I didn't find that good. I didn't find the Mexican hot chocolate too impressive, even though I loved the cinnamon stick that came with it. Maybe I just don't like Mexican hot chocolate, but it seemed like packaged hot chocolate with water.Since it was a Sunday morning, it was pretty crowded, but the line did move quickly. The service was okay, even if it wasn't friendly. They were prompt about fixing small mistakes and getting drinks quickly to our table. Definitely want to come back to try their sweet crepes.

Get up the next day and do it all over again.The surf instruction is top-notch.  The beach: walking distance, and oh-so-beautiful.  The accomodations: spacious bungalows, with that mosquito netting over the beds that reminds you that you really are in Central America.  The food: fresh and plentiful - lots of fruit.  The grounds: nice pool with a bar right next to it (serving the best pina coladas ever), plenty of space to hang out and relax, and iguanas running about.   I can't wait to go back!

Don't ask me why but I don't think that an expensive purse paired with expensive sweatpants looks any better than a cheap purse paired with cheap sweats.The Papery has a lot of really cute, unique paper products but you'll have to give up a lot of your own green paper to get it.  They have gorgeous wrapping paper, cards for any occasion, little gifts like tea, plates, and candles and they also do invites [wedding, baby shower, etc.]  I overheard some customers ordering wedding invitations at $6.50 per invite.  YIKES.  If I carried a Coach bag I would have filled it with notepads, stickers, and fancy pens, but since I don't I picked up a few things off the Christmas table for 50%.  I am so 2006.

They arbitrarily ban certain products if they contain ingredients they don't like, i.e. Lundberg makes some scrumptious apple and cinnamon and caramel rice cakes that you can get at other stores. The Co-op won't carry them because they contain "sugar". The last time I looked, there were a lot of other products on their shelves that contain sugar. They wouldn't carry corn tortillas because they contain lime, which is traditional and necessary to process the corn. They won't carry the Ben & Jerry  Heath Bar Crunch. Food Nazis.They really screwed up with opening their Elk Grove location--sure there's lots of growth out there, but they should have opened another location in a more established area, like Fair Oaks, or Carmichael where there are more people into organic and natural foods. They were afraid of Whole Foods already being out there, but that just shows how much smarter Whole Foods is about demographics. Now us long-time members get to pay for their blunder. I also think they spend way too much money on printing and graphics in the stores.But they do provide a good product, and though they're not cheap, they're not as expensive as Whole Paycheck. The bulk section is pretty comprehensive and has some good values.But the best deal they have has got to be their buffet. We go to lunch there once a week, and I can't think of a place that has a better salad bar, and healthier food. They usually have some kind of chicken dish,  and rice and beans, and a couple of tofu dishes. I usually pile up my plate and always get out of there for about 7 bucks. Plus it's quick. They also have some good deals on wine from Chile and Argentina--for about 4 or 5 bucks a bottle.I have to admit, I'd love to see a Whole Foods in midtown. I've been out to the Arden store a few times, and it's pretty amazing--not cheap, but amazing. The more choice, the better, and I honestly don't think if there was one that close to the Co-op, it would hurt them. They would have to become more competitive, and in the end I think it would only make them stronger.

Fortunately, we live just down the street from the Sacramento Animal Hospital. Their staff couldn't be friendlier or more helpful (they didn't even blink an eye after my um-teenth million question). I was especially impressed by the super cool, casual, and relaxed atmosphere. I felt like I was in Santa Cruz again. Sweet! The doctors are equally kind, patient, and understanding - when I asked them, yet again, are you sure I can do this, but what if I do that? No problem, they were clearly there to help and wanted you to know it.  They get SIX stars!

<review# 1181,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/26/2007,7/25/2007,15,54,3,2,4>If you wanna eat an Ostrich, you can do it here! Redrum burger used to go by the name Murder Burger but due to copyright laws, it seems they had to change it to Redrum Burger. Whatever the reason, this place rocks.......kinda.So here's the pros. Kick ass ostrich burger. Enormous onion rings, decent fries, and jalapeno poppers. You really have to screw up royally with the deep fried items. The shakes were thick and sweet. Nice selection too. Mmm mmm good.The cons, well the ostrich meat was kinda flaky in texture. I've never actually killed an ostrich and cooked one so I have no other reference to compare it with but it tastes great. A bit pricey too. Better bring in some extra cash for your sides because you'll spend at least $12+ for yourself. The place was also filthy as fu&#. Sticky floors, unmopped dining areas, greasy tables & counters...I don't even know why I still eat here?! And the service fits the description of all the bad burger joint stereotypes. Its as if the employees don't care. How does this place survive?Since I had great memories here in the past, I'm gonna give this place a 3 in hopes that they better themselves. They had amazing potential for an independent burger joint but with their current state, they will continue to decline to the point of shutdown. Good luck Redrum Burger.

<review# 1184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2007,7/21/2007,87,115,2,10,4>Week 2-1/2: In search of the perfect bowl of Pho.New Paris brought back a lot of what I remember about the great bowls of Pho I consumed in the 90's. There used to be a great Vietnamese restaurant (I don't remember the name) next to what is now a Big Lots-next to K-Mart on Stockton Blvd.) It was wonderful and I particularly remember a killer dinner there with my ex (she's still my business partner), Peg Tomlinson, and Elaine Corn--big time foodies in Sac when most of you Yelpers were still in your nappies. We all agreed it was the best. I never checked it out on the weekends, but judging from the dance floor and big PA system, it must have really been hoppin' on the weekends, too.Anyway, the owner was very proud of his place and the fact that the kitchen pumped out solid, tasty food. I mention it because New Paris or Vinnie's or whatever it's called has the same vibe--big PA in the corner and solid food. Vinnie seems to be a pretty cool dude, too. I dragged my friend Rodney of the Troublemakers there on Saturday and without going into a lot of detail with him about my quest (he couldn't care less), we both ordered small bowls of their Pho (I went for my standard Pho Tai Bo Vien (rare eye of round and spicy meat balls-Rodney went for just the meat balls). Rodney is not a foodie--he survives day to day on cereal and coffee. He had never had Pho and loved it! Even though the teenaged server complimented me on my pronunciation, I was too intimidated to ask if the stock was housemade or the granulated stuff. The color suggested fresh, but at this point, unless it's way too salty of I get the MSG jitters, I don't really care. It was the best so far. Plus they get extra points for having all the classic acoutrements, which include the elusive sawgrass herb and toasted chile oil.I came back today for lunch with my partner (yeah, the ex...) who is a a Bun fiend. She ordered the grilled pork and shrimp Bun and was blown away, too and she is one tough customer. They added some of those pickled vegetables you usually find in Vietnamese sandwiches (Banh mi) and it added an extra dimension to the dish. The grilled shrimp were the best I've had--good quality shrimp marinated and grilled to perfection--not overdone!I feel like my quest is narrowing down, but there are so many new places in the shopping centers that are popping up all over the area, that I hope I get a chance to try them all before getting burnt out on Pho!I will withhold a 5 star rating for New Paris until I've tried all possible contenders, but so far, this is the best.UPDATE: New Paris gets 5 stars because their Bun is the best we've had. Their Pho is great, but still 2nd behind Saigon. Overall it's a split.
<review# 1185,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2007,7/20/2007,44,281,,7,5>Dec 07- I have been back several times and experienced no more issues; they seem to have it all ironed out. I even got to try a tonkotsu ramen they were offering as a special. I haven't been lately because thanks to a Sac Bee article, the wait is too long. Otherwise you would see me in there every night!8/10- - I went back and was disappointed - the broth was too cold and there was barely enough to cover the bottom 1/2 of the boiled egg. They are now offering "sets" where you can add a meat over rice dish to your ramen for $2.50 more. They told us they plan to have beer available within a week or 2.Mmmm...love good ramen. I like it way better than Edokko- I thought the noodles were much better-great consistency. Funny how taste buds are so different; the last reviewer thought his ramen was too salty; I would have liked more salt in mine (shoyu). It was $6 for the small bowl- chock full of noodles, plus green onions, spinach, seaweed, fish cake, and pork slice. I paid $1 extra for them to add a boiled egg. The ramen is good quality, but I still think the price is too high, especially since it is $1 for extras. The place is TINY. When word gets out, and weather gets colder, I imagine there could be quite a wait for a table. This is similar to ramen I had in Japan, and a welcome addition to the Sacto dining scene.  One thing I wish they had though: tonkotsu (pig bone) broth ramen.FYI- CASH ONLY - Located near the Curtis Park crepeville.

We stopped by for a pitcher of Budweiser and some burger madness on a Saturday night. The curly fries get my salty salute. Fanny Ann's usually has some good tunes playing in the background along with the TV's showing the ballgame. There are three floors to drink, eat, and play games. There's kitsch EVERYWHERE. Hey Layyydeees...If you're wearing a dress or skirt you may want to be aware of that when you use the creaky old stairs. The stairs are a bit exhibitionistic AND trecherous. Last night a woman in a dress was going downstairs when she took a tumble and the entire bar got to see that she was a no underwear type of gal. I guess it was her "Britney Moment". There are lots of video games and pinball machines if you're in a arcade gaming mood. Excellent pinball!  The confusion at the bathrooms can be entertaining to witness. One says "men" the other " women"  with a finger pointing at the other bathroom.  Patrons get a bit confused and use the bathroom of the wrong gender. That's when the wacky begins! Fanny Ann's is a fun place to check out if you're ever in Old Sacramento.

Take it from a full-blooded Israeli, this little shack makes the most amazing schwarma on the face of the earth. Get it with spicy Tehina (sesame) sauce and it will be love at first bite. The tender meat just melts in your mouth and provides a sharp contrast to the crunch of the fresh crisp cucumber and lettuce, while the tomato slices add a hint of sweetness. The flavors are as balanced as a samurai's bushido blade and just as sharp. If you are ever within a few hours drive of Davis, I highly recommend a detour through this quaint little town for a taste of true ambrosia.P.S. This place doesn't take cards so bring cash.

<review# 1190,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2007,4/22/2007,65,28,3,8,5>In any undertaking, there are two things that need to be considered: the goodness of the plan and the facility of the execution.  This is a 5 star idea and a 3 star execution. I love the idea of knowing what is going on inside the grid.  People consistently complain that there is "nothing to do" in Sacramento--indeed, a recent discussion thread bears witness to this complaint in the most immediate way.  So, let's give credit where credit is due.  MM does a rather good job disseminating this information.  It has its collective ear to the ground and, unlike SNR or other local periodicals, does considerably more than repeat what you've already heard elsewhere.  I inevitably learn something--and something interesting--about Sac every time I read MM, and you can't say that about very many freebies.On to the facility of the execution... MM is in its infancy, so some bumps in the road are expected.  The initial issues were loaded with copy editing snafus, and one found grammatical errors of all stripes (misplaced apostrophes, misused pronouns, misspelled words).  Recent issues are, however, much improved in this regard.  I still find that the writing still lacks the verve and edginess that the substance of the magazine begs for, but the gap here is closing, too. Form has not quite caught up with content, at least not yet, but every issue is better than the last.  I'm very pleased to see all these improvements--careless writing is evidence of careless thinking, and MM has done a nice job tightening up both.I continue to be mildly disappointed with the reviews and editorial content, but find these recently improved as well.  MM does a very good job telling us going on, but could, I think, do a better job telling us why we should care.   There seems to be an unwillingness to take the sledgehammer to anyone, and there are places that richly deserve a harsh treatment.  The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, but it is hard to know exactly why that is.  Is it because the reviewers only review good things, because they are afraid to criticize neighboring businesses, or because they are unable to distinguish good from bad?  In short, I don't know.  I hope, however, that MM joins to its decidedly self-congratulatory air the discernment and critical sniffishness that would justify it.  I am a long way from thinking that a good critic hates everything, but he has to hate something, and to explain himself in an ingratiating way.  All I want to see is more critical animus, expressed a bit more felicitously.

I would have headed to Peshawar and tried the kabob/grilled meat they are known for and I would have hit the largest outdoor market in the world.  Now, I will settle for researching Pakistani food and going back to Mehran.

Sure, there are lots of other items on the menu which boasts both Vietnamese and Chinese dishes.   However, the pho was what I was after.   It was a cold rainy afternoon on Sunday, and the prospect of a large bowl of soup with lots of noodles seemed to be just the thing to warm up. I had the beef  bowl with rare beef, flank steak, tripe, and beef tendon.  The warm, chewy rice noodles came in plentiful quantities with a delicious soup base. You have to select a bowl size ranging from small to extra large.  I had a look around:  the extra-large was a huge mixing-bowl size.  Although I was pretty hungry, I opted for the medium size.   It was more than enough to satisfy my appetite.The portions are so generous!  The flavor was good.  The soup tasted freshly made.  I drank all that was in my bowl.  There was a lot, but it was so good, that I didn't want it to go to waste.The restaurant is fairly large and able to seat a good number of diners.  (It was pretty busy at 4 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon. ) There's a flat screen television inthe corner, and several fake coconut and date palm "trees" arranged around the room.  (Amusingly, the ~real~ tree was in the corner next to the tv.)After you finish your meal, you step up to the register counter and let the cashier know what it was you had.  They pluck your ticket out of the lineup and you then pay for your meal..It's possible to come in ravenously hungry and satisfy yourself with a large amount of tasty, healthy food for under $6...where else can you do that?Do be careful if you go after dark to eat.  The parking lot can be  a little dicey and requires that you keep alert to what is around.

Yes, they have ostrich.  And turkey.  And veggie version of the burger.  They also have chicken sandwiches, and I think I'll get one of those next time I can get my gut there.I dragged our intern Carlos with me because I wanted a witness.  He is currently having a nap in reception due to his purchase: the Wally Burger.  It's hot pastrami on top of a quarter pound of ground beef, AND HE ADDED SWISS.  I could barely watch him eat, it hurt just to see his mouth open to bite that sucker.  He was able to blurt "good sandwich" before passing out in the car.   Thank gawd they had diet sodas, I think that's the only thing that saved us from caloric overload.I just got a normal burger.  I figure if they screw up a basic burger, I'll never go back for something bigger.It was really good!  The bun was nice, it didn't fall apart and make a crumby mess.  They pickle/onion ratio was perfect.  It comes with onions, pickles, lettuce, tomato (except I hate them and held it), and mayo.  Cheese is optional, I got pepper jack.  I would probably hold the mayo next time.  The fries were perfect and shoestring style for those who don't like potato wedges.  I noted they also have seasoned waffle style fries as well.It's the consummate blue collar warehouse worker style eatery. They have beer, burgers, sandwiches, and breakfasts.  They have french dips, terriyaki rice bowls, chicken sandwiches, a salad bar that is full of huge jugs of mustard and ketchup squeeze bottles.  They have a large assortment of beverages in a case as well as fountain drinks.They have homemade macaroni and potato salad.  I bought a small container of potato salad, it was very garlicky and not too mayo-y.  It may have displaced the room I had to accomodate my burger.So it's a solid 4 for burg-i-tude.  The tables and floors were messy, but they were busy.  I would never take my boss there.  I still think Hamburger Mary's is slightly better, but this place is locally owned.They take debit.  They charge a .99 cents fee for use.  My total was 8.19 with the debit fee for burger/fries/potato salad and a soda.  Not bad.

After I called the sandwich shop, a very sweet gentleman told me that it was located between I and J.

We drove by Tan China Bistro a few days ago and they are finally open. Grand opening was earlier this week.Here's my experience:Service: The staff was very nice & friendly. They greeted us when we enter the restaurant and we got seated right away with our menu.  Our waitress bought us water and asked if we're ready to order. We weren't ready. Many Chinese restaurants we go to, the menu is NOT all in English with no Chinese. I would assume they would have the Chinese names under the English names. When placing our order, our waitress was unsure what we ordered, and was writing it down in Chinese on her notepad. To make sure we order the food correctly, my husband repeat what we wanted in Chinese.  (-1/2 star)Majority of the food on the menu is gear towards American people too. Since Channel 10 station is located across the street, I would assume they have more people coming through. While eating our dinner, only one person from the station stopped by for dinner.   There was nobody in the restaurant when we came here for dinner, only two couples. When we finish our order, we were given fortune cookies.Atmosphere: The restaurant is nice & clean. They have nice decorations on the walls and large tables for bigger groups. However, I would like more lighting when I'm eating my dinner. (-1/2 star) Food: We ordered BBQ Pork Fried Rice $6.25, Beef Chow Fun $6.75 & Onion Pork Chop $7.79. The portions are big, and we took home leftovers for lunch the following day. The BBQ Pork Fried Rice was delicious, but a little oily. The beef chow fun was perfect with lots of onions & bean sprouts. YUM! The Onion Pork Chop was a little salty for my taste. The pork chop was good, but the dish wasn't made the same compare to other Chinese restaurant I been to. (-1/2 star)Overall: The food was good, but we like to eat at more authentic Chinese restaurant. The menu is a little small for the authentic food. Maybe I'll come back in a month to give this restaurant another try, even though I have many other favorite Chinese restaurants. Many people would enjoy the food, depending on what kind of food they're enjoy eating.

The class is always taught by the same person, but the attendees are a flexible bunch. Classes range in size from 5 to 15 and consist of college-aged students, middle-aged officemates and even retirees. Yoga Seed is a donation-based studio (they'll tell you how much is a good amount based on which class you're taking). For my intro course, the recommended amount is $7-$15. I've paid as low as $5 before and as high as $20. I love the flexibility in pricing! I've always paid in cash, but they seem to accept Visa too.They can even give you your own mat/blocks/other necessary supplies. There is a water jug on-site, a bathroom, pretty art to look at on the walls and (love it in the summer) air conditioning!There are really no barriers to starting yoga with Yoga Seed. Parking, though street-only, is easy (and mostly free), the supplies are provided and you pay what you can. Choose whatever class sounds interesting on their website (theyogaseed.wordpress.com), show up and start feeling better in body and in mind. Dooo it!
<review# 1201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2011,6/28/2012,58,52,5,10,6>My favorite place to get manis and pedis! They have 3 diff packages for pedis and 2 for manis. I believe all packages come with parafin wax, some have hot stone massages and I see that they recently got a whole bunch of "crackle" colors. The staff is well trained and super friendly (although some give better massages than others but all polish jobs have been excellent). They have about 8 pedicure spa chairs, they're typically pretty well staffed, so even if everyone is busy, they would usually be able to let you soak your feet while you wait for someone to free up. Also because of the amounts of stations they have, it's a great place to do a girls' day out or other parties. They also offer customers complimentary sweet iced tea or water! A very wonderful experience at a great price. They have a bday list too where you can get a discount around your bday. The manager is super nice too and he's always helping out the staff and making sure the customers are ok.
<review# 1202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2011,6/27/2012,398,256,6,10,7>Okay, this place is amazing!!!!I'm a huge fan of thin New York style pizza. I love the fold and the crunch sound the crust makes. Of course, since I've never been to NYC I can only go by what is supposed to be NY style pizza as told to me by others (and by others I mean the Food Network). I love pizza!!!! And I LOVE the pies I get here. I scored a Groupon and was excited since it has been years since I was last here. We ordered a medium 1/2 Primavera 1/2 Da Bronx Bomber and a beer. Oohhhh that pizza and beer hit the spot!!!! I thought the cheese was perfectly melted. Not some ugly/scary slab on unidentifiable cheese product on top (glares at Little Caesars). But melted nicely, oh and my favorite, stringy. You know, you take a bite and the mozzarella doesn't want to leave the mother land? Yea.....LOVE that.Pizzas starts at around $18 for a small and go up from there. Yea, it's certainly pricer than your crappy ass pizza places (gives Little Caesars look of death), but is it worth it? You bet!!!!I am so looking forward to coming back. Unfortuantely for me I live in HeLL (Elk Grove) so it's going to be awhile before I can make it back here.
<review# 1203,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/9/2011,6/26/2012,390,173,3,14,14>There's something about dining at a table by the window that makes me all warm & fuzzy inside. At Shabu, there's ample opportunity to do just that. Plus, this cute little restaurant throws a hot pot in the middle of your table for extra coziness. And it does get warm in there once all the pots are going. There are two large screens televisions which had "Kung-Fu Panda" playing the night we were there. I'm not sure the place would be as inviting for lunch, but on a cold winter night the scene was completely charming.The selection of appetizers was disappointingly limited. We settled for edamame as the only other options were variations of salad. No gyoza or yakatori here.Moving on to the shabu-shabu, the dinner for two was a good value at $28 for two types of meat (choice of Kobe beef, pork, lamb or chicken), soba noodles, mushrooms and more cabbage than most people can hope to eat in one sitting. I like cabbage, but this was a major mound o' greenery. I've discovered that lamb is my favorite meat for the hot pot, with beef being a close second. Both were beautifully presented and meltingly tender. Also liked the thickness of the soba noodles. Little easier to eat and definitely more substantial.All raw vegies were crispy fresh and our miso broth was nicely seasoned. Servers were very friendly and efficient.
<review# 1204,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/5/2012,6/25/2012,433,220,17,15,16>Everything I loved about J's Cafe, I still love about Dad's on J. Everything I hated about J's I still hate about Dad's, which is that 8 times out of 10 I can never find a place to sit, but I would never hold one's uncontrollable popularity against them. So, moving on...It is really nice that they have their menu and specials posted in the window so you can decide what you want before getting in line. I also like that their menu is simple and to the point. I usually like to treat myself to the Monterey Burger which comes with bacon, avocado, some awesome sauce and all the other fixin's. It is slap-yo-mama good. The combo comes with a drink and steak-cut fries; none of these rinky-dink, crinkle cut Elementary school cafeteria fries for little girls, real fries. I have also enjoyed their Philly Cheesesteak sandwich on a couple occasions. It is great, but SO hot; you can easily burn your tongue if you're not careful. Then you'll have "cat tongue" for the rest of the day, we all know how that goes.What is super cool is they price their combo meals so that they come out to a rounded dollar amount after tax (most come out to $8). You see, these people know how to think. They come up with ways to get people in, fed, and on their way as quickly as possible.

I enjoyed the chana masala and butter chicken; spouse chowed down on chicken tikka masala and a lamb dish. We both opted for garlic naan. I also got an iced chai, knowing that I'd be headed for a food coma after eating and would need a pick-me-up. I was going to give this place 4 stars, but really- this doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. The food is good, the prices are fair, they even serve a number of Indian beers, and the woman who owns the place is right there behind the counter- sweetly greeting everyone as they come in and asked how our food was later on. As we enjoyed our meal, I watched her chat with a number of customers. This level of hospitality should be the standard of any business. You can tell she really takes pride in her work. We'll be back.

We have the whole state of California's fair in our city! ugh, take that. Must try foods:    deep fried peaches: i know, it sounds crazy. but it's like a churro with peaches inside of it. if you smile and ask nicely, they'll give you extra sugar hehe.    turkey leg: it's not as good as disneyland's, but it's big enough to feed two people!    deep fried snickers: the best of the deep fried confections; a whole snickers bar inside of the deep fried goodness? yez pleaze     those long stringed candies being sold in the vendor building:     get a REFILLABLE CUP! worth the money, and you get a souvenir!     - In previous years, I would say the corn is the #1 thing you should try. But then I learned how to cook (somewhat). And then I learned that corn is 6/$2.00 at Safeway. Don't do it !!!!Must try rides:      magnum - don't eat anything before riding this!     the spinning space ship one - don't look at your feet or attempt to look down while riding this, you will get the fattest head acheAtmosphere:    Great for first dates, couples, groups of friends... it's wonderful. I love going to the fair, because everyone is happy. No one seems stressed out (unless you're spending $$$ on games that you get gipped on). It's wonderful.Carnival game hints:     Don't play that stupid dart game!! They charge you per "level" which isn't exactly based on skill. You'll end up spending $50.00+ if you want anything bigger than a medium sized prize     If you're playing that shooting water/racing game, point your gun forward as far as you can so the water pressure is at its' maximum level, and keep steady!Some carnival hints:      Go at NIGHT! People are tired out by the summer sun, and you find more parking AND there's less babies and strollers. Two birds with one stone. It's an imperative that everyone experience the state fair. Unless you have a kid in a stroller. Now you're just a roadblock.
<review# 1208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2012,6/21/2012,372,323,8,11,9>Made a very gracious visit here a while back. It was for an small yelp gathering for happy hour and a little dinner afterwards. Their happy hour offerings are great. They kept it going a little bit longer for us to enjoy. They had a nice selection of: sticky teriyaki wings (which were really full of flavor and meaty)brushcetta that I couldn't get enough of, a bunch of chips and dips, veggies and etc.Their dinner menu is really something one of a kind. Fantastic portions that don't skimp on flavor. I feel like they're inventive and well planned, with great love and emotion. You will receive a meal described as hearty and generous. Expect to bring a to-go box home. We ordered the Prime Rib sandwich which was cooked perfectly medium rare and juicy as ever. It was extremely thick but still had a buttery texture to it which melted in my mouth. Next up was the Pot Roast (both not mine, shared with someone), extremely well executed. Tender and full of veggies and not missing a single flavor or ingredient. Creamy mashed potatoes, just the way it should be.I can't wait to come here again for both dinner and happy hour. I plan to indulge myself, take my time, enjoy it and take it all in, and repeat.
<review# 1209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2007,10/15/2007,207,336,4,12,13>I spent an entire summer completely poor by doing an internship here but what I got was worth much more than money.  St. John's is a shelter for women and children (males up to age 14 can stay here, females of any age).  Women and their children are allowed to stay up to two weeks or if the women take the classes offered by St. John's they are allowed to stay up to two months.  They take required classes on money management, respect, jobs, etc.  I worked in the daycare with children that were new born to age 16.  What I remember is this: cuuuuuuuute kids, I mean so cute, fieldtrips to the movies and the zoo, inside and outside games, sibling relationships, a 7 year old knowing what a hooker was, snack time, crying babies, learning numbers, the alphabet and animals, and this is what I remember most.  A 14 year old girl was living in the shelter when I started working there.  At first she hated me because "I took her job helping watch the children."  At the end of her two months, she told me that she loved me and that I was her favorite person that worked there.  It was amazing to see that I could have such an impact on someone in such a short period of time and I will always remember that for as long as I live.

It is not receiving 5 stars bc the wait can be way too long. Side note: I like that they pay their staff very well - above and beyond most fast food places!I don't have to tell you that In-N-Out burgers rock! My order is: Cheeseburger combo "animal style" (w/grilled onions) and a chocolate shake (rather than coke). For some reason I find myself putting an obscene amount of ketchup on these burgers - but my god it just TASTES so damn good!!!!! Also, I personally LOVE their fries - I am fully aware many don't but I DO!!!Now, I have explained before in previous reviews about my stomach/IBS/lactose issues BUT I make a rare exception here too for a chocolate shake - perfectly thick and requiring high suction - me like.(stop laughing sickos)

TONS of toppings to choose from which is dangerously delicious. Price...not bad at all (even if you have a ton of toppings and yogurt oozing over the edge of your cup). I think the total came out to less than $20 for 4  (huge ... and satisfying) cups of frozen goodness.

I may love my dog more than I love most people- but I am not about to get my dog a blueberry facial. If I can't afford a facial for myself- my dog sure as hell ain't getting one!!!That said, Wag Hotel is a great place to board you dog. I had to work out of town this weekend- and took my doggie to Wag Hotel for the first time. They are pretty reasonable- I paid $38 a night which includes 2 playgroups a day. Most boarders do not have any playgroups- so this was a huge plus. The other thing I loved about Wag Hotel is that they are open 24 hours so you can pick up and drop off whenever works best for you. I have had many a frustrating experience with dog boarders and their insane pick up and drop off rules- usually you have to drop off between 8-10 a.m. and pick up between 4 and 6 p.m. Which is so not  convenient. I got to take a tour of the facilities when I dropped off the pup, and they showed me everything from the "kitchen" to the different kennels (the dogs in the luxury suites get flat screen TVs with dog friendly TV...they were watching Lady & The Tramp when I toured.), they have a huge indoor play area with swimming pool and a "spa" for dogs and cats to be groomed and pampered.

I drove up to find an empty parking lot with no smoke rising from the smoker. But there was a nice guy outside who smiled as we walked up, and said "You here for some ribs? Come on in!" Heck yes I'm here for some ribs. It took a little while for us to get our food, but this guy was running the whole show. As far as the food goes, I don't think anything was fresh off the smoker, which fair enough since we arrived about 45 minutes before closing. The ribs were nice and very well-flavored, smoked on fruit wood. We also tried a special, Cornish hens, which, while also well-flavored, were a bit dry. The macaroni and cheese, potato salad, and red beans and rice were great. We had 2 bbq plates and our meal came to around $25 total. I look forward to coming back.

I do wish the original was slightly more tart, but oh well.Red Mango is located in the new section of the Galleria mall. I almost walked right by it at first. They built it up freakin' fast.They have three flavors now, Original, Green Tea, and POM. I just got a medium original with strawberries, chocochips, and graham cracker dust. And just as I did last time, I forgot to mix the graham cracker dust into the yogurt. If you don't, you'll probably inhale it and die. Medium + 3 toppings = $5.00And guess what? They have REAL FRUIT. Take the hint, Big Spoon who tries to make it a disgusting dessert instead of a healthy snack.I think it just opened this past weekend, and the guy behind the counter had a case of the nerves. Sorry bud, you can't let it show!

In addition, the facility is friendly to creativity. For example, say you want to make a huge plexiglass thing. They will cut the pieces of plexiglass to your exact specifications, and point you in the right direction for permanently gluing it all together.Um, one time I had this friend that wanted to make a unit to enclose her glass grinder so bits of glass wouldn't fly everywhere when she needed to edge pieces of glass for some other terribly urgent project. Tap Plastics actually helped her build a containing unit for the grinder to make it safe to grind glass in the kitchen. She was really happy with the service she received and the doors it opened by making her glass habit feasible in a one bedroom apartment.Let's just say Tap Plastics, at least this one on Auburn, isn't at all close-minded about trying to do something new with plastic. I love this place. But it's a little pricey for my budget. But nothing I've purchased ever broke from poor workmanship. Good times... with plastic.

If Ross caters to middle class folks on a budget, dd's caters to my peeps who really know about the struggle of making ends meet but wanting you and your home to look good while you do it. To be quite honest, dd's is kind of awesome. Super cheap - almost thrift store cheap, except everything is new. I found a comforter set for $29.99 that I absolutely LOVE - and I am 1,000 thread count Egyptian Cotton picky! It stands out as a comforter that will be around in 10 years to use for floor pallets (you know, when you make a big bed on the floor to put the kids on and watch movies). For $100 or less, I think you could almost decorate an entire apartment at dd's!I also noted that the only brand name clothes you can find that they carry are Apple Bottoms, Baby Phat, Fat Albert and South Pole. All the rest of the clothes are random cheap brands. Pretty ghetto, but I found a gorgeous purple Baby Phat bathing suit there for only $9.99!
<review# 1222,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/18/2008,1/4/2009,9,27,2,4,2>I went to Capitol Dawg a couple of weeks ago with a friend for lunch. I will agree with other posters about the substantial number of choices on the menu. It is definitely worth your while to go with a couple of extra minutes on hand to read the menu. Eventually, I decided on the Old Sac Dog meal which included the hot dog, fries and a drink. When our food arrived, my friend and I were underwhelmed with the size of our dogs. We were immediately both struck with the idea to buy another dog, thus turning our $7 per dollar lunch into a $10 per affair. This puts Capitol Dawg into a whole different category for me, going from cheap eats to every so often. Keeping with the food, we both got our dogs grilled and they still tasted boiled. They really did not seem to have any of that smoky, greasy warmth that a grill (even a flat one) will impart. On the service side they were great. Our cashier/server was quick to smile, offer any help deciphering the menu and made sure we didn't need anything when she brought our order. That's pretty good service for an establishment that does not really bill itself as a sit down place. So, 2.5 stars for the food with a bump up for good service.

<review# 1225,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2008,12/31/2008,11,15,1,12,5>The Citizen opened on Sunday, so I organized a group of friends to check it out for Happy Hour on Tuesday. I would have given this place a 3-star rating just based on this experience, but I bumped it up to 4 stars in consideration of it's newness (we were the first to order the bar-food and the Grange restaurant had not yet opened), and also for their excellent customer service.I set up a private tour for about a dozen of us. The person I coordinated it with was very gracious and professional... even when the fire alarm went off and they had to shuffle all of the hotel guests outside to wait in the freezing December night in Cesar Chavez Park. Regardless, we really enjoyed ourselves. The bar staff was friendly, and the "Blue Donkey" drink was really popular. We loved the historic preservation (original marble, railings, brick, etc), and the cute nods to the unique political life of Sacramento. The bar is named "Scandal" and has posh red and black decor, old legal books, and original prints of political cartoons. The meeting rooms are named things like "Yea" and "Nay" and "Executive Boardroom." The bartenders even tell us that they will show the City Council meetings on Tuesday nights, which thrilled (in a funny way) those of us who work in local government. I look forward to going to the Grange soon, which will feature a rotating menu of local food and wine. Hopefully it's better than the uninspired, overpriced bar food we had. I really hope locals check this place out. It has a great view of the Capitol, City Hall, Cesar Chavez Park, The Cosmopolitan, and the other great buildings in downtown.
<review# 1226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2008,12/30/2008,86,113,13,4,6>Are you serious? Somewhere that's open 24 hours in Sacramento that's not Lyons or Del Taco? Someone call the city so they can shut this down immediately. All kidding aside, you won't get the best food of your life here, but really, who cares. If come here and then bitch about how your tacos weren't completely "authentic" then you are the lamest person to ever exist. Places like this only serve to ladle up something cheap and greasy when the bars let out. Hipsters need fuel to pedal their fixies back to their respective corners of the grid and suburbanites need a place to gather and fight once those places around Harlow's close up. So yes, come here drunk, order up a chicken burrito and then get into a fight with a dude with hella gel in his hair because he was staring at you. It's only a matter of time before City Hall bans this place for being too awesome.
<review# 1227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2008,12/29/2008,451,541,1,11,6>I really didn't read the reviews of this place; however, I wanted to come here for some honey. When I went it, it was really interesting to see so many things here. Fresh honey, Containers, and Bee Supplies. Moreover, the information about honey is all over the place. I didn't know all the interesting stuff about honey. WHen I was there, there was a couple with like 20+ containers for a refill of honey. I looked around but I didn't know how stuff worked so I asked the clerk. She was very very nice in explaining everything. My co-workers were even interested. I was so happy with this place. I ended up buying some local Sacramento honey and was off in a jiffy. Recommended for everyone. Pros: Service, items, Honey, Cool Building ColorsCons: Can't think of any.

<review# 1229,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2012,11/1/2012,113,14,15,12,12>All this time I've been living next to this gem and finally got my lazy ass up to check it out. Driving by it every day, the place never really shined from the outside... What? I'm a girl, I like shiny things. Can ya blame me? Well anyway, one fine day, a relative of mine had invited me for lunch here, and so, I decided to go. Let's just say that's probably the best decision I've made in the month of April. I'm all about #16: Turkey (I substitute for Pastrami), bomb sauce, avocado, cream cheese. HELL to the YES. That bomb sauce got me feenin' YO! They even have a punch card. For every 15 sandwiches (I believe it was 15) you get one on the house. Did you read that? I said on the HIZOUSE! That's pretty rad, I'd say. By the way, the owner is super nice and friendly, and he cares about his customers, its not that hard to tell when he walks around the counter and asks how your food is. Hold up! Did I mention Tri-Tip on Tuesdays and Thursdays? YUP! Guess what? The BBQ T-Tip is done outside in the parking lot, on a real fire BBQ grill. Hell yeaaa. Pretty amazing right?! Melts in yo mouth, not in yo hands!  Must try before you die! Okay, I need to stop writing this review right now, before I start eating my hands. No, seriously.
<review# 1230,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2012,10/31/2012,1134,510,9,8,9>Snagged a couple seats at the very crowded bar on a Thursday after work.  The friendly bartender informed us right off the bat that we had 6 minutes of happy hour pricing left.  So we sampled the poke wraps, the Greek pizza, the giant pretzel (not on HH menu), the bruschetta, and an OMG for dessert (not on HH menu).  Big beers are $1 off during HH, same for wine (I think), and martini cocktails are $7 (I think).poke wraps-came out in 5 minutes, served on lettuce cups, tasted fresh, mixed with mango chunks, and nicely flavored with sesame oil.  greek pizza- just average.  was expecting something better coming out of the old CPK ovenbruschetta- was told before I took a bite that they are changing the bread to make it crunchier, more toasted.  i hope they do that soon.  i've never had bruschetta on a soft piece of toast.  wouldn't order again until they harden that bread!giant pretzel- star on the menu.  perfect texture, lightly salted, buttery, warm.  served with little cups of pimento cheese and a spicy mustard dipping sauce.  i wish they offered more choices of dips, and ask for more of the cheese sauce when you first order.  OMG-recommended by owner.  when i saw other patrons who ordered it, i was very intrigued.  i thought it was some kind of chicken pot pie!  it's a huge ball of really good vanilla ice cream, wrapped in carrot cake, and then deep fried, served on top of some thick whipped cream.  OMG is right!Service was pretty good, although after our poke wraps came out in lightning speed, we had to wait awhile for the rest to come out.  Plus there was a mix up in our order, so I think they forgot about the giant pretzel.  Of course that was the one thing we were anticipating the most.  Good thing the bartender whipped me up a delicious lemon drop while I waited for the most perfect pretzel. Oh...I believe this is the new hot spot for the cougars to dine before heading upstairs to the Mix.  I'm just sayin'.
<review# 1231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/29/2012,10/30/2012,406,278,8,12,8>When I learned that Rancho had a casino restaurant, I was hesitant to give it a try because, hey, it's Rancho! However, I'm so happy I was proven wrong!The "casino" looks like a nice lodge from the outside. It's surprisingly well kept for an establishment of Rancho. When you walk through the large doors, you're greeted by a very nice lobby with high ceilings. To the right is the "casino," a small area that consists of about 5 tables total. To thel left is the bar/restaurant. The food here is EXCELLENT! I was so surprised when I took my first bite of their French Dip sandwich. The prime rib is so tender and seasoned perfectly. The bread is so fresh and delicious. And the au jus.... omg... a heavenly combination with the sandwich. The prices are very reasonable, considering I would be paying about the same for a mediocre sandwich anywhere else. I've tried their burgers as well and the one with the horseradish is my favorite. Again, very delicious. Service is usually very good, with the exception of my first time there when I had a very slow waitress. I deducted one star mainly because on fight days and game days, the restaurant is so packed that the receptionist simply turns people away. I found out the hard way when I was craving their French Dip and didn't realize it was a fight day. Overall, I would HIGHLY recommend you stop by if you're in the area and are looking for a place to eat.
<review# 1232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2012,10/29/2012,210,713,6,13,9>One of the reasons why I wanted to try this place is because I saw Baked Alaska on the dessert menu. I've never had it before and was intrigued by it. Baked Alaska - French vanilla atop a white sponge cake and surrounded by Italian meringue baked and served with white peach purée. A friend thought it was a pile of mashed potatoes. Haha  The dessert was bigger than I expected and can be shared.  I've never been a big fan of meringue but I liked the ice cream and cake layers. Most desserts were $4. Reasonably priced, unlike some other restaurants where desserts are almost as much as an entrée. Another reason to come here is for their bar appetizers ($3-$4).I tried a few of the bar appetizers that my friends ordered:-Buffalo Wings (half dozen)- standard-Crab Stuffed Jalapeños (3 pieces)- Claw meat and cream cheese stuffed jalapeños, deep fried and served with a sweet red pepper relish. Spicy! It left a burning sensation in my mouth.-Buffalo Mac & Cheese- Penne pasta tossed in a spicy buffalo cheese sauce topped with chopped apple wood smoked bacon and chives. I wished I ordered this for myself, because one bite was not enough!Buy one get one free bar appetizer when you check in!
<review# 1233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2012,10/28/2012,702,960,14,20,19>I'm a big fan of Dos. Introduced to this place during college days, I'm so glad they have branched out from Davis! My favorite is their tostada with anasazi beans. And their salsa bar -- wow. Talk about liquid manna. I could drink that stuff up like gazpacho on a hot Spanish afternoon. One gripe is their soft drink machine. One machine, one spout - many combinations. So many in fact, that it creates a backlog of thirsty patrons who wait to get their chance to push a button to create the ultimate soft drink. Problem is that if you want plain ol' water, you also have to wait your turn in the high fructose corn syrup beverage line. Although it's right off busy Folsom Blvd, their patio area is pleasant enough. You can ride your bike this way from the bike trail if you know which exit to take. It's also conveniently located by the Folsom Outlets if you need to refuel during a shopping foray.
<review# 1234,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/5/2012,10/27/2012,329,223,12,15,13>My mom likes buffets... she's a buffet junkie.  Casino buffets are her favorite. So when she discovered the Miwoks have a casino near her home she wanted to check it out. She, my son and I met my stepdad for lunch. The casino is pretty spiffy.  I am used to the one owned by the Yuroks up in Crescent City which is kind of woodsy/lodge feeling. The Red Hawk casino was more like a Nevada casino... sort of *bling bling* and mountain views. The first thing that hit me was the cigarette smoke. Man! It was gross. I think that is the only real negative mark against Red Hawk. I mean, smoking and gambling go hand in hand, I get that, but this is California and most of us don't smoke. Most of the people I saw weren't smoking, so I don't even know where it was all coming from. Improving the ventilation system would be a really good idea.  The buffet had a pretty wide selection. I'm not the buffet junkie my mom is, but I will give them props for the mashed potatoes. They were really good - not boxed potato flavor like other buffets. They had an Asian section, meat & potato section, Southern foods, burgers and hot dogs, pizza, salad, seafood, and lots of desserts (some people were buying whole cakes I think).  The servers were great and the other guests were really friendly. Also, the smoke smell wasn't overpowering like in the gambling area. It was a pretty nice lunch.There is an entire floor below the casino devoted to kids. This is where my son and I hung out while we waited for my mom to drop a few bucks in the slots. The children's floor is great! We had a lot of fun. They had some good air hockey tables, a little cafe for the kids to order meals, prizes, and an area (that looked amazingly fun) where they babysit your kids while you go and gamble or do whatever it is adults do.  I really liked the fact that there were armed guards at the entry way and it didn't smell all smokey inside.My mom has this weird casino luck. She always wins.  Always. She's doesn't really gamble that much, either. Every once in a blue moon she'll get this idea to plunk a few quarters in a machine and she'll win. Sometimes $40 sometimes $400.  I don't know how she does it.  So I wasn't surprised when she arrived in the kids area with extra cash in hand, ready to duke it out with my son in a game of  air hockey.We all had a good time and have decided to make it one of our rainy day family fun stops.

<review# 1236,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2012,10/25/2012,189,452,4,7,9>One of my favorite places.  I bought a few screw on spouts that you attach to empty bottles for olive oil. You can use it for anything...get creative.   I actually enjoy the imported goodies and ethnic pieces.  They sell some contemporary prints and bath products too.  If you love cooking, they also have  culinary tools and also beautiful dishes to choose from.  I like also their assortment of wine, tea and cocoa.I can stay here for hours too.  Just let your imagination run wild.  Plan a party or do a interior design make over.This particular World Market Store....the customer service was satisfactory.  They were nice.   I gave them a 5 because it is one of my favorite stores.
<review# 1237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2012,10/24/2012,105,243,5,14,7>When I eat Japanese food, I stick with sashimi, sushi, sake or beer.  When I order, I generally have chirashi and/or some nigiri sushi.  I steer clear of the CA, spicy tuna, rainbow and other american-style rolls that have crisscross patterns of different colored mayo, sweet-spicy, sesame, soy, sirracha, wasabi dressings, and topped with seaweed and different artifically colored tobiko.  That's faux sushi designed for the Nigori (unfiltered sweet) sake bombs/shooters happy hour crowd. Yeah, it's gotten so that you can get this junk-kind of sushi at Safeway and Belair.Yui Marlu can make you whatever roll you like but they also serve traditional Japanese dishes as well as nigiri sushi sets, chirashi sushi and sashimi.  When we visited last week, four of us had chirashi, udon, karaage, ika gesso, saba shiroyaki, and some nigiri sushi with a combination of uni, ikura and tobiko. It was the real deal (no faux sushi) and it tasted great.If you like to enjoy the traditional sushi bar experience (pre-CA Roll era), this is a good place to go.  Order your favorite nigiri sushi and savor it with some cold sake and good friends.This is the kind of place that when they say "Irrasshaimase" it sounds like it does when you go to a Japanese restaurant in Japan.  Check it out.
<review# 1238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2012,10/23/2012,213,318,5,12,8>Biba, Cheers to second chances! We started our dinner off the in the bar area for "happy hour", which is amazing on its own. $5 dollar drink specials, and apps for $7 (I believe). An older gentlemen playing piano in the background. It makes you feel classy, relaxed and at ease immediately upon entering.     The new updates they did in the dining area are fantastic, the walls are no longer lined with mirror and neon "art". It is very classic and southern looking, white & yellow wall with windows everywhere. Dinner: The BEST halibut I've ever had, and I'm a halibut nut. It was pricey, 30 dollar for one entrée for me, is expensive but it was my birthday (and I wasn't paying haha). The crust on the outside of the fish was crisp, but the fish was tender....not soggy, or overcooked. Served with a bed a veggies, which were lovely as well.Everyone else got the special lasagna only served on Thursday and Friday, this is one of their signature dishes so of course everyone said it was very well executed. Our server was named Gigi, I will be requesting her from now on...pleasant, funny and efficient. She kept us full and refreshed to whole night. Biba is back on top in my book!
<review# 1239,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/15/2010,8/4/2010,903,380,22,19,15>Petra Greek is about as tasty, quick, and affordable as any late night option in Midtown.  We can round up to 4 stars. The first things you notice walking in are piles of MEAT cooking on poles to the right setting off Pavlovian drooling responses to patrons walking in.  Mmmm.I went with the lambeef gyro.  (It's little known fact Greeks are the only people known to successfully get a lamb and cow to breed.)  A LOT of meat from the pole found it's way my plate and wiggled inside pita bread.  Big portion.  No need to go with the side of fries really.  It's pretty tasty as well.  Maybe not my fave lambeef gyro in town, but it'll do the job for sure. The side of hummus was great.   Just make sure to order extra pita.  You'll need that.  That's the only place I see stinginess.  Other things I can't spell were good.  Do the pepper and feta appetizer! I like the beer choices on tap as well.  Firestone DBA!  Olympia  for a buck fiddy as well.  Doesn't Olympia sound kinda Greek?  It's not, but if it were Greece would not be in such financial chaos.  Tios bring that stuff (and Natty Ice and Bud) by the by the truckload to Mexican family BBQs.  Umm yeah, back to Petra...cool place!!   I can totally see Jesse Katsopolis stopping by here for some sobering late night grub after his band, Jesse and The Rippers, knocks 'em dead at Old Ironsides.    Have mercy!
<review# 1240,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2010,8/3/2010,451,183,5,6,8>I usually only come here for the $2.00 Olympia beer on sunday funday. This place is always just a quick stop on my way to somewhere else. But last time, was differant. I ordered the beignets. They came out warm and fresh, with a jalepeno jelly type thing. This got me thinking about eating here. Maybe I should try it.     Fast forward to a month later. I came here tonight with a few friends. We came to see live jazz, but alas! there was none. It was kind of a bummer, considering the decor. My friends were just finishing up their "mushroom toast"  appetizer. It was sauted mushrooms over melted motzerella on toast. It came with a little tuft of carrots and celery(?) marinated in vinegar. I tried some. It was all sooo good together!! But lacking salt, just a note.     The entrees that came to the table were:     Burger and fries      Steak salad with croutons     Grilled hearts of romaine saled with grilled prawnsI had to try my friends grilled salad, as I do love grilled lettuces and leaves. It was AWESOME!!! The rest of the food looked and smelled good, but I didn't taste it. I have no doubt that it was just as tasty as it appeared.      I ordered dessert, to share with my friend. Though they only have three desserts, they all sounded good. An Oreo cheesecake, warm pecan pie with ice cream, and a peanut butter mousse with warm chocolate brownie. "I want that!" I exclaimed the second I saw the menu. OH MY PEANUT BUTTER GOODNESS!!! That was sooo good! The brownie was all warm and soft and there was smear of p.b on the plate as well as peanut toffee sprinkled on the plate. It was supposed to come woth mousee, but the 'mousse" seemed more like soft ice cream.      They also had a fume blanc on the menu that was tasty. I had that with dessert. It's rare to see that wine on menus, so it made me very happy.
<review# 1241,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/6/2010,8/2/2010,119,183,4,5,8>Yum yum.  Get in my belly!  If you can't tell...I looovvveee sushi!Went here for my best friend's birthday dinner.  Cute place, located right in the heart of midtown.  We started off with the seared albacore tuna and it was delicious!  It was served with three sauces...one was this bbq type of sauce, another was an aioli type of sauce, and the third was this heavenly pineapple type of sauce.  The third was something I have never had before at any other restaurant...this sauce was definitely my favorite.  I wish I remembered the names of our sushi better, but the only thing I can remember is California Rolls and Caterpillars.  Regardless, the sushi was yummy!  We had also ordered lobster tempura which was served with the same spicy aioli which was served with the albacore.  Mmmm...lobster tempura...sooo yummy!  For dessert we had ordered the fried tempura cheesecake.  Hee hee hee, this was yummy!  If you order this...expect to share it...very generous portions.  Service was fantastic.  Our waitress this night was the same waitress who had assisted me the last time I was at Red Lotus w/a group of friends.  I for the life of me cannot remember her name...but she was absolutely wonderful!  I'm sorry I cannot remember your name, lovely waitress.  Hope to go back again real soon!
<review# 1242,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/17/2010,8/1/2010,92,271,7,6,8>What not to do at Rubicon Brewing Company: 1. Do not assume that trying 7 different types of Ale is a good idea.2. Do not assume you will be welcomed if entering the wrong bathroom3. Do not let your sober friend decorate the floor with your food    So it was fun visiting the Rubicon. I feel like I have been here before, but this was the first time I've started drinking before 7pm so I actually have memories of tonight's events. I was told by many different people what their ale of choice was from here, and since I arrived early, I thought it would be best to give them all a try!  ...bad, bad, bad idea.      Why not take advantage of Tuesday night's $2 Pints. Being I couldn't decide, I wanted to try everything on the list while I was still coherent enough to read the list. I sat at the bar for a good 30 minutes before the war party arrived, but alas I was already drunk by the time they came.     Food! Yes, food. We had food. Chips and guacamole accompanied by the Rub-i-Q*. The guacamole was pleasant. It looked like guacamole, tasted like guacamole, and it didn't run off the chips like green slime compared to those at Adalbertaco's aka wanna be Adalberto's aka Mexican place with Hawaiian decor.       The Rub-iQ*, from what I had of it, was OK. The bacon and sauce of the burger was tasteful, the bread was hearty, but the meat was a bit dry. I may not be a pro when it comes to shoving a large piece of meat in my mouth, but even I know how unpleasant a dry piece of meat can be. A large piece of mouthwatering meat may sound appealing to some, but trying to inhale such a dry delicacy was just not going to cut it.     The fries. Looked fresh and delicious. I think Katie B and Eduardo C could be a better person to tell you how the fries tasted. Eduardo decided that decorating the floor, Matrix style, would have been far more entertaining than actually eating it. I must applaud Eduardo in his quick reflexes and ability to create an abstract masterpiece. Piling the fries up with napkins, ice, and straw covers on a tiny plate was the resulting piece of art there after that made even our server look at us in disbelief. I think she was just jealous she could not do better.    So how is Rubix cube Brewing Company? It's a fun, lively, and social bar filled with locals who like beer, spandex, and friendly staff.
<review# 1243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2010,7/31/2010,1134,510,9,16,9>This is the only restaurant that I've ever felt compelled to write to the Food Network as a recommendation for "Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives".  So if you've read any of my other reviews on burger joints, ignore them and pay close attention to this one.  GATSBY'S has THE BEST BURGER.  Jared, co-owner and chef exrodinaire, is da bomb diggidy!  He was great to converse with (my boyfriend was "all up in his grill" with compliments) while he put together the most juiciest, freshest, delicious, gourmet burger, right in front of us. The fries, chips, salad dressings, mayo, and pickles are all homemade.  You can tell, and taste.  I almost wanted to reach across the teppanyaki grill they use and slap Jared for making everything so flavorful and mouth-watering.  MMMMMMMMM! The burgers are 1/2 lb. of ground choice chuck, cooked to your liking.  I had the "cauliflower almandine burger", well done, with BBQ chips.  The patty was cooked well done but stayed thick and completely juicy.  It's served with an almond mayo, which converted my mayo-hater boyfriend, into, well, a Gatsby's almond mayo-lover.  The chips had so much flavor without being salty.  We also tried the ranch dressing, which I loved because you could distinguish the fresh dill and other herbs in it.Service was excellent.  Friendly, attentive, accommodating, and surprisingly fast.  "Fast" in the sense that you won't be waiting 45 minutes to an hour for a cheese skirted burger.  You will instead pay $8.95-9.95 for a freakin good gourmet burger made and served with a lot of love.  Please, Sacramentans, try GATSBY'S for yourselves and  keep them in business.  They deserve it.

(they just sounded good at the time - and they were.  Additionally, we had shrimp tempura.  Light, crispy and very flavorful.  One can tell how old the oil is by the flavor of the tempura batter, which is one reason I rarely order it.  Theirs is really good.We had Molly as our server.  I like to give kudos to great servers and she is one of them.  Actually, everyone who works there is very nice, but Molly took the time to get to know her guests, make suggestions and even brought us some chocolate mochi after dinner (an unexpected treat!)  Good people deserve recognition.I really don't know if I have a "favorite" sushi restaurant, only because sushi is just that... sushi.  I'm not big on the roll thing (although I do enjoy a few slices) I just like raw, sliced fish.  That's always what I get.  Overall, it tastes pretty much the same in any sushi restaurant.  I can't say this is my "favorite" place, but it's great, the atmosphere is great, the service is great, etc., etc.  What else can I say?  Thanks for reading!

Flaky is the word to describe Real Pie.I got on the mailing list recently through their web site and thought I'd hit pay dirt. Finally, I would be able to buy an elusive Real Pie. Alas, not so! It took several failed attempts to order one of Kira's pies before I finally acquired one strawberry-rhubarb concoction last week. (Her pies are so popular and few in number production-wise that they were selling out fast!) I picked my treasure up at Corti Brothers on Friday after work. Pies run about $19, but I love that Kira uses ingredients from local family farms. And did I mention they're flaky? That's the magic of all-butter! The filling was just right, not glooey at all. Top notch, and trust me - I know pie!Then, hooray!

I ignored the sweet, mellow, and completely silent black kitten my sister picked out.  No I don't want the boring one...I want the one with character, the one that's all chatty!  Never mind that he is the size of a small dog and that he has white long hair that will probably end up coating everything I own.  No no... give him to me!  I ignored all the signs, including the ones on the way home in my boyfriend (at the time)'s truck... in the rain... on the freeway, when that bundle of joy escaped his cardboard kitty suitcase and dove under my feet and tried to squeeze under the gas pedal.  I felt nothing but absolute love as his high pitched and nonstop meows assaulted my tender ears in the small truck cab, while I maneuvered in a panic to avoid squishing him underfoot and killing everyone on the freeway.And to this day I thank this SPCA for giving me such a gift... every time I want to shut him in a closet because he.

Up.  Every time I pull long white hairs out of my eyeballs and my corneas look suspiciously red like I hit the bong for breakfast.  Every time I walk away and he bites into my calf for not petting him enough.  And every time I wake up in the morning and the adorable little shit has stolen my side of the bed AND my pillow.  I love my beast.  He's a pain in my ass but he's got character.  He's got attitude but it makes him interesting.  He'll kick your cat's ass.  He is the best cuddlebug, you know, we spoon.  On a serious note, the folks at this SPCA were great.  They were friendly, helpful and it was relatively easy and quick to adopt a pet.  Granted, that might have been because they couldn't wait to get rid of my precious, but nawww..that couldn't be it.  Not my sweet boo!

What I do know is that for some reason, mid-week, my car goes on auto-pilot and heads straight for La Flor! It's crazy, i know!I tried this place after reading the reviews that the pupusas were the best. The owner, who is as sweet as can be, remembered me after one visit."Where is Esteban?" she says"Esteban is not with me today unfortunately...""Oh well, tell him to come back next time!"We tried all the different pupusas. My favorites: the chicken and cheese and the jalapeno pupusas. Spicy, succulent, and scrumptious! It is recommended to call ahead about 20 minutes and place your order so that it's ready when you come in.
<review# 1249,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2007,2/15/2007,65,28,,5,4>In my initial walks around my new neighborhood (I moved from GA in August 2004), two places caught my eye--Aioli and Zocalo.  The latter opened very soon after I moved in and, as you might imagine, it was a gaudy, baroque spectacle, replete with press coverage, hollering mariachis, and (of course) dozens of sweaty singles.  By contrast, there was very little activity around Aioli: its exterior was nice but unprepossessing, and its fare was appealing but a bit obscure.  Being (ahem) a man of the people---and new to the area---I went to have a mojito and gawk at the circus.  In consequence, I did not make it to Aioli for nearly 4 months.What the initial trip suggested, subsequent visits confirmed: this is a very good restaurant, but it's difficult to pin down exactly why.  The cuisine is clever but not innovative---assorted seafood tapa and paella are the main attractions---and the interior is pleasant but not memorable.  Why, then, do I like it so much?Aioli appeals to me because it has what I consider an authentic or natural sophistication---not the flashy affectedness of Masons or the continental pomp of Firehouse, but a genuine and quiet confidence in its concept and its cuisine.  It is the southern gentleman of Sacramento restaurants: it esteems those who recognize its virtue, and shows its respect for its patrons by refusing to gratify their baser appetites.  It is for the people without being of the people.  It bows but does not stoop.  It is courteous and obliging, but never saccharine or cloying.  It has a leisured and effortless grace that touches everything around it and everyone in it: the service is polite but not fawning, the food is interesting but not whimsical, and the decor is elegant but a bit shabby.  It has that vague thing that we somewhat graspingly call culture. I'll spare everyone specific recommendations, as essentially everything on the menu is good.  I will mention two things, though: 1) Aioli has a wonderful wine selection, both by the glass and by the bottle, and 2) after everything has been considered, Aioli is surprisingly affordable.  It can get away from you if you let it, but exercising a little restraint won't prevent you having an excellent meal here.

Sold.   Spicy Ramen for $1 each?!?!??! Take that too.....  Asahi, Hite, Sapporo, Kirin, Soju, a wall-full of Sake, that are fairly inexpensive?!??!?! Take all of that.....  Korean and Japanese soda and Miruku Kohi (milk and coffee) that are dirt cheap!?!?!?  Hell yeah!!!  We even found salted Mackrel (3 large fishes) for $4.....NICE!!!!!!!  Most of the food there I had never seen outside Japan.....and they actually had Ponzu sauce....which, the last time I got it, I had to go to San Fransisco.....so pretty frickin' nice they had it there.....Nice, friendly staff....they can speak both Korean and English....so kinda nice....We walked outta there with a trunkload of food, beer, and tea.......for a grand total of $64........pretty nice......Anyway.......I am gonna go curl up in front of the TV with my Salted Mackrel, Asahi, Japanese Peach Gummies, and Korean Soda, and probably watch "Love Actually" again........Either that or just get pissed and watch porn........I love not having any family obligations........ :)  Merry Xmas!

I have had my tongue pierced here, my belly button and ears numerous amount of times. Billy Wang did my first tattoo behind my left ear, it's a gray star with a yin & yang symbol in the center. I described it to him and he drew it on the spot and I left very satisfied. Mark, did my second tattoo of an angel girl with wings wrapped around her face. He redrew this tattoo different than what I envisioned however I was much happier with his version. Lastly, Francesco helped me pick out and redraw the two birds on my lower back. He was very patient and helped me get what I wanted on each hip.I have even brought my daughter here for her labret piercing. It came out a hair crooked but it's completely unnoticeable unless you are looking for it. There is just a few issues that I have with this place like the jewelry is small in selection and really not that great and it's a bit over priced in some regards. However, I know that I am going to get what I want and have never been dissatisfied here. :)
<review# 1253,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/7/2006,2/10/2007,1800,1375,7,5,3>Long time ago, when I was still caught up in the romantic and somewhat ethereal throes of dating someone I really liked, slathering myself with lotions, potions, and powders that whispered floral and fruity notes of attraction was part of the mammalian response system.I stopped by recently to peruse, mainly for a co-worker of mine, since it was her birthday the next day.  As I entered the store, my olfactory bits went into sensory overload, due to the many many scents wafting my way.  The store clerks were busy putting out stock, so I was left to my own devices.  I had almost forgotten how expensive the items here were:$9.50 for hand creme, lotions, and shower gels for around a 10oz container.  $14 for body butters (but that week, they had a special of buy one get one free) so I picked up the Japanese Cherry Blossom.  sweet smell of cherry blossoms, toned down with a musky note of perhaps sandalwood.  Non-greasy and leaves the skin soft.  They also had an extensive line of hair and aromatherapy items, where I noticed a gift set of the Jasmine Vanilla body wash with a natural loofah, wrapped in plastic, priced at $10.00.  The wash is normally priced at $13.00, so this was a deal.There were other items as well, targeting skincare.  I personally like the Molton Brown and C.O Bigelow brands, especially the Rose Body Silk, priced at $18.00.  The experience is wonderful.........lotion light and once dry, it seems to form a silky layer on the skin with a hint of rose.  I personally can't stand powerful scents that travel after the perpetrator for a mile, so the the lighter the smell, the more seductive:  it requests the person next to you to lean in a little closer.I recommend purchasing items that are bundled in a deal (say, buy two and get one free, or the holiday sales) because otherwise, it will add up quickly.  Nowadays, my choice of lotion is the Vaseline Renewal pump, 20.3 fl. oz. at Target for under $4.00.  My days of attracting the other sex as if on a hunt are long gone.
<review# 1254,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2006,2/9/2007,177,474,1,8,5>Wow, David's review was pretty much spot on!  and I'm irritated I'm not the first to review this teeny gem.  My first boyfriend was born and raised in Jamaica, so I have a semi-melancholic reaction to Caribbean cuisine.  And mangos.  ANYway....Is it bland?  Yes, for Jamaican food in the US.  Also, Gwen does not make coco bread (but the roll I ate was lovely and fluffy and hot, and served with real butter.)  Why do I mention the butter? Because it's a sit down restaurant with an all-you-can-eat buffet for lunch.  Bug her enough, she'll probably make coco bread.  I didn't understand her reasons why she doesn't bake it.  She made a face and said no one orders it and then said something about beef.  Weird.  But cute.It is VERY strange to be the only one eating in there, but apparently the lunch crowd comes in later.  I was there at 11:30 trying to beat the hordes who converge on Arden Fair Mall and ruin my day.  The room is VERY BIG, like a banquet hall, and the tables are widely spaced, so it feels very empty and not cozy.  Too bad they didn't take over the restaurant that Mums used to have!  There's a cute patio in back of the Freeport restauran that I feel would work really well with Gwen's personality (she was dressed completely in red today, and totally adorable.)  The Nicaraguan place that was there for awhile has failed, and I think rightfully so, but nothing good took its place...did it?BACK TO THE REVIEW:Chicken: falls off bones, lightly spiced jerk flavoring.  I had both curry and jerk, the flavors are delicate and subtle, like Jamaican home cooking should be: flavors are pervasive but not overpowering.  If you have ever eaten at Jamaica House, that place was flashy compared to this one, and the food was zingier.  This is more homestyle Jamaican.Beans and rice: bland, but those smokey caribbe flavors are there.Salad: IS NOT ICEBERG.  And that says a lot!  It was fresh, good lechuga and paired well with the fried plantains.I've had better fried plantains, but not in Sacto.  There is a definitive dearth of Caribbean cuisine in Sacto.So, for service and uniqueness, a 4 stars.  I'd like a bit more spice, a few more people enjoying the space with me, and less steel drum electronica xmas carols on the sound system.Please go here so they get enough people to make it worth their while to offer a bigger buffet for $7.50 and bake off some real coco bread and brew their own ginger beer (although, they do offer Old Jamaican, which is yummier than anything Jamaica house offered as homemade --and too strong!!!---.)Here's why Gwen's is not well known in my circles: I asked if they do live music shows, and they don't. They have a full bar and every Friday night is a DJ who spins hip hop/soca/reggae/roots/dancehall.  THAT'S where the rasta boys hang...I always wondered.  Tonight is Dee Jay Hype.  How cool is that?  Gwen and her hubby don't seem that "hip" but they are.  I likes.Samples from the Caribbean Lunch Menu (not the buffet, just the regular menu):Mixed Cury Style Chicken Parts (the parts I had were legs)9.95Jerk Chicken or Jerk Pork10.95Home style Red Pea Soup6.00Fried Fish w/ a light tomato sauce10.00They had "American food" as well, basically steaks etc.  The dinner menu was about 4 bucks more for the main entrees.Pretty neato!  Buffet is still the better deal though.
<review# 1255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/5/2006,2/8/2007,323,1092,2,10,6>I'm going to get a fat little taco belly and I don't care.  I live a block away from Angel's and after a conversation with my housemates last night regarding the lack of cheap ethnic food in the area, it was decided that I'd be our Angel's guinea pig.  So, like a dutiful little food critic I stopped by this afternoon.  I am poor so I opted for the $1.40 chicken taco.  I thought about waiting a half hour to order because these tacos go down to 90 cents at 3pm.  90 CENTS!  So cheap.  They only have outdoor seating, but it's charming as hell and covered so you might freeze in winter or get really hot during the summer, but you probably won't get wet if it's raining.  While waiting I noticed that they have a number of specials (both daily and based on time of day).  Everything is cheap regardless.I was expecting something skimpy for $1.40, but there was a surprisingly large helping of chicken, a fair amount of good spicy salsa, and a lime.  The chicken was tender and had good flavor.  I'm insanely picky about my tortillas and these had a perfect corn flavor and held together during my taco eating process.  The chips that came with the taco were extra crispy and slightly more salty than your average chip. Yum.After I finished eating I almost considered walking back over and ordering another.  I am shameful with tacos.  I love them, I love these ones in particular, and this could evolve into addiction.

<review# 1257,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/18/2007,2/6/2007,63,181,1,2,2>Settling into my first apartment in midtown, back in the early 90s, I put all that prep for my first week of classes aside and sat down with the city Yellow Pages which had newly arrived on my doorstep. Forget marking the locations of the nearest grocery store, bank, hospital or even, dare I say it, record store relative to my new digs in my new town. Instead I dog-eared the couple pages of bakery listings after highlighting a handful that I thought had the most potential. And then I hit the road, the golden reference book beside me, there on the passenger seat of my 1985 Toyota Tercel. It was 100+ degrees outside and there was no air conditioning in this vehicle but I would NOT be deterred from this very important business.I'll just pull all the stop signs out of the story here and cut to the chase: Freeport Bakery came out way ahead of all the others. I liked its cozy size and storefront. I liked the few little tables on the patio under the shade trees and that rickety screen door and the sound it made opening and closing, as it constantly did during certain hours and seasons.Loved the hum of the air conditioner working overtime to cool the joint on summer days, and catching glimpses of busy bakers in the back room, and the fresh-baked scent that spilled out onto the sidewalk, sometimes greeting you in that tiny adjacent parking lot.And I loved the cakes. I can't remember them by name now (except for the "Fruit Basket") but I tried every cake of every flavor I could reasonably expect to enjoy (chocolate-hazelnut - yes! Lemon poppyseed - No!) and loved them all. I thought the pastries were so-so, the cookies had a bit more flair but the cakes were done very well. Come laundry day, I would bypass all the laundromats in midtown and head over to this neighborhood so I could sit at this bakery and enjoy a slice of cake while my clothes would spin and tumble across the street.Also, once I locked my keys in my car in the laundromat parking lot and bakery co-owner Walter wrestled around with the lock using a hand- fashioned wire tool (a stainless steel prong of an egg beater, I believe) and some fresh whipped cream for some 15 minutes. He failed and I had to call a lock service (no AAA at the time!) but he was a nice man who, in addition, really knew (knows) his craft.

We've also had the Nachos, chili and patty melt. All meat-less! You've also gotta try the fresh corn bread with their home-made honey butter. We always take away some for morning toast.There is always a line here. Sometimes it may take up to 15 minutes, but worth the wait.

The accessories, I mean toppings are endless too!  They also have some sandwiches, sides and desserts to boot!It was during the "Summertime Cappy Hour".  My boyfriend and I came here to meet fellow Yelp friends and celebrating David O's birthday.  I ordered the Deftones Dawg with a turkey frank, chili, cheese and onions.  Very rich and tasty.   Because it was during Cappy Hour" (Tues - Fri. 4:00 - 8:00 pm), my dog was $2.22.  Then BF and I treated ourselves to $1.00 a scoop ice cream cones.  They had my favorite flavor of mint chocolate chip.  Delish!  Beer and wine are also $2.22 during Cappy Hour.  Needless to say, this place was pretty busy, yet still relaxing and a fun place to socialize.   Our group took over most of the patio area.  And I must say, I had a great time talking and joking the evening away.  I even made a new friend who enjoyed my company even though I was a little quiet and tired after work.  Now let's be "frank", even though the owner of the business displays a sign stating that "3 out of 10 Yelpers are idiots", I take no offense, because it may be true somewhere out there in Yelp land.  I just don't think those idiots were here with us that day.  In fact I think we all gave this place good ratings.  Idiots are every where, not just with Yelp.  I wonder how the public would respond if the sign said "3 out 10 patrons are idiots"?  Kind of the same thing if you ask me!     Oh well, I still want to come back again and try the veggie dawg at the next go around.   youtube.com/watch?v=LuyS

We came on a weekday around 5:30 p.m. and the place was about half full. We were quickly seated and given menus. It was happy hour so I decided on the happy hour sliders and a pint.  I tried out the banana beer.  They do offer samples, so if you're unsure if you will like the beer, just ask your server.  It's served in a mini (shot glass-sized) mug!    The beer was $1 off, I believe.  The sliders were 3 for about $6.  They were pretty tasty and quite filling.  I couldn't finish my order.  They had a nice tahini dressing too.Overall, I'd say that the name says it all, "burgers and brew."  That's what they serve and they do it right.  Everyone I came with seemed to really enjoy their food.  Notes:-happy hour!-original location in Davis!

The inside is clean, cool, and homey. Burly jumped to our presence and was extremely friendly and helpful with advising my noob self on what to order. Kao poon, stuffed fried chicken, pork larb... some of the best food I've had in a while. I couldn't breathe.

Our party of six, seven if you count infants as human beings, came here for the mother's birthday and to partake in some entertaining cooking and downright delicious fucking food.  Seriously, the garlic fried rice made me want to convert to Taoism and move to Asia and live in a village that served only that, Dim Sum and ferret faces.  If a ferret face was covered in this garlic fried rice I would eat it without hesitation knowing full well that ferrets are filthy, disgusting rodents and those who keep them as pets don't get laid nor do they care about the scent of their bedroom.  Put the cage in the laundry room or something, Jesus Christ. Ahem, anyways, Wasabi is small, minimalist and stylish, with their liquor selection lined up close to patrons at the bar and a modest beer fridge stuffed with Asahi, other Asain beers, and NOT Tsing Tao (I ordered one, the bartender/server laughed and informed me that Tsing Tao is not at all Japanese).  So, I'm a white chick fucking moron what do you want from me?  At least I didn't order Coors Light and ask you about North Korea.  The older Asain man at the bar to the left of me had an amazing plate of beautifully stacked sushi in front of him, I commented on it, and he went on with a big smile to tell us how we must must must get the cooks drunk so they cut the fish thicker. I feel like Thicker Fish may be a good band name. We were seated promptly at our reservation time around a large skillet and surrounded by other patrons doing the same.  What I really enjoyed about Wasabi is that you get a sense of their culture of food, and moreso, the culture of dining.  Dining to them is an event, something used to connect, share, talk, drink, yell, sing and that's pretty cool and incredibly fun.  Before choosing our meals we watched and listened to the other tables around us do Sake Bombs, in which the cooks and servers would come and announce it to the room and often partake in one themselves.  Sure, this is a cliche restaurant spectacle, not original to this place, but something about the way they did it seemed more genuine.  Everyone was actually having a good time, not just doing their job.  This was the first restaurant I've been to in a very long time that seemed to exude a sense of genuine community.  It was awesome. Our cook was a young, strapping Japanese man who flipped his tools and smiled at the baby and did his job with sincerity and skill.  He impressed us with his party tricks, laughed at our jokes, and agreed to do a sake bomb with us at the end of our meal.  The food here is just downright fucking delicious.  The spicy veggies, the garlic fried rice, all the chicken dishes, the perfectly seasoned beef and some of the best sushi I've had in a very long time.  The entrees run you about 20 bucks but you totally get 20 dollars worth of food; both in quality and portions. I don't know, I just really really loved this place.  When we all left we talked about it for days afterward, like, "hey, remember how good Wasabi was and what a great time we had?" That is a true hallmark of a superb dining experience.  Not only do I highly recommend this place, I'm already planning my next trip there.
<review# 1265,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/1/2012,9/25/2012,202,243,4,7,7>Dislike the parking lot (which was very full during the lunch hour on a weekday when we were there) and the strip mall location (despite the many decorations, the place still felt like it was one part of a strip mall - a bit lame). But I loved the food, the waitress, the vibe (low-key), the dolmas and how quickly everything came out. I didn't order one of the lunch specials (gyro and one other), which were less than $5, but my meal was still under $7. Such a deal since my meal came with a delicious cup of soup. Good food for great prices? I'm in. I think that this place has made it onto my list of repeat restaurants.
<review# 1266,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2012,9/24/2012,68,247,,11,6>I used to work at a small yogurt shop and the owners introduced me to Hawaiian shaved ice and I've been hooked on it ever since.  My shop closed and I've been looking for a new place in Sacramento to find my fix.  When I saw Da Leila's Beach Hut featured on Good Day Sacramento, excitement immediately filled my heart.  My boyfriend and I went to Da Leila's Monday after work.  The owner and her husband were so nice.  In fact, everyone there was delightfully friendly.  The decor is cool, the location is great and easy to find.  The only issue is finding parking and trying to avoid some of the sketchy locals.  He ordered the shaved beef sandwich.  The meat is cooked in au jus and you can taste it in the meat.  It was so good and not too salty.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken burger.  The owner brought out a huge mixing bowl and showed us what went into the burger.  He showed us chunks of cut up chicken breast, green onion, carrots, salt and pepper.  He told us that my burger would take about 10 minutes because they had to grind it fresh.  We paid about $6 for each.  Combos and fries are extra.  When I got my chicken burger, I couldn't believe how good it was.  I was impressed by how fresh it tasted, how well the burger held together without any binding.  I could count the number of ingredients were in my burger.  How many restaurants can you go to and count all of the ingredients of your burger with one hand?  Okay, maybe two hands.  I really enjoyed the texture of the burger.  I almost didn't need the teriyaki sauce.  The bun was just a regular old bun.  My bf's sandwich was on a wheat or grain roll that looked really soft, but not soft enough to get stuck in the roof of your mouth.  The au jus completely flavored that meat and yet it wasn't sloppy or dripping apart.  It literally put a smile on my face and made me feel happy.  The shaved ice was good.  My boyfriend's was really sour (at his request), and mine was just the right amount of sweet.  The condensed milk or "snow cap" is very thin.  I don't know if that's a style or if people prefer it light.  Personally, I prefer it straight from the can.  Adding the snow cap added a nice creamy flavor.  I tried the strawberry and Li Chin Something, rather. I don't know the name of that syrup.  I liked the people, I enjoyed the decor.  They're just opening up, but I think once they get their rhythm, service will run really smoothly.  I really wish this place sticks around.  I feel like what I loved was the simplicity in their food.  It reminds me of something my family would do back in the old days.  There's something great about this joint that I can't quite express, but I really think people should try it just once.  There's something about this place that really makes me happy.
<review# 1267,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2012,9/23/2012,71,119,4,10,7>This place serves some of the best falafel and other Mediterranean fare that I've ever tasted - and I've spent over a year traveling in the Middle East! :) Not only is it delicious, it's really a good value: You get a lot of food for your dollar. The restaurant itself is spacious and comfortable, and the staff has always been friendly, courteous, and prompt.They have a mini-market in the restaurant where you can purchase fresh-made spreads and food, as well as various items you'd find in a specialty Middle Eastern grocery store.Oh, and last time I was there, I noticed that they cater - and they seems to have really good prices. I'd definitely consider them for a catered party.I can't wait to get back here for another falafel. Seriously, check this place out.
<review# 1268,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/13/2012,9/22/2012,410,518,3,3,4>I've been having a different flavored cupcake everyday for the past five days.... It's my birthday week!  I would have done it on any regular week, but it just so happened that I walked in to Icing looking for something special to serve at my pre-party when I experienced a mouthgasm after a bite of their signature Pinkdelicious, I had to have more..taste more!  I was surprised by the fluffy, soft, moist texture of their cupcakes.  They do not refrigerate them at all.  Tastes fresh!  Besides the Pinkdelicious, I've had their chocolate mint (drool), the red velvet (OMG good), the apple pie..YES Apple Pie!  It was an individualized apple pie the size of a cupcake.  I may have to pick those up for Thanksgiving to share with my family.  And last but not least the Neopolitan that I'm about to demolish tonight.  Vanilla cake, strawberry frosting, with chocolate cream in the middle.  By far my favorite cupcake!  I really think this SHOULD be on their regular menu.Location and parking suck, but their cupcakes are delicious.
<review# 1269,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2012,9/11/2012,116,75,10,13,12>I wish I had a few more stomachs! Owner Phil was generous enough to gift my favorite husband and I a 5-course meal, complete with drinks. As suggested, we showed up very hungry.Our first course was hummus & pita bread, which we gobbled almost too quickly. Phil put the next plate down and warned us to save room: lots more coming! This second course was a quad of flavorful salads: chick pea salad, tabouli, cucumber/tomato, and a lemony orzo. I was nearly stuffed by this point, but every delicious bite motivated me to keep on munchin. Phil came by with the next course: the sampler plate, overflowing with feta, olives, falafel, pita bread, dolmas, tomato & onion, shwarma-style meat, 2 sauces, and - my favorite: spanakopita. I stuffed bite after bite into my beak, at this point very much wishing for more room in my tummy. Oh no! What's this? A plate of perfectly-cooked lamb with a sauce of spinach, mint, feta, and magic. As I was slowly, barely stuffing in a lil bite, the final course came: pasta. Simple- with garlic, olive oil, a squeeze of lemon, topped with feta; all of the flavors in a delicate balance. Phil was knowledgable and extremely hospitable- not just to us, but to all of his customers and staff as well. On this fairly busy night, the staff kept up with the flow of diners without appearing rushed. The beautiful young dessert lady came around to showcase a couple of tonight's desserts. As stuffed as I was by the end of our enormous meal, I still meandered over to get a pistachio baklava. On our way out, Phil offered me another glass of wine. I declined, and instead he put a half bottle in a bag, slid it over and said, "Here- it's the weekend!" What a guy. Stop in- and bring an extra stomach.
<review# 1270,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/10/2012,9/10/2012,582,450,8,13,14>Crab legs, Cajun garlic butter, a bib, and lots of napkins! Not bad when the biggest dilemma of the day was deciding what crustacean to devour and what sauce to accompany it with.  There were so many choices...        3 different kinds of crab legs (at market price), crawfish, shrimp and clams.  Should it be fried catfish or chicken wings?... or do I want to stick with the crustaceans?  Oh, and the add-on's... to die for!I opted for 1 lb. of snow crab legs in the THICK Cajun garlic butter sauce, a small 1/2 cob of corn, and a basket of Cajun garlic fries (which I gladly shared with my fellow Yelpers).  The crab legs and corn came to the table in a large plastic bag, nestled inside a wooden bowl.  The bag is deceiving because it doesn't look very appetizing, but it contains the most delicious treats...  whatever main ingredient(s) you decided on and a very generous amount of sauce.  You can buy a side of white rice ($2) to soak up the rest of the saucy goodness (I would recommend this).My crab was fresh and delectable. The thick sauce was a smooth bled of garlic, butter and spices.  SO, So, so good!!  The crab is served with a cracker, a pick, and a bowl for shells.  My neighbor's crawfish was served with a regular sized dinner fork.  Sad for them... have you seen the size of crawfish tails?  They are too tiny for a fork that size.  I'd ask for a smaller crab pick with your crawfish order.  The Cajun garlic fries were crispy, spicy and very garlicy!  They were perfect and I would highly recommend trying them!Great company, great conversation, and a wonderful place to bring family, friends, and kids who aren't afraid to get their hands dirty!  You will needs lots and lots of napkins and the wet naps will be put to good use!Overall, a really fun restaurant!

<review# 1272,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2012,9/8/2012,412,840,6,10,10>So against my better judgement after reading the yelp reviews and my experience at MG at Ramstein AFB in Germany I came here for dinner for a change. This is a concurrent draft on mobile yelp. Very nice hostess and very nice waitress! Carli-- she wrote her name in crayon on the table. House wine, drinkable, honor system, served in a tumbler as they really do in Italy (although there it's smaller). The glass was actually explained to me and I could have chosen a "premium wine glass".Next test: they have a steak served with mac and cheese and veggies. Well I'd like a spaghetti bolognese small portion with my steak. "No problem!" Surprised and pleased so far.My starter salad which in Italy and France would come afterwards was a good California style mixed greens with radicchio etc in a mild vinaigrette. Not what I like but excellent for what it is. (I prefer the Olive Garden's iceberg lettuce mix--so not European but sooo good!)Pleasant service--my Pelegrino is being refilled. Now I get my plate! A nice steak which I ordered rare even though I like it blue! The bolognese is real! It tastes right. And my steak is blue! I Iove it!Then the waitress asks if all is ok! Yes, fantastic! She will tell the chef!A few minutes later this very handsome man approaches me to say he heard I was unhappy with my meal. Lol! I told him how good the bolognese was and how nice the steak was (not) cooked ! Still with a great sear.  Andwith a nice sauce. It did not even need the garlic aioli.Of course I couldn't finish it all since I like to nibble and graze. Finished the spaghetti and taking the rest of the steak home. I love the atmosphere. Open kitchen, rustic, wine racks. Cool!I'm really amazed! I'll have to come here with jack. Just afraid we'll get a different waiter and different chef.
<review# 1273,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2012,9/7/2012,648,305,5,10,12>The kid and I decided to take our chances on a beautiful sweet sun-showery Thursday in Old Sacramento. I'm so glad we did...  Ive been meaning to take my poor fruit and veggie loving child to a real donut shop for a while, because Mia's never experienced the taste of  a real donut (I know, right?!)  We were on our way to the railroad museum, and out of the corner of my eye, I spotted the Danny's Mini Donut sign...how could we not? We were warmly greeted by the most heavenly smell, and a super friendly employee (maybe Danny?) Took a glance at the menu, then decided to try the half and half basket... What true chocolate lover can really decided between white and dark chocolate anyway? Coolest part twas watching him fry the darling little things in front of us.  I also ordered a hot chocolate, not the greatest- but hey, I'm here for the food, right? We took our treat, sat on the picnic tables outside, and practically inhaled the order. Awesome sauce. Rings of holy perfection.  Very cool thing to do while we enjoyed the sights and sounds of a gorgeous early afternoon in Old Sacramento. Of course we'll be back:)
<review# 1274,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2012,9/6/2012,280,194,4,9,8>The best things about any place you visit will most notably be about the service. First time here, as with many, passing along the strip mall joint. I heard some good an fair reviews and since it was a Thai kind of day, I thought I'd give it a whirl. It looks bigger on the outside than in. Walls along the inside are adorned with murals of a beach. There's 6 small tables and a roomy kitchen per hostess. She gave us plenty of time to select from the menu and since it was also within the lunch special pricing, I decided to expand the tastes a bit. After pursuing the tips section, we settled for the Fried Calamari, Red Curry Chicken, Lao style Papaya Salad, and beef drunken noodles. The portions are favorable for two. I like the Calamari because it was served in a crispy Panko crust and not greasy. Also, it was real squid and not baby octopus or tentacles. The sauce that came with this was a sweet heated tartar sauce on a small bed of iceberg lettuce. It also had a small side of sweet Thai dipping sauce. The Red Curry Chicken was ordered on the advice of the hostess, as the best of the curries. It came in a small soup bowl with steamed rice as a side. I liked the eggplant that was incorporated into the dish. I was expecting more heat for a medium spicy but didn't get it. You'll probably want spicy if your looking to feel any heat. Plenty of chicken and a good mix of ingredients in the dish. The Lao Style papaya salad had more heat but was also ordered as medium heat. The initial sighting of raw blue crab bits inside had me at hello, as this would have been something from a home-made recipe. It came with the traditional cabbage and large chucks of tomatoes. If you took into the account of just the papaya, it was a bit on the salty side. But if you ate the papaya salad with the cabbage and bits and such, it was well rounded. Least impressive was the drunken noodles.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but drunken noodle dishes have the clear noodles? This dish was more like a pad thai version. Flat wide chow fun noodles served with the regular garnishments of the pad thai/ drunken noodles variety. Anyhow, it's was a little slow so the hostess/ possible owner lady was so curious about us. We ordered a lot of food but didn't really eat much. Our conversation shifted as she also joined in out talk. This isn't a 5 star quality joint since it's in a strip mall and only 6 tables deep, but if the food is nice, and the price is right, and the service is personable, then you can always look for me to come back.
<review# 1275,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2012,9/5/2012,178,194,4,15,7>The grand opening is this Friday 08/10/2012, but I managed to get myself into a soft opening event...  Such a cool spot! I don't really recall what the interior looked like previously, but the ambiance now is awesome! Except for the back lighting of the bar, the entire place is light by nothing but Edison bulbs, which works perfectly with the old brick walls, the winding stair case behind the bar, and the dark wood of the bar and the tables. Right when you walk in, you'll notice the 4 pour tables to the right, which house two beer taps and one Jameson Whiskey tap right in the center of your table. I'm not quite sure how that works, but there is an iPad behind fiberglass built into the table to display your consumption. I imagine its going to be pretty hard to get one of these tables for quite some time, which is probably a good thing for me, because I'm pretty sure you'd have to carry me out if I ever sat at that table! Since the "Pour tables" were all taken, we headed to the bar, where the whiskey and bourbon selection reaches to the ceiling. In addition to those tasty treats, they have 24 beers, and one cider on tap, and then they even throw in a nice bottle selection just to top it off. I was pleasantly surprised to see the prices for the draft list were actually quite reasonable, unlike some of the other specialty beer places that have opened up recently! If the extensive beer and whiskey list haven't managed to catch your eye, its clear they are setting the stage for some great craft cocktails! Even though I didn't stray from the draft list, the bartender let me try one of their house made brandied cherries, and I'm looking forward to stealing a few more of those next time I stroll in! For the adventurous drinker, they had something called a whiskey fig, which had fig jelly in it, but I think I'm just going to convince one my friends to order that bad boy! The kitchen is run by Coast to Coast, which also has a food truck rolling around town! I haven't tried it yet, but I've heard the catfish Po-boy is pretty awesome! Oh, there is also a patio out back with a fair amount of seating, but since its literally right be the train tracks, I'd be curious how loud it is when the train rolls by! Speaking of which... I hear they are going to have drink specials every time the train comes through!

Too bad there's no storefront - you've gotta track down the cart.WAFFLE WAGON:  This was my first stop at the latest SactoMoFo after I heard a lot of clucking about the infamous Volkswaffle Wagon. Surprisingly, there wasn't a line - I was worried that I'd have to put up a cockfight since I've heard this is a popular spot! Because this was a virgin rooster experience for me, I decided to go plain with just a light dusting of powdered sugar and I'm so glad I did. It was love at first bite! The waffle is not a traditional one that you'd get at IHOP and because of its richness, it's probably better as a snack than a full meal. It's lightly crispy and golden brown on the outside and densely doughnut-like on the inside. It's sweet, but not overbearingly so, and a little bit reminiscent of the beignets at Café Du Monde in New Orleans. The doughy texture melted in my mouth and I savored every bite, only to find myself wanting more!FANCY TOPPINGS:  These waffles can be fancied up with exotic toppings, including strawberries, whipped cream, Nutella, and even a Klondike bar! That said, the waffles themselves are so good, I don't need them adulterated with all that craziness! One plain waffle please (actually, better make that two)!
<review# 1278,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2012,9/2/2012,667,245,6,9,10>It was a Friday night and we stumbled into Sapporo after walking around J St for Second Saturday. I guess they turn the restaurant into a "bar/club" during the late night hours as we were asked for our IDs before being let in. The place gave out a good vibe, and you could tell everyone there was having a good time. We sat at the sushi bar and had some sake bombs and delicious food! I've only been to Sapporo once prior to this, but I think they definitely stepped up their food game. My favorite was the calamari! The staff was super friendly and provided great service. Great music from the DJ, great food & great company = a GREAT Friday night!I'll definitely be back soon! :)
<review# 1279,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/10/2011,12/21/2011,42,177,23,37,33>I truly hope this place does well.  Our first stop in for drinks & appetizers hooked my wife . . . the parmesan fries set us both up for a 2nd visit, but then homegirl got into a conversation with the guy tending bar (probably the owner), and she talked him into making her a peach bellini.  A week later, she made me take her back there.  She wanted a couple of peach bellinis while she discussed the awful week she was having. Late on a Saturday night, while enjoying a small margherita pizza, an order of polenta fries and -- you guessed it -- we spotted the brunch menu, and came back the next morning.  On this, our third visit in a week (which looks and feels ridiculous in hindsight), the wife had the french toast and the bottomless mimosa; I had the eggs benedict and coffee (they get it from Temple, downtown).  All  was delicious.  Our server was under 21 and couldn't handle alcohol, so I had to get the mimosa refilled myself.  Other than that, service was okay.  We've visited Fabian's three times now, and I can't remember seeing anyone there, besides the staff and ourselves, under the age of 50.  Got a year or two before you qualify for AARP?  Pay a visit.  They won't turn you away at the door, I promise!
<review# 1280,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2011,12/20/2011,149,559,7,14,11>Short version: 3.5 stars? Legit lunch option down the block from the Capitol - way better than Spataro (as a comparably priced option). Dishes vary: some are awesome and some are just ok.Meandering version: I'm up, I'm down. I'm impressed, I'm underwhelmed. I cannot pin down my opinion of Mayahuel. I have hemmed and hawed with co-workers and friends about this place... I either really like it and am not sure why, or don't love it and am not sure why. It's not a ton of food for the money, but I like the food I do get.Some observations: The moles and sauces are very good - the actual mole in the chicken mole enchiladas is excellent. The enchiladas themselves, however, are basically just chicken rolled in tortillas - the care and time taken to produce such a lovely mole is in stark contrast to the rest of the dish, which feels thrown together.  The cochinita pibil is a good option.  The other tacos are good, but not amazing.  The pozole is pretty good, but severely overpriced for the portion. The salads are shockingly good: tremendous attention to detail in the flavor and ingredient combinations, and everything tastes fresh. Seriously, the salad is worth a try for a healthy and delicious lunch.I believe in high end Mexican food, and I am willing to pay for it. Mayahuel does a lot of things right... but there is something just a bit off. Can't put my finger on it, but I have talked to enough people who have the same feeling, that I've decided it must be true, even if I can't properly express it.
<review# 1281,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/3/2011,12/19/2011,329,223,8,12,14>I used to take my son here a lot when he was a fetus. He really liked the French ground steak burger with cheese and a peanut butter shake. The doctor told me I couldn't take him here anymore due to my gestational diabetes. Then when my son was a baby I moved to the coast and haven't been back since... until now that is. I took my son to grab a burger and a root beer. We didn't get shakes because now that I'm buying for more than just myself it suddenly seems pricey! I got the steak burger and a small burger for him. My burger was as good as I remembered and he was loving his. He even danced while he ate which is a sure sign he is enjoying his food. The burgers aren't salty or filled with weird meat-textured stuff. It tastes like straight up, no frills beef. The dressings go under the patty (which I like) and the cheese on top. The buns have the perfect texture and don't seem to get soggy despite all of the dressings. It gets messy and drips all over your fingers - but there are plenty of napkins. The small burger is the same as the big one, just...well, small. The service was really friendly and as I watched the guy wipe down a nearby table I thought about the "old days." I used to live in this neighborhood and my father once came to visit. He told me about a small place he used to love eating at when he was younger and working in the neighborhood. "It was just a meat market, but the guy would cook up some burgers so customers could sample the meat. People liked it so much that they became popular and people would come by just to buy the burgers. The poor guy would get so flustered, but eventually turned his place into a burger stand. I wonder if it's still there." Well, no, it wasn't. It had moved to a bigger location at 19th and H. I took him over and he was delighted that other than the location it hadn't really changed "I think it's even still that same guy and he seems just as flustered" he said with a smile. I wonder if that guy is still around.

I have to admit though, I like it more in the middle of winter in a rainstorm than I do in the summer. Go early for the freshest produce - go late for the best deals! I love going just with my man and planning awesome menus. However, I also love going with a big group of friends and geeking out over the awesome fresh fruits and veggies. We always buy our cheese, meat, and eggs here too. If you are leery of Farmers Market meat - don't be!!! Its well priced and wonderful!Parking can be a little hair-raising - and so can crossing the street, but its all worth it for the freshness!I have heard people complain that they don't see enough organic, but I have never had a problem with the levels of organic produce there. I have always been impressed with the quality.
<review# 1283,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/14/2011,12/17/2011,354,195,7,14,12>This place used to be Nail Stop but after the new owners took over they renamed it Fabulous Nails and Spa. Before going to Fabulous Nails I only got my nails done for special occasions because I hated how fake nails always felt on my fingers. However, a few weeks ago I was feeling all bummy and my mom suggested I should do something to make myself feel pretty, so a day doing girlie things and getting my nails done was what I did. Le did an awesome job on my nails, so well that I have been going back to get them filled which I have never done before. I loved that they felt really natural on my fingers and didn't feel like they were fake. His wife is also really good at pedicures and tips. They have gel polish and airbrush as well as crackle designs and glitter tips. They also do waxing, piercing and paraffin wax for hands and feet. Also, if you mention you are a first time customer and get a set or pedicure you will get a free nail design or paraffin wax.Everyone who works in the shop is extremely friendly and Le is very quick to offer you soda, water or coffee. The only reason why they loose a star is because often when someone comes in to get a eyebrow wax Le will leave and take care of the customer while in the middle of the manicure. (I think he is the only one who does the waxing)That sorta irks me because I'm not paying to wait for you to wax someones eyebrows while I'm sitting there waiting, but like I said they do a great job and I highly recommend them for your tips, fills and pedicures. Oh, and my mom says they do a good job at eyebrow waxing as well.
<review# 1284,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/21/2011,12/16/2011,534,268,10,14,11>After going to the preview day at East West Cafe... the one thing I had in mind is.. I definitely wanted to come back the next day! 5 stars.SERVICE: We walked into the restaurant and it was very spacious and clean. Rather huge for a Vietnamese food place - there are chairs and table, and a booth area. Two lady server were extremely nice - they greeted us with big smiles and asked us where we wanted to sit. This time around I came back here with 3 other friends. And all of us had our hands down to the BUN BO HUE. Here are the reasons why:(1) It was actually SPICY: At first, I was expecting the bon bo hue to be not spicy, but I was wrong. It was actually SPICY! This is the first time I actually had a SPICY bon bo hue - because in other places it's not even spicy! So, hands down the SPICY-NESS - 5 stars!(2) BROTH: You can see the color of the broth - a brown-ish - red color and that's how you know the bon bo hue is super good. The soup is layered with a shimmer of red-hot-oil like coating. A very delicate, yet, thick on the bud. The taste melts gradually spreading onto each and every taste bud. It wasn't too salty, nor did it taste like it was covered with msg. 5 stars!(3) Veggies: One of my favorite part of this dish, it came with a plate of thinly (let me repeat - thinly) sliced red and green cabbage. Compare to other places I LOVE the why they slice because other places cut their cabbage in thick slices, which I do not like. The thinly sliced cabbage balance perfectly when added to the spicy hot soup. The spicy-ness is counterbalanced the the cool thinly sliced cabbage - 5 stars!(4) MEAT: This bon bo hue is LOADED with MEAT! I was like WOW! There's so many meat - Since I'm such a food-saver, I had to ask for a box to take it togo - save it for later. 5 stars to the meat!YES, indeed! A 5 star to BUN BO HUE!  FYI - small is $6.95 and large is $7.50. I had the large! YUM!My other friend had the East-West Rice Plate - $10.95, and it's worth $10.95. A huge plate with different kinds of meat with rice and soup on the side. There were egg rolls, bbq pork, tofu stuffed patty, shredded pork, sun side up egg, and an egg patty including rice and a side of soup -  drench it with fish sauce.. and now, that's a feast! 5 stars.**OVERALL: I've been a meaning to try this place for awhile... and WHY did it take me so long.  I've heard about this place from my friends at their other location in Elk Grove - I never had an opportunity to go to this one because it was too far (driving from Davis). I definitely recommend their BUN BO HUE and their feast-y rice plate! A will come again! FIVE STARS!

Kupros seems like one of those Yelp darlings~ you know, all the rave with most top reviewers- others love or hate it. I have to admit, they've come a long way since they had started. The service is 3x as better as it was almost a year ago- they must have got rid of the rude... We sat on the deck, I ordered that meat, my Aunt got the meatball sub, and the kiddo had the mac and cheese. The sub was devoured (great balls) I tried tackling the out-of this-world burger (left with half) and the mac..meh. So so. (I'm spoiled with my own homemade- so not knocking) I recommend more umbrellas- they deck can be a quite crispy at lunch time. I love what they've done upstairs, and get a kick out of browsing the photos on the wall. This place is slowly becoming a favorite of mine. Poutine and pickles...Ill get you next!
<review# 1286,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2011,12/14/2011,432,335,11,17,12>Dear wine snobs:  please don't read this if you're looking for a sophisticated and educated review!  This was my first wine tasting experience.Seriously though, I was a little nervous not knowing what to do or expect.  We stopped in on an early Saturday afternoon, during a winter downpour, and pretty much had the space to ourselves.  This enabled our waitress to give us her full and undivided attention.  For $10, we had our pick of 9 tastings and 1 glass of our favorite.  I don't recall the names of all the wines we tasted.  Only that my favorite was the Chenin Blanc and my friend preferred the Cabernet Sauvignon.  Craig Haarmeyer, the winemaker himself, stopped by more than once to see what we thought of the wines and we chatted for a bit.  He was genuinely nice, down to earth, didn't get all wine snobby with us either (whew!).Local and fresh ingredients are used for their artisan small plates and the menu changes constantly.  I appreciated the careful thought put into ensuring that the food pairs well with the wines.  This is where I fell head over heels for Beet Salads.  I also tried the homemade pop tart which I found enjoyable - not too sweet at all (that's not a complaint).They participate in Second Saturday events, occasionally have live music and events (Winemaker's Dinner), happy hour at starting at 3:30 p.m. Tues - Fri, and also have a small banquet room for private parties. I've returned twice since then and continue to receive personable service, enjoy the casual atmosphere, taste the great selection of wines, and consume their delicious small plates.  I'm definitely a fan of this urban winery and grateful it's easily accessible for a quick escape from reality.
<review# 1287,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2011,12/13/2011,390,173,3,17,12>I love Pronto's location. After Saturday or Sunday brunch, the Capitol is only a nice little stroll away. Here for Tuesday lunch? Fremont Park is right around the corner with a Farmer's Market during the spring/summer. Every time I've been there, I've taken full advantage of the 2-hours free street parking.One weekend I was feeling the need for a nice restaurant patio where I could enjoy a fabulous brunch and quietly read the paper. Pronto came through with flying colors. Quiet when I first arrived at 9, the patio was filled with happy people by 10. The Italian Benedict was tasty and cooked perfectly. The prosciutto was slightly crispy and I love that it's on ciabatta bread. The cornmeal pancakes with blueberries were a letdown. I prefer pancakes with the berries actually added to the batter instead of dumped on top in an overly thick sauce.For lunch, I've tried the Pasta Carbonara and the Baked Pasta. Both were rich and wonderful. The Carbonara may be the first dish I've ever tried that almost had too much bacon in it. The taste of their garlic bread dipped in that garlicky cream sauce is something that's not easily forgotten. The Baked Pasta arrives smoldering hot. Literally had to wait 5 minutes before I could dig in. There's tomato and cream sauces mingling for a fantastic flavor combo. The generous portion translates into enviable leftovers at the office the next day.Even in the summer, I'm a lover of soups. They had a rare Manhattan clam chowder available that was so good I'd easily go in just for that.Service has been prompt and friendly every time I've gone in. I kind of like the pay-when-you-order, DIY drink and leftover system. Everything's ready to go, so with just a little manual labor, you're done eating and out the door in seconds.
<review# 1288,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2011,12/12/2011,257,251,7,11,10>This place definitely lived up to expectations.  The expectation being that the food here would be just as excellent as Tulí.Three of us fine ladies ordered different dishes and passed bites to one another.  I almost didn't want to share my Pork Tonnato: it was so good I wanted every bite!  The combination of exquisitely tender pork, crunchy baguette, pickled fennel, fresh arugula, and crispy onion strings was simply amazing.  Perfectly light on the tummy, too!  My friends ordered the Capitol Burger and Chicken Cordon Bleu and both were just as tasty as my dish.  LOVE the shoestring french fries.Bonuses to the lunch were the refreshing cucumber waters at the start, and then the equally refreshing cocktails: Cucumber Cooler, Mai Thai Thir13een, and Tangerine Comet.  YUM!We all agreed that our meals were worth every penny!  Also, if you come here on a day with great weather, make sure you sit outside!The only thing that wasn't perfect about this experience (and I hate to even think about it because everything else was so lovely) were the very uncomfortable chairs they have in the outside seating area.  My plentiful bum wasn't happy, but my tummy was!ps. Love that you can make reservations on their website!
<review# 1289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2013,9/20/2013,410,518,13,28,19>This place is like an intense version of Weight Watchers!!  Have ya'll seen Mymy N. Lately?  HOTNESS!  Her amazing transformation and the continuous encouragement from her sister to try this place out is what made me finally  give it a go! Thank you Nguyen Sisters!! Life changing, body changing results since I've started.  I've always worked out on my own, but I'm pretty sure I graduated from my own program and hit a plateau.  In preparation for my upcoming nuptials and the fact that I was having a harder time losing weight and getting toned on my own I had to try out this gym.  After joining; I've lost 7lbs, lost 5% body fat, 45 seconds faster on my mile and a half, and increased my strength by 68%!!  Woot Woot!  Of course I had to put in all the hard work and actually go.  AND it took me 2 whole month to get there.  How'd I do it??  How is this place different??:1.  You start off with an assessment.  They weigh you, take your body fat measurement, measure the circumference of several body parts (waist, hips, legs, arms), measure endurance all so you have a starting point and the trainers figure out your fitness level.2.  Trainer!!  Yes, you get a trainer! Every member gets one.  Someone who will encourage you and push you through the work out.  Who knows your fitness goals and will help you work to achieve those goals.  Despite having your own personal trainer, the rest of the staff is there to help you as well.  They pay attention to how heavy you can lift and will add another 5lbs if they think you can do it, they will turn the treadmill faster if they think you can run faster; everyone pushes you to the limit.   They hold you accountable, they will email you tips or reminders, and will give you weekly weigh-ins to ensure you are on the right track.  And if you're scheduled for a cardio class after the regular workout and you decide not to go, they will physically make sure you're in that class.  Even if it means dragging you from your car and taking your keys until class is over.  LOL!  I've seen in happen :)  3.  The meal plan.  After the assessment you are counseled on a meal plan to help you achieve your fitness goals.  It's not just about the exercise here folks!  They even provide you with recipes, alternatives, and a mobile device to keep you on the right track.  The app:  Myfitness Pal has definitely helped me snack less through the day and take in more protein to help me reach my fitness goal.  4.  The workouts:  Intense and lots of variety,  I never know what my body is going to endure.  I'm always scared when the class name includes "power" or "blaster".  I just know it's going to be tough.  At least once a week they have me sore and unable to walk.  I prefer coming to this gym than a regular one.  They have me spoiled.  It's easier to have someone tell you what to do than make up shit on your own.   5.  The time:  There is a scheduled work out at every hour starting at 5AM until 8PM with two cardio classes available Monday through Friday.  If you miss a cardio class the trainers will make one up for you! If you're late to class they'll still put you in and then make you stay a little for the next one.  They also have Saturday and Sunday classes as well.6.  The Members:  I've never met so many positive and encouraging people in my whole gym experience.  Everyone is rooting for you to be stronger, go faster, and pushes you to your limit.  They will run with you when you don't feel like running and spot you when you're feeling weak.  Love the camaraderie!  I live in North Natomas and I drive all the way out here because it's working for me.  I feel better about myself, I feel more fit, and I'm hitting all my fitness goals!  The PERFECT gym!!
<review# 1290,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2013,9/19/2013,266,332,20,23,25>"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's amore'!"  I felt as if I could hear my step dad's Dean Martin album as we walked in.  We came here to celebrate my son's birthday and I have to say it was a good choice! I called to make reservations about two hours ahead of time and was told that typically it would have been almost impossible to be able to get in on the same day. Luckily, it was a slow night, so they were able to accommodate our party of 10. Immediately upon walking in, they take us through the tour of the kitchen and dining areas before coming to our table. Our server, Elliot, greets us instantly, and asks for our drink orders. We ordered a large bottle of their red and Italian sodas and Pepsi for the non drinkers. "When the world seems to shine, like you just had too much wine, that's amore'!"We ordered the chopped antipasto salad($19.99), so good, large supremo italiano pizza ($24.99), large spaghetti w/meatballs/meat sauce($30.99), large baked rigatoni($28.99), large Penne San Remo($29.99), and lasagna($18.99). Too much food!! Everything is served family style so we could've sufficed with omitting maybe two of the pasta dishes. Although we've been here before on several other occasions, we conveniently forgot how large the portions were. That's okay because everyone  was going to have a great leftover lunch tomorrow! "Bells will ring, ting a ling, ting a ling." Ok, enough with the singing! Mangia! Mangia! The food got my step dad's approval, he's Sicilian and it's almost as good as his mom's. He thought it was pretty good, no complaints there. We had great service from Elliot, who was on top of all our needs, and the food was fantastico. I have to give him props, as you may know, most restaurants charge 18% fee for large parties, and Bucca is no exception. With that being said, we have frequented many restaurants and majority of servers knowingly give us less than the required attention since we are a large party and  they know that they will no matter what, get a nice tip. Elliot, on the other hand, stayed true to the end, making sure we were still satisfied with everything! Bellisimo! That's Amore'!
<review# 1291,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/5/2013,9/18/2013,1353,176,19,27,19>Asian Cuisine: this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship.Husband fiiinally convinced me to go, (he'd been pushing for weeks). I'm not sure why I fought coming here? Maybe because I was wary of the "Asian Cuisine" moniker; "jack of all trades, master of none" came to mind. And indeed, the menu covers many different types of food: Thai, Vietnamese, Laotian, Chinese, and more. I'll admit, I was a Skeptical Sally.I was a fool. A FOOL, I TELL YOU.After having visited 3 times in two weeks, I can report that everything we have ordered, and I mean *everything*, has been fantastic. If you are familiar at all with my reviews, you know that I'm kind of obsessed with Thai food.     * The curry here is outrageously good. YYYUUMMM. (Like, for realies.)    * We've also had the chow mein, with all veggies for my vegan self. Enormous portion, and really really good.     * Husband had the Mongolian beef, to rave reviews.     * Four words: Mango with Sticky Rice. DO IT. The location itself isn't anything of note: pretty plain, tv is always on and fairly loud, located up against a liqueur store. * Fun fact: If you sit near the front window, a life size cutout of a beer wench in the adjacent building will watch you while you eat! (This is bad or good, depending on your preferences.)It's worth mentioning again: the portions are giiiiinormo. (Maybe see my photos. That's a pile o' noodles, man.)VERDICT: GO! Totally go. Eat eat eat.
<review# 1292,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2013,9/17/2013,667,245,6,15,12>This is a great spot for HH! For HH pricing you have to sit at the bar or find a table around the bar area. We arrived close to 530pm so all the tables were already taken but there were still plenty of seats at the bar. Their HH menu ranges from $4-$7 and offers a variety of food choices. We ordered the fish & chips ($6) and lobster pizza ($7). The portions were ginormous--basically full size even though it was HH. The lobster pizza was surprisingly good. Might sound kind of weird at first but after your first bite, you'll realize what a genius idea it is to put lobster on pizza! Bits of tomatoes and chives also accompanied the lobster. I loved how the pizza was thin so that you could really taste the toppings. It had a generous amount of lobster as well! Each pizza comes with around 8 slices so it can definitely be shared between a few others! It's a great deal! On Thursday-Saturday for late night HH, they offer all pizzas for only $5!! The fish & chips weren't so bad either but I would prefer the batter to be crispier. I loved how it came with a lot of fries on the bottom though! The tartar sauce was pretty amazing as well.My only complaint is that the bar staff could be a little friendlier. The guy sitting next to us at the bar got excellent service and she even offered him to-go boxes without him asking. I had to ask for one after we paid our bill. She clearly saw half a pizza left sitting on the table and didn't even offer us one. Maybe she thought she would get more tips off him since he looked like businessman? Who knows.
<review# 1293,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2013,9/16/2013,178,171,16,26,17>Standard disclaimer...I know the owner. Not well, but there it is.Went out for beers, my buddy pulled "tank house" seemingly out of the air. I rode my bike first to Low Brau, thinking it was next to them...it was not. After a few minutes of searching yelp with no results, I remembered they were opening where Had's was, and Fuji had been before that. Wow. Total transformation. Dark wood, White benches ala Golden Bear, antique mirrors, exposed wood, antlers, etc. Not a western feel, but more like an updated version thereof. Feels a little like a Johnson & Ross job. Jus' sayin.Great beer selection, from canned Hamm's to what I had, a 22 of Knee Deep Brewing's McCarthy's Bane. Rustaller on tap.Meat options included babybacks, brisket, hot links, pork butt sando's and brisket sandos. Sides were the standards...so I had the half rack of ribs...indirect smoke heat...so amazing. So good my friend had one, and offerred to order another full rack and split that. Got the mac and cheese...white cheddar, another one I couldn't place, and just a whisper of blue cheese I could only taste for a second at the very end of each savory bite.Had another beer, and then got a short tour of the patio on the east side (smokers welcome) and got to see "Lexington Steele" the eight foot, hand rolled, locally welded, steel smoker...god what a beauty. Go there. Go there now. Or, don't. More for me.
<review# 1294,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2013,9/15/2013,283,114,21,23,16>It might not be beautiful on the outside but it's really sexy and cash-only on the inside. I walked in, waited in line, got my food and was like, woo hoo! They asked how I was and I said good and then I asked for one of those, one of those and three of those and she said that'll be five dollars and I was like wait...what! Come to find out, they have hecka cheap food here. Their pork bao buns are hot and fluffy and wow!      It's a small corner store in a quiet neighborhood over in them south-west regions of the grid where most people just go when they're lost. It's not fancy and trendy. It's cheap and fast, and good. There were two people running the show when I was here - an older man putting your food in a box or a bag, depending on what you get, and an older lady right next to him ringing you up. He's kind of straight-faced, no-frills and she smiles a lot. I ordered one egg roll, one piece of fried chicken and three pork bao buns and nothing to drink because I wasn't thirsty. Egg roll - HUGE. Lots of noodles and maybe some minced meat and other stuff that I'm not remembering, and deep fried - always remember deep fried. It's good for one dollar if you like big, vintage, greasy egg rolls that don't skimp...for a buck. My fried chicken was the last piece they had for the day so I was hoping for the best and expecting the worst and I got the worst. But only for a dollar. Pork buns? The. Best. Ever. Highlight of Lam Kwong Market. Conversation starter for next five hours. Better than others. Only complaint - I ordered three and not twenty-seven so I'm going back tomorrow. Again, one dollar!  Overall - impressed with the food and super impressed with the prices here. I'm coming back a lot.    Recap -  you walk in, you wait in a line if it's busy and it probably will be because it's good, you order hella food from a guy, you pay a lady who smiles a lot, and you walk out. That's all there is to Lam Kwong Market, I love this place.

As for flavor profiles, everything here is wonderfully delicate and subtle. Nothing will truly overpower your senses, but everything will satisfy your palate the way a quaint butterfly caresses a spring flower. (haha analogy FTW)Afternoon tea for 2 comes out to 55 dollars including tax and here is what is included along with a rating of each:2 pots of tea (white/green/black) with unlimited hot water refills -- I had the white rose infused tea. It had great flavor, but I expected the rose to be a little bit stronger. I also do not have a very good sense of taste, so I really had to dig deep to find the flavor in this one-- My GF had the apricot black tea, which was great-- especially when mixed with a bit of sugar and milk, giving it a heavier consistency. The tea had great scents of apricot and black tea. She won the tea contest.1 blueberry or raisin scone with devonshire cream and jam 4/5-- not the beset scone I've had but pretty darn good6 cucumber mint sandwiches bites: 4/56 Salmon/caper sandwich bites: 4/56 veggie sandwich bites: 5/56 turkey sandwich bites: 3/52 curry chicken sliders: 5/5-- Bomb.com2 petit fours (chocolate covered cake bites): 3/52 Napoleon bites: 5/5-- these things were so fluffy I am going to die2 Macarons: 3/5-- one was pistachio, one was raspberryand then an assortment of fruit at the top.I wish this place was more in the sun, as it is kinda tucked away in an alleyway between other businesses.However, overall it was a great experience.

I LOVE me a good burger), their Sausage and Slaw Pizza, and their Banh Mi Sandwich.  I also had a side of papusas on one occasion.First of all, the Juicy Lucy Burger ($12) really stood out and for me and was absolutely fantastic.  It features a 1/2 Pound of Niman Ranch Beef Stuffed with Habanero Cheese, Pepper Bacon, Jack Cheese, Heirloom Tomato, Avocado, Baby Greens, Aioli.  Lets not forget the Kaiser roll it was placed on which was heavenly... This is what a good burger is all about!  BRAVO!!!  Oh, and the fingerling potato fries... (I'm standing up out of my chair clapping)Next up, featured on DDD, the Sausage and Slaw Pizza ($12).  Piled high with house-made Niman Ranch Pork Sausage, House-made Mustard Slaw, and Red Onion Marmalade, I'd describe this dish as interesting, and worth trying, but probably stick to ordering the Juicy Lucy for the rest of my life...  Oh and if you elect for this pizza, don't forget your gum. Worst. Breath. EVER... Then came the Yelp recommended Banh Mi ($11), YUUUUMMM.  If I ever want to take a break from the Juicy Lucy (like that's gonna happen... hah!), this is one damn good sandwich.  Made with Roasted Pork Loin, Pickled Carrot, Chinese Long Beans, Daikon Radish, Cilantro, Basil, Lemongrass Aioli, Bella Bru Baguette.  There is a lot of flavor going on with this sandwich in every bite.The papusa was just eh... too much dough with not a lot of flavor.  It was beautifully presented though, I gotta say!All in all, the food is an easy 5 stars, no question about it.  But being that it is mainly a bar, I gotta dock at least one point since it's not really possible to come here and just enjoy a meal with your girl like you could in an actual restaurant.  There's always gonna be some loud drunk guy bumping your elbows and being obnoxious, and the occasional RUDE bum/bitch outside harassing you for your leftovers.  No you can't have my money, and HELL NO you can't have my leftovers... there's a Juicy Lucy in here and I'm not parting with it without a fight!  Bum: "Oh, you're too good to feed the homeless..." my response: "Oh, you're too good to get a job..."Stay Classy Sacramento!foodnetwork.com/local/ca

It's clean, neat, and I can find some über cute items that I may or may not need.I come here to stock up on my basics: panko, miso paste, tofu, daikon tongarashi, dashi, tonkatsu sauce, Golden Curry paste.....etc etcSometimes I sneak some cute and colorful something rather into my cart. Sometimes I browse that adorable $1.50 area where I can find things that I need *lunch belts and chopsticks in cases* to things I really could do without *mini soy sauce bottles and nose massagers*. They have bento boxes available (of course they do! it's a freakin' Japanese market....they BETTER have bento boxes) and a nice little dining area to enjoy. They also have a container full of tea to drink (burnt genmaicha....).What else....It's fairly affordable. Some prices are steep, but you would honestly be paying more if you went to your neighborhood mega mart. The sake section is big (bigger than your.......mega mart!). And they have Orion beer, which makes the Okinawan part of my right leg (below the knee or above the knee.....) very very happy. All in all, I love Oto's. I am soooo glad I discovered this place and I don't have to brave SF Market (unless, I need something Chinese or Vietnamese). My right leg give it two toes up!!

My friend Toni O. referred me to Amithyst Salon and guess what came out of it? My new favorite stylist Stephanie - she rules!First let's talk about the salon - major kudos to Amithyst herself because her salon is way cute. I love the colors, the furniture, the art and I felt as if I was in the comfort of a friend's home. The location is great, parking kind of sucks but its midtown. Now let's talk Stephanie. I went in wanting to change my red hair to something lighter, thinking blonde but she told me I couldn't just yet or else my hair would fall out. So we started the process of going lighter and I love what she did to my color! My bangs are totally cute too. I used to have straight across blunt bangs but she made them a little sassy and curved which I love. Stephanie will make you feel comfortable and will definitely make you laugh. You also get a complimentary deep conditioning treatment!One of the best hair washing experiences I've had as well. You know how some sinks hurt your neck? Not the sink at Amithyst, it was so comfy I could sit there all day. They also use Moroccan Oil products which I love so all around this place is the jam!
<review# 1301,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/10/2010,5/31/2010,287,110,3,6,3>I totally agree with previous yelpers who have raved about the outside patio renovation being a welcomed upgrade! My husband and I have eaten here a couple times for breakfast and lunch since the takeover, and I must say that I'm definitely a fan.  What I appreciate most is the fact that my over-medium eggs have been prepared just like I like 'em!  Nothing pisses me off more than an over-medium egg with an uncooked egg white.  Seriously, it's a "march my plate to the kitchen and throw the eggs at the cook" kind of pissed off!  (deep breath) Anyway, the biscuits are also delicious, and the bacon is perfectly crispy without being burned.  Overall, it's a great breakfast spot if you're looking for something simple and satisfying.As for lunch, I had a cobb salad the other day that was pretty tasty.  I usually like my salads to come with more of a leafy green lettuce, but they do give you a good amount of avocado and bacon so all is well in the universe.  What really stole the show for me, though, were their french fries!! If you're a lover of fresh cut french fries then you have to come and give these fries a try.  They come in regular salted or you can upgrade to garlic or blue cheese.  Service can be a bit slow during breakfast, but everyone is super friendly and accommodating.  One time, my hubby ordered his meal with substitutions and somehow it got screwed up.  Luckily, the server quickly took care of it.  They even gave him extra sausage, which he said was delicious.I'm so glad Dad's is back! It's nice to have a great neighborhood restaurant right down the street.  Next up--biscuits and gravy!  Yeah boyeeee!!!!
<review# 1302,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2010,5/30/2010,71,64,8,8,5>Please feel pity for me.  I grew up in Riverside County (aka the armpit of Southern CA) where there was no such thing as Ethiopian food.  In fact, I doubt most people in Riverside County know that there is a country named Ethiopia or where it is located.  Anyways, when I went to visit my friend who went to UCLA he introduced me to this magical cuisine of stews and pastes.Fast forward to now.  Here I am living a few blocks away from Queen Sheba, my magic Ethiopian retreat.  Tonight I had the pleasure to go here and order my usual, the Vegetarian Combo.  It comes with a medley of greens, lentils, cabbage, potatoes, and more.  I also ordered the sambusa lentil wrap as an appetizer.  If you like savory, flavorful foods, give this a shot.  Honestly, it's not for everyone.  I will confide that I am partial to Ethiopian food and have never been to an Ethiopian place I haven't liked.  It's just that good.WARNING:  It is so good you will be stuffing injera bread in your face at an ungodly rate.  Slow down cuz that bread is like a sponge and will expand in your stomach.  Besides never having Ethiopian food I've disliked I've never had left an Ethiopian Restaurant without a massive stomach ache.  It's cool with me because this food is soooo tasty.
<review# 1303,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2010,5/29/2010,175,211,6,4,6>I want to say thank you to the Mix for a great night!  My friend & I arrived a little before 11pm for a private party.  The guy at the front door was super friendly and found our names on the list.  He then escorted us to the front desk where we were greeted again.  We then got another escort to the elevator and then to our party.  The bottle service was set up and we had the back of the lounge all to ourselves.  It was pretty packed.  We walked around the lounge to check it out & in turn, did a few turns on the dance floor.The Mix has always had a nice vibe.  Good drinks and mature crowd.  The only contention I've had in the past was the music they played.  I understand we are in our 30's & 40's respectively, but there is only so much Brass Monkey ala Beastie Boys & flashbacks of house parties from days gone by that a girl can take!  This night though, the music was so much better...I have no complaints!I've heard it called a cougar den and although I'm not of "cougar" age yet, so be it!Great night with good friends!
<review# 1304,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/14/2010,5/28/2010,472,178,15,12,10>The naan was so fresh it actually burned my fingers!!! This is a good thing!!! I had the Vegetable Korma Thali lunch special, which came with naan, dal, rice, another side of curry and some mixed vegetables in spices.HOLY CRAP MAN! It was so much food I looked at it and was like "omg there is no way I can finish that." Then the angels came down from on high and said, "my dear, yes you can finish that" and I did. Gotta do what the Indian food angels say, right? Anyway, the Vegetable Korma is a creamy cashew curry with cauliflower, carrots, onions, peas, and potatoes.  The vegetables still retained some crispness, which I admire because it's so easy to overcook a freaking vegetable nowadays and have them mush all together as one soupy glob. I slathered my rice with everything on the plate and was using my naan as a spoon.. lol. The waitress kept asking if everything was okay and I was like in pain from shoveling the trough full of food in my mouth and I probably had curry and potato bits at the corners of my mouth with a pained look on my face that you only would see at a hot-dog eating contest... "yes... is good... is all good.... I so full...."Huge vegetarian section, even bigger than the regular entree section I think. Entrees are between 10 and 12 bucks, but you get a lot of food... the lunch special I had was 11 bucks and I almost couldn't finish it all.I kinda wish I sat at a table instead of the bar because the chairs were really pretty and looked very comfortable!Parting words:"I wanna dip my naan in it"

<review# 1306,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2009,5/26/2010,179,181,3,8,8>This place is pretty under-represented as far as Yelp reviews go, but don't be misled. It seems midtown has a low-key powerhouse in its midst, and I'd like to add to the buzz. This review is specifically for Linda, one of the nail technicians at White Orchids. I won't lie: When I found out how much it would cost for a mani/pedi ($85 plus tip), I really wanted to cancel and see if I could find a cheaper place. Fortunately for me, I only have this done twice a year and because I'm too lazy, I took a chance and hoped the benefits would outweigh the costs. Boy, did they ever. Short story: Linda is AWESOME. Long story: It may have taken 2.5 hours (and I had no idea that much time had passed until I left the place), but I walked away with the smoothest, finest manicure and pedicure I've had in years. Linda is uber friendly, but she worked HARD to make sure my hands and feet are in optimal condition, as well as asking questions to make sure I'm satisfied with what she's doing. Plus I'm lazy when it comes to my extremities, and therefore I have a lot of dry, dead-skin build up and semi-wonky nails, and she tackled all of it without a second thought. My only "complaint" is that the services are more pricey than I hoped for, but they are worth it thanks to the massage, treatments, and personal attention which were lavished upon me in addition to the standard nail fare. Thanks, Linda!
<review# 1307,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2010,5/25/2010,39,85,2,5,3>I had just recommended Magpie to a girlfriend of mine to pick as her date destination which made me realize that I never reviewed Magpie on Yelp! Tsk tsk. I have been a fan of Magpie Catering for quite some time. I have had their food at various events and have always loved them. They KNOW how to work greens! Mmm...The night that I had gone was for a birthday dinner celebration. It was a GREAT celebration. Since you order at the counter, it makes it easy for large groups to dine together. Love the exposed brick and cozy feeling of Magpie. Love that they have a variety of seating options - bar, high top tables, regular tables, etc.We had ordered: mussels in a vermouth cream sauce, roasted herb potatoes, artichoke hearts, side of braised winter greens and we got some Indian spice ice cream as a surprise! I got the barbera from St. Helena...so good! Everything was so amazingly delicious and in season, I was in love. We even had to order more bread to sop up the delicious mussel juice and the olive oil from the braised greens. They know their food and they know customer service. Highly HIGHLY recommended for both locals and when entertaining guests!
<review# 1308,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/18/2010,5/24/2010,101,103,10,6,7>What can I say that hasn't already been said before? Hmmm, well I've never been asked so 'nicely' to leave from a restaurant before.  A very sweet young waitress with a very big smile on her face, asked as politely as possible that we leave our table. Why you ask? Because they are very busy & people are wating. Hmphhhh!Ramen was quite tasty (after I spiced it up a fair amount), I enjoyed that & a half very generous salad for $4.50 (great deal!!!).My date gave me a very important tip before we ordered.  If you find yourself bored with your dining companion you can always start reading the history of ramen posted on the walls but be careful because he might notice...
<review# 1309,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/21/2012,3/19/2013,156,217,7,10,11>I've had my chilango-dar set to sensitive for some time, and it was blippin' pretty furiously last time I drove down north Watt Avenue. El Chilango Taqueria has moved into the spot formerly occupied by Taqueria y Pasteleria San Marcos behind the UPS Store in the Arcade Square Shopping Center (which is anchored by a Grocery Outlet). Tortas Chilangas are their specialty, and pambazos and gorditas en estilo de D.F. are the other chilango delights that stick out on the menu.On my first visit, my girlfriend and I split a torta called the "guapachoso", and we each had one taco al pastor. "Guapachoso" confounds the Google-translator, but I've learned that it relates to lithe and lively tropical rhythms. I'm not so sure what's so tropical about this torta, but when you split it in two, it's the right serving size if you wanna enjoy the full flavor combination of milanesa and pierna (pork leg) plus two types of gooey cheese and still be lithe and lively.Typically, any torta combining milanesa with another meat makes for muy messy munching and mucho slippage along the x-axis between the meats, each lubricated in their own grease. But El Chilango's guapachoso was incredibly drama-free. It stayed completely composed despite its fulsome ingredients. Yet, its bolillo buns were not billowy pillows of bad carbs. They were really rather svelte, but certainly spongy enough to aid in keeping the torta structurally sound 'til the last bite. The milanesa itself was remarkable for its edibility, too. Often, milanesa can be a little tough and chewy and the main culprit for torta contents to become dislodged as your incisors try to tear through it, but El Chilango's milanesa was tender from edge to edge.The tacos al pastor were good, though not truly exceptional. If you might like Chando's adobada better without the bits of pineapple, maybe these tacos would be a worthy alternative for the same price.Although El Chilango is only a taqueria and not also a pasteleria, there is one sweet treat on the menu which looks eminently enticing....churros with ice cream. In the picture, it looked like a deluxe banana split with churros instead of bananas, plus a sauce of Mexican chocolate drizzled on top.I've got this dessert plus those gorditas en estilo de D.F. on my list for next time. If that pans out, then certainly El Chilango is not only an excellent taqueria for this area, it might be worth a visit from halfway across the entire Sac Metro area from time to time!
<review# 1310,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2012,3/18/2013,451,183,11,10,13>I just had to give an update to remind everyone how much I love this store! There are only like 3 stores in midtown that can still sell singles. This store happened to have its license to sell individuals before the ban came to the midtown area. I am not sure that the other 2 mentioned are still around...Peace Market has seemed to survive the failing economy keeping people happy with a solution to their depression while being broke, unemployed and needing a reason to carry on the day. That is much easier to to do when mucho intoxicated!!!They have singles of Sierra Nevada, Rogue, Crispin (all my favs) on the shelves, ready for consumption! (yep, all tall bottles)  And of course, the good ole classic 40s- Mickeys, Old E, High Gravity...They also seem to find whatever newer yummy candy bars are out and carry those too. Peace Market- my love for you grows stronger with every visit.
<review# 1311,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/5/2012,3/17/2013,223,238,4,12,5>Yay I'm so happy that Oscars opened up close to my work and opens at 7AM (great place to get an awesome breakfast burrito. The location is close to the freeway and shares a building with squeeze inn (across the street from Grand Central). Inside the décor is very clean and bright with 10 or so tables around the restaurant.  They moved here due to renovations on the original site (Across the street from McClatchy).Like the Sacramento location the food does not disappoint. I personally like the California burrito it's hefty, cheap and fantastic. The food costs around the same as a meal from your local fast food joint which makes this place a great choice compared to picking up some McD's, Carls etc etc. The service is friendly and quick; even though the place was packed my order came up in about 6ish minutes. While waiting for my food I overheard that they plan to open up the drive through in the future. The only bad thing is that my will power is going to be tested and I'm going to have to refrain myself from eating here. (I'm on a diet).**EDIT/UPDATE: I went for breakfast this morning and they said that the drive thru would be used for as a pick up for phone orders. (makes sense because food can take a while since it's made on the spot)
<review# 1312,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/28/2012,3/16/2013,130,389,6,11,8>I think I just walked into macaroon heaven.This place was calling my name one evening and I decided to drive here on a Friday night after work for some sweets for the first time.Walk in literally two steps into the shop and you're showcased with a galore of macaroons and chocolates. This place is super tiny, let alone the kitchen behind, but I guess it's enough space for Ginger to whip up her magic. I wanted their snickerdoodle flavor considering I tried them at a potluck at work -  but didn't notice any macaroon trays with signs reading "snicker doodles." So I asked the sweet gal behind the counter if they had anymore in the back. Apparently flavors are rotated every 7 months and I just so happen to miss last seasons flavors. (I guess that's what I get for holding out on coming here so long.) So I settled for a mixture of chocolate ganache, almond and vanilla cranberry. Vouching for everyone else's review about this place; yes, these are the BEST macaroons ever - very soft, fresh, delectable and sweet. Instant gratification at first bite. These little goodies would pair very well with a cup of coffee or latte. My favorite? It's got to be the original macaroon flavor - almond. I'm very impressed at Ginger's artwork. She definitely has a keen eye for detail and presentation. These delectables can be a pricey dessert. They are $1.75 for one macaroon, but I'd say indulge and put in your order because they're worth every penny. (and plus, how often would you be coming here anyway?)Please do come and try. You won't be let down, I promise.
<review# 1313,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2012,3/15/2013,291,553,6,15,10>My boyfriend and I visited Thir13en on a second saturday.  The place wasn't too busy around 6:30 p.m., but there were a few other tables filled already.  We didn't have a reservation, so we sat at the community table.  (I think it's pretty cool that actually have a community table, unfortunately, no one else came while we were eating.)  The restaurant itself isn't too big, but there is an adequate amount of seating.  It has a nice vibe to it and the place is sort of dimly lit.  Everyone we interacted with was very personable and helpful, as well.  Now, on to the food:-Mac and Cheese appetizer ($10): this is a huge portion, and can easily be an entree.  My boyfriend and I decided to share everything family style, and the waiter was happy to bring us extra plates.  The blend of the several cheeses made for a nice, creamy mac and cheese.  The pasta held the cheese perfectly and the overall taste was unlike anything I'd ever had before.  It had a deep, somewhat holiday-spice/warmth to it.  Plus, the breadcrumbs make for a nice "crust."-Harvest salad ($9): a simple, yet perfectly balanced salad.  The mixed greens were very fresh, and I really liked the pine nuts for a little crunch.  The thin slices of cheese were a nice accompaniment and the dressing was not too heavy at all.-Pasta bolognese ($19): Pappardelle was nicely al dente and the duck and pork ragu was very flavorful.  It was really hearty and my boyfriend and I only ate about half of it- the portion was huge.  I think that this dish seemed extra special because this seems like a dish that I wouldn't normally make at home, or a dish that I wouldn't even necessarily see at other restaurants.  It was very tasty.After a wonderful dinner, I can say that I am eager to come back and try out their lunch and brunch.  The prices are very fair and the portions are much larger than I would have guessed.  All of the dishes are beautifully presented and it seems like a perfect place for a date, or even a casual meal.  The waiter consistently came by to refill our waters and check up on us.  At the same time, he didn't rush us at all.  Notes:-We didn't order any drinks, but the bartender seemed to be really friendly and when a lady asked for "something fruity," he was eager to create something for her.-Street parking was pretty easy at night.

<review# 1315,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2012,3/13/2013,1211,148,7,42,25>To tell you the truth, it's quite difficult for me to even write this review. But I'm hoping it would be of use for those who may one day go through the same thing I had to endure this past week. This recent Wednesday, I got a phone call from my father that Keekee, our family pet for the past 12 years have passed on. I rushed to the house to see her, and I just immediately fell apart. I couldn't believe she was really gone, and I'm still trying to register it now. She was old and I have made peace with the fact that she may be leaving us any day. But the whole process was still very difficult to cope with. My family and I knew we wanted to get her cremated. But she was my first real dog. And the first one ever to leave me. None of us had any idea what we were doing. I went on yelp and typed in "pet crematory". There were two results that popped up for me. This being one of the two. None had any reviews so that wasn't helpful. I then searched on Google. This one popped up again. So I went on their website to get more information. I was a bit frantic and insane at this point. I didn't even bother sitting still to read anything. I just wanted the contact number for the place. It's a family owned and operated business. The couple are Cindy and Jeff. I called the first number on the site and Cindy picked up. She answered all of my questions like how much it's going to cost and gave me a good idea of how these things work. Basically all of the information I would have if I had looked through their very helpful website. But still, she was patient and nice about it.It was already past 8:00 in the evening and we live quite far from the place. But when I spoke on the phone with Jeff, he told me that it was okay if we wanted to drop her off the same night. I was so grateful! Their place was located in the country side. If Jeff hadn't parked his pick-up truck along the road with his blinkers on, there would've been no way to tell that it was the right place. It just looks like any other house along the dark and quiet road. But it's all right because we got all the help we needed from them. Jeff showed us where to pull up and he lifted Keekee's body from our trunk onto this metal table with wheels. He pushed it into the crematory room and pulled down the garage-like door almost all the way. This was a very quick process. Her body wasn't weighed out like I thought it would be. We then followed him into the house to take a look at the different boxes of urn to pick out the one we wanted for her. There were a couple of different choices. And the ones we were limited to of course depended on the weight of our dog. They also have different types of wood options. We chose the red cherry wood box with a frame slot for Keekee. He gave us some paperwork. It was to fill out her name, birth date, date of death, family's last name, and a few brief words for her along with my contact information. I really appreciate the fact that he was very honest with us. This whole time, since the moment I called them with questions over the phone, I thought Keekee was at least 100lbs. If she was 100-120lbs it would cost $200 (including the urn). When I asked him if it's $200, he told me she doesn't weigh that much and said that it would only be $175. He asked us if we'd like to pay then or the day we pick up her urn. I thought that was weird, but in a nice way how they didn't demand payment right away. We paid him that night and was told that it should be ready on Friday or any day after. My dad picked up her urn yesterday morning, and I finally got to see it last night. The urn was very nice and I love that there was the whole picture slot. We didn't know how to take it out to place the picture in though. I didn't want to mess with it and risk breaking her urn. So I tweaked with the photo and inserted it the ghetto way. (Hey, It works just fine okay...) Afterall, Keekee did grew up in the HOOD. I'm sure she wouldn't mind...Underneath the picture on a golden plate is her name in big print. Above it is the line we picked out. And under it is the date she passed away.We'll love you foreverKEEKEE09/26/12They gave us the certificate of her cremation, signed and dated by Jeff. They even gave us a copy of the "Rainbow Bridge" poem. It has been really tough lately, but I'm so glad I chose out the right place for Keekee. Losing your beloved companion is truly like losing a close family member. I'd really like to give a big thank you to Precious Paws and Claws for making the whole process a bit easier on all of us.
<review# 1316,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2012,3/12/2013,141,309,,18,11>I had my wedding reception in the penthouse lounge last June. As the first couple to officially book a reception here, I wanted to pass on the essential information! I had been scouring the internet for days trying to find the right venue for my husband and I to host a reception in Sacramento. The vast majority were far outside our budget, and the others were - how do I say this nicely? - quite shabby-looking. I was disappointed, as I wanted a venue that matched our personalities, but I wasn't willing to spend more.My husband found this venue listed on the Venue Vixens website and sent them an inquiry about prices and availability; we set up a meeting that week.I was astounded to find out that when you use their catering company and reach a certain very low minimum amount, there is NO rental fee. That's right! The venue was free! A sexy, urban-distressed penthouse on two floors with incredible views - for free.We booked immediately and got to planning. Because it's only been open as a tasting room for about a year, it was pretty rough in some areas. Between the months when we booked and when we hosted, they continued to do a lot of work, updating furniture, hanging a new chandelier, and retrofitting the door to the patio. We planned a LOT to change up the other things we weren't so crazy about. The 13th floor, when you get off the elevator, was much rougher than the top floor, so we hung lights and a chandelier and brought in lots of flowers and decorations to spruce it up. We also brought in some draping, more uplights, and more decorations for the top floor, though that floor is already beautiful in its own right.Michael Chandler, one of the owners of Rail Bridge who also runs their catering company, was the man we interacted with the most. He was AMAZING and so helpful. He gave us the key to the penthouse for the entire day for set up, and we were able to clean up the next day. This is just about unheard of in the world of weddings!Now I feel like I'm rambling, so let me get a bit more organized for anyone considering renting for an event:VENUE: Beautiful and versatile. It will hold, between the two floors and balcony, up to ~100 people comfortably for standing room. For a seated event, it might be ~50, though that's harder to estimate. There are two stalls in each restroom. Be warned that there are only stairs between the 13th and 14th floors, so it could be difficult for handicapped persons. They are working on building an elevator.SERVICE: Impeccable. All the servers for food and wine were so accommodating.FOOD: AMAZING. We set a per-person budget for heavy hors d'ouvres  (much less than most restaurants would charge), made our own menu with their help, AND THEY BEAT OUR OWN PRICE. That's right - I told him a per person price we could afford, and he countered back by telling me it would be $7 per person less than what I asked for. Crooked businesses would've just taken the money and gone with it. Also, Michael was training his staff to cook and serve lamb for another event they were having shortly after, so he cooked up some the night of my event and served it to our guests - they raved about it! We ended up with fruit, bruschetta, cheese, olives, pizzas, meatballs, raviolis, mushrooms, clams, and so much more. Everyone was full and happy, even with diet restrictions.WINE: Delicious and very affordable. I love buying local wine and it's just icing on the cake that it tastes so good. They even gave us a discount for buying in bulk. They charge per bottle and only open one of each bottle at a time, so we didn't end up paying more for the bartenders opening multiple bottles ahead of time. We just did beer and wine for our reception, and they let us choose the type of beer and if it was bottled or from a keg.OWNERS: Awesome from beginning to end. They know their stuff and have done MANY events here, both big and small. They're extremely accommodating and professional and still fun. During our first meeting, when we talked over the venue details and did a little wine tasting, they sent us home with multiple bottles that were open, for free. Happy Julie :)VALUE: Unreal. I'm still pinching myself for how lucky we were to have found this venue and for what we spent on it.I admit there were a few smaller things that made me nervous at the time. For example, the door to the patio was literally hanging on one hinge, and I was afraid it would fall on a guest; I had to pester them to fix it, but they came through in the end and it was in top shape. There were also a few emails that I had to resend before I could get a response back from them, but I know they're crazy busy running this business. Really, that was about it! Everything else was smooth as butter.Now that the venue's becoming more popular in Sac, they might up the prices, and I wouldn't blame them - it's worth it!
<review# 1317,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2013,3/11/2013,171,43,12,19,17>La Bombe is cute, small, different and a date night must. Want to take your significant other to Gunther's ice cream for a scoop but don't want to wait in line? Go to La Bombe instead! They serve Gunther's popular flavors by the scoop or by the sandwich even, that's right...your favorite flavor of ice cream between bakery fresh cookies. Yum! What I like most about La Bombe is its French & Italian pizazz. What is a Bombe you ask? A Bombe, also called bombe glacée, is a dessert of ice cream lined or filled with custard, cake crumbs, etc. A bombe in English, is an ice cream dessert frozen in a spherical mould so as to resemble a cannonball, hence the name. La Bombe serves their mini bombes on yummy Italian wafer cookies called Pizzelles, which are a delicious crunchy addition in my book. They have mini bombes $5.95 each, in an array of flavor combinations, that are perfect for one person by itself or to share with your date. They also sell larger bombs to serve multiple people that are great for entertaining. So far I have tried the Napoleon and the Colonial, both were amazing. My fiancé cant seem to get past the Italian bombe to ever order any other flavor beside it, clearly he is a fan.La Bombe also serves soup and sandwiches, perfect for a quick lunch there or to take away with you for a picnic at the very close Mckinley Park. I have not tried the soups or sandwiches yet but the next chance I get, you can bet I will. I can't wait to come back and try a new Bombe flavor and see what else they have to offer on my next visit.

I'm a boozing adult in a booze store. God, I love this place. Did I mention they carry booze here? Booooooze. What the eff? There are large bottles of everything then the tiniest, most adorable (yes, adorable) bottles of booze. Like booze to-go. Except you want to save those bottles until you reach your destination, ya drunk.They have accessories too. What's that you say? You don't want to be trashy and drink your wine from the bottle? They have glasses. Need someone to cork that with? They have those corking things. Need a bag to hide your booze in so you don't feel like a lush? THEY HAVE GIFT BAGS. "To me, love me."Have a boozer in your life? They have wine gift baskets around Christmas. Happy Holiday's, now go get drunk grandpa.And want to tell someone you love them with wine, but want a card to go with it? They have wine themed cards. Who doesn't love a booze themed card WHILE opening booze and then immediately drinking said booze?! No seriously, who doesn't love that...please tell me. This review was not written while drinking. GO HERE.
<review# 1319,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2013,7/22/2013,106,308,5,27,19>I can't explain exactly why this place is so special to me...if you look at the simple facts this place doesn't excite the children as a trip to an amusement park or fancy vacation spot would. But it's a little bit of home. I grew up on 5 acres of land and had the privilege of growing up in the countryside where I spent hours on end in the outdoors. Particularly during the spring months when Northern California's native wild flowers come into bloom.Now that I live in the city, and so do my children, it is difficult to find or afford that kind of lifestyle. The nature walks around Effie Yeaw center allow me to share that with my kids and my daycare kids right here in the middle of the city.Effie Yeaw was a preschool/kindergarten teacher who had a vision for the future. She saw how urban sprawl was taking over the land, and fought to preserve this area for future generations to enjoy as she did with her students. What an amazing woman to have known. I wish I could've spoken to her in person.  I would tell her thank you for being so proactive and how I much fun people have coming here.Effie Yeaw has a building that hosts animals that needed rescuing, a small gift shop, and a display room with information that is both interesting for adults and smaller children. However, the real fun is when you take a map and start exploring the trails. The main trail is easy to follow and takes you in a short circle. But there's some interesting side trails that take you outside of the main area. You will see and hear many animals along the way including birds, squirrels, wild turkey, and deer.I also immensely enjoy the events that they continually put on. Effie Yeaw has two or three naturalist on staff. They lead nature walks with cool information and activities.  Check the calendar on their website before you go for the times. It's a much more fun trip when you schedule around these events.On a side note: parking is $5 for a daily pass. You may purchase this pass at the ranger station on your way into the county park- Ancil Hoffman (bring exact change to put in an envelope if ranger not there). Or you can park at the Effie Yeaw center and purchase a pass at the gift shop.$50 for a 12 month pass will give you unlimited parking passes to all County parks. Or if you plan on only really coming to this park, I recommend becoming a member for $40 and the proceeds go towards helping keep the park open. It also provides daily parking passes for free for a year and discounts on classes.
<review# 1320,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2013,7/21/2013,199,139,10,8,7>14 napkins! That's how many I used during my dinner tonight. I may have ordered a fat-boy meal-- but I had to keep the ketchup, mayo, and grease from getting on my clothes. There is something about this place that brings back fond memories for me. There was a Nation's within walking distance of my high school, and I used to go to that location quite a bit- until they closed down. When I heard I was moving back to California, I had to find out if there was a Nation's nearby. Found it! Man, I couldn't pull in that parking lot fast enough. In fact, I cutoff a police officer just to beat him into the restaurant. Their burgers come standard with a 3/4 lb patty piled high with lettuce, tomato, onions, and their house dressing. I am not sure, but it taste like miracle whip to me. I ordered the cheeseburger (American cheese) with no onions. I had to say no when the lady at the counter asked if I wanted bacon on my burger. I felt guilty enough knowing I was about to eat more than I should. I also noticed that you can add green chile to your burger. Since I know I will be back weekly- I will make sure I try that on my next visit. The fries were hot, fresh, and salted perfectly. My only small complaint was that they were a little too greasy. For dessert,  I opted for a slice of banana cream pie. The pie crust was delicious, and the bananas were not overripe. The was plenty of whip cream over the top-- (enough to make you wish you didn't eat that entire burger for dinner). For me, it doesn't get much better than this. A fresh made-to-order burger that drips juices all down your face and arms -- what more can you ask for?  More napkins -I guess.
<review# 1321,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/3/2013,7/20/2013,106,90,9,15,13>This past experience makes it hard for me to come back simply because if you have a party of 9 or more, you'll be sitting in 2 different tables. I came here for my birthday with my family and there was 10 of us total and 6 of us sat at one table and the other 4 sat at the table across from the other.  They still charge 18% gratuity even though we we had 2 tables, 2 servers, 2 separate checks that they couldn't cash out together.  We ordered cactus blossom and fried pickles for appetizer and was passing it back and forth between the tables and had to yell at one another to hear what the other table was saying. Not exactly a good way to try to ask my nephews and nieces how school was for the day.For my entree, I ordered the steak and ribs combo w/ a side of seasoned rice and buttered corn.  The steak was a little too salty for my taste but it was juicy and perfectly cooked. However I got so full off the bread and appetizers that it looked like I didn't even touch my entree and had to packed more than half of it to go which is a shame because steaks are never the same the next day.
<review# 1322,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2013,7/19/2013,570,275,15,16,17>I love this place! Cake batter and tart flavors? A ton of topping treats? A ROOT BEER FOUNTAIN FOR FLOATS? You bet your bottom I'll be back!There are so many choices here, which consistently change, so you'll never get bored. They're all delicious which makes for serious choosing conundrums. The kona coffee tasted just like real ice cream deliciousness as if it were packed with calories. Best part? It WASN'T packed full of calories! Winning!Ever want cookie dough topping, but the cookie dough is that fake and stale crap? Not here! This cookie dough is legit. In fact, sometimes I load the yogurt low so I can pile on more cookie dough. Don't judge. However, the greatest thing about this place is that they're cheaper than their competitors.  My boyfriend and I walked out with two yogurts, chopped full of toppings, for $3 less than what we normally pay. OH, aaaaaaand they were open on Easter. This place saved my craving that day. I'm definitely looking forward to going back. In fact, maybe I'll go right now...
<review# 1323,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2013,7/18/2013,1070,429,23,18,15>Oh my god, you guys! I'm getting married in six months! Eeee!That's right, come October, Devon F. will become Devon S. Hooray!All of this wedding planning makes me hungry, and nothing hits the spot quite like Taqueria El Burrito. It is far and away the BEST burrito joint in Davis, and I find myself here at least once a week to get my fix and break away from the craziness that is my life.(Seriously, cake-cutting fee? What the hell is that about?)A super burrito here will set you back about $6, and is full of tasty ingredients that manage to be both fresh and greasy. Taqueria's cooks wrap the burrito correctly, and it's insane to me that it's the only place in town that knows how to do it so that none of the ingredients fall out upon first bite. It's open late for quick stops on the way home from the bars, and they make a valiant attempt at carne asada fries. But alas, with my impending nuptials and a body-hugging white dress I snapped up not too long ago, Taqueria will be on the "No-Go" list soon enough. I'm pretty sure 1200 calories full of tortilla/bean/cheese/meat/guac/rice awesomeness is not gonna help me in achieving a photo-worthy figure.I keep pushing back my self-imposed "last month to have a burrito" because they're just so damn good. They have a Frequent Buyer card, which is super not helping the situation, but I'm hoping to have it full before I cut off burritos for realsies the month before the big day.Unless, of course, my fiance brings me home a surprise burrito like the good man he is. What an enabler. :)
<review# 1324,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/1/2013,7/17/2013,213,318,5,12,11>NYE! we had so much fun here last night and my dinner was so amazing, I felt the need to write this review the next day! Chicken wings (half dozen 10 bucks), the largest and most original wings I've ever had. They had the wing and drum attached, which made for fun and messy eating. Great tang to the sauce, and large amount of meat for the price. -another 10 seconds in the fryer and they would be perfect.Cubana (10 bucks), chicken sandwich, with mojo marinated, chicken breast; served & garlic citrus vinaigrette....it was tender juicy and fantastic. Gold Rush (12 bucks), smoked pepper crusted Niman Ranch beef, topped with bacon mac-n-cheese, applewood smoked bacon, & grilled onions. I must say this burger was OUT OF THIS WORLD, unique, risky and interesting! better than any other burger in town.Most beers only 5 bucks, huge portions and double cut fries that were very high quality. I must say, I was surprised the food and service were great since this place has a "dive bar" feel (which is another reason I love it!)...Ask for Natasha as your server, she was super nice, funny and attentive.,,
<review# 1325,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2013,7/16/2013,61,271,5,20,11>I heard about this new Russian foods store from a couple of coworkers.Apparently, it's only been open for about 3 weeks.   The deli meats section was what drew me.   The Kalabosy (hunters' sausage) was my main object, but there were several other sausage items that tempted me.The store is large.  It's located in the same expanded parking lot as the Sam's Club.  ( There used to be a Big Lots in the building, I think.)Prices are generally good.   (A few items were comparably priced like at Koreana Plaza International Market.)There are so many interesting food items!For example:  the rose petal jellies, the giant ginger cookies big enough for several people to share, the large boneless hams shaped like a piglet (fully cooked...just brown in the oven and serve), and the chocolates/candies aisle!  Not sure what kind of fish "sprats" are, but they seem to be very popular with their customers.   One huge section of canned fish was stocked with an astounding variety of canned sprats.I noted that they have a lot of jarred tomatoes there.  If someone wanted to buy tomatoes packed in glass jars rather than in cans, this would be a good place to find jarred tomatoes.There are three chest-sized freezers, each with a different stock of frozen hand-made raviolis:  Beef & pork, chicken, and veal and pork..  We took home some of the veal & pork raviolis for dinner.  They are delicious! The fillings are very lean.  Even the cold leftovers tasted good the following day.The store is still a work in progress. There's a baked goods counter, a produce counter, and a deli meats section, currently.   There's a whole wall on the left side of the store that is still being assembled.  They stay open until 9PM on most days.
<review# 1326,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/10/2013,7/15/2013,296,61,3,10,11>This business is the exact definition of a hole-in-a-wall restaurant as I almost walk by it.  You can tell the business has limited resources as you see the outdated decor and uninviting ambiance and service.  Nonetheless, it was one of the few eateries open at 10 am in the area.Must say their menu items are your  typical Asian lunch items ranging from terrikaki chicken combo plate to pho. Faded unappealing pictures of these item are hung from the walls.  I had ordered their terriaki pork Vietnamese sandwich which was a restaurant quality sandwich with plenty of pickle daikon, carrots, cilantro, and pork in good size baguette. Very good portions considering it was $4 and tasty. I had ordered the terryaki chicken combo another day.  This dish was favorable as the chicken was cooked perfectly, nicely charred and grill, moist with a good flavor.  The fried rice and noodles was suprisingly good considering their was nothing in it.  In the picture the rice had canned carrots and peas, mine had none of that stuff (as if that would have made it better).  The chowmein was just noodles seasoned as well.  Goes to show you, hot off the wok is much better than steam plate at a supermaket.
<review# 1327,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2013,7/14/2013,397,268,3,6,9>Thanks to a Yelp Elite event held here, Monsoon is now one of my favorite new spots in Sacramento. Alex was right when he said "you may never eat at another Indian restaurant in Sacramento again". The atmosphere is fun, the service is awesome and the food is so yummy!My first visit to Monsoon was for Yelp's Bollywood elite party. I was definitely impressed by the restaurant itself, a huge bar area surrounded by plenty of seating and gorgeous chandeliers, but I was even more impressed by the service. The staff at Monsoon handled our large party with ease and kept the food trays come out and the drinks flowing all night long. The best part was that the food was amazing! Platters of chicken tikka, lamb naan, and vegetable pakoras were passed around and everything was delicious!Since then, my husband and I have made Monsoon one of our regular date night spots. The food and the service are consistently amazing. The portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable. As Danielle said its definitely a "Midtown must". What I really love about Monsoon is that it really has the best of everything; great atmosphere, the best Indian food in the area, great prices and super friendly service.
<review# 1328,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2013,7/13/2013,136,72,5,10,9>Phenomenal. You will enjoy whatever you order here. Great authentic recipes. You can just taste the love in each bite. You can't help but to feel like family as you enjoy your meal. You know its bad when I have to convince someone in the office to drive from North Sacramento just to pick up lunch because another place just wont do. You wont be disappointed. At least I haven't been. Family owned and the food quality is consistent at both locations. My favorites are the burritos and the salsa but between myself and my office we have tried EVERYTHING on the menu. If you get the super burrito....just see for yourself. You can make it more than one meal or split it with someone.  Are you hungry yet?
<review# 1329,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/26/2008,2/10/2009,17,41,10,6,6>This place loses one star because I never seem to remember the end of the evening...and I'm sure it was worth remembering if I was here.  This seems to be the go to bar for a great time.  The lounge singer is just cheesy enough without being lame, and the drink.....phew...STIFF!Note: when gleefully walking out the front door of the Back Door...remember...the alley way is slick.  If you don't remember this you could fall directly on your arse TWICE when going outside.
<review# 1330,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/13/2008,2/8/2009,1134,510,9,14,6>One price, one massage, one hour.  $20.  What's not to love?  Be aware that the massage therapists are pretty rough.  I think I was in a police hold at one point.  It's a good thing I like it rough!  Seems they used more accupressure and sports massage techniques.  It was good.  The place is clean, plays video of underwater or floral scenes, and is mostly quiet until the staff start carrying on a conversation with each other while working out your kinks.   I could also hear the microwave beeping in the background, but even worse, I could smell the shrimp that was being heated up.  Not very relaxing.  But, hey, for $20, it's all tolerable.   English is definitely the second language here,  but the female hostess said you can tell them to be "gentle" and they would understand.  You get a nice warm foot soak and they offer you hot tea or water.  You sit in a recliner that converts to a massage table, which is lined up in a row of about half a dozen others.  So don't think you'll be in a private room.  But, geez, for $20....who cares!!!!
<review# 1331,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/9/2008,2/7/2009,41,58,4,4,7>Mason is the man. In five minutes, he took my suggestions, showed me a few pics in a magazine, and then presto - he was on his way to giving me a quality cut. I'm not sure what exactly it was, but I was never as nervous as I usually am when I go to a brand new place to get a haircut. He is very chill and better yet, pretty damn talented. None of the chainsaw-massacre-like approaches with clippers here...instead, he worked like Edward Scissorhands for a solid twenty minutes to give me the cut I wanted. All in all, I ended up with a cut that looked better and better with each passing day and I never regretted going here.  It's just too bad that I can't talk myself into putting this much change into every cut, mainly b/c my hair grows faster than weeds and I need to get it cut literally every 2.5-3 weeks. That being said, if I win the lottery, or finish my training (whichever comes first), I'll be sure to dedicate my winnings to the Magic Salon, a very worthy cause indeed.
<review# 1332,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2008,2/6/2009,28,47,3,7,8>Cookie's hit the spot today! Went with a coworker for lunch and we were both very happy with our shakes. Im cool with them using frozen yogurt instead of ice cream, makes for smoother sipping. I also had the Rodeo Burger with everything which was big but not too huge and came on a really good bun. If you want a good burger and shake without any drama this is your spot.
<review# 1333,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2009,2/5/2009,24,143,12,13,12>Only in Sacramento would someone have to drive 20 minutes for Vietnamese food. Argh, so off to the dirty south (Sac) we had go!  Still tired from the night before, we all stumbled in and were politely greeted by a waiter.  We had our choice of tables and sat near a fancy new LCD that was playing Paris By Night 143654 (I mean really, who knows what volume they are on by now!)  Hrm, which brings me to the decor at Pho Hien Vuong which was rather impressive for it's clean, modern appeal with a slight home-y atmosphere.  But enough with that, let's talk food. The Spring Rolls (Goi Cuon) were good but nothing to get crazy about.  And while everyone else ordered some variation of pho, I did get a 'lil crazy and ordered the Pork & Seafood Tomato Noodle Soup (Bun Rieu Cua).  Well, it was absolutely delicious and the flavor of the broth was very close to my Momma's.  I washed it all down with a Lemonade Soda (Soda Chanh) which was nice and tart, yet sugary and sweet all at the same time.  This area is heavy on the traffic front due to all the neighboring businesses, but Pho Hien Vuong has a large parking lot with plenty of spaces.  Service was attentive, polite and friendly.  Though there was customer sitting in the corner talking to himself, our dining experience was enjoyable.  (Vietnamese establishments aren't complete without a little bit of drama.)  And the food hit all our yummy food spots just right. Mmhmm,. you really can't ask for more. P.S. I use a lot of parentheses because I have a lot of side thoughts, ok? :)
<review# 1334,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2008,2/4/2009,1,17,1,8,5>They opened a week ago.  I've been there three times since then.  Twice for take-out, once for eat-in.The owner greets everyone with enthusiasm.  It's a tiny spot worth exploring, between the big grocery store and Jamba Juice in Loehmann's Plaza.  He gave me a pile of kim chee to taste.  When I detected Ko Chi Chung as one of the ingredients, his face lit up!  It is a sweetish taste rather than the acidic taste one usually associates with kim chee.My order?  Korean short ribs, tofu teriyaki, and a bowl of kim chee.  Yummerookies, is all I can say.  I dipped into the ribs on the way home and nearly drove off the road!  Next day went to get food for a friend whom I was picking up from the airport at 11pm.  A midnight snack.  The next day my friend called to say it was wonderful - especially the yellow fin sushi.Last night took my discriminating 23-year-old son for eat-in.  He loved the Thai chicken, was surprised at the amount of food, but would have liked a bit more rice.  He is going to take his friends there, since prices are much less than the usual sushi place.  Our two dinners were just over $20, including the $2.50 for the kim chee.  The owner gave us a 15% discount for being a frequent customer.  The receipt has 15% discount printed on it for the next visit (may be for first few days).Food arrived hot and quickly, and was mighty tasty.  Go, go, quickly!
<review# 1335,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/24/2008,2/3/2009,14,123,4,10,7>This really is a great little shop. It's pretty small, but I could spend hours in there looking at everything.Last week, I went in looking for something very specific and the guy working immediately knew what I wanted and showed me tons of options. He even went into the back and brought more out for me to choose from. Also, while I was looking around I overheard a conversation that directed me toward another object that couldn't have been more perfect for the person I was shopping for. It was seriously like fate.And about the guy working...wow. You just don't see people like that in customer service a lot. So friendly, so knowledgeable, so helpful. He not only put my purchases in a gift bag since I had mentioned they were a gift, but he also went to the trouble to print out an article about one of the things I bought. Nice!So support fair trade and shopping locally and go to Zanzibar!
<review# 1336,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/16/2008,2/2/2009,95,282,13,7,12>My dearest love,Tonight let's go to Pizza Chicken Love Letter where the chicken is spicy and the pizza is hot.  We can gaze into each others eyes as you drink your enormous beer and I daintily sip my coke.  The romance will continue when we go to the drive in and gaze at the stars during the intermission.Forever yours,Shannon A.
<review# 1337,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2008,2/1/2009,66,86,4,12,11>Just when I thought I was cool for having "discovered" this place... I guess I was two weeks late out of the womb, so I'm destined to be late to everything.The BF have scoured the city for good Thai food in the past few years and have been relatively satisfied with our findings.  After a few months working downtown and countless business lunches, each of us suffered from sort of a Thai numbness.  Boon Boon, however, reawakened our love of Thai.  BF has always loved yellow curry, which he had stopped ordering for a while; Boon Boon does it ALL right, balancing flavors perfectly as a result of painstakingly delicious research at Thai restaurants around the city.  Though we were equally excited about the crab fried rice, we decided against it.  I dallied in the red curry beef.  The rich, complex sauce made me want to stuff myself with curry-soaked rice even after the "good stuff" was gone.I think Asian Fusion is a bit of a misnomer in this case.  I realize that they served Asian food as well as different types of food, but I don't recall any cuisines being fused into single dishes.  What I saw was a variety of dishes from different parts of the world because the chef has a "do what you know" attitude toward serving food.  Apparently, from what I've heard from those who have actually tried the non-Thai food, the chef is learned indeed.The staff is, for lack of better terms, SUPER NICE.  It was a typical May afternoon, and the BF and I had our dog with us.  There was no shade to park under, so instead of moving my car over to the Food Source parking lot, we asked the staff if we could bring the little mutt inside.  They were really cool about it - our waitress set up an umbrella on the patio for lil' doggie to stay under, and when she started barking out of separation anxiety, they didn't break a sweat moving us to a table on the patio.  They even offered a small bowl of water for her to drink out of!  Based on their initial reaction, I'm sure this wasn't standard procedure for them, so I really appreciate their hospitality!
<review# 1338,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2008,1/31/2009,53,209,10,9,9>Bottom line: if this place were any more authentic, a customs agent would search your car as you left the parking lot.  Sacramento, like many cities, is replete with restaurants advertising "Authentic Mexican Food."  If one were to believe most such claims, one could be forgiven for thinking that Mexican food is, in fact, totally unremarkable, composed mainly of grease-laden, insipid meats, gluey refried beans, chips, and salsa.  I checked out Lalo's on a tip, however, because the word is that they have a totally different brand of authenticity going on.  Believe the hype.  Lalo's claim to fame is their "barbacoa estila Hidalgo,"  typical of the central Mexican state of Hidalgo.  They serve it on weekends only, and it definitely draws a crowd.  I'll cut to the chase and say that this stuff is (1) unlike anything I've ever found stateside, and (2) tha friggin' bomb.  Hidalgo-style barbacoa at Lalo's comes in three varieties: the regular barbacoa, i.e. lamb meat, "panza roja" and "panza verde".  My waitress explained that the "panza" consists of "the insides."  Ok, sounds good...but which to choose?  After understandably growing tired of my questions, she offered Whitey a combination of all three so I could try them all.  Sold!!!  The meat is served in a style that is simultaneously unceremonious and totally cool: big scoops of meat arrive cradled in a sheet of heavy-duty foil, topped with a bunch of tortillas and a side of cooked onions.  Eating it requires no explanation: take a tortilla, add meat, with or without fixins, and grub.  At your table you'll find additional topping: bowls of pickled red onions, a red salsa, and an unbelievably vibrant green salsa tasting strongly of cilantro.  I realize that some diners might be put off by the idea of "insides". and indeed you can have the regular barbacoa and eat very well; there's nothing at all wrong with this tender, succulent lamb meat.  However, I'd strongly urge you to step up to the "panza."  I am not exaggerating when I say that both versions are soul-stirring.  The "verde" is flecked with pieces of green chile, while the "roja" has a well-seasoned red chile base which brings to mind a good chorizo.  Heck, order a combo like I did and try them all.  Words are truly failing me in describing how utterly, deeply delicious these are.    Barbacoa aside, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of the unusual delights that Lalo's holds.  Everything emanating from the kitchen looked great.  Even quesadillas, normally the most banal item on any Mexican menu, appear as thoroughly crisped half-moons of masa mounded with shredded lettuce and crema.  I cannot wait to try their tortas, licuados, and aguas frescas as well.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough; it is the sort of local establishment dedicated to great, affordable food that we all should be patronizing.  Trust me, after eating here, you'll feel like you should get 20 lashes and 50 Hail Marys for every time you've gone to Chipotle or Chevy's.  Enough said.
<review# 1339,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/6/2009,4/28/2009,242,141,5,13,10>Anyone who owns a home knows (and particularly those of us who own quirky flat topped homes) that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We recently have been busy taking preventative measures to protect our investment. Our first Big Project was making sure our roof wouldn't leak. This is an ongoing vigilant matter with Eichler owners.Local roofer Hugh Barnes from The Roof Repair Company assessed our roof, came in with some proactive minor repairs and also kindly cleaned our roof and gutters in the process. He resealed all the items on the roof that had penetration flashing with modified mastic and granules, repainted all flashings with aluminum colored paint, and worked on an area that needed repair over our garage. All areas with edges were resealed as well as all areas that were suspect for future leaks. We also invested in a two year roof certification so that in the event the roof leaks he would repair it.I found Hugh and his coworker easy to work with, professional, and competitively priced. They were also very happy to make sure my clumsy butt didn't fall off the roof when I went up to take pictures.Hopefully we won't be needing to make use of our roof certification but if we do, I will report back regarding the outcome.
<review# 1340,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/28/2008,4/27/2009,611,620,5,10,9>This place is awesome!  I had a couple of friends performing in "battle of the bands".  I didn't spend much time in the front section of the doghouse saloon but I did enjoy the kennel club in the back.Awesome sound, tons of seating and a huge bar.  The first drink I was handed was really weak.  My friend asked me how it was and I said, "It tastes like coke."  She grabbed it, brought it back over to the bartender, he dumped out half and filled it with rum = yay.There's a nice sized dance floor in front of the raised stage where the bands perform and a big screen TV that pumps out music videos in-between sets.  Black lighting is always fun.  There's all kinds of craziness, stuffed up into & hanging from the ceiling. Chihuaha's, dingle balls, huge stuffed prizes.  Take a good look around.They have a big fan placed strategically at the front end of the bar. It was a warm July night and it was pretty packed being Saturday. I never felt warm, so between their air system and the fan - the temperature was ideal.There's a big room in the back for those of you that smoke.  That's if you can drag yourself away from all the hot ass, mingling around the bar.My friends won and I'll be back in August for the finals!
<review# 1341,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/31/2009,4/26/2009,903,380,11,12,9>Tasty.  Quite tasty indeed. My friend Rob and I came to the conclusion one Sat afternoon: we needed FOOD and BEER.  I wanted something spicy.  He suggested jalepeno burgers at the Flaming Grill Cafe.  Although he didn't quite sell it, he did mention beer so that's about all I needed to make a decision and check it out.  We sat out by the patio in order to count all the cars with rims passing.  My favorite was the 15 passenger van with rims AND an exhaust system.  The patio has such a endearing, makeshift "let's build a tree house" feel to it.  I noticed what I thought were two pitchers of beer going to a table of two. "Those people are worse than us", I said admiringly,"Two pitchers for two people, right off the bat?"  Rob said, "No, those are just  the tall ones."  NICE!  The tall ones are like 32 oz for as much as a pint costs some places.  Flame Grill has to have the most bizarre combination of micros, domestics, bottles, and cans I've seen.  Shriner, Schlitz? LOL! But there is enough decent ones at cool prices.  And then came the burgers.....The burgers are just some of the better burgers out there. The buns are wonderfully fresh.  The jalepenos in the jalepeno burger DID NOT come from a jar.  (PIC:  yelp.com/biz_photos/ccTW) They are obviously freshly sliced and fused perfectly to the melting cheese.  The meat is glorious.  I got 1/2 pound sirloin, but the buffalo looked great too.  The gabby regular next to us told tales of the 5.99 Philly cheesesteak splendor.  Maybe next time....Basically, my only gripe with this place is there is NOTHING close to it. It's kind of hard to grub, pound a couple ginormous beers, and be on your way from this location but likely that won't stop me from trying because it's good and of great quality for the price.  Do it!
<review# 1342,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/10/2009,4/25/2009,537,1541,2,2,2>This is a very classy, romantic, delicious place to take a date.I would not recommend coming as a large party (greater than 4) because the price of the whole meal for everyone will just become ridiculous.Everything about this place screams elegance and professionalism though. It has a nice entrance, the service staff are very nice, the whole restaurant is nicely lit and decorated creatively, and they take care of you very well.For example, when you eat the bread they give initially, you probably will make a lot of crumbs. The waiter/waitress will come and clean the crumbs from your table with a cool lab spatula-looking thing.When you order a steak, they actually wheel a cart over to you showing you their cuts and sizes of meat. They'll tell you as much detail as you want about the meat like how tender it is or how many people a particular slab will feed.I came here with a date once a while back and we used the dinner-for-two coupon which was a good meal for $100. So we spent about $120 total.We had salad, steak, shrimp, potatoes, and dessert.You'll get full and be satisfied for sure.Bottom line is that the service is phenomenal and the food is excellent. Only bad thing is the high price but that's what you'd expect here.Take a cute date here, maybe on a 3rd or 4th month anniversary, nothing earlier than that.

Had a couple things off the menu, the chorizo omlette is bombay.  Good coffee and they keep it coming.  Definitely a hassel free, let you be you type of place where they don't care how loud you laugh and don't rush you.  The place itself is pretty quirky as you walk like thru the kitchens and the place seems endless, just when you think there's no where to sit...BOOM, another room, let's grub.  Bring cash tho, cuz they don't take credit cards, just some ancient atm.  But the omlettes are so premium, that won't even cost em a star. do it.

I have blisters on my hands thank to you:@)There is a cell phone lot you can use so you don't drive around the airport over and over again (any SFO frustrators out there?)And the restrooms are clean! The security TSA is fast and efficient. The southwest gate has laptop workstations with USB chargers.And one thing I like about the SMF airport is that the shuttle drivers are happy to lend you a hand with all the heavy luggage.  Such friendly service... it evokes the happy emotions of HOME.  Who said NorCal people can't be friendly?

I live in midtown which has more than its fair share a wonderful stores and restaurants of all sorts. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for West Sac, which is where I work. One day, in a desperate effort to find somewhere to go for lunch other than Togo's or Baker's Square....I took a short drive and found this amazing nirvana called The Nugget! A wonderful deli, beautiful fresh fruit, the friendliest employees I've ever encountered anywhere, a great wine selection and a wide range of Burt's Bees products....what more does a gal need? And now I hear rumor that they also do a $3 wine tasting every Friday evening! I'll have to confirm that rumor for myself, and once I do...I may just never leave. Chalk up one more reason that I'm not feeling as bad about calling Sacramento home as I had anticipated that I might. With places like The Nugget, I might just take off my coat and stay for a while.

This is more about the stylists, since I'm loyal to Toni, not the salon itself.They do walk ins, but it's better if you make an appointment because they're not always available for a walk in. Park on the opposite side of the street if you're getting color or anticipate a longer appointment, as that side has 10 hour parking ($1.00/hour) and the side the salon is on only has 2 hour parking. Music is easy listening, always good tunes. I've known Toni and Sarah since they were at Felicite. I'm not really familiar with the other stylists here, but Toni and Sarah are great, very friendly, very professional. Toni has always done my hair but I've seen the hair Sarah does as she's always there at the same time, she does a great job too.

The labor hard and long! But everything is so worth it for her... The staff is friendly and the security is really tight. Must bring ID to see anyone here. Everyone needs a badge to even walk around the building including kids. I had a private room and my visitors had 24-7 visiting hrs. I just wish my sister left her kids at home. I didn't have problem with any of the nurses until my last day there... It actually took 3 hrs for them to discharge me. 3 freaking hrs... OMG! I almost wanted to walk out of there with my baby. But I couldn't do that because I had bracelet and my baby had bracelet that would not allow this to happen. If got into the elevator without permission, the whole elevator would freeze up. Which is good thing!Im done having kids!!!
<review# 1349,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2008,12/27/2008,42,25,1,5,7>Besides the death of loved ones, the saddest day of my life was when I read the news about Corti Brothers being forced to leave its East Sac location.  It sounds hyperbolic, but it's so true.  I went in that very same day and felt heartsick walking around.  There is no place like Corti Brothers in Sacramento, and honestly, probably nothing like it anywhere.  My friend Alice exclaimed, 'where will I find lufkes?!' (A Scandinavian gnocchi bread that she's only found at Corti Brothers.)  I felt the same way about so many aspects of Corti Brothers, and so do countless other devoted shoppers, as well as foodies across the country.  Corti Brothers is frequently cited in food magazines and cookbooks as a resource for offering specialty and imported items.  And, Darrell Corti deserves his props -- he's a scholar who has received numerous accolades for his work, including a James Beard award, and an induction into the Vintners Hall of Fame on the Napa Valley campus of the Culinary Institute of America.  He has been a great friend to Slow Food Sacramento and recently helped us raise nearly $16,000 for Slow Food Nation.  I could go on and on about why and how much I love the Corti Brothers -- the great deli and meat counters, the wonderful and conscientious staff who have been there long term and know their products and their customers, the incredible variety of specialty items -- but there are no words that capture the euphoria I feel when visiting this treasure.  I, and the throngs of other loyal shoppers, are the target audience for the "Good Eats" that is taking over Corti Brothers, and I must say, I will never step foot into the new venue because I have such distaste over how the company and the building's landlord have literally kicking Corti Brothers out of its home.  I'm sure Good Eats will build its own clientele over time, but I know that there are many other loyal folks who have voiced their intention to "boycott" the new venue.I am hopeful that Corti Brothers will find a new location, and I will patronize them wherever they relocate.  In the meantime, East Sac is losing one of its most beloved neighbors.
<review# 1350,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2008,12/25/2008,149,559,4,7,7>Quick take: It's really good - any newcomer Vietnamese joint on that already-competitive strip of Stockton Blvd. has to be able to bring its A-Game... and Pho Xe Lua did. Food, ambience, value - virtually unbeatable.The longer, tortured saga and corresponding assessment: I am a loyal customer of a few places - not easily swayed by the shiniest newest restaurant. And I am a staunch defender of Pho Saigon (as my review of it indicates). I was introduced to Pho Saigon by my mom about 10 years ago, when she and I were first getting acquainted with Vietnamese food and lived about a mile away, and it's been our favorite ever since.We've both moved further away from the area, but we still make the trek with some regularity, and are never disappointed. Well, that was true until recently. I always order #20, the Duck Noodle Soup, and for the past few months, it's been very little duck and a lot of noodles. (I get that the prices haven't gone up in a decade, while food costs have skyrocketed, but raise your damn prices - don't skimp on product!). Anyway, when Pho Xe Lua opened directly across the street, I was surprised at the audacity of someone to go toe-to-toe with Saigon... but I also had no desire to try it.My mom was little bolder, and she called me from Pho Xe Lua back in August to describe the lovely ambience - spacious, new, clean, fountain, flat screen TV - nice people, and to claim the food was "even better than Saigon." I almost fell over. In my family, those are fighting words. What an outlandish claim. I refused to try it.When her birthday came around, my mom insisted that she wanted the whole family to go to dinner there - clearly, that was the only way she was going to get me to test her claim. (If this girl is driving all the way to Stockton and Fruitridge, there is no way she is not going to Pho Saigon). So, I capitulated, in honor of a birthday celebration.And it was, as she said. Damn.There were 5 of us, and we ordered a few different pho dishes, spring rolls, and 2 different vermicelli dishes with shrimp, egg rolls, and charbroiled pork - standard fare, nothing fancy. It was superb - every dish was absolutely delicious! I was determined to not like it as much out of loyalty, but even I had admit the superior food and total dining experience.They also let me bring in a birthday cake - and gave me matches, plates, and forks, for no fee.But here's the rub: Pho Xe Lua does not serve Duck Noodle Soup - there is no duck on the menu at all. So, while I found it to be the superior restaurant in ever dish we ordered, my very favorite dish is not offered at this shiny new establishment.It's a good compromise... I can love love love Pho Xe Lua, and also recognize that when I want delicious Duck Noodle Soup, Pho Saigon is still #1.
<review# 1351,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/28/2008,12/24/2008,97,283,5,6,5>In the midst of Black Friday at 7am, I think I FINALLY found my new favorite donut shop.  Growing up in South San Francisco, I had a local favorite that I had been going to since I was a little kid.  Now that I live in the Sac area, I had to find a new donut shop.  I always find that great donut shops are hard to find.  I feel like most of them get all their donuts from one huge baking factory that serves the entire state of California!  So it's like seeing the same exact pastries at every single mom & pop donut shop. The first thing that caught my eye was the fruit roll.  It looks like a freeze dried rolled up dessert crepe with glazing on the wrapper. ABSOLUTE HEAVEN!  I had the blueberry flavor but it also comes in raspberry and lemon.  The Mr. had a Bavarian cream bar with chocolate icing and he said it was quite tasty as well.  Another pastry that got my attention was the braided bar with chocolate icing and chocolate chips sprinkled on top. I'm sure it tastes as good as it looks.  They also had fruit pastries that were so deep full of fruit it almost looked like a mini bowl made of a pastry with a cup of fruit inside.  Their bear claws looked HUGE with very distinct swollen toes, kinda like the Vienna Sausage toes that a woman gets after wearing 4 inch heels the whole night. I can't wait to check out the rest of the pastries again because everything just looked so yummy!
<review# 1352,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/16/2008,12/23/2008,57,117,4,6,5>I went with a craving of egg salad, and from the looks of reviews this was the place to go. I actually called ahead because it was Saturday and they said that they would keep their deli open until 3:30. Sweet. I arrived at 2:30. They said the deli was closed. Humph! I returned during a time I knew they would be open and ordered a sammich. Egg Salad with sunflower seeds. They were out of the sprouts I wanted. Taste and portion of food was great! It was a great sandwich even without the sprouts I wanted, and the next time I'm craving some egg salad then I will go here. But only if I'm craving egg salad. Bon Air is like the ruler of egg salad in Sacramento. Kinda a small niche, but still, its good to be King.
<review# 1353,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/5/2008,12/22/2008,33,80,9,20,16>Hands down the best vets around.  They're known for it too.I was originally referred to Davis by my vet, though not my primary vet, but another vet that was available when my Netherland Dwarf broke his leg.  This vet insisted that Bunny (yes, he was a bunny named Bunny) needed to have surgery or amputation.  Surgery was out of the question due to his age so amputation it was.  And she said she could do it.  "I've never amputated a rabbit but it's like a cat."  LIKE A CAT?? Are you out of your mind?So I went to Davis for three reasons: 1) as described above, 2) its the best vet school in the country, and 3) as a teaching school, they were cheaper.  But they seemed to think I went to Davis because they specialize in older rabbits.  (Rabbit geriatrics, anyone?) in any case, based on the break, it turns out that Bunny didn't even need the amputation! It was in a position that could heal itself.   Waaait a second, HOOOOLD UP. You mean to tell me the my so-called vet at home was going to amputate a leg that didn't need to be amputated? Not to mention, amputate it like a cat? Are you joking??  (Moral of the story is be careful with surgery happy doctors who just want you to pay them for the services, and aren't really looking out for your pet's best interests.)  Bunny's leg ended up healing pretty well to the point where he was running again albeit leaning to the left a bit if you watched from directly behind him, where he had maybe 60% of his weight on his left leg and 40% on his right leg.Unfortunately, Bunny broke his leg again 6 months later, same leg, different area, and it did have to be amputated.  UCDavis did an amazing job, you couldn't even tell he was missing a leg most of the time (since the back leg is usually tucked under the body anyway).  When I picked him up after surgery, they also sent me home with some greens for him to eat on ride back.  They must grow them in their own garden because they looked so yummy and fresh, my dad considered asking for more so he can have a salad for dinner.They have an amazing team - thoughtful and caring, and they all take there time with you. Every time I brought Bunny in (and there were a handful of road trips - 2+ hours roundtrip) for the little guy), people would remember him and how little he was and how cute he was.  Nurses would come up to me in the waiting room to say hello to him.  Apparently he is quite popular there.  And they are quite popular with me.My favorite quotes come from there.  Doctors have said to me:"Oh, we can't go in that room.  There's a chinchilla in there." "Sorry, I was taking so long.  I had to see an iguana and its owners were being really difficult."Sadly, Bunny passed away at the end of October.  I think the huge surgery took its toll on his recovering little body. He was 11 and a half, pretty old for a bunny, and I knew that was risk going into surgery. I miss the little guy.  UCDavis sent me a sympathy card - I called them a couple days after because after all the time they spent with him, I felt that they should know.  It was signed by 2 of his doctors, in addition to another doctor and 2 nurses, all of whom had a share in caring for him.

<review# 1355,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2008,12/20/2008,145,130,4,7,3>This was the best restaurant experience I've had in YEARS. I finished my meal five hours ago and still can't stop thinking about it! I came on Yelp and wondered what the hell else everybody else was talking about. Surely it had received glowing reviews, right?Well, I'm here to change that.True, I'm not exactly a high-class seafood connoisseur, but my boyfriend is (he got the lobster and steak), and I loves me some mothafuckin' crab. Maybe I'm biased because my awesome boyfriend took me here for birthday, the same boyfriend who introduced me to the joys of crab. But even the side dishes were superior to anything I've had possibly ever -- and by that I mean that they were far more than tasteless pre-entrée fillers. The clam chowder and garlic mashed potatoes made me wish I hadn't filled myself up on their bread and pasta. Not to say either were bad, because they were still ten times better than what you'd find at even the swankiest of seafood joints.I tried lobster for the first time here and was underwhelmed. My boyfriend was impressed but I thought it was chewy. I'll have to give it another try somewhere else. The crab was excellent, though I've had maybe a teeeeeny bit better at Scoma's in San Francisco. I'm not discriminating enough to care, that's for damn sure.Last but not least, the service was above and beyond the call of duty. Exceptionally quick and attentive. Unlike a lot of servers who hate their jobs, the waiters would glance at tables as they were passing by to make sure everything was in order. There was also some really neat mixed media art on the walls. Nice ambiance.All in all, it was a meal to remember. I'm still in a crab-induced coma/haze/wonderland. It was an incredible amount of quality food for the price. Definitely a special occasion place but worth a visit! A note for the wise: don't order the drinks. Tasty, but seemingly non-alcoholic and they'll rape your wallet.

Every time I go in the person who signed me up still says hello to me, as does my trainer, and the person at the front desk 2. After they say hello they ask how my Mom or sister are doing as well 3. It is never crowded, machines are always open 4. Classes are never full 5. I only pay $15 a month 6. my trainer Al, was amazing, hands down, no comparison 7. There aren't the overwhelming amount of meat heads here, like there are at 24hr fitness 8.

The best part of Kelli's is actually their cookie delivery. Yes, that's right! Cookie delivery! Picture it: you've been slaving away for months with a business partner on a major project. The day of the big deadline, you ask Kelli's to have several dozen cookies delivered to their office as a pick-me-up/thank-you gift. Nothing spells kindness quite like a batch of freshly made cookies.I first encountered Kelli's at a nonprofit function. They were giving away free samples of their "glacier mint" cookies--rich chocolate mint cookies. These soft, chewy fresh cookies beat the kind in the green box any day! I was hooked from my first free sample, and have been ordering their cookies as gifts ever since. My husband loves their chocolate chip and oatmeal raisin cookies (but not as much as my homemade cookies, he tells me. I'm not sure I believe him). I am also a fan of their banana chocolate chunk cookie. All these varieties are soft and moist, sweet and delicious. Sadly, there is nothing "gourmet" about the gift boxes in which the cookies are delivered. They are little on the cheesy side. But the cookies inside are truly bakery-fresh gems, and their delivery service is superb. For a unique gift idea, you can't beat these cookies.

So when I needed my morning caffeine fix (yes - the headache was approaching in the distance) he drove me over to Coffee Garden. I felt like I was about to go on safari in this place. We sat towards the back where there was a big trunk set up as the table in front of a super comfy couch. I could have sat there all day.   I was briefly awoken from my daze when a lady with a 3-legged dog walked by (I kid you not) and I saw the great patio area in the back. Ah-ha! That is where I saw the "Garden" part of Coffee Garden. The back has tons of tables surrounded by plants and other pretty, serene-ness.Now on to the "Coffee" part of Coffee Garden - I got myself a Mexican Mocha with an extra expresso shot.....and I was all, "Wait, Starbucks who???"  The BEST mocha I have ever had - by far. The cinnamon and other spices in it were strong, but not overpowering. The chocolate was rich but not barfy-sweet. I was in heaven. I am drooling right now thinking about it. ....need to mop the drool off my desk now.....
<review# 1359,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2010,1/17/2011,268,316,8,12,11>Executive summary: drink the soup AFTER you are done eating all the meat and veggies. You will find it wonderful. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, on to the review.i was so excited when I found out Heat Shabu Baru (HSB) was only a few miles from my abode. I mean, this could be the beginning of a long lasting relationship. In the building that use to house the now defunct Bali Wine Bar & Grill, HSB serves up a form of shabu that makes cooking your food an integral part of the dining experience.When we arrived we were tended to by the owner, Anthony (awesome name, I must say). He was very honest with us, telling my wife and I that we had ordered enough food for 3-4 people (we had 2 kids with us). I said no worries, because deep down in my heart of hearts I knew I would polish off everything they threw at me, if it was as good as I had anticipated. Our server Sylvia arrived to take over, and she was definitely a delight and handled the transition with aplomb.I ordered two meats, the America Kobe beef and New Zealand lamb. I must say I really enjoyed the flavor of the lamb. My wife said lamb is too game-y for her, but hey, flavor is the name of the game. As far as the soups go, at first I thought they weren't particularly powerful in flavor, but as the night when on and I had simmered 2 orders of meat and veggies for about an hour or so, the flavors were just astonishing. I was able to finish off my meal with a hearty bowl of spicy tonkatsu and spicy miso. Throughout the meal I thought the tonkatsu broth had the upper hand, but in the end the miso was just exquisite, with a strong mushroom beef flavor throughout.Since this is a shabu place, i would recommend everyone focus on the shabu. The other items were good, but I feel the strength is in the main attraction.Service was incredible and friendly. The owner and our server were great with our kids. They really understand what it means to provide service with a smile. I'm coming back...next time with reinforcements to tackle the all u can eat food and drink deal!(Don't forget to get the 15% off for the early bird, Mortie)(I forgot to mention the special ponzu dipping sauce...INCREDIBLE)

Beer, burgers, easy on the wallet prices, a pool table and cardboard cutouts of Corona soccer cheerleaders all in an awesome dive bar for burgers kinda atmosphere...how could I not love this place? The Awful Wally burger with pastrami on the patty is legit, I do recommend up sizing to the 1/2 lb if you have a bigger appetite though but the regular size if perfect if you're looking to avoid inducing a food coma. If this place was downtown and open late night it would easily be a 5 star spot. I'm sure when given the opportunity to do some day drinking here I'll bump up my rating.

Gambling is in my blood.... *shameful headshake*With that being said this place has become quite nice after its million dollar renovations.  I think they did wonders "Classing" this joint up with the new resort, concert stage, pool, Bar, etc.  The food court is open and accessible for Starbucks, Panda Express, Beach Hut Deli, etc.  You can eat and not have the smell of smoke everywhere.  The buffet is about average with mostly Asian and American Faire with pizza thrown into the mix.  Probably  my favorite food-related thing here is the Thunder cafe where you can get coffee and GELATO~!!! YEAH FOR GELATO~!!!You can waste your nights away here as the demon "GAMBLOOR" takes control of you.  On Fridays and Saturdays this place is swamped full of people!  If your into the "one handed bandit" then you better be ready to fight off some old Filipino lady whose ready to steal your seat the moment you stand up to stretch.  Seriously! I think I almost sat on one!  The ables are also plentiful here with a myriad of card games for you.  It may be hard to enjoy on slower nights when fewer tables are open and you are stuck next to the guy who insist on hitting on 18 because he feels it and ultimately screws up the entire table!  You know who you are!!!  The poker room is the real gaming gem of this place.  It gives off a very clean and classy feel.  Moving it away from the saloon style card bar it once was.  Very nice dealers throughout.  Plenty of flat screens for sport center.  And plenty of online players who think they can bluff you outa your pocket aces with their 5, 8 suited.  Oh kids.... I only become richer because of your careless "all ins".The new bar is so upscale looking.  I makes me feel poor walking through it.  But its a great place to have an overprice drink, watch tv, and pretend that you are a baller!  Oh yeah, I sit there with my pinky up just to show the ladies whats up!  So Yelpers, if your ever out there, just look for the doucher with his vodka/cranberry and his pinky up.... I'll buy you a drink!
<review# 1362,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/17/2010,1/14/2011,910,555,5,10,7>I've always said Stockton Blvd of Sacramento is almost like the Bolsa Ave of Orange County (or the Story or Tully or whatever of San Jose)..and this restaurant backs up my statement!  It's a restaurant by day, lounge by night.  They have a small stage with a microphone, which is a must have if you're a Vietnamese lounge, haha..and the fridge is fully stocked with HEINEKENS.  Double haha!  What wasn't so traditional was the decor; it was very modern.  Vibrant colored lights made QC stand out from the other Vietnamese establishments around the area.Now on to the food: from looking at the pictures I provided, the dishes look pretty average.  Portions are average, presentation is average, prices are average, too..but taste I would say was a notch above average.  The fish sauce was good, the marinated pork was good, the veggies were fresh.  I'm happy!  I ordered the Bun Tom Thit Nuong (grilled pork and shrimp over vermicelli) and couldn't finish because they piled on the meat!  My mom had pretty much the same but with broken rice and tau hu ky and she said the tau hu ky was really good.I hope to see QC stay open for years to come; previous owners of this particular building have been in and out.  Give this place a try if you're craving some authentic Vietnamese food!
<review# 1363,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2010,1/13/2011,352,248,6,14,11>This place has been on my bookmark for weeks. I finally made it here yay!! I dropped in here this afternoon for lunch.  I haven't had a gyro in a long time.  I ordered the beef/lamb gyro.  This reminded me of the shawarmas I ate during my deployment to Saudi.  My meal was very good and the price was right. I love places that serve Pepsi so I was really happy.   My server was great and very helpful with the questions I had about the food.   Overall a nice place with a good price for food.
<review# 1364,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2010,1/12/2011,476,248,11,9,12>Honeycomb on my cheese plate....how dare you!....how dare you NOT introducing this into my life sooner! OY VEY!...the combination was delectable. Next came the salad, it  was nothing to write home about...the goat cheese was a nice addition, but there were no surprises that tickled my tongue, no interesting combinations like I had before with my honeycomb cheese explosion of flavor!For the entree...according to my wedding place card I was a cow for the evening. And how I enjoyed being that cow...eating a nicely cooked, medium rare flank steak with a herby spice rub...on a bed of spinach and paired with rustic potatoes. In my opinion...the potatoes were a throw-away, which I didn't really appreciate because potatoes are my favorite food. F U GRANGE...Gimmie POTATOES OR GIVE ME DEATH!okkkkkk....a little too intense there, but that's where that star went. The pappas were dry and lacking of any kind of flavor, no salt, nothing. If it wasn't for the cheese plate, I would have downgraded the rating even more. Anywhoo...I would come again, I heard from the other guests that the pork lion was fabulous and the chicken was tender. I would like to come back for the drinks (my lemon-drop was pretty tasty) and the atmosphere of the restaurant. Overall great job...but work on the damn carbs. They deserve love too!
<review# 1365,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/22/2010,1/11/2011,562,500,15,13,15>I met up with a few of my good friends at the Sail Inn the other night.  We watched base-a-ball, played at pool, ate a bit, drank a bit, karaoke'd a bit and "hell yes" we partied hearty.  All that, in this little hole in the wall on the other side of the muddy ditch.What my friends did not know was about the woman behind the scene.  I have forgotten her name but she bought the Sail Inn twenty five years ago when it was centered in a hub of blue collar jobs.  Since that time, the blue collar jobs have dried up and it is now in the middle of what you would call a Sacramento bedroom community.  The transformation has been hard on the Sail Inn, but the lady is willing to do what it takes to keep the doors of the Sail Inn open.The night we came, she started out as the bartender, then she became chief cook and bottle washer, she finished the night overseeing the karaoke.  I have a feeling that if anyone comes in and starts any problems, she will become the bouncer that kicks their ass as well.Here's the point that I am trying to make.  If you want a beer and someone to talk to, she will make you feel welcome.  If you are hungry she will make you what you want to eat at a damn good price.  The place is not fancy, it falls in the category of classic dive bar.  If you can handle that, "sail on inn" and tell her Joe sent you.
<review# 1366,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/23/2010,1/10/2011,253,90,12,12,12>This place has a lot to offer with the location, great bar and brews, service, and originality of the menu. Located on 21st between Capital and L, this is a prime midtown spot with a lot of space for happy hour wanderers or a hot date, or even an ideal place to host a work party. The balcony upstairs is very spacious and fit our large group of over 20 people. Then Joe started making construction references about how balconies collapse "all the time" when over capacity, and I started to brace myself at the feel of every small movement. No worries though, the structure was very solid!Unlike Matt C.'s hesitation when it came to wanting to try other people's food, I have mastered the art of distraction. "Hey isn't that the Waterboy restaurant over there?" (grabs a deep fried pickle while heads are turned)"Oh, isn't that decoration in the restaurant just lovely?" (stabs fork into poutine and makes the steal)I will have to agree with the general consensus in that the menu is very original and the final product was better than expected. I hate it when restaurants over-sell and under-deliver, something my boyfriend might say. The macaroni and cheese was the special and concocted using the Arrogant Bastard ale in their sauce. It was so soo sooo so good. My only request is to maybe make the hamburger affordable. $13?! Holy moly. Time to bust out the ol' credit card tonight! Maybe it is served on a solid gold platter and infused with diamonds. Because that sounds so good. Our server Jeremy was the bomb biggity. Not only was he really nice, but he was working really hard to make sure that all of us in our group of 20 ADHD scatterbrains who were playing musical chairs the entire night were taken care of. Not many restaurants will do that. I can't wait to come back!
<review# 1367,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2010,1/9/2011,472,178,14,11,13>I have been coming here about once a week with my dad for at least the last five years. My dad lives up in Yuba City, but he comes down to Sacramento a couple of times a week to meet with clients, and usually stays around until I get off work and we go to the Delta King. It's kind of our ritual.My dad usually calls around 3:00 to tell me he is "gonna be down your way" and wants to know if we "wanna grab a martini on the Delta King," and my natural response is "um yes" because who doesn't enjoy a martini now and again? So he picks me up from work at 5 and we head to Old Town, dodging muffin top bitches on their cruiser bikes and old people and tourists who don't have a clue that they are walking in to oncoming traffic.But after we park, we talk about the river level like always, talk about how we need to take the boat out, talk about the weather, talk about anything at all on our walk to the boat.We never hang out in the regular part of the restaurant. We always turn right and head up the stairs to the bar, and depending on the weather, we sit out on the deck. Especially during the evening, the deck can get pretty warm. Usually we only do that in the spring and the fall, because on a day that gets over like 80 it turns into an oven.We have seen the menu change numerous times, staff changes all the time, and right now it's pretty decent. They don't have that Cruella Deville lady working their anymore who looked like she never got the memo on "day vs night makeup." There is a nice younger guy who works there now with a good sense of humor and is speedy with our orders. The inside of the place is nice, I like quirky places and since this is an old ass boat, the quirkiness factor is through the roof. They also remodeled the interior and put a couple of large booths along the side which are pretty comfortable. The menu is good, and the fries are no longer frozen bagged fries but cut from REAL POTATOES IN THE RESTAURANT (what a novel idea)!Now to what to order:Since I have been coming here forever, I have pretty much ordered everything on the menu.I always get the portabello mushroom sandwich with either a side of fries or salad, depends on my mood. My dad usually gets the fish (cod?) and chips, the batter looks light and crispy, and my dad says it tastes "really good" and is never soggy. I have also ordered the chop salad, which comes with chicken, bacon, avocado, tomato, feta cheese and your choice of dressing that they toss it in. I no longer eat meat, but I have ordered it without the chicken and substitute more veggies and it always comes out really tasty. The burger -- really fucking big and greasy and pretty much just how a burger should be. I forget the toppings that come on it, but the bun doesn't suck and the burger is seasoned well, but not too salty. The oysters are also really tasty, though the order is kind of small. I remember my dad saying that he thinks he continued to get hungry during the course of him eating the oysters and then proceeded to slyly eat fries off of my plate until I just offered him the other half of my sandwich.The food, the drinks, and the experience of dining on the Delta King is definitely part of the Old Sacramento charm and is not something to be missed.Only downside -- it's kind of small so if you get some annoying group of people next to you droning on about how "John never pays the mortgage on time" or "what am I supposed to do about my country club membership now that the economy is tanking" or "I am on this new diet where I can only eat grapefruit, duck fat, and black coffee four times a day"......chances are you will know them VERY well by the time you leave: unfortunately there is no sound dampening of any kind.
<review# 1368,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2010,1/8/2011,133,189,1,10,9>Sacramento is totally coming up in the vegan world. This store is located directly above Sugar Plum Vegan and is equally as awesome. We're so lucky to have two amazing establishments (run by two amazing women) in the same building. Today was the grand opening of Never Felt Better Vegan Shop and although it was a soft opening, there was more than plenty to look at.Jen has a wide variety of cruelty free items ranging from snacks to clothing and hand made crafts to condoms. It is a one stop shop for those of us who would like to live a life free of animal exploitation and for those of you who are curious to know more about the vegan lifestyle. Check it out! You won't be disappointed.
<review# 1369,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2011,4/17/2012,199,190,2,18,5>YUM!!! I literally live a hop, skip and a jump away from this venue and have been waiting for it to open for a few months now. It was everything I had hoped + more! The building is small, but a lot of places are. The good thing is that this restaurant does not close in the middle of the day so you can go at an "odd time" and beat the crowds.  We started with two miso soups, and some edamame.  The miso was delish, and the edamame was cold and crisp, just how I like it.  For the main rolls, we split the Kamikaze, Spicy Monster and the Twin Sakura. All three were delish... they aren't DRENCHED in sauces, the fish is fresh (melts in your mouth, not rubbery at all) and the rolls don't have too much rice. Mmm. Their prices are PHENOMENAL.  I also got a soda, and some mochi-- they automatically take half off your bill so we walked away for under $30 before tip!! Although the prices are cheap, I recommend tipping on the full amount of the bill (before discount) because the service is impeccable, and they are prompt and very nice.We will DEFINITELY be back, probably during Happy Hour next time to enjoy some $1
<review# 1370,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/9/2011,4/16/2012,451,183,9,13,9>My 100th Review!!!!!! I had to do it on something on something special and it just so happens a friend took me here for dinner last night. It was a total surprise to me, having always wanted to come here and either forgetting it was here or not having a dining buddy. Oh, i came here once, years ago, by mistake. I hopped on a party bus late at night with an old friend of mine, and it took us here (along with lots of drunk sluts). We got bored fast, and left, forgetting we had to figure out how to get back to midtown. But I got off track here....So, we started with the spinach artichoke dip. Wow, $12?? It must be made of gold. It was not, however made of gold, but loaded with cheese!!!! It was sooo good, lots of melted cheese. Like, Parmesan cheese. And ramekins of sour cream and salsa. I am still scratching my head as to why they put that on there. Trying to copy Chili's? So I ignored them and continued my cheesy green bliss. My friend and I decided to split out dinner, (since it was like a date we were on) so we got a french dip sandwich, a side of mac n cheese and a side of sauteed spinach.  Oh my beefy and cheesy goodness!!! Up until now, my favorite mac n' cheese had been from the former restaurant of Mason's. ( ( who then changed to Cafeteria 15L and the m n' c went waaay downhill) I now have a  new favorite. It was rigatoni- which I normally despise- covered in a creamy, cheesy cheese sauce and topped with either bread crumbs or walnuts. Can't remember.The sandwich was loaded with fresh, thin shaved prime rib. Came with au jus and horseradish and mashed potatoes colcannon, which turns out to be mashed taters with cabbage!!! I was in heaven with this little Irish classic. There was enough for me to take home leftovers. We skipped dessert (since I had prepared some custard at my house!) and went exploring in the  area. I can not wait to come back!!!!!!
<review# 1371,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/25/2011,4/15/2012,287,110,14,14,17>What do you do when you've been laid up in the house suffering from a cold, monster cramps, and a headache from trying to finish up that 12-page paper? You go to Shoki! Their flavorful broth and hearty noodles have a magical way of making everything better. I'm always on the lookout for new Shoki buddies since my girl, Marina C., can't be trusted. One minute she tells me how much she loves Shoki...then the next she's telling me she doesn't want to eat there because she's, "all Shoki'd out." I say whatever to that shit. I liked it better when she was always down to slurp the sweet nectar. Anyway, I pretty much always get the Shoyu, which has a soy sauce base. However, word on the street is there's a Curry flavored something or other that's definitely worth trying. The problem is this: I tell myself I'm going to try something new, but the Shoyu hits the spot every time, which makes it almost impossible to stray. I usually recommend Shoyu to the newbies as a safe place to start but let them know if they're looking for something lighter to get Shio, which is a salt base. Or, if they're looking for something spicy to get the Tan Tan Men, which has a chili base. I've found most people prefer the Tan Tan Men, but it's too heavy on the sesame for a girl like me. Service is always fast and friendly. One thing I love about Shoki II--in comparison to the original Shoki--is that this one doesn't get near as humid and steamy. My hair is in some variation of an afro 99.9% of the time, so, needless to say, humidity is not my friend. The one downside to Shoki II are the acoustics. It gets so loud that it's hard to carry on a conversation. I swear sometimes it'd be easier for me to just talk to the couple at the table next to me rather than try to hear my dining partner across the table. Really, though, it's not that much of a problem since I'm usually too busy getting down with my ramen anyway.Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options are available!
<review# 1372,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2012,4/14/2012,99,153,3,9,5>I agree with Jen K. wholeheartedly! This spot combines the pro's of each Beach Hut and Mr. Pickles in to an even better more affordable offspring. Looking to yelp for a sandwich...spot... on the way to work I was brought here and will definitely be back. I was greeted immediately by not one not two but three young ladies all pleasantly welcoming me to their sandwich creating, carb loving, kitschy decorated haven.I picked a pastrami sandwich which cost $6.50 compared to the atrocity of $8 at one of the competitors and it was delicious. Meat was tender, thinly cut and the sandwich was perfectly warm. (as requested).I look forward to trying other options!(add a gourmet spin on a sandwich...think goat cheese... and you will need to drag me out of here!)
<review# 1373,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2012,4/13/2012,288,1059,6,6,6>Man I love this place. I found it purely by accident one night when finding myself stuck in some ugly ugly I-80 traffic. Thank goodness for Yelp and thank goodness for my iPhone GPS! At first glance, it's nothing special and next to a charming little liquor store. Nice. Get your 40 of King Cobra AND Kung Pao Chicken all at once! Kidding.The great thing about this place is the super friendly service and the decent food at the great prices. I walked in and was immediately greeted by two people behind the counter. I appreciated the photo descriptions for those us not familiar with what Mongolian Beef looked like. I went for the old childhood favorite of shrimp in black bean sauce and sat down with a magazine and a giant cup of tea. Less than 10 minutes later, a server drops off a giant plate of food with a huge smile and I'm in heaven. The shrimps were cooked perfectly, the green bell pepper was soft, the sauce (which is the most important part) was thick, not too salty and had a great bite to it thanks to the black beans. Oh, why must I love bad Chinese food in a sketchy neighborhood so much? I'll never know.
<review# 1374,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/15/2011,4/11/2012,202,116,9,11,11>Menu here: capitoldawg.com/#/menu-i I have hit all the hot dog establishments in the area, and this is my favorite! It is vegetarian friendly.VEGGIE DOG REVIEWThe veggie dog weiner is better than the packaged ones at the store, and is probably about the best I've had [the Weinery is the worst]. The regular hot dog buns are fine, but the key is to ORDER YOUR DOG ON A FRENCH ROLL. The french roll is fresh but has a nice pull to it that's much better than the soft and boring regular bun (sorry regular bun).There's a veggie corn dog too. You won't find that in too many places. It was a little greasy for my taste, but what would I expect where the main ingredient is deep fried batter. They do cook with trans-fat free oil!TOPPINGSThere are tons of toppings, so you can create your own specialty dog. There are also some unusual hot sauces to choose from. My only complaint is the veggie chili is really lame - so lame that I started getting pinto beans on the side instead. They really need to work on it!I WISHI wish they had milkshakes. It would complete the comfort food experience. They have freezes during the summer, but it's just 7-11 style - not with fresh fruit. There are floats but who wants a float? Also, they don't have brewed iced tea (damn Gold Peak iced tea-like beverage!).I LIKEI like that they have hot dog memorabelia covering the walls. I was surprised to learn that you don't need to eat 50 or 40 or even 30 hot dogs to compete at the local level (10-11 will do). I enjoy sweet potato fries too. HOT DOG DOCUMENTARYThe owner always tells people about how a hot dog documentary crew came to film at Capital Dawg, and the filmmaker said that this was one of their two favorite spots out of the dozens they had visited. INTERESTING NOTETheir website has a guestbook. capitoldawg.com/#/guestb "Gary" posted demanding that Capital Dawg should take down "the Doganator" hot dog because "Arnold is a disgrace to California."

NOUGH SAID.Their curry beef noodle soup is ah-may-zing and so is their green waffle thing. I've never seen so many undercover meats in my life (that's what she said). You might feel skeptical of eating wannabe tofu... "Such a sorry sounding confused food item" you might be thinking. But I assure you my friend, in the end it will be you who is confused. Once you try it you will question the identity of each food item they offer.. "This is not real beef?!" "Is this shrimp real?" "What about this meat patty?" "I can't believe it's not dead animal!"

I've only been here a handful of times but each and every time I've been blown away by anything and everything I ordered. Honestly with faux meat like theirs, who needs the real thing?!Even though this place is kind of in the middle of nowhere, it's worth the trek. I highly recommend the wonton soup and the curry 'chicken.' Prices are roughly $7-9 a dish and portions are very decent. A vegan girl really couldn't ask for more! I always take home leftovers and eat them the next day or sometimes I get a little too excited and eat it later that night! (opps..all gone!)It's a nice clean environment and the staff is nice. I've never seen it crowded. There's always seating and the food is DE-LI-COUS! Give them a try, even if you're a carnivore, you'd be surprised!!
<review# 1377,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2011,4/8/2012,42,177,19,14,8>There are dozens of these restaurants all over Chitown. In all my excursions to the Windy City over the last few years, I've never stopped in.  My taste buds apologize, but my arteries are grateful.  Skinny white chicks:  just keep it movin'.   It's all fried, with a big slice of bread served underneath the ridiculously generous servings of chicken strips, catfish fillets, fries, etc., to sop up all the excess grease.  Pretty extensive menu . . . cod, crab cakes, jumbo shrimp, oysters, chicken breast fillets, gizzards(!!!), you name it.  The sides are varied as well.  Along with my catfish fillets and crab cakes, I ordered 2 sides:  rice & beans, and collard greens.  Both tasted as great as the fish.  My stepson said the mac & cheese wasn't that good.  Can't blame him, J J's . . . he's been eating mine for 6 years.  You don't stand a chance.A combo plate comes with 2 types of fish and an order of fries and, priced at $10.99, is probably enough for 3 meals.  Desserts?  Yikes.  Peach cobbler, fresh strawberry cake, 7-Up cake, mini sweet potato pies, BANANA PUDDING, and many others... an insane variety.  Nutritious?  Hell, no.  Delicious?  Hell, yeah!Drawbacks?  No AC, on a 100 degree day.  As for the neighborhood:  it's the ghetto!!!  Where the hell do you expect a LEGAL establishment like this to function and prosper?  You wouldn't be caught dead with a plate of fried nothin' in midtown!  Get over yourself.  Move out of your comfort zone, and stop bein' a little punk.  Get over there, and get your grub on.  Try some real soul food.  You won't be sorry.
<review# 1378,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/21/2012,4/7/2012,189,452,3,11,4>PARTY OF 2SERVICEWe walked right in without really knowing how this really works.  I read all the reviews here, but I still felt like a blind man ordering an experience.  The waiter was extremely helpful.  He answered all our questions about the menu and also made suggestions that we may enjoy.  The wait help came to refill our drinks, took away dishes that were already used and also replaced all of our utensils even though we can reuse them anyway.  We got clean and new stuff all the time.  FOODAppetizers we played it safe and I was trying to be courteous with the person I came with.  He was not one of those people that ate raw fish often.  I can, but  maybe next time I can return and eat some sashimi stuff.  We ordered simple appetizers like the Crab Won Ton and Gyoza.  It was great!So the experience we had no idea.  Basically there is this round heat contraption middle of our table.  Then you choose your soup.  We got MISO and TONKATSU.  A pot came to our table and was placed on this heat contraption.  It was boiling hot.  One side of the pot had MISO and other side had TONKATSU.  Both are SOUP.  Then we got each a platter of vegetables and noodles.  We were instructed to leave our veggies into the soup to our liking.  Even less than a minute if you dont want it too soft.  The food, we ordered American Kobe Beef "two" LARGE platters.  You know...I didnt realize this was a lot of food.  I think we both couldve been fine with the regular sized KOBE BEEF. Beautiful thin sliced beef.  It wouldve been enough.  So basically you pick up the raw beef and place it into the soup.  You can over cook it or have it rare, medium rare or fully cook.  It was amazing. DESSERTThe dinner we ordered came with GREEN TEA ice cream with little peach tasty mochi bits.  It was DELICIOUS!  I loved it!PRICEWell I was actually surprised that my dinner was lower than I expected.  There was a 15% off and we never understood our receipt so we asked.  A man that looked like a manager came up to our table and we asked what was the 15% about?  He smiled and said it is because you guys made it here during our Happy Hour.  WOW!!!!!!!!!  I was like I didnt know that!  He smiled and said that he can take off the 15% and make us pay regular.  Then he laughed and we all took that as a joke.WHAT SHOULDVE HAPPENED IN THIS IDEAL WORLDI wish the waiter told us about the HAPPY HOUR.  If he did, we couldve ordered more.  Maybe I couldve ordered the Sashimi and just ate it for myself even though the person I was with didnt like fish.MY THOUGHTSI believe it was an amazing experience.  I enjoyed it and I LOVED IT.I think its a great place to bring friends or family.  It actually allows you to have conversation with your party.  You have to interact in order to use that pot in the middle of the table.  I believe it would be great for a first date.  There will be plenty of room for conversation.  Make sure you know if your date like soup or noodles.  If not, then its not the place.5 STARS
<review# 1379,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/6/2011,1/1/2012,299,309,4,11,11>Walking in, you can't help notice the walls are filled with awards/magazines that this place has earned the recognition of, and this praise and recognition is well earned in my opinion.  I was able to meet Phil, the owner, who is undoubtedly the reason for it's success as he shows a genuine passion for what he does, and an impressive care/concern for what his customers think.  I had gotten the Yelp deal ($5 for $10 I believe) and was really excited about using it.  This of course means I can order more than I normally would have (as opposed to ordering the same amount and saving some cash.. honestly, who really does this?), and there are many good options here to choose from.Starting off, we had the hummus and pita plate (which came free for checking in with Yelp.. awesome!)  Their hummus is made there with their own recipe, and is absolutely delicious.  Then we had a sample platter with a number of different items on it, all of which delicious, honorable mention goes to the spanakopita that had so much crispy-cheesy-yummy flavor I had to take another.  My all-time, unoriginal, Greek favorite is hands down the gyro.  I love my gyro meat juicy and full of flavor.  Opa delivered on both.  Phil talked to me a bit about how they make their gyros, and told me the meat can be ordered fresh off the block, or from the warmer, and then you could also elect them grilled.  I personally prefer the meat out of the warmer, as it tends to be more juicy and not over done that way.  Other honorable mentions of the evening include their skewers of chicken (kabobs) over rice that came with a whipped olive oil garlic dip.  SO much flavor!  Another item absolutely packed with flavor was their garlic noodles (the actual name I can't recall), which was somewhat of a surprise.  Absolutely amazing.  And last but not least was their lightly marniated/seasoned lamb (that can be ordered in larger chunks on a skewer, or thinly sliced, with their garlic mashed potatoes.  YUM!When looking for Greek in Sac, look to Opa! Opa!

After all my experiences with Fuji's and Davis Sushi Buffet, my expectations for buffets have dulled down to almost nothing.My housemate wanted to go here, based on her friend's recommendation. After a long day of errands and shopping, we were starved. When we first saw the place, it looked somewhat deserted. It wasn't very crowded, but mind you, we got there pretty late.We were seated by a nice waitress, and we were given menus. I absolutely love how the hot food and sushi is made to order. They don't have any sushi sitting out, waiting to be picked up by a curious patron. We ordered almost all of the rolls. Recommendations?- Firebird- Salmon Lover- FRIED OYSTERS!!!- GyozaI can't remember what the other rolls were called. I was too busy eating them to take note of the names. Just remember, you can't go wrong with the sushi here. And  save room for dessert: fried ice cream, donuts, and fried bananas!!! All extremely good.note: it's extra for sashimi. $3 for 5 pieces. Still a great deal and their fish is freesh!The staff was more than welcoming. They were suuper niceee! It was a pleasant experience, and I absolutely cannot wait to go back! NOMNOM!

I've never been let down there. They have wonderful, fast, friendly service and even though there's only one vegan option on the menu, it's more than enough to keep me satisfied. And jeeez, they're portions are large. I have to get a ($8) regular size because that's the only size available for the vegan option and it is more than enough to fill me up, even if I'm hungry. Without a doubt, this has to be my favorite place to get ramen in sac. I'm going to say it loud and clear, shoki is the best ramen house in Sacramento. And after their new location opened, it's only made it easier for me to get my fix! Later hours too! I will be back! yum!

You contemplate turning around and walking back out but the smell of the buns and hot foods draw you closer... egg tarts, roast pork buns, large crusty pineapple buns, dimsum, fried chicken, chinese food... all hot and freshly made by the husband slaving away in the back. You better buy now before they sell out in the afternoon.When she rings you up, there is no small talk or joking. Her demeanor says, "Here is your total, you better have your cash ready." You feel like you should apologize... but you don't know what for. With the goods in bag, you leave feeling worthless. You fill this gap with your consolation prize of what you just purchased, vowing to never return again.Tomorrow you will make your grandma go in.One day I went in with my friend whose mother patronized this place so frequently that they have befriended the Bun Nazi. This was the first and only time that I have ever seen her smile. It was like watching a donkey and a horse consummate, the most unnatural sight I have ever laid eyes upon.

<review# 1384,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/16/2010,12/26/2011,150,166,3,10,8>I'm gonna be the first one to review them! Under their new name change of course... this used to be Butch 'n Nellies and as far as I can tell it hasn't  changed much beyond the name change (not sure if there was a change of ownership). This is still the awesome dyke-owned cafe and a lifeblood to both the gay, art, music and literary communities of Sacramento. :)I read a poem at the Midtown Out Loud open mic that just started up here, and I must say it was probably the best event of its kind I've been there, the quality of the performers and turn-out were outstanding, though the crowd got a bit noisy at times. But this place usually has lots of regular open mic events, so I hope this becomes as much of a tradition as Poetry Unplugged at Luna's!I haven't had the coffee here, but my friend got a latte, which she said was quite tasty... I've had sandwiches and that amazing gelato here before, so I hope they keep both of those mainstays!They supposedly have a new outdoor patio, but I didn't get to check it out, next time! I still love the casual sofa set-up and tables with chess boards painted on them. This is one of the cutest cafes in town and the one official dyke hang-out I know of in a town desperately needing it! I really hope that this place can continue under the name change and flourish for many years to come. :)

The charming Michelangelo and I were talking at a UYE recently about places in our area to check out and decided we wanted to try Mati's, as we both like to step out of our normal dining comfort zone. We arrived and were the only customers in the restaurant. It was nice since we weren't rushed to pick our entrees, due to a busy lunch line. The ladies behind the counter were very friendly and helpful when we had questions about the food. They also offered samples of the dishes before we committed them to our plates.  The prices of the combos were really reasonable.  You can grab the small combo (2 items) or the large combo (4-ish items) all for fewer than 10 bucks!  They were pretty flexible with letting you really customize your combo.  I settled for the cauliflower/potato side dish and buttered chicken.  Michelangelo went with Tikki Chicken and the Tikki Lamb.  He's muy caliente, err; I mean his palate is muy caliente.  --or insert "likes it spicy" in the proper Indian dialect.--  I sampled his lamb, but it was a little spicier than I was ready for.  It had a really nice flavor, and wasn't too spicy to the point of burning my tongue, but just enough to bring a nice flush to my cheeks.  The Butter Chicken was really good; nicely seasoned and not dried out.  We both went with the Garlic Naan.  It was nice and fresh, but I thought it would be a little more garlicky.  I'd get it again though, because the light garlic flavor complimented the main dishes nicely.  They also have plain Naan, but c'mon, go for the garlic!  By the time we'd left, the inside of the restaurant had gotten quite full of patrons.   I was really pleased with my meal and want to go back and try some of their curry dishes.  I'd also like to try that lamb again and see if it was the reason for my cheeks flushing or actually my lunch mate.
<review# 1386,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/14/2011,12/24/2011,125,189,9,10,11>I jumped at the chance to be treated by a friend to breakfast this weekend and it came down to choosing between Orphan and Evan's.  Due to my friend's inability to mentally process why Orphan does not carry ketchup, her inability to find a bottle smaller than 22 ounces (specifically for the purpose of "sneaking" it past Orphan's ever-ketchup-vigilant staff), and her feeling somewhat like a ketchup-crack-fiend after being talked down from the ledge that was her possibly running in to Del Taco to pick up some packets, we rationalized that Evan's might be our go-to this time around.  Orphan: 0, Evan's: 1.Evan's is located in the lot of the 57th Street Antique Mall, and everything about the place was an old person's paradise.  You are surrounded by antiques, both the knick knacks being sold, and the oldies buying them!Evan's itself felt like grandma's house.  Simple decor, trinkets here and there, ol' folks hanging around, and so on.  Hell, except for the young server girl, even the employee's were older folks.  Service was friendly and prompt though!Now the food is what merits my five star review.  I have been looking for a place that serves a mean biscuits and gravy, just in case Tuli (my go-to) ever stops serving them, and Evan's serves a mean biscuits and gravy!  The Shack's b&g weren't very memorable, so I was stoked to find Evan's!  I also plowed through an order of the French toast.  Fantastic food here!!  Flavorful, excellent portions, and relatively cheap!I'll be back for sure!
<review# 1387,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/1/2011,12/23/2011,570,275,11,16,17>What the hell?  WHERE did this place come from, why have I not been here earlier, and why do I love this food so much?!  This gorgeous, delicious, stuff my stomach but keep me begging for more foodie heaven was quite the experience.  Cafeteria 15L, where have you been all my life?Our reservation for new years eve was promptly ready at 6:45.  Not 6:50, not 7pm but the time I requested.  For some people this may not be something worth mentioning.  But on a busy night like New Years, it was certainly appreciated.  We were greeted with a smile and taken to our table.There is something unique and magical about this place.  The decor brings a certain urban sheik, with a touch of warmth and total comfort.   I spent a great deal of time studying their lighting fixtures which all had their own, really intricate style that accentuated each section of the restaurant.   I don't think I've spent that much time paying attention to the environment of the place I'm dining.  Or have I ever left feeling like everything there was truly beautiful, the meal included.Have you ever had an experience with food?  I mean, not just ate something and enjoyed the taste.  I mean an experience that transcends you to another world where the only words you can utter is "this is SO good."  Not a food coma (which did follow after), but an amazing daze. You don't want to talk, you just want to taste. Believe me, I tasted every bite of my juicy, glazed pork chop.  This juicy pork chop was topped with an apple cranberry chutney.  The pork chop was also  placed on top of maple glazed sweet potatoes and tender greens.  I wish I could give you all a piece of this meal right now, because words cannot express how much I loved this meal.My friends had just equally delicious meals, one steak and the other Ono.  We were very happy, very satisfied people. The desert that followed made us equally as enthralled.  By the time our almost 2 1/2 hours of dinning were up, we could do much but blissfully smile with our experience.The service, the food, the environment, the everything made me anxiously await to write my review.  I look forward to returning and having an another transcendental food experience.
<review# 1388,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/17/2011,12/22/2011,313,152,14,12,10>I recently joined this gym because I was sick and tired of waiting for a cardio machine at the local 24 hour fitness. To my amazement this gym turned out to be better than I could have imagined. First there were plenty of cardio machines at all hours of the day, second there were no meat heads at all which is amazing because meat heads drive me nuts. You know who you are. The guy trying to assert his alpha maleness by lifting weights he can barely manage and grunting as though was about to give birth to a 12 pound brown baby boy. In addition the gym is clean and most of the people go there for one reason to get their work out done and go home. The staff is friendly and the rates are really reasonable. I signed up for 30 dollars a month and of in addition to purchasing the key card dealio but it's only a one time charge of 30 bucks also. Over all I can't complain about this place other than it's kind of small. Which is something I can totally get over with.
<review# 1389,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2012,5/30/2012,412,840,8,11,14>Wow! Fantastic Eritrean food! I would have thought that was an oxymoronic phrase until yesterday when I visited Habesha. (Sincere apologies to my Eritrean friends!)I have  loved Ethiopian food since the early 80's in Atlanta. Since then I have had it both America and Europe from superb to down right horrific (St. Paul MN). In the 90's within the city of SF there were mostly Eritrean places. I would describe two major differences as menus in Tigrinya rather than Amarinya and adding a can of stewed tomatoes to an Ethiopian dish to make it Eritrean. (I'm not saying that's how the "real" cuisine is, just what I experienced.)I googled Ethiopian restaurant Sacramento yesterday since I've been banished to Folsom CA for most of 2012 for financial/professional reasons. I found Queen of Sheba Ethiopian in downtown Sac and then Habesha Eritrean more toward my part of the woods. It was raining cats and dogs but I was craving some raw meat. And they had Gored Gored. And I was solo. And my friends and family can do kitfo but not gored gored.Enter Habesha! Located in a little strip mall I almost missed it. Signage still advertises some Greek gyros joint. In the rain it looked pretty wretched. My first surprise came when I looked at the menu. The dishes were labelled trilingually in English as well as transliterated Tigrinya and Amharic. The owner/operator/waiter was extremely pleasant and friendly. I ordered my gored gored raw and some misir wot/birsin. The injera was made with a teff sourdough as it should be. The gored gored was very tasty, the meat of excellent quality, not tough or stringy. The misir wot was good though not the best I've had. (That award still goes to Lalibela in Frankfurt, Germany.) During my meal which was washed down with Harar lager, I had a pleasant conversation with the owner who gave me some more tips around tibs and other dishes including gored gored.As always I had too much food.  And as always I asked for a box to take the leftovers. Now I have to tell a secret about me: I hate leftovers much to the chagrin of friends and family. And I think there's little worse than mixed up Ethiopian food all covered by cold injera. (I take leftovers with me so that it doesn't appear like I didn't like the food. I'm just a grazer not a binger and I order too much. But they usually end up either in the trash or somewhere for a homeless person.)So today was a first: I nuked the injera with the birsin and quickly warmed up the gored gored in a pan with French salted butter and some Harissa infused olive oil from old sac. (The owner told me that most ex-pats do like it quickly tossed in a hot pan and my mixture was the closest to niter kibeh I could come.) I actually had leftover Eritrean food! The gored gored turned out even better than last night thanks to the culinary advice. WOW! YUM-O!!!
<review# 1390,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2012,5/29/2012,826,495,8,10,10>Perkos is perky! Especially the attitude of the waitresses and, um, other things that have yet to suffer the ravages of age.That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by the place. The interior is much nicer than your standard diner and actually reminded me of a ski lodge. Plus there are even flat screen TVs so you can catch ESPN while eating.Service was excellent and my steak and eggs was quick, tasty, and very well done. Since it's just down the street from 24 Hour Fitness, this is a great place to get your post-workout protein!Oh, and as for the comments in other reviews about the young, pretty servers, they are basically just high school girls and I was pleased to see that the restaurant supports and sponsors activities at both Rosemont High School and Capital Christian School. I'm guessing those two schools are where most of the waitstaff is from and Perkos definitely deserves credit for supporting its local community.If you want basic, tasty food, Perkos is an excellent option for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

The service: My husband and I went opening night and the service was great! Everyone was so friendly and, even though it was a bit crowded, we were helped right away and our food was out quickly. The beer: Great selection of craft beer; with 20 on tap and about 20 bottled choices. It was so impressed by the beer selection that I had a hard time choosing... no problem, the bartender poured a few tasters to help me narrow it down!The food: You had me at mac and cheese! I have a few mac and cheese spots around the Sac area but this place tops em all. Four different mac and cheese options that all sound amazing! I ordered the tri-tip mac and cheese (yep, I said tri-tip mac and cheese!) SO YUM! The portions are huge and come with a side. They also have a good selection of salads and sandos, which I plan on trying in the near future. Can't wait to go back!

My friends, who are in the 27-30 age range, invited me to check out Sac and said I'd like the music, I gave it a go. I get there with a friend, we have to pay $5 cover on a SUNDAY NIGHT. Apparently, it's crackin on Sunday nights too so we didn't care about the charge. We walk up these fancy stairs into a very spacious, lounge-y, and classy bar. It was really beautiful, their bathrooms are nicely set up (they have a person who hands you paper towels), and they have an outdoor patio for you to chill and do your thing. Drinks were super cheap that night, I believe I got good sized vodka shots for $6 bucks!!!!! Crazy right?! That adds a star to my rating. The music was also really poppin' playin top 40s, club electro house music, and anything I could dance to. BUT... I noticed I was probably one of the only ones who was drinking and getting dance crazy. Maybe older people can take hella drinks and not show any sign of drunkeness. They were coherent enough to smoke, dance, drink, and talk, and laugh to people. Minus a star for not being able to mix well with the crowd.Again, good looking older women, old rich guys, and good looking older women. That's the MIX.

As for the meals: the Benedict Arnold was pretty damn good, as was the Corned Beef and Hash: hearty, TON of food on the plate (husband and I each had 1/2 fruit 1/2 potatoes)... very breakfasty, satisfying.  Not brain-melting delicious, mind you... but very good. As an afterthought, we decided to get some scones.The sconesOh, the scones.*thud*Right now, as I type this review, I'm literally disappointed I don't have one to shove in my mouth. We had an olallieberry and a blueberry. Warm, soft, glorious. Perfect texture. And with the Devonshire Cream slathered on top?? OH MY GOD. It also comes with lemon curd, jelly... those are great. Sure. But the DEVONSHIRE CREAM... I wanna fill my purse with it. I wanna give it to strangers, to bring them joy. I wanna rub in my eyes.On a scone? Fuggedaboudit. They have a huge mimosa menu too, which was also awesome. Did I mention the scones?Verdict: Go. Seriously. Suck it up, wait, eat a scone. For the love of Burt Reynolds, I hope they live up to my ranting... 'cause for us, they were epic.

Easy to park in the attached parking garage, Chicago Fire sits right on the street and adjacent to Whole Foods.We came in early on a busy holiday night (mid-week, but still busy) and the friendly staff was able to accommodate our party of 20. We called for a reservation for that evening, but they were booked. They told us if we got there early, there shouldn't be too long of a wait. And they were right! We had great, prompt service and they got all 20 orders correct. Not an easy feat!Decor is comfy and inviting and even though the ceilings are high, it's not overly noisy. It's a pizza joint, so it's kid and family-friendly. I'm not really a fan of deep dish pizza so we got two thin crust pizzas - the Traditional (which is a margherita) and a pepperoni. Hubby and I also split a wedge salad. Everything was fresh and prepared perfectly. One note however...they don't serve pitchers of beer. They have beer by the pint and 22 ounces; just not by the pitcher. All in all, a great experience. I'll be back!Pros:Good food at a reasonable priceExcellent serviceEasy parkingCons:If you're not into kids and families, this might not be your place.
<review# 1395,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/19/2011,5/24/2012,317,342,5,13,9>Watch out for Pork Belly Grub Shack when driving on Truxel, because you might miss it since it is behind the empty building that formerly housed La Bou and other disappointing attempts.Pork belly has been gaining steam as a popular item to many menus, so of course I came with my girlfriend this afternoon, and wanted to try EVERYTHING!!!  The restaurant itself doesn't have much on the walls, and is a little small., with about 10 tables.  Service was a little slow, but that could be attributed to the small rush of folks ordering.  The pork belly street tacos are ridonkulous!  They are street tacos, so they are kinda small, but they were filled to the max with the sumptuous crunchy pork belly, and topped with vinegar-y daikon and carrots.  The pork belly fries were topped with chunks of blue cheese, pork belly, and a white sauce that had a hint of citrus and parsley.  By the time we got to near the bottom of the box of fries, there wasn't much of the toppings left.  I would've liked a little more of the toppings, especially the sauce, as it was rather tasty and not too heavy.  The burger was just okay.  The taste of the pork belly got lost in the patty and cheese and light lettuce.  I will come back for the banh mi sandwich, it will be worth it.  Fair warning, they are only open from 11:00 am to 6:00 pm.  I hope this place survives.  I can easily see what they offer on a food truck.
<review# 1396,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/21/2011,5/23/2012,319,199,6,10,10>I have often driven by Zocalo and thought it looked like an art deco movie scene ripped straight out of the 30's (minus the actual patrons). Then I discovered this swanky mexican restaurant was offering a bargain menu for Yelp Eats week, so I figured I was time to actually step foot inside and give it a try.First off, this place is unquestionably one of the "prettiest" dining atmospheres I have ever eaten in. It feels like a cathedral inside, loaded with ornamental lighting, beautiful chandeliers, and lush ferns throughout. They also have one of the nicest patio's in midtown.I tried the empanadas to start. I was expecting a couple petite little treats, and what I got were three big fat delicious chewy empanadas stuffed with tasty shredded beef. Those alone could be an entire meal.For an entree, I went with the "Cochinita Pibil" Described in the menu as smoked shoulder of pork in an achiote rub, achiote glaze. It was tender, sweet, smoky and DELICIOUS. Served with warm house made corn tortillas and beans/rice.  The rice was especially good, they mix in some kind of citrus cilantro sauce that makes it really stand out from the typical "side of rice".Then for dessert, the key lime pie. It's really more of a key lime custard with graham cracker crust. The texture is creamier and more like ice cream, but the overall flavor should satisfying any key lime pie lover. I always enjoy when I can see little flecks of the lime rind incorporated into the filling.I'm really happy I gave Zocalo a shot. They quickly won me over and will be at the top of my list next time I'm in the mood for a high end, high quality mexican meal.
<review# 1397,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/14/2011,5/22/2012,466,199,18,14,15>This is a great place to try a bunch of wine if you don't know what you're into.  I do know what I'm into and can tell you they've got a great selection of le olde Pinot Noir.    They'll pour you a 3 oz. taste or a 6 oz. glass and there's not a spit bucket in sight.  As Dr. Steve Brule says, "no way Jose am I spitting this stuff out - it tastes like fruit!"  The servers and bartenders are well-versed in their product but aren't the least bit pretentious about it.  They can provide recommendations if you tell them what you're looking for.  You know, like "black pepper and cherries" or "stinky gym socks and morning dew".Back in my single days, my friends and I would swing by 58 and sit at the bar.  We figured we would meet a higher caliber of men at a wine bar than, say, Old Tavern.  However, this is a great date spot so not many singles in sight.  58 should be your first stop to set the mood right, if you know what I mean.  For a "wink wink nudge nudge" kind of night.  For a "romantic evening".  For a little "something something" later on.  For "the sex".
<review# 1398,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2012,5/21/2012,1070,429,15,20,26>It was September 9th, two days after we had moved into our place in Davis. My boyfriend and I were sitting on our couch, trying to decide what to do with the rest of our day. Coated in a thin film of dust and sweat after packing, moving, driving, more moving, and unpacking, we had a couple of options.Me: "Well I suppose today's the day we go to Ikea."Him: "I guess we could go to Ikea. Maybe we can stop at the Animal Services over in Woodland on the way."Me: "Oh yeah, that's a good idea. Why don't we just drop by and see if there are any cute puppies?"Him: "Yeah sure, let's check them out."You see, the boyfriend and I had puppy fever unlike anything anyone had ever seen. I lived on petfinder.com, sent photos of prospective puppy adoptions to annoyed friends, and harassed a few breeders in Northern California until I realized that there was no way I could afford to buy a dog. We had specifically chosen our apartment complex because it allowed dogs, and we had hypothesized for months about what life would be like once we had a little pup to keep us busy. When we arrived at the Animal Services building, I must say it was pretty intimidating. The building is a part of the Sheriff's office, so all of the employees are in uniform and looking oh-so-very-official. And I'm not sure what we expected to find, as the dogs they had listed on petfinder weren't really what we were looking for. But we pressed on. They escorted us into the dogs' area, and we heard the barks and howls from the cages in front of us. A couple of pitbulls, a little chihuahua mix, and then we saw her. The most adorable little black labrador mix ever. She couldn't have been more than a couple of months old, and she was very interested in us, but she didn't bark or whine. We liked that. Cute little floppy ears, big brown eyes, and a wiggly tail that couldn't stop moving. After that, I have to admit that I don't remember a lot of the details. I remember them saying she had only been there for a day, and her sister had already been adopted. That we had swooped her up over another couple because we had our apartment complex's animal policy and they didn't. I remember her being so scared that she threw up in the car. I remember having to stop at Petco on the way home to get basic pet supplies, because even though we had planned on getting a dog forever, we hadn't actually thought about what would happen when we brought her home. I remember us going through a couple of names before settling on naming her after one of my boyfriend's favorite comediennes. And I remember hugging her so hard once we got home because I had wanted her for so long and there she was, in my arms and in my apartment. I never had a dog growing up. I was fully a cat person. But my little puppy is now eight months old and is one of the brightest spots in my life. She is everything I wanted - sweet, friendly, active, snuggly, goofy. Now that she's bigger, we get people telling us that she looks like a cross between a lab and a german shepherd. Lab, shepherd, it doesn't matter to me. I love her to pieces, and had we decided to go to Ikea instead of Animal Services, she most likely wouldn't be ours. She'd be the same happy dog going by a different name in a different home. But I love my little Lucy. And when the time comes to give her a friend, I know where I'll find her Ricky.

This is probably my favorite club in Sacramento and its the closest thing you can find to an LA, Scottsdale or Vegas atmosphere in the area. The people are friendly, the staff does a good job of taking care of you and the design of the place is great. Whether you choose to sit on one of the couches inside or out, one of the funky chairs or even at the bar you can have fun. Sure it's pricey and there are definitely some cougars on the prowl, but its a refreshing change from the hipster-wanna-be's drinking their PBR's at every other dive. So if you want a fun night out, dress up a little bit and hit the Mix.
<review# 1401,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/29/2009,1/27/2010,177,474,,14,4>My daughter is enrolled here in the "Blue Class" under Misses Jenny and Jessica.  This is the Pre-K class; although Rainbow Daycare has full time daycare, they also have preschool components.  Preschool covers numbers, letters, some science, and lots of art.  The kids really get to explore and pretend and be part of the school.  There is also an infant-toddler room, a class for the 2 y.o. children, and the class for the 3 y.o. children.  There is seamless transition, and all of the children have a chance to interact and play with each other.  This is an amazing experience for my daughter, who is an only child.We love Rainbow Daycare.  The parents are required to complete participation hours, which is fun.  The school is well-managed and small enough to accomodate special requests personally.  I also really like the snacks.We loved our previous daycare (it closed down), but the biggest beef I had with them were the snacks and meals, and then they cut their lunch program.  My kid always brought the most ridiculously healthy brown bag lunches.  At Rainbow?  I don't even worry!  Their meals include veggies and fruit, whole grains, and they've even had families bring special items to share with others (we brought a pile of seaweed rice crackers and edamame.)I also truly appreciate the diversity in staff ethnic make up and culture.  It brings different traditions together and helps kids explore other cultural elements as well as helping children feel "part of something" because they are so open and welcoming, and because "different" is the norm.  I love it!!I will be sad when we leave to have her attend kindergarten, but I know that with the care and teaching at her school now, she will be quite prepared for what is to come in her future.Also, Rainbow Day Care is very flexible for scheduling.  We pay $660 for 4 days a week for one child (we are furloughing state workers with most Fridays off.)  We find this affordable, though it's more than what we paid before for full time.  It's also closer to our offices, which means we all commute to and from downtown together!
<review# 1402,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/1/2010,1/26/2010,437,1330,4,8,6>I just ate there tonight and the owners have changed (as of 9 days ago).  I don't know the old menu but the new menu consist a lot of mayo-like rolls and other dishes you'd get typically.... think Akebono. It wasn't wow, it wasn't bad.  Prices were very reasonable and quality was above what you're paying for.   What I'm sad about is that this place, with the old owner, may have been the last izakaya-like place left in Sacramento.    Sorry to see Sac Japanese food scene just reduced to sushi places and a single ramen place.
<review# 1403,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2010,1/25/2010,79,134,4,7,5>Cut & Go isn't my normal haircut shop, but if I'm in a hurry, or need a last minute cut, I don't hesitate to go see Art.  He does a very good and thorough job.  It's $15 (cash) and there usually isn't much of a wait.  He has at least 1 other stylist there and she does a good job too, but I always prefer Art.  He is friendly and once you go a few times, he'll definitely start to remember who you are. I would normally probably only give this place 4 stars, but today I'm giving it 5 stars because I don't think that many people will review this place and I want Cut & Go's rating to be high.

<review# 1405,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2010,1/23/2010,249,140,3,5,5>What a great place to see some all ages music. Last Saturday I got to enjoy The Nickel Slots play a all ages gig here. The sound is pretty good, not overpowering, and loud enough that you know you are listening to a band. Coffee was good, the girl at the counter seemed a bit overwhelmed with all of her orders. She was nice enough to find people in the crowd while the band played and personally deliver cups of coffee. Great atmosphere, and a great place to enjoy local live music.
<review# 1406,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/6/2010,1/22/2010,356,378,4,5,7>I try to think of myself as a down to earth kind of gal, so I feel a little uncomfortable at places like The Shady Lady, but I have to give it the major props it deserves. First, their Pecan Pie is off the hook! Top that with vanilla ice cream, as my friend would put it, "My mouth is having an orgasm right about now!" Secondly, they take their cocktails very seriously. They like to put a lot of this and that, and more this and that into all of their drinks. Every drink is a special concoction. And lastly, they have awesome decor. The red patterned wallpaper alongside the beautiful chandelier at the bar, topped with dark woods and dim lighting makes this a pretty classy joint. The Shady Lady isn't as shady as she wanted to be.

The idea of a custom winery caught my fancy....since well...karaoke is SO not my thing...I make the drive from our office east... exit right on Hazel ..left on Folsom...left into the parking lot. *bump...bump...bump* More speed bumps in the parking lot..well more like dips...reverse speed bumps. There was almost no parking. It was super hot (back in July)...my clothes stuck to my skin as I made my way to the door.Looking around I realized the building was full of businesses...everything from a comedy club to glow in the dark mini golf. Most of the traffic was there for comedy I thought...made my way inside.The interior of the building seemed cheesy. Fake trees...exposed brick...tile floors (way slippery when wet) ...Music came pouring out of the small rectangular space...a man who was trying to be 25 when he was really 55 was singing a song that made my ears want to bleed...but everyone inside was having a good time...We sat down and were immediately greeted by the staff. My friend frequents the place...so they knew what she wanted already..but they were all smiles.Ok....best part about this place?? The ability to taste everything they have!! I spent time finding that perfect glass and now...I just walk in and order a bottle....I always find myself comfortable...welcomed...and happy to be at Vintners...I go there to write.. play games with friends...snack on amazing cheese and yummy snacks...taste new wines...and eventually I will go there and bottle my own.You see...up there in the title.. it says Custom Winery! Thats right folks...you can make...bottle...label...age your own wine. You can make batches as gifts...(knocks the price of a bottle WAY down) or you can just make a custom label or two for a wine they already have ready... I made a bottle for my mom on her birthday. They helped me pick the font and the colours....it was a blast...they work fast and the cost is minimal... There is a lot more to be said (we are talking TONS here people)...but I cant even gather all my good thoughts up and compress them enough to make it into this review. I love the place...I love the owners...I love the staff...So... GO GO!! Let them know you found them on yelp...and you can even buy me a glass of Berry Charming if I am there (which I probably will be!) ..yes yes...sit there...on their indoor patio...with an outdoor feel... enjoy the wine...taste everything...and snack on a thing or two...
<review# 1409,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2011,3/6/2012,305,464,12,12,12>So, I'm an admitted food-nerd, and kitchen goddess (in my own mind, of course). I love to cook, eat, and experiment in the kitchen... sometimes much to the chagrin of the oldman, and his picky food habits. And, I have been pining away for just one piece of Le Creuset enameled cast iron... any size, any color - I just wanted one. Warning, kitchen nerds... one will never be enough. Once you get one, you'll find another reason for another size. And damnit, this is the place to procure your dream-cookery items. The store is nicely organized by color. Some items are "seconds", but you can still get the lifetime warranty. And, some items are discontinued colors - still get the lifetime warranty. In my humble opine, all of the colors are beautiful. So why not go for the discontinued color that happens to be on sale!? I now have three lovely pieces in various colors (someone is trying to keep me in the kitchen), one discontinued exclusive blue for Williams Sonoma. Eh, blue schmoo. I don't care, as long it makes me feel like a kitchen goddess. Be sure to get on their snail-mailing (they don't email) list, to get the latest information on their monthly sales. I just got mine in they mail, yesterday!
<review# 1410,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2011,3/5/2012,210,713,12,12,12>If you just want to stuff yourself silly without paying too much, Fuji is definitely the place to go to. You should plan on coming here before the doors even open, because there is always a line. This way you can maximize your eating time. Skip the conveyor belt. What you need to do is go up to the sides of the bar near the kitchen and catch the attention of one of the sushi chefs/cooks and order through them. If there is a roll you like, you can ask them to make a full sized one for you. I would recommend getting the fried platter. They have tempura shrimp, calamari, oysters, and soft-shelled crab.  I like ordering seared tuna and salmon as well. I wish they had an actual menu though. I feel like I'm missing out on some good stuff.Chinese food is available. I usually don't bother eating from this section but may get some cooked seafood- oysters, clams, shrimp, etc. Grab some fruit too, so you can pretend you ate a healthy meal.I came here near closing time for lunch and saw everything was cleared off the conveyor belt. I wonder where the leftovers go. Trash, serve it again for dinner, or take it home? I don't know. I'm not sure I want to know.
<review# 1411,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/23/2011,3/4/2012,280,194,7,7,9>It's an uphill battle with these Japanese startup fast food establishments. First off, inside is nice and open, huge ceilings and high chairs with tables. They have contemporary music over the speakers and large flat screen TV's to distract you. They do serve several beers on tap. The kitchen area is open and clean, I like that. The food is average. I ordered a Thai Chicken plate with a side of Spicy Tuna roll. The chicken was smothered in garlic chili paste, not what I was expecting for a Thai dish at all. It sort of defeated the purpose of a flavorful meal descending into a drenched chicken with garlic chili paste sauce. The Spicy Tuna roll was a regular 8 piece tuna roll with what looked like Cayenne pepper flakes, no Sirracha. I love that they have Fanta soda at the fountain. It's an environment establishment more than a food lovers hole in the wall. With it's distractions, and well lit large windows and open patio, it was a nice way to kill some time. Service was top notch, very professional. When it slowed down a bit, they was mopping inside the kitchen instead of standing around.
<review# 1412,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2011,3/3/2012,105,253,,10,4>Best gelato in Sacramento by far.  I never really liked gelato before going to Italy and learning what real, fresh, tasty gelato was like.  The stuff sold in America that I've tried was always really dense, hard, full of artificial flavoring, and just not as good as ice cream. In Italy I saw the light, I became obsessed with gelato, I had it everyday I was there, sometimes even twice a day.  I developed a gelato sense, where I could tell just by looking at the gelato whether or not it'd be good. Coming back to US, I've been looking everywhere for some good gelato, and finally I can say I've found my place to get my hazelnut gelato fix.  After anticipating the opening of Devine for ages, I finally saw it open today.  When I walked inside my gelato eye told me this was going to be at least good gelato.  I am happy to say that this is pretty awesome gelato.  The gelato is fresh and I can taste the ingredients in all the gelatos and sorbrettos instead of artificial flavorings.  Pear sorbretto was made from pears and I could even taste and feel the pear texture.  Same for all the other fruit flavors.  And the hazelnut had that lovely creaminess from real hazelnuts.  Hazelnut was and still is my favorite flavor, and Devine does it justice. Everyone here was extremely friendly and very generous with samples.  I would say that Devine is a good addition to the midtown grid.
<review# 1413,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2012,3/2/2012,151,185,9,8,13>Excuse me, did you say a cool hip bar, that's intimate yet fun and is not a chain, and it's in Rocklin?!  EXACTLY!  All of that is true and you can only find it at Boneshaker.  I'm a beer girl, and their selection was amazing,and it's not your typical stuff.  JJ helped us out and was very informative. I tried something light at first, which of course I can't remember the name right now, but then I had to go darker.  It was a toss up between the Coconut Porter and the Lost Coast Imperial Stout.  After a tough choice I went with the Coconut Porter, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I didn't order the food, but I did get to try a few bites of the mac and cheese, and can you say, "love at first bite"?  I definitely will be back to indulge in the mac and cheese with some great beer.  Great service, everyone was super friendly and helpful.  I'll be back for sure!

Plus they have real ceviche de pescado.My ceviche and tacos al pastor y asada were great.

<review# 1416,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2012,2/28/2012,1070,429,14,9,10>Ladies and gentlemen, I am back on the wagon. For the past year and a half, I've found myself indulging in bad habits and I've seen my waistline balloon into freshman year of college "Why YES, I AM on the cookie diet" territory.But I have renewed the pact with my running shoes, and as of three weeks ago, I'm gearing up to run my 5th half marathon in March. Those of you familiar with such a pact know that it entails long calorie-sucking runs early on weekend mornings, followed by lethargic afternoons with iced-up calves and quads. After such an endeavor had led me on a 7-mile jaunt of South Davis, I was starving. I could've eaten a hippopotamus if they were indigenous to Yolo County. Alas, they are not, and we had tired of the diner brunches of Davis, so off to Putah Creek Cafe we went!When we arrive there was a wait, but my boyfriend and I wait for no one, so we promptly scooped up the available seating at the counter. Even the B.O. of the dude next to me could not deter me from salivating over every item on the menu. It all looked so good, and I was already at 600 negative calories for the day. Bring on the grease!I went with the Rancher's Breakfast, a two-plate monstrosity of every breakfast item under the sun. It was fantastic, but the praise has to go to the bacon. Bacon, while delicious, is a pretty easy thing for a diner to f up. It can very quickly go from fantastic to underwhelming, especially if it's undercooked or burnt to a crisp. Putah Creek's hit a perfect medium, and even better, they gave me what seemed like 6 strips. My boyfriend got the Putah Creek Scramble, and I think he had wolfed it down in the time it took me to decide which plate to start on. And so yes, I will be back. And hopefully, while I'm running up a storm. Otherwise, with the kind of deliciously bad for you food they serve, I'll be offering up such lovely anecdotes as "Why YES, love handles ARE a part of my new look!"
<review# 1417,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/13/2011,2/27/2012,466,199,10,20,17>I woke up the next morning and wanted more.  Monsoon's food is absolutely delicious.At first we were disappointed that they do not have a thali available.  If you're not familiar, a thali is like a bento box for Indian food.  You get your main entree, plus rice, soup, a couple of side items.  This is usually a good deal if you're not sure about a place and want to try a few items.  Since this was our first time, that seemed to be the way to go but it is not an option.Instead, we ordered the veggie samosas, Monsoon Prawns Curry for me, Chicken Tikka Masala for him.  The entrees do come with rice and a choice of naan (we went with plain) and we added on the potato and cilantro parantha (kind of like naan but with a layer of potato between the naan layers).The samosas were fantastic, inside and out.  They dust the outside of them with a salty spice and I had to remember to act like a lady and not lick my fingers.  The parantha that I slathered with spicy green chutney almost spoiled my appetite but I slowed it down a bit and waited for our entrees.  He loved the Chicken Tikka.  I don't eat chicken but I tasted some of the sauce on my naan and it was very flavorful and not overly creamy.  They nailed it with the Monsoon Prawns Curry.  They didn't skimp on the herbs and the flavor combo was perfect.  Naan from the other side of the table kept sneaking onto my plate to dip into the sauce.  There are so many dishes there that I want to try but this was so good I don't know how I'm going to order something else next time.  First world problems indeed.After polishing off everything we agreed that a thali would have been completely unnecessary.  We were at capacity and there was nothing lacking.  Our server, Ford, was great and I'm sure we'll see a lot of each other in the near future.
<review# 1418,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/29/2011,2/26/2012,147,109,4,9,6>Let me get this out of the way first and foremost: Five stars for sweet gourmet f*ckin' burgers (yes, I actually swore, it's so f*ckin' good) but one star deduction for incredibly slooooowwwwww service.  Forgive me, I get it. It's gourmet, and it's amazing, it's fine to wait for some things. But Davin, if you're reading this- let it be known, the slow service is deterring me and many folks from visiting (again).  However, for those willing to wait an hour+ during your lunch break for these incredible mini-creations, keep reading my friends...We're talking about a stylish lookin' food truck that has immediate appeal and a 30 person line along the side.  The menu is simple, four different burgers to tickle your palate in all sorts of ways you'd only wish every burger could be.   Buy a single, a two-pack or three-pack.  Sweet potato taters are like nothing you've ever had before and the hand cut fries are worth passing up for another burger ;)The process is simple: Find location via Twitter. Wait. Wait. Wait some more. Order. Wait. Wait. EAT!  And when you finally bite into that perfectly juicy, amazingly flavorful burger- you realize the wait, no matter how long, was actually worth it.  And then you repeat, two or three more times, depending on how many burgers you get.  Let the burgeritis ensue!
<review# 1419,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/4/2013,6/1/2014,89,66,10,17,12>This review is for people like me, who have NEVER COOKED A STEAK in their entire lives, but who enjoy a good steak once or twice a year... as long as it is cooked MEDIUM-WELL or WELL, and who are afraid of the pink in a steak.I admit it: I am that person. Arthur Henry's Supper Club & Ruby Room is a gem of a joint in Oak Park. The dimly lit interior has class and style, and it is the kind of place that would have been filled with the cast of MadMen and cigarette smoke if it the world was frozen in 1964.I attended the soft launch and wasn't prepared for the "cook your own steak" part of the meal. I don't even know the cuts of a steak, let alone know how to cook one.The staff at the Supper Club was very helpful, answering my cook questions as I gingerly peeled saran wrap from the raw block of red meat. I set the stopwatch on my iPhone for 7 minutes to cook side one of my fillet Mignon, then flipped the cut and cooked for another 5 minutes. Apparently that is not long enough to cook a fillet (it is thick--I told you I don't know what I am doing!), so I threw the steak back on the grill for another 2 minutes, each side. It was still super red so I threw it on the grill again... and again.By the time my steak was "done" (a decent medium well) everyone in my party was done with their food. So I had to eat alone.But I didn't care... because my fillet was freakin' tasty! I tried it alone, with steak sauce, and with the side of blue cheese chunks. All parts of the steak were badass... and I couldn't complain about the cook because I was the one who made it.I left the Super Club satisfied and full, with a sense of accomplishment. This could be the most unique sensation I have ever experienced at a restaurant.COOKING TIP for people who like a steak MEDIUM WELL:I believe the total cook time for my steak was 13 minutes on one side, 11 minutes on the other side. Don't cook it in the flame-area or it will burn and not cook through.TIP FOR ALL DINERS:Have the person in your group who likes well-done steak start cooking their meat first. Then add on the other steaks based on the countdown clock, with the portobello mushrooms cooked last. This is important if you all want to eat at the same time.
<review# 1420,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,5/31/2014,161,382,8,14,11>The short version: A secluded area for hiking close to Sactown where there are difficult trails and no cell service to speak of. My new fall back hiking location.The basics: In my search for a new local or semi local hiking spot I stumbled on this secluded spot and decided to check it out. It fit my needs which were within an hour from home and gains in elevation with some challenge involved. There are two parking areas and street side overflow for people coming to enjoy the nature. It should be noted that after about 11am the parking is overflowing and you may have to search a bit. I also heard rumors about people breaking into cars here so don't leave valuables visible. That being said I found the trail head easy enough and once inside there was plenty of signage telling you where to go and what to expect. Dogs are allowed on some parts of the trails and in the parts they aren't I still ran across quite a few. Personally I wouldn't take my dogs here because it is drowning in ticks and I don't want the headache. The first mile of the trail is pretty simple and straight forward and it leads to the second section of the trail which is where you are going to feel the burn. For another 2-3 miles you will climb stairs and boulders and just basically go up and up. There are some really nice views when you reach the top and you will go over about 4 other peaks on the trail if you take the entire loop. The last section on the trail down is pretty much switchback after switchback and nothing too special. This is definitely more of a workout hike than a relax in quiet nature hike since there are a lot of college students hiking out here and they are just loud. Also there are a lot of rocky areas where you should watch your step. It would be a bad day if you were to get hurt way out in the middle of nowhere.What works: Easy access parking and clearly marked trailsWhat to improve: Not much of anything I can think of.
<review# 1421,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2014,5/30/2014,52,78,17,16,16>Well this is my review for the food not the joint itself as I myself did not go there but my sexy green eyed woman did. Thanks baby.So my woman heads over to Chando's tacos and is texting me as she is in line and how there's cars just flying by and the hood isn't all that great but she is prepared with a double shooter of O/C spray, you an never be too careful especially when it comes to Chando's tacos, well according to the reviews.My woman gets back to our vacation spot and she brings in these tacos and a burrito, 2 asada tacos, 2 chicken tacos and a Asada burrito to split, mmmmmmmmOk so the chicken taco comes first and the flavor is pretty damn good, the tortillas are soft and the toppings are fresh.Next comes the Asada taco and well I love asada when it's cooked right and Chando does a f*#@en good job at it,  the flavor is awesome and again the toppings are just as good.Finally comes the Asada burrito, same as the taco, the meat is cooked just right, maybe could of been filled a bit more but it was good enough, we really don't need to eat a giant burrito anyways. The Asada from Chando is the best thus far for me here in Sac. But the hunt still continues for the BEST ASADA BURRITO as none compare (YET) to the one's I've had over in los banos (CUTIJA) or the ones in gilroy (SUPER TAQUERIA) but Chando is right there on top of the list and well Chando's in the lead here in Sacramento.Since I only had the experience of the food and not the customer service, dealing with the traffic or lines I wil give Chando's Tacos 5 stars on the food alone and they are well deserved.

Walking into Hoicin I was immediately brought back to being 5 years old staring up at all of the live fish and crustaceans swimming and hopping about in their tanks....yes I'm a little taller now and we're at eye-level but you get the picture.I have been needing and feening for some good soup. Wasn't in a pho kind of mood....ramen wasn't really what I was craving....Enter the epiphany known as Wor Wonton Soup. Thank you to Christina M. for suggesting this diamond in the rough....It's literally in the rough I'm talking in one Rancho Cordova's finest areas. Let's face it though...if you want some legit food sometimes the uglier the hood, the better the food.Placed my order over the phone for pick-up and eagerly waited for my 10 minute time limit to pass by. Wait for it...wait for it.....OK LET'S GO! I was greeted right away upon walking into the restaurant, and my food was ready about a minute later literally as I was done signing my name on the cc receipt.My food:One Large order of Wor Wonton soup and one order of Shanghainese Dumplings. I was so happy to see they put the broth for the soup in its own container (leaving way more room for all the yummy stuff!) There was another container for the wonton's (a generous amount of wontons at that!) and then another container for the squid, prawns, mushrooms (2 different kinds), bok choy, chicken, AND pork! You could tell all of the ingredients listed above had been pan fried and sauteed and in a super yummy sauce. This was a damn good meal and well priced.The dumplings. Oh the dumplings. Due to my um, super awesome driving skills I may or may not have accidentally had to hit the breaks a few times whilest driving home in traffic (IT'S RAIN PEOPLE YOU DRIVE THROUGH IT LIKE NORMAL!!!) sorry. So the sauce that was packed with the dumplings kinda popped open and coated each dumpling. One would think all was lost at this point....but actually the sauce was good!

<review# 1423,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/18/2014,5/28/2014,266,563,8,19,14>Chewy's is the latest incarnation of my beloved chalet-roofed IHOP building, and a pretty interesting place to eat. First, the inside is nicely decorated in a quasi-IKEA modern yet warm style. Second, as soon as we walked in the nice counter lady stopped her food prep to walk out and thank us for coming in/explain the ordering process. Third, DAYMN their menu is pretty big! I wasn't expecting such a wide range of food given the venue. Fourth, breakfast served all day... automatic +1 Yelp star in my book.I ordered the beef cheddar melt sandwich with a side of pasta salad, and he ordered the spicy breakfast cazuela (mainly out of curiosity because neither of us has ever heard of a cazuela, and he works in the food industry!). The food took maybe 5-10 minutes to come out. My sandwich was good, as was my pasta salad. I give them props because I was expecting the standard comes-in-a-big-plastic-tub commercial macaroni salad... this was fresh made with bowtie pasta, fresh vegetables and no mayo. Even though I don't like broccolli and olives, I still appreciated the fresh take on pasta salad! He really enjoyed his cazuela and it *was* pretty spicy, even when my sample bite left out the jalapeno peppers.I'm somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, so I'll round up since Chewy's is just getting off the ground. I'd definitely come back here again to try more of their extensive menu.
<review# 1424,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/7/2014,5/27/2014,149,559,15,23,11>It's a 24 hour gym in Land Park that costs only $39 a month. That's pretty sweet. You can also add other people to your account -- regardless of their relationship to you or whether or not they live with you -- for a discounted rate.Big facility that's pretty nice... not the nicest, but pretty nice, and certainly a great value. At this point (before it gets much more popular) you never have to wait for machines or weights. There are towels. Front desk staff have been helpful and pleasant.Why not 5-stars? Two reasons: 1) Classes are largely offered at really inconvenient times. Apparently, the target group is the Real Housewives of Land Park; and, 2) There is a weird contingent of grunting steroid jokers in the weight room at peak times which can make it uncomfortable for other people to lift, even with loud music playing in one's own headphones. You can work around this by lifting at off-peak times.

So whenever I think about donuts, this is the first place that comes to mind. Why? Because the donuts are simply super good here! They're always extra tall and fluffy, they're made fresh daily and great prices. Also, the owners are very friendly and patient. My personal favorites are the: Raspberry filled donuts, Glazed French donuts and the Cinnamon rolls! Oh and they have a DOZEN donut holes for just $1 =) So if you're looking for some yummy donuts, give this place a try, you won't regret it!

A plus being that it was lunch time.  We started the meal with shrimp spring rolls.  Fresh and tasty, served with a side of peanut/soy sauce.  Not bad.I ordered Bun with charbroiled pork and egg rolls for my entree and I could not believe how BIG the portion was!  A giant bowl of vermicelli noodles, shredded lettuce, carrots, a ton of charbroiled pork, and a side of fish sauce.  (I didn't count this against them in the review but I had wished that the meal came with a little more sauce.)  That said, I had enough food for two meals... well worth the money spent!  The pork was tender and tasty, the noodles soft and fresh.  The only thing that I am used to having with Bun that wasn't on my plate... mint leaves.  No biggie, it was still delish!I plan to return soon!
<review# 1427,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,5/24/2014,136,282,9,14,10>I randomly stumbled upon this spot while I was out. I searched for donuts on the yelp app and this one was near me. I am so glad I found it! The donuts I got here were really good. They do have cronuts but called them doissants I think. In case you don't know, its basically a cross between a donut and a croissant. They made it fresh right then and it was delicious. Note you do have to wait if they do that for it to cook. I highly recommend it though as it was pretty yummy. I also got an apple fritter that was pretty tasty. Did I eat all these pastry items in one day? Yep! Not all at once but over the course of the day I did. I will come back to this spot. I noticed they sell croissants and donut holes too. They also serve coffee and maybe some other beverages that I didn't notice. I can say I recommend this donut shop. Also they had a little deal for checking in on the yelp app.
<review# 1428,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/2/2013,5/23/2014,113,255,10,20,16>Plates2go is my go to place for lunch. Quick, friendly service, good food, mind blowing chocolate chip cookies and women working for a better future, what's not to love about this place. Plates is conveniently located in the handle district and you can order from the full menu or grab something from the display case. I always get the organic greens salad which comes with walnuts, raspberries, blueberries and goat cheese. It's finished with the best sherry vinaigrette I've ever had. When I'm feeling really gluttonous I finish my meal with their famous cookie larger than my head. Because I work in the area they also offer delivery which is such a nice alternative on busy days. Plates is run by the women of St. John's Shelter. Here women get hands on work experience and usually find full time employment through the training program. I fully support any woman who works for a better future. Sure the food is good, but knowing the difference they make in our community makes me come back here week after week. It's the only time I don't feel guilty for going out to lunch. It's money well spent.
<review# 1429,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/19/2006,12/30/2006,4,68,1,5,1>Jack's is like a grown-up cafeteria. But unlike a cafeteria that you might see in, say, a middle school where kids are filed neatly in a line picking out their food and waiting patiently for the cashier to ring them up, Jacks has no discernible order. Not that it's a bad thing, just an observation.I just think that if you have a line for just salad, then you should somehow let people know that that line is only for salad so that people who want sandwiches know to go to the other line that looks like it's part of the salad line, but is really for sandwiches and etc. Good thing I was there with someone who was in the know or else then I would have been red-faced, and I would have wasted my time with all the salad people.  (In all fairness, if I were a "local," I'd probably know about this, so it wouldn't be a big deal.) Anyways, the sandwich I got (Jack's special - Chicken) was not bad, but I don't think it was all that good either. The urban fries were tasty though, but then I'm a sucker for all things fried.
<review# 1430,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/20/2006,12/29/2006,8,78,1,3,3>I remember going to newsbeat back in the day with my dad. It was a small little shop down an alley across from cafe roma. My dad was able to choose from the many motorcycle magazines and I always got to choose a candy. I am glad the place has expanded and outlived the Borders coming to Davis days. We all held our breath there for a moment when Borders moved in. Newsbeat is truly a unique place. You can find almost ANY magazine, in many languages, lit journals, candies from all over the freaking world, special cigarettes and cigars if your into that thing, and yummy drinks. One of the only places in Davis that sells Jones soda. So I always stop in...Newsbeat is also a dog friendly place and they LOVE it when you bring your pooch in with you. They always keep the doggie treats around. Great place, great products, happy dog friendly people, and any magazine junky's heaven.
<review# 1431,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/20/2006,12/28/2006,15,27,1,8,>Je suis francophile.  That being said, I still think Rolle is worthy of five stars.This little spot across the street from Sellands is unabashedly francais, from the red checker table cloths to the yellow walls to the Edith Piaf CD on constant rotation (If I have to hear "Milord" one more time I think I'll go crazy).  And M. Rolle himself chatting constantly in French and English and singing along with the music.  As far as I can tell, there are at least two people who work with Rolle as wait-staff and both are also friendly and efficient -- one even remembers my son's name and my son is only six weeks old, mais j'espere qu'il parlera francais.The lunch menu is an extensive selection of sandwiches and salads, with variations on the venerable croque monsieur, several kinds of pate, and, of course, salmon, the specialty of the house.  The lunch specials tend to involve a salmon sandwich and a croque monsieur with a special ingredient sauce -- watercress or wasabi, for example.Dessert is usually creme brule, mousse au chocolat, or tarte aux pommes.  The tarte is very good, with the apples resting on a creamy layer of something and a brittle, sweet crust.  But I almost always go for the raspberry creme brule if it is available.  Magnifique!I've eaten dinner here once, shortly after Rolle introduced a dinner menu, something I don't know if he is doing consistently.  Although a bit pricey for the portion size, it was still a fine meal made better by the chatty waiter and a surprisingly good vigonier.  Rolle has a very limited wine selection, but he won't serve you swill.I probably should, but I refuse to dock him a point because he tends to close at random times. Sometimes this is because he goes on vacation, but sometimes it is because he has a catering client.  I will not insist that M. Rolle be in two places at once, as annoying as it can be to get myself all worked up for the Stacy's Favorite (roast beef and brie sandwich with caramelized onions), only to find him shut.Sacramento's selection of French-based cuisine is paper thin.  We need more like Rolle.

<review# 1435,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/20/2006,12/22/2006,78,82,1,9,3>Are you female and have always wanted to learn to surf?.....or already know how to surf, but want to get more instruction, NOT freeze your ass offf and actually be able to wear a bathing suit in the water? Or maybe you are already a fantasitc surfer, but don't feel comfortable travelling to Costa Rica by yourself for a surf vacation?  If this is you, I HIGHLY suggest booking a trip with Pura Vida Adventures.  An amazing woman and friend of mine, Tierza, started this business about 4 years ago, and I was part of the very first all girls camp.....and I can't possibly iterate how empowering, fun, beautiful and enriching my experience was....probably because of all the tequila I drank while I was there.  My memory is a little foggy ;-)  I fell so in love with the area, Malpias and  Santa Teresa, that I now travel back on my own to enjoy the same beautiful coastline, waves, rainforests, and people (THE HOTTEST men I have EVER seen living in one tiny area in my life!!)Here's a great quote that a girl from my camp wrote at the end of our trip...I think she sums it up very well:"Start by imagining the perfect week: surfing, yoga, wonderful food, beautiful women, falling asleep to the sound of the waves every night - wake to the sounds of tropical birds in the morning. Maybe see the stars like you've never seen them before. Start telling time by the direction of the wind and the tides. Forget what day it is. How hard can you paddle? Drink? Laugh? Double that, and that's Pura Vida." Although the camp caters to all women groups, they do have some weeks throughout the season that are coed....so, if any guys are interested in this, check out the calendar on their website.  puravidaadventures.com To get a discounted rate, pay 60 days in advance of your trip.  NorCalWomensSurfClub members get an even bigger discount, and  joining NCWSC is free and easy to do on their website.  So, I highly recommend that for savings....and it's a great way to meet other female surfers. This is one of the most amazing times I have had travelling...and I try to travel as much as I can.  It definitely took some months off my life, at least off of my liver, and I think there's a video of me riding a mechanical bull that I wouldn't want my parents to see floating around somewhere on the internet....but, so worth it.  I made friendships that will last a lifetime....and it gave me the confidence to begin travelling solo....Pura Vida
<review# 1436,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/4/2006,12/21/2006,53,66,1,5,>Originally planning to get take out, once we got to the place, we decided to eat in - probably because it was quite cold outside.  A large group of about 10-15 people had just finished their meal, they were making their way out the door just as we got there.  Surprisingly, even without the group, the place was still packed around 7:30pm.  We had to wait in the two large chairs by the door for about 15 minutes or so before the staff asked us if we were waiting for a table.The place is what I would call "cozy" - when few diners are there, it feels just right, but during peak hours, it the place feels full without feeling like sardines.  The lighting is warm and the decor wasn't too exotic, but still felt Thai.  The wood tables were impressive though.After they had cleaned the mess of the large group, we were seated in the corner near the hallway to the back.  We were ready to order since we had been eying the little take out menus earlier:- Chicken Satay- Green Curry with Chicken-Extra Spicy (4/5 on their scale)- Pad Thai- Drunken Noodles (with sliced beef per Amy P.'s suggestion)- I ordered Hot Thai Tea, my friend had Iced Thai Tea, although given the temperature outside, I have no idea what he was thinking.The chicken satay was very tender and flavorful and just the right amount for an appetizer.The curry dish didn't seem to hit the right spot for me. I think the mix of vegetables used wasn't what I was used to in a dish like that so much that it felt like I was eating something completely different.  Regardless, it had the right flavor and was filling.The Pad Thai was very good.  It was my friend's order, so I didn't really get a chance to have much of it.My order was the Drunken Noodles - Again, cooked up the way Amy P. described, this dish was excellent!The Hot Thai Tea was exactly what I was looking for! I enjoy Iced Thai Tea during the warmer months, but other Thai restaurants have only offered hot teas that seemed to come from fancy boxes.  I've been wanting a hot version of the Iced Thai Tea, and this is the first place I've been to that served  it - a pleasant surprise.I was starting to feel full when one of the staff came by and asked how our food was.  I don't know if I said it with a tone or if it just came out wrong (I had been trying to swallow the Drunken Noodles I was finishing off), but I guess I blurted out "May I have some water please?"  As I said that, there was a look of pure appall on his face that made me feel guilty, but his look was probably because of the fact that we had gone through the whole meal without water.  He quickly came back with two glasses and apologized as though I had shamed him, which was definitely not my intention.Gut Reaction Rating would have been 4 stars, but an extra star for tilt.  The trip wasn't so bad, the food was wonderful, and the service was very good - a nice balance to having to wait for a table at first. Plus, my friend and I got a chance to catch up while waiting anyway.Will definitely come by again.Update 2007 02 25 - I ordered take out today of drunken noodles (yay!) and yellow curry, and finally introduced myself to Kevin, who was hard to identify since he cut off his ponytail for the wedding a couple weeks ago.  He was very excited to meet someone who reviewed his establishment on yelp.

It's a great way to get acclimated to the Capitol crowd - members, staffers, lobbyists - and make some great friends too. Perfect place to network. Just be weary of some of the "suits" - they know who they are. Other than that, even the food is pretty good. Except for that one time my friends and I were there and we invited Simon Jr to drink a shot with us and he decided to charge us for his shot too. Shady? yeah just a little.

So you can imagine my surprise walking in and finding out that this wasn't the case.  But even so, just a sandwich and lower in price than expected, considering what was delivered. As I stood in line, I watched person after person walk by with trays overflowing with food. Sandwiches, gravy-covered mashed potatoes, bowls of stew, cole slaw, and so on. "Hey" I thought, "perhaps this isn't so bad.So I reached my turn to order, a BBQ sandwich with nothing less than onions,  which was prepared and delivered to me  in less than 10 seconds. The problem was, no side-orders. WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!!?!?But then, my brain seized control from my stomach, reminding to "LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THE SANDWICH YOU MORON!!!" which I promptly did. And lo and behold, I saw a feast like no other. One that I wondered if I would actually finish. So much so, it required a knife and fork to eat- but not very neat. I walked out proudly, a full stomach and sauce call over my face. Some looked at me with puzzled looks. Others gave me a look of "I know where you just were, and I've been there as well." Knowing what to expect, I wandered next door to the coffee shop, ordered a  double-espresso and took a nap on the nearest couch, until the staff delivered my caffine counter-active to "the-itis".A warning though, this is not a vegan-friendly place. So much so, that the patrons may grab you, throw you into the roast and demand you served up on a fresh Colombo roll. Don't believe me, just check it out for yourself- if you dare.My only complaint: they are only open mon-fri, 11-3. So if you don't work  nearby or have non-standard work-hours, you're out of luck. However, I do recommend this establishment. Very much worth going out of your way for, or even calling in sick so that you can have lunch at. Yes, it's that freakin good.

Honestly, my four stars are going off of what this place means to me now, looking back on my memories.There are no exotic animals, save for Macho, that mischievous baboon/macao? who likes to jerk off and throw his poo at the school children. That is unless, he died, which could very well have happened since I haven't been to the zoo since 1995. I do, however, have this incredibly strong notion that there used to be elephants in the back of the park, but this theory could either be due to a (sub)urban legend, or, that as a tiny 4 year old Asian girl, I could've easily mistaken llamas for elephants.The peacocks roam around the entirety of the park, much to the enjoyment of all the 8 year olds risking getting their eyes pecked out, trying to yank their feathers.To be fair, apparently The Folsom Zoo has a pretty reputable rehabilitary system for birds or something. It's like the Cirque Lodge or Betty Ford clinic of the Zoology world.As for the train, that guy has been wearing those overalls and squishing himself into that cardboard box for the last 15 years! Forget the Folsom Zoo, Mr. Conductor is an establishment himself.

When asked, "Where's Dad?" the server joked back, "Oh him, we got rid of that guy a long time ago."Well, whatever they did - it works. I took a chance at the Angry Roadman ... turns out, he's a real good guy. The grilled sandwich features turkey, bacon, cheese and some veggies melted to perfection.

I'll just chalk that one up to some 20-something shenanigans. . . and needing glassware for my first grown-up pad.  But, quite frankly, I can't remember that long ago.  Speaking of acquisitions, I also somehow ended up with a giant pink foam cowboy hat from some funny-hat-pub-crawlers once.  I'm still not sure if there is karaoke there, or if it was just some spontaneous belting out of Bon Jovi by the crazy hat people.Yes, the restroom signs pointing to the opposite doors always have, and always will, fool me. . . Guys, don't even try - we still won't believe you. And those stairs to get to said restroom, are pretty precarious.  But I'll always be fond of them because I was once told by some really drunk dude that I was the most beautiful thing he'd seen coming down those stairs . . . Well, I was teased all night, and every visit afterwards, for that one. . . lemme tell you I wasn't gracefully gliding down those stairs either, rather tottering down those old wooden planks.  I guess that's why we always hung out on the first floor as much as possible, except to visit the girls room - or boys room on accident, of course.But, there is a culinary treasure that will keep me in the clutches of Fanny Ann's forever.  And, that would be the JIFFY burger.  Peanut butter and BACON on a burger = cow/pig/legume party in my mouth .  Strange enough, I think they need to step it up on the peanut butter factor, so I'll just ask for extra.  The curly fries are scarf-down good too.Actually, my fondness for this peanut butter and bacon burger is starting to make me think I might be part Labrador Retriever . . . *pant, pant, slobber, drool*.**Up-Fricken-Date . .

I'm talkin about the whole "henry the f-ing 8th" sized piece of wing.  Not too saucey, and NICELY deep fried poultry love.  And take it from me . . not being one to suck the meat off chicken bones  . . .but, I sure as hell did on these babies . . .Deliciously deep fried, cripsy morsels of love, indeed!  Now, I just have to decide on Jiffy burger or Hot wings . . damnit - I'm gettin both, and I'll roll into you, coming in at prime sumo-wrestling weight.

(That was my best Britney Spears accent there for ya.)  I'm sorry, my pizza budget normally runs closer to Papa Murphy's prices or my favorite supermarket frozen brands so when I'm going to go out and sit down to have a pizza I want it to HIT! THE! SPOT!  and this just didn't.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing, but this is pizza -- and we all know that even when it's bad it's supposed to be pretty good, right?  I give it 3 stars for it's prideful identity and for the cheap beer on tap and RIDICULOUS selection of liquor (looking for Absolut GrapefruitBlueberryPassionKiwiBerryFruit -- they've got it) but I'm disappointed that there was no part of my visit that made me really excited to go back again. I want to love you passionately and effusively, Zelda's -- I really do.  But right now, we're kind of just making awkward small talk in line at the DMV.
<review# 1447,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2008,11/9/2008,268,316,4,9,7>I dunno why it's taken me so long to write a review of NHKW, since it is one of the top HK style restaurants we are lucky enough to have in Sactown. Service is actually not as bad as some "finer" chinese establishments I have been to, and the prices are low and offer great bang for the buck. I'd still consider it a dive. You may be lucky enough to have an oscillating fan as a dinner companion or brave the HK style dirty bathrooms. Some of the top items IMO are:1. Wonton mein2. Sui gow mein3. Ching Tong Ngau Lam (Beef stew in broth)4. Any flavor jook (congee)5. Hoi nam guy faan (empress chicken w/ rice)6. Spicy salt squid or oysters7. Sea bass w/ eggplant hot potGo there and enjoy, but wear clothes you don't mind getting infused with greasy aromas, and don't plan on going on a date afterwards without a change of clothes!(Oh yeah they are part of the Culinary Wonderland corporation so the food and menu are very similar to New Canton, Macau Cafe, and probably New Lai Wah)
<review# 1448,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2008,11/8/2008,8,25,5,7,5>Ooooh, the Sunflower.  Been haunting this haunt for the last thirteen years or so, and I always find any excuse to grab a tasty nutburger when I'm anywhere near the area.  In fact, I've even been known to drive all the way from downtown to Fair Oaks quench my thirst for nutty goodness.  Yeah, it's that good.My usual order consists of a Super Nutburger (with extra pickles!) and a garden salad with herb-cheese dressing, topped off with a cherry vanilla Hansen's soda.  The nutburgers are one of the many specialties, and with good reason; I've yet to find any other offering that rivals the spicy taste of the homemade patty and slighty thousand island-ish dressing drizzled within.  The garden salad is not anything special in itself; however, it's the herb-cheese dressing that makes it worth my precious-ass time.When I'm feeling frisky, I also like:* Super Nachos.  It's got the cheesy awesomeness you'd expect, but is much lighter and non-greasy. They could definitely stand to melt the cheese longer, though.* Nutty Tacos.  Pretty much the nutburger "meat" in taco shell form.  Super yum.* Coffee ice cream.  I don't know if this stuff is homemade, but it sure tastes like it. I normally despise the taste of coffee, but for some reason, this doesn't put me off.* Super Avocado and cheese.  I personally haven't tried an entire sandwich, but my best friend swears by these and I've bitten off hers.  Lots of melty cheese and good times to be had.A few tips to enhance your all-natural dining experience:* If you've been to the Sunflower before and know what you want, call ahead and order your food about twenty minutes before you get there.  This will save you a potentially long wait, and chances are your order will be ready upon your arrival.* If the tables are full and there's nowhere to sit, get your order to-go and hightail it to the park next door.  Plenty of tables and lush green scenery to be had there.* Oh, and the chickens do NOT want your lettuce, so don't even try.  They only buk-buk for the bulky shit.  And maybe if you're lucky, you'll see a fretful mother hen escorting her precious little tweeting babies across the asphalt like my friend and I did on our last visit.  And if that doesn't turn you into a pile of goo, I weep for you and your black heart.
<review# 1449,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/29/2013,4/2/2014,591,132,10,17,14>One of its kind in this area. A place to get a sushi burrito. Yes! a sushi burrito! If your initial reaction was like mine thinking there's a mix of tortilla with raw fish then you're wrong as I was too. A concoction of a large seaweed wrapped in rice and everything you see in a sushi roll. The price of literally one sushi roll but with the helping of three rolls inside this burrito. The idea is unique and the response for these burritos have been in demand luckily for me there hasn't been much of a line every time I've been here. One of the reasons might be that Wrap and Roll sits in the middle of Elk Grove in a residential area and not really that close to the freeway. So good that there wasn't ever a long line bad that it's a bit of a drive to get there.Two things to try for all sushi lovers is the sashimi burrito and the spicy tuna nachos. For the sashimi, read carefully, because they pack these burritos with quite a bit of ingredients. One I could live without on this roll was the fresh cut jalapeños. If you like spicy you should keep them. Spicy is great but I prefer my rolls spicy with sweet mayo with an added sriracha. Another ingredient I can go without on this roll would be the green onion. The second time I had the sashimi sushi burrito the green onion was a bit overpowering. Other than that these sushi burritos are delicious. When biting in the slipperiness of the sashimi raw fish collides with the crunchiness of the deep fried shrimp and egg roll wrap. Dip it into their sweet mayo sauce or wasabi mayo and you got yourself a perfect lunch that will leave you full off one order. I know better now to not have ordered the nachos with the tuna the second time around as one burrito left me with a packed belly. There are plenty of other sushi burritos to choose from other than the raw stuff. And describing these sushi burrito on here doesn't do this place absolute justice on how delicious this place is. Try it for yourself. Try something new!
<review# 1450,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,4/1/2014,206,100,15,26,24>I am not a huge sweets eater, but do like a good cupcake every once in awhile. This place definitely falls into the really good category.I came here after Carol P.'s birthday gathering at The Mix with fellow Yelpers Devo S., Donovan H, and Claudia H. The owner was working the counter and told us what each cupcake was and what was in them. I quickly settled on the salted caramel cupcake (Claudia took the last blueberry) for there, and a lemon to go. I also picked up a raspberry, and a confetti, for my wife and daughter. The owner told me to pick another one for free to keep them in the box better! What is better than a free cupcake?! Well, it is probably the fact that he let me still use my check-in discount and got 5 cupcakes for only $6.00! We all sat at  a small table and it got real quiet as we all enjoyed the super moist, dense cupcakes. Donovan had that look on his face like Andrew Zimmern after eating something good. He also had the salted caramel and it was pretty damn good. The frosting wasn't overly sweet and made me very happy. Claudia with her blueberry, and Devo with her death by chocolate. They were in a world of their own. We all really enjoyed our cupcakes. After we had all finished our cupcakes, and were ready to leave, the owner walks over and gives a lemon cupcake to share, some discount cards, and buy 10 get 1 free punch cards. He even brought us a knife to cut it. It was super good with the lemon curd or whatever hiding inside under the frosting. Once I got home, my wife and daughter also loved their cupcakes. I had the other ones the next day. They were still really good the second day.I will be back for sure to support this business, you should too.

He always got back to us by text, email or phone and never left us hanging.  As we closed the deal on the house we purchased he answered many questions and communicated quickly with the seller's agent and with us and continues to be a great resource for us as new homeowners.I would recommend Casey to anyone looking to buy or sell a house and I hope I get a chance to work with him again in the future!Please feel free to contact me for a more thorough reference if you'd like, I cannot say enough good about our experience buying a home with Casey McLoed!

The food specials range from $3-$5 and I would normally order the beef sliders with jalapenos. The crab stuffed jalapenos and the pulled pork sliders are also good! The drinks are pretty cheap compared to nearby bars. I would normally order a Jameson which is only $6! If you like Johnnie Walker Blue Label, it is only $12 here which is pretty cheap! There are drink specials and you can order a glass of wine for $4!The service has always been good every time I have been here. I am not sure why there are such negative reviews for this place.

<review# 1455,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/11/2013,3/27/2014,391,248,10,16,16>Parking here is a disaster - all the spots in front of the shop is "20 minute parking" and there's only about 10 spaces total. I don't know if this is strictly enforced or not but I didn't want to risk it so I parked across the street. We came early on Saturday and were the first customers for the day. This could be a hit or miss - but for us it was a hit. Everything we ordered was delicious. Being that my boyfriend and I are pigs disguised as humans, we ordered the calamari as appetizer, two rolls of sushi and two bowls of  ramen for breakfast. Calamari - light, hot, and crispy; not greasy at all and not overly battered. Ramen: * I ordered the - Tantan-men - The broth was flavorful and the noodles were cooked evenly. I hate it when my noodles are clumped together.* House broth with fish - My boyfriend wasn't as much of a fan of this bowl as I was. He liked the Tantan-men better so we ended up switching our bowls halfway through. (Yes, I shared my food. That's love right there. Lol)Sushi: The sushi rolls were huge and very reasonably priced. I believe it was around $8-10 for the rolls and generally within those price ranges, you'd have to order several rolls to fill up on. I ordered the King Kong and he ordered something else that I forget but both rolls were yummy!
<review# 1456,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/31/2013,3/26/2014,161,58,7,12,10>Don't judge a book by its cover.  That's the best way to describe Chang's.  I went here thinking it was gonna be Chinese food along the lines of panda express but boy was i wrong.Located in a strip of food joints in the CVS/Safeway shopping center it is tucked away in the very corner of it all.  It really just looks like a typical fast food Chinese place like a point and choose kinda place but everything here is made to order.  And not only it is freshly made it is really good.  I'm pretty sure the flavors are along the Cantonese style food, which happen to be my favorite kind!  The menu covers pretty much everything but if you want to do a combo plate, you can.  I haven't been here for lunch yet but the dinner plates are like $9 and you get a whole mess of food and an egg roll. I always seem to take it to go but this place actually has a lot of room to sit.  There are like 10 tables.I really like coming here when i want tasty Chinese food in Naomas.  Its cheap, tastes good,  and you get full.  What more can you ask for?

I went here with the SO for some Thai but I was very pleasantly surprised with how much I loved this place.  I was also motivated by the Yelp checkin for a free soda or beer - what can I say?We ordered some great picks and I would recommend them to anyone visiting Mints.  We ordered the lemon grass tofu as a side dish that came out before our order.  It has an amazing taste and the tofu was slightly fried which was excellent and gave it a nice texture.For our main dish, we ordered the large tiger prawns with garlic noodles topped with parmesan cheese.  Wow, this was so good. The prawns were nicely grilled and huge.  The noodles had an amazing flavor with the parmesan. I have never had that kind of cheese in Asian cooking but count me in for future eats!
<review# 1458,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/26/2013,3/24/2014,266,332,22,29,26>Grange is located in the Citizen Hotel. We came by for lunch and was asked if we had reservations. When we replied no, the hostess told us that she will have to check to see if there are any open tables. As she left to check for tables, I thought for sure there wouldn't be any available tables as the restaurant was packed with well to do, business peeps. She came back and told us there was a table in the back. Our server came to take our drink orders, it turns out that she's also the bartender. Hubby orders non spicy Bloody Mary, I order ice tea, she asks what kind of sweetener and I reply, "regular sugar," daughter orders coke.  It took quite a while before we got our drinks, since our server was the bartender, she ended up filling and making other drinks. In that time frame, she must have lost our order because hub's Bloody Mary was "spicy," my ice tea was brought out with no sweeteners, at least my daughter's drink was right. Can't screw up a plain Coke. So we place our orders, I ordered the weekly featured menu item. It was a pork schnitzel ($15), with sweet potato purée and a Brussel sprout kraut. Hubby got the steak entree ($18) and daughter got the turkey, bacon, and avocado sandwich ($15). When our dishes came out, the first thing we noticed was how much my dish smelled. The smell came from the kraut, I love kraut but I'm guessing that since the kraut was made with brussel sprouts and a combination of different spices, it made the aroma, rather "peculiar." The schnitzel in my opinion, was over cooked. Just take a look at my dish, yelp.com/user_local_photHubby and daughter's dish was nothing to really rave about. I'm sorry but maybe I'm being rather harsh, I just had higher expectations from a restaurant with a $$$ menu.

With its golden dome, it looks like it's from Vegas. In one lobby, there's a huge statue of Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella. In front of the Governor's office, a marvelously tacky bear. The dioramas of the various counties are worth seeing. The Napa County one is simple and decorative. The Sonoma County one simply supersizes the official tourist brochure's opening page... not much work. It's a cavalcade of Californian attractions- Hollywood, Disneyland, the beaches of LA and Santa Barbara, Mount Shasta, Mount Lassen, Yosemite.The state capitol is a must-see in an otherwise blah city.

An almost zen 13.1 miles, for the person who runs for the love of moving.  * It's crowded, but not overwhelmingly so. I was with a group for about the first 3 miles, and by mile 7(ish) I was running almost alone. Some might need a crowd, but I relished the opportunity to just concentrate on moving and breathing and not passing out. * Very easy to follow pace-groups, big signs. * You start and finish in William Land Park, right by the zoo and a lake. Pretty. * You run along the river, which was really nice. Peaceful. * They have spots with music, either live or recorded. If you've never run a race, you might be surprised how important that can be. At one point, when I was having trouble seeing straight I was so effing tired, they played (nerd warning)Travis Tritt's "Great Day to be Alive" and I experienced an instant of love and wonderment and rainbows. Profound, no jokies. I still think about that moment to this day, and I'm grateful I had it.  * Massages available to all finishers. Thaaaaank you!* For finishing, you get a cowbell! Christopher Walken would approve.The one, glaring bummer... and it had the potential to be a biggie:(STORY TIME!)As I said, it was my first half, and I didn't know how I would do. I (stupidly) didn't train properly, (read: not at all), so by mile 9 I was dead. I mean D-E-A-D. I had serious doubts of whether I could actually finish the race, if I could physically keep moving... which was a little scary. At one point, I thought I might really need help. I contemplated stopping. So I thought: "Okay, so I poop-out, lay down on the concrete and succumb to the sweet, sweet blackness... who will come get my limp body?" I realized, in growing panic, that there were hardly any medical stations, and I felt like no help around for a looong stretch. And lemme tell ya, toward the end of a race, any stretch seems looong. So, out of an irrational fear of being somehow lost in the middle of Sacramento, I kept moving, zombie-like.I ended up finishing and earning my sweet, sweet cowbell. The lack of opportunity to stop may or may not have actually ended up helping me/pushing me, but I was lucky I didn't really need help. Enough about ME. This is about the race. And seeming lack of med-stops aside, this is a good one. Verdict: Super enjoyable half-marathon. I would highly recommend it. I would also recommend training. Like, at least once. Take it from me, ol' Sara "Could-Barely-Move-a-Muscle-the-Next-Day" B.

(gasp) Is it possible to have too much cheese?  Why, yes it is.  Everytime I took a bite I thought I was going to have to walk over and grab the emergeny defibrillator.  Felt like my heart was slowing down.Cornbread - 4, Slightly old, but good flavor.  I bumped it up one star due to they serve honey butter with it.  (Homer Simpson voice)HHHHHMMMMM, honey butter.Service - 4, the lady helping us was super nice, BUT we waited an hour for our food which sucked because my body was about to shutdown from hunger.  She was nice and gave me a free sweet ice tea plus a free slice of sweet of potato pie.Sweet Potato Pie - 4, very good even though I couldnt eat it all.Sweet Tea - 3, it was good but I am just not a huge fan of sweet tea.I want to give it a rating of 4, so lets see if that works out.  5+3+3+4+4+4+3=3.72(yes I used a calculator, dont forget, I am not smart).  So my rating was pretty close.  I will for sure round up for this place.  Next time I go in I am going to try the fried chicken.Now excuse me, I am going to go fall asleep in my food coma.

He also said that if there actually are Chinese people inside, you will only be able to know its good Chinese food by the amount of OLD Chinese people inside.  This is how I find Chinese food, and let me tell you, it works everytime! (and this place is FILLED with old Chinese people)The first time I walked in, I saw everything was a little dingy, and the fish aquariums were kinda sketchy looking.. and I thought, "Awww hell ya!! We're gonna be grubbin on the BOMB Chinese food!"The only time I used to eat dim sum was at Chinese New Year so my grandpa could hear me say "gung hay fat choy"-- that is about the extent of my Chinese knowledge. Sorry, I seriously dishonor my family. And also, dim sum used to never be closer than a 2 hour drive from my house..  But now that I live in Sacramento, I can eat dim sum whenever I want! (Assuming I feel I can handle the post-chinese food bloat for the next 3 days)Heads up- don't park in the parking lot. ASIAN DRIVERS = ASIAN PARKERS. You do the math. I always get all my favorite little dumplings and rice balls, black bean spare ribs and pretty much anything with shrimp... There really is no stopping for me until I've reached food coma status, because everything is SO cheap! I came here recently with a group of 7, 4 of whom were BOYS. We all seriously grubbed, and our bill came to be $10 for each of us including tip.  Not too shabby! My only complaint is that with all the salty food, the water doesn't get refilled often enough (or all the way to the top). Larger water cups, please! Regardless of the water, I love this place. It is hard to understand what a lot of the people are saying, but if you speak "food" really well, then you shouldn't have a problem.
<review# 1464,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/22/2012,2/18/2012,179,181,15,11,12>In honor of spending a recent Saturday afternoon at BFD with my boyfriend so he could suss out the ingredients of his next beer - and watching at least five other aspiring brewers also walk in with their girlfriends/wives in tow while I was there - I present to you: A GIRLFRIEND'S GUIDE TO BFDLet's face it ladies. If you find yourself at BFD, chances are fairly high that it was not your own idea of how to spend your Saturday. Here are some guidelines to making the most of BFD if you happen not to be a brewer yourself. First rule of BFD: Enter armed with patience. Even if your significant other thinks he knows what kind of beer he wants to brew, it's likely he'll get what I call Brewer's Blackout as soon as he walks inside and sees all the options he didn't even think about beforehand. Tim also stocks a number of old brewing magazines and new brewing books chock full of recipes for perusing and comparison for that perfect pint, potentially drawing your time here out a wee bit longer. Because the staff is so small (two employees at most the times I've been there), it could take extra time to gather the ingredients once those decisions have been made. Second rule of BFD: Scope out a good place to set up camp. BFD is a compact space, filled with piles of grain boxes and random brewing equipment that may or may not be organized on the day you're there. If you're not the only customers in the place, it's not easy to passively hang out without inevitably being in someone's path to the next great beer. I spend a large amount of time looking at the cheese-making supplies and contemplating if it's worth the initial investment to wow my friends with homemade mozzarella. I haven't yet, but I wouldn't doubt that I may stare at them long enough in the future to make the leap to add cheesemaker to my résumé. It also helps if you like kids, since there are almost always a few inexplicably running around who are ready and willing to play with customers. Third rule of BFD: Stifle giggles while homebrewing customers puff up their chests and dole out pointers to other beer creators as they also try to out-impress each other with tales of their own awesome beers. Fourth rule of BFD: Relish in the fact that soon you, too, will be partaking in the tasty result of an afternoon well spent in the confines of this store.Cheers!

Perhaps a grove? Keep searching. In this over-burgeoned suburb, it's true, there are few gems.But there ARE gems.I submit Brick House. Now, I could toss around flowery language to describe the large corner bar, the historic photos on the walls, the cozy decor. But I'd much rather leave the poetry for the food:YUUUUUUUMMMMMMYYYYY!Addictive chicken wings that'll heat you up. Sandwiches that'll make you cry--either because of their immensity or mind-blowing flavor. Cheesecake that is next to godliness.But don't rely on my words. Try it yourself. If you go to Elk Grove for just one reason, make it Brick House. You'll find that there truly are diamonds in the rough.
<review# 1469,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,8/2/2014,212,56,9,13,9>UC Davis 100 years Picnic Day is my first Picnic Day!!! This day is THE day of the year that turns the whole town upside down. Literally yesterday was very calm. Today aka Picnic Day has waken up all the partying spirits of not only students but parents! Since this year is my first time, there are 5 things that I wish I could have done to improve or utilize my walkings to see the most events on campus:1) Briefly go on the UC Davis Picnic Day website at least a day ahead to highlight all events you would like to see. Trust me, on the day of, there will be so many people looking happy, you will be way too excited to follow them! 2) If you are planning to bring your dog, cross out Doxie Derby (the pup race) at the ARC. Unless your dog is a service dog, they will not allow you to bring in your little ones. I had to learn this the hard way, as so many other dog owners. 3) Go to sleep early the night before, because you need to wake up early to catch the parade at 9:30am!!!! 4) Get your sunscreen ready, or go buy an umbrella/ a hat! The weather will be hot (not so much of burning hot). Prepared for your skin away from the sun is healthy for you, since you are expected to be out for HOURS! 5) Bring a bottle of water!!! You will easily get dehydrated. Campus had a variety of places for you to refill your water bottle. Anyways, enjoy the best Aggie tradition! For those who visit Davis for the first time, welcome to the town of awesomeness!

The green beans were a tad soggy and there was no kick at all to their jalapeno beans.  All that for $14 w/ a nice country soundtrack thrown in for measure.  I could take this act to Sandra Dee's and get twice the meat with killer spicy beans and collard greens.  But seeing as I can only do this once a month I guess it's well justified...now I just gotta walk off this heartburn with a lighter wallet.
<review# 1471,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2014,7/31/2014,1594,134,7,14,9>OK so my wife is not as enamored with this place as I am. But I'm of the opinion that food just tastes better at restaurants where they strive for excellent customer service. That is certainly the case here ! We've eaten here a number of times and each time  I felt like the staff was going "above and beyond" to make us feel welcome and appreciated.Now on to the food. I love the diverse menu of Japanese "street-food" and Asian staples. Each dish I've tried seemed fresh and creative. So far my favorites are the Kalbi Tacos ( Korean short ribs and kimchee ), Rock Shrimp lettuce cups, Seared Albacore and the Bibimbap. There are a lot more options including the lunch special which is a tremendous value at $10.50 for Chicken or Fish, eggrolls and sushi, plus rice, soup and salad. I also enjoy the option of brown rice, even for the sushi dishes. This Bistro is a welcomed addition to dinning options in "The EDH", the food is good the service is excellent and it has "hip vibe" and inviting ambiance. Once the weather warms up the outdoor patio will certainly be a frequent dinning spot for us.
<review# 1472,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2014,7/30/2014,562,500,30,27,23>The receptionists can be unfriendly, more than a little contrite and at times they are downright unhelpful and don't listen very well but the nurses, doctors, and other personnel tend to be pretty cool.  If you are lucky they might even let you see Dr. Kyle J  Michaelis.I went to my appointment in January only to have the receptionist tell me they had supposedly called me two weeks earlier to inform me that my appointment had been cancelled because I no longer had the same primary care physician.  This seemed confusing to me since I had been to my primary care doctor the day before and I had not received any such phone call.  I tried to explain to the receptionist that this must be some kind of mistake and asked her to please call my doctor but she refused to call him or listen to anything I had to say.I stopped by my primary care physician's office on the way home and left a message with the receptionist but she failed to give my message to the right person so it wasn't until I just happened to get the right person on the phone a couple of weeks later that the situation was finally resolved.  The receptionist was very friendly on my next visit to Sac Heart.  I really don't know what to tell you other than this guy fixes broken hearts.  Of course, my heart was kinda fixed before I started seeing him but let's not get too technical.  He not only fixes broken hearts but he is also very funny.  When I asked him how to lose weight, he answered "don't eat".Hopefully Dr. Michaelis knows what he is doing because my life kinda depends on it and I really don't have enough knowledge about this cardio stuff to really know.  I seem to still be alive so I would guess he knows what he is doing.  However, "if" and this is a big "if", I just happen to die from heart complications in the next couple of years than it might be a good idea for you to choose a different cardiologist.  I am not sure how you will know I am dead since I won't be able to write a review.  I would have my girl friend write a review but that is considered second hand knowledge which is against the Yelp tos and would probably be removed.  Maybe you should just send me a personal message to see if I am still alive.  Anyway, as long as I am still alive I would highly recommend him to you but you would have to have a broken heart and I would not wish that on anyone.  However, if something does go wrong with your ticker, CALL AN AMBULANCE, if you are lucky enough to live through the next couple of days then I strongly suggest you give Dr. Michaelis @ Sac Heart a call after you make sure I am still alive.  However, the receptionist may not let you in unless you have a referral from your primary physician.
<review# 1473,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2013,7/29/2014,136,261,7,16,10>The best Indian food in all of Sacramento and outstanding prices. Full of flavor! The Palak Paneer was great; so flavorful and full of spice. The spinach was leafy unlike most other Indian restaurants where they basically turn the dish into a soupy concoction. Adding a little of the tamarind chutney to it made it a spicy-sweet delight.The Bhuna Gosht was great also. The lamb was tender and juicy and had wonderful flavor. With our meals we ordered a side of rice (which was enough for two) for 1 buck and naan for 1 buck (which was a rather large, hearty disc of bread with a great lavender taste and scent. We got Gulab Jamun for 2 bucks which had a lovely floral taste, I believe it was rosewater. The taste of the syrup was so yummy. We ended up drinking the remaining syrup. BOTTOM LINE:You can't beat this for the price and the quality of food.
<review# 1474,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/8/2013,7/28/2014,225,140,6,11,8>I have been coming here for years and I thought I would give an updated review. We came here on a Sunday night and it wasn't too busy. We ordered the Pad Thai, Seafood Combination and the steak salad. The Pad Thai has always been a good dish and it is always consistent when I ordered it. I wanted to try the seafood combination and I was not too impressed with that dish. The dish was $13 and I felt that there were more vegetables than seafood for that price. The beef salad had a great dressing to it. The complaint that I had with the steak salad was that the beef was well done and I like my meat medium rare. The service was slower than normal but it was not horrible. I would definitely still come back to this place for Thai food. I would order my usual Pad Thai, Spicy Catfish and Duck Curry next time though!

Sky zone also presented a video at the party of day of fun at Sky zone.  I had a great time and heard the best words ever from my daughter.  "That was the best party ever!" That did it for me! Great experience overall. I would definitely do another party for my daughter here or let her return for a birthday party here with another child.

They're in a centrally located hot spot with easy access by foot, bike and car.  I heard talk of a bike valet too.2. There's an entertainment tent with a sweet band jamming out some awesome Saturday morning tunes.3. There are local farm vendors including Sacramento's own Feeding Crane Farms and Soil Born Farms.4. There are also local tea and product vendors with baked goods, sauces, and honey.5. You can get farm fresh eggs!6. They have nifty t-shirts for only $15! Get em while they're hot!7.  Have a little pup that likes to come along on adventures?  There's even a vendor that sells organic dog treats.8. There are quite a few places that take credit or debit card!  But remember to bring cash for those that don't.  You don't want to miss out on some of the first strawberries and cherries of the season.9. They're new but people are extra friendly while figuring out all the kinks.10. It really brings the Midtown (and beyond!) community together to celebrate our local bounty.
<review# 1477,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2013,7/25/2014,398,256,8,14,12>So freaking cute!!!!!!!!I love tea rooms. Linde Lane is an adorable one in the quiet little town of Dixon. The giant tea cup in the center is just darling and would be adorable for a little group of ladies *or gents*. I've actually only been here twice and each time I walked away smiling. The first visit was for a St. Patrick's Day tea with the girls in my Lolita community. The best part of the tea? They have out Irish Cream to pour into your cup of Irish Breakfast. To say that by the end of the tea party I was drinking that Irish Cream straight. Now mind you, I'm decked out in frills, must of been a sight.The second visit was a Groupon visit. I dragged my boyfriend and he seemed to enjoy himself. Unlike the St Patrick's Day tea I was able to order from the menu and choose my own tea. We shared the Royal Tea for two and I had the Gold Rush tea, my boyfriend ordered gunpowder. We started off with mango sorbet and shortbread. Then we were served a garden salad and a soup (it was sausage and kale....so yum!). Then a tier of sandwiches, scones and cream, and dessert was served. By the time got to the desserts I was full. Everything was tasty and my tea pot never stayed empty.My gripes are I wished the servers wore something other than all black. It's kinda.....boring. If they wore cute dresses or tops it would just brighten up the place a bit more. And I wish they had a Darjeeling. I love Darjeeling. (youtu.be/D5m33zK6ZlA)Anyways, I'll be back! =)
<review# 1478,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/22/2014,7/24/2014,416,84,15,24,20>Okay... truth be told time! I've been going here FOREVER! (I hate when I get "called on it"... lol) Not by choice, like some people, but because it took me forever to get into their nursing program. No joke... I know a little of EVERYTHING about this whole campus. All my friends and family call me when they need ARC advice and I can recite it like a play. I also worked on campus, so that's a big plus lemme tell ya.  ;) Yes, this is a community college. Community college's get a bad name sometimes on just that; a name. Trust an "old" pro now...ARC has some truly amazing, notable professors. Some serious top-notch teachers. The first one that comes to mind is Soheir Sukkary-Stolba. She teaches Anthropology at ARC (a required transfer course). She has been around the world and back working with the WHO, writing books and fighting for women's rights. She's amazing. She's just one example of some of the outstanding professors at ARC. I've taken a little bit of everything here over my 6 years. Nursing is a very high unit major (70 units before the actual program!). I've had my share of amazing, life changing, crazy awesome learning and my share of meh.  The majority has been awesome.This school has some great student services/  programs. Financial aid, career center, disabled student services, book rental from the campus bookstore, very active campus clubs, an awesome school newspaper, a HIGHLY rated (please look up "The ARC Review"... just awesome) literary "magazine" that comes out every year (with 90% student attributed works), a 5 star culinary program (with a 5 star restaurant on campus), a highly rated funeral services program AND nursing program... just to name a few.Now every school has it's not so good. Parking here is atrocious. But they recently built a 4-story parking garage which has helped alleviate this huge issue.  Some "students" on campus are not there to learn... but this happens anywhere. They can be a distraction. The financial aide staff are notoriously unfriendly, the bookstore has outrageous prices (not their fault), many classes are hard to get into and unit fees keep rising. But...Overall, this is the BEST community college in the area by far!! The good outweighs the bad. If you are dedicated and apply yourself, you WILL learn here. You will leave ARC with lifelong experiences you wouldn't have gotten otherwise. You will be prepared to transfer to Sac State or wherever your little heart desires. :)  You get out what you put in friends. True story. The prices are soooo much cheaper than state schools or private schools. Start here and go on to bigger and better things! We all have a greater purpose, a dream in life. Maybe a higher education is the start to your purpose/dream? Community college's are for EVERYONE, even you.  :)

That only makes me think of the Folsom Outlets and the Nike store. But that's my own problem. I won't be making fun of them any longer.This place doesn't mess around with meat. We really wanted to get a 99 cent taco, but were willing to get it after we made our selections. He insisted we eat it before we continued shopping. Why? Because they make their tacos with their own meat. We got the carne asada and MAN was it great. In addition to the London broil and ground beef we purchased, I also got myself some rose essence, Pakistani jasmine green tea, and a crazy mexican frozen dessert that was "rice pudding" flavored, and, before you ask...yes. It did have rice AND raisins in it. I was pleasantly surprised at the total price upon check out. Don't let this place deter you because of the ridiculous name or questionable location.I can't wait to go back.
<review# 1480,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2011,5/20/2011,40,38,7,12,10>My son doesn't care for Thai food, so my husband and I usually head out to Thai Chef's House when he has a sleepover or is otherwise occupied.  This has become our favorite kid-less treat to ourselves.I don't know why this place is always empty when we go, because the food is consistently fantastic.  It seems like every time we go in, there is only one other table in the place which is puzzling considering the quality of the experience.  We really need to buzz this place up and make these people some money so they keep doing what they do best - cook amazing Thai food.We are always seated in a booth that has a broken seat, and my short self ends up with chin on the table.  Which, in this place is not a problem because it just puts my mouth a bit closer to that delicious, delicious food.The soups are  wonderful, full of coconut and galangal and steam and comfort.   One sip, and you are transported back to the humming streets of Thailand, even though you've never been there.  They are that good.The main meals are equally outstanding. I love a good red curry and you get none better than here.  I change up the veggies and mix in chicken with the red curry and order it Thai hot.  You will get it Thai hot too, bring tissues for your runny nose.Everything you will order, from appetizers to main meals, is fresh and delicious.  I've never seen anything that wasn't freshly cut or prepared and which didn't come out steaming and crisp.  Each dish is enough for two to share, so you can try several things.  The owners appear to be the servers and they are unfailingly polite and attentive, and often wear traditional Thai dress.  The restaurant itself, aside from the broken booth, is quite attractive, which you wouldn't know from the outside.  It's very large and would be a great place for a party.  The whole thing is wooden inside, but is kept clean, which isn't easy to do.  There are lots of Thai artifacts and decorations.I wish my son liked Thai food because we'd probably eat here weekly, it's that good.If you find that La Rosa Blanca down the road is too crowded, as it often is, don't wait.  Just walk down the street and give Thai Chef House a try.  You won't be disappointed.

Mac and Cheese!I felt compelled to try everything.  But I took a deep breath then tried to keep composure.  I decided to start with one of their staple burgers;  I opted for a Spin Burger with bacon topped with mac and cheese and homestyle fries.  That's what I call a BURGER.  It was huge, juicy, tender, mouth watering, and savory smooth.I cannot wait to try the rest of the goodies on the menu.Say hello to Spin Burger's newest fan.

ALso, I always throw them away, thinking I have one, but the coupon bandit always seesm to take them since they are not in the drawer when I go to retrieve....I love the Managers Special. 3 toppings on a medium pie for like 12 bucks. I usually get fresh tomato, mushrooms and feta cheese. Usually with red sauce, but I may branch off of my usual and get that with white garlic sauce next time.I had been trying to get my sister and roommate to order from here, but they always go for the chains :(      Finally! Last night I convinced my twin sissie to let me order from there. My roommate woke up from his nap upstairs as we dialed, heard us ordering, and went ahead and got a large chicken garlic. I will tell ytou that the vampires are staying away form him for awhile... And the ladies  ;)  We all agreed that this is the spot.Note: The pizza here rocks but the chicken strips are not so tasty. Don't order them!  The ranch is good though. And hey, I come here for the pizza, not the extra bs, so I can forgive a soggy strip. I just won't order it again.

And I've already fully embraced the dog owner lifestyle which means that when I go to dog parks, I can recognize dogs on sight and tell you their name, gender, breed and how my dog will get along with them but I have NO idea what their owners names are. My first time here, I was pretty unimpressed. There are a lot of dirt patches and this one area of dirt that gets flooded with water so of course, it attracts dogs and produces lots of muddy tracks. Plus, on my first visit, there was a ton of dog poop. Gross. But since then, it's slowly grown on me and I've learned to appreciate it for what it is: a really large, fenced in, hilly area for your dog to run and play. If you have a dog that loves to run, this really is a great place for them to chase balls or other dogs. Tons of space, lots of hills, lots of water spots and chairs for the human companions. Occasionally some dogs get aggressive here but most owners have been responsible enough to break up the fights right away and pick up after their dogs. I think my dog loves it here and I know that it always tires her out.

Boy, did this fucking awesome truck filled parking lot country dive deliver.  Above the glass front fridge housing bottled beer was a virtual shrine to John Wayne.  I bet the Duke himself would enjoy shooting the shit with the good ole boys having their post work beer before going home to their wives.  Topics of conversation included: Alan Jackson's expensive divorce ($38 mil) and subsequent remarriage, which was apparently a stunt to sell records and books.  AND.....Willy Nelson's tax troubles, which originated because he never called "that broad out in North Highlands".  youtube.com/watch?v=2LqKI've never heard the phrase " it's all horse shit and feathers" so many times in a day.  I've never heard it ONCE in my life until Happy Bar.   "I pay the mortgage, but I only own the garage," I giddily overheard.  This was as awesome as the Gran Turino barber shop scene.  I could drink here all day, easily. They had a couple decent beers on tap, a pool table, an internet juke box, and an array of chips/pretzels for sale. I'm thinking this is a Friday tradition for me.

Ohhhhh SNAP!Me not so gusta:The stupid photo booth fee.  Can't you make it a little cheaper? Oh who am I kidding? I'll still use it anyway!Oh you lady of shade, how I enjoy thee!
<review# 1488,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2011,5/12/2011,464,603,9,13,10>I'm in love with Dumpling House! I love the atmosphere, the cute lady working there, and of course, the food! I've only had the dumplings, and they were so good! They also come in generous portions, so it's easy to split with a friend.We got the pork and chive dumplings, as well as the kimchi dumplings. I love the kimchi dumplings since there's the spicy kick in it and kimchi bits, of course. Highly recommend those! And if you want to aim for the classic, try the pork and chive dumplings. mmMm. Sometimes I think of dumplings as comfort food. It's not overly greasy, either. I can't wait to come back and try the other dumplings.Oh yes, and my favorite part is the lady working there. She's so adorable and makes me smile. Very patient, too. We sat there after we finished eating and she still happily refilled our water.
<review# 1489,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2010,7/3/2010,79,134,5,6,8>Ford's Real Hamburgers... much better than those pesky Fords Fake Hamburgers. Ha ha ha. For "reals" though, this place has it all! The hamburgers are big, tasty, fresh, topped with lots of extras and great sauce!The shakes are big, thick and very delicious! The fries are on par with everything else here -- Really good, hot, and fresh. Everything is served in pretty big quantities, but there is a down side for it all... you have to pay for what you get.  Ford's is on the pricey side, especially if you're going for some of the bigger burgers.  You can easily walk out of there paying $15 or more for the whole meal.  The wait time is something to deal with. People should definitely be aware of what they're getting into.  The food is worth any wait you'll encounter, but don't be surprised if you sit there for 15-20 minutes before you're chowing down on some delicious burgers. The outdoor patio is fantastic for those long summer days! It's right across the street from Land Park, so you can sit and eat outside and enjoy all the views that Land Park has to offer.  Ford's Real Hamburgers is a Land Park must! We've been going there for a long time, and will continue to keep coming back. Last bit of advice... call-in on your way there with your order and have it ready for when you arrive!
<review# 1490,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2010,7/2/2010,133,189,7,14,14>I always forget how wonderful this place is. Whenever I find myself there, I like to order the veggie dog prop 51 style on a french roll (which is the only vegan bun) and thanks to Katrina B. I found out that the veggie corn dogs are vegan also. The fries are delicious but very salty and I always feel like I need to break my "no soda" rule to indulge in a root beer.I've spoken with the owner on several occasions and he is absolutely fabulous. He is very friendly, knowledgeable about his product and such a persoanable guy that seems to love what he does. When they first opened I was accidentally served a real hot dog and he came to apologize himself and gave me a complimentary meal on my next visit. Great service!
<review# 1491,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/1/2010,7/1/2010,418,300,10,8,13>Don't be a Player Hater. This place is fun. Good grub too. Ribs, waffle fries and ice cold beer. Big plate of ribs. Our dark-haired waitress was friendly and had ample cleavage. In fact, a lot of women at Players had ample cleavage. Especially as the night wore on. Lots of Fair Oaks felines texting and texting. One of them had a bit of a cat fight with my wife. And there goes her bra! No I'm kidding but there was just a minor verbal spat. Cougars!Players is a great place to watch the game. Screens all over the place. We were finishing up dinner when the karaoke started up. I threw a song in the hat before the place got too packed. The karaoke host was entertaining and had a killer sound system. four greasy hot wings!

I jumped up and down in the crowd, danced on stage, sang my lil heart out and had a run in with the law afterwards. Rockstar status confirmed. P.S. The strawberry lemonade cocktail was delicious and kamikazes were $4.50 each that night!
<review# 1493,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2010,6/29/2010,642,604,7,11,7>This is well, one of my "La Favorita" places to go for Mexican food in a casual atmosphere. My boyfriend & I enjoy eating here on a frequent basis. I especially favor the shrimp tostadas! The tostada shells are deliciously crisp with generous toppings of shrimp, avocado, sour cream & salsa. I also love their vegetarian burritos! They are humongous! A large tortilla packed solid with lots of delicious beans, rice, & of course veggies!  It is very difficult for me to even finish one, so I end up eating the rest the next day. We also appreciate the fact that you get to help yourself to the chips & salsa bar at no additional charge!  It seems few Mexican restaurants offer this anymore!  The food is always fresh & cooked to perfection.  The service is quick & efficient.  You can also pick up food to go, but hopefully you don't have far to drive home, or some meals can get soggy in a short time. Don't let a long line of people scare you off.  It's worth the wait!
<review# 1494,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2010,6/28/2010,149,559,4,6,6>Been meaning to come in for quite a while, but I always forget about Mahoroba when I am hungry. But today, I came in for lunch and it was delicious - specifically, the savory pastries.I'm not a believer in Chinese dessert (as a Chinese person, i'm gonna say it), and I haven't worked through my own racism enough to try the delicious-looking Japanese sweet pastries at Mahoroba. So, I need to taste more stuff before I can commit to 5 stars.The savory pastries were spectacular - very flavorful and filling - and under $2 each. Lunch for less than $4? Sign me up.
<review# 1495,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2010,6/27/2010,148,83,11,12,10>If June Cleaver opened her home for business, it would probably look like Sugar Plum Café. This white picket-fence lined café is actually a converted home, and that's exactly how you feel as you approach. Except for a tiny banner waving precariously in the wind, you wouldn't even know there was a business presiding inside. The warm, homey feel will trick you into believing that those pies and cupcakes you're seeing in the petite display case were baked by June Cleaver, too. Pretty cupcakes billow high with clouds of vanilla frosting topped with freshly cut pink flowers in the shade of a baby's cheeks. The pie crusts puff, ready to burst over mountains of high-piled fruit. And the savory smells wafting from the kitchen warm your nose and tickle your tongue, like walking into the house as mom is pulling dinner from the oven. You may still believe you are at June Cleaver's home as you are greeted by a cashier dressed sweetly in head-to-toe vintage. Have you entered the 1950s? No, you are certainly not in June Cleaver's home. The moment you meet the chef and read the menu, you know you are indeed planted firmly in 2010. On a recent visit, as I step up to the counter to order, I inquire about the Whoopie Pies. The chef, hearing me make my purchase, emerges from the kitchen, dreadlocked hair pulled back neatly in a pony tail, beard bobbing as he speaks. He tells me with a literal "Whoop!", "You must pronounce it 'WHOOP!-ie pie!'" So, I do. I'm sure that sound was never uttered by The Beaver himself, let alone June. The tone has been set. I'm in vegan territory. The diet comes with a culture: communal; earth, plant, and animal-friendly; outside the norm; and utterly inviting. Please check all snobbery (and rules about keeping elbows off the table) at the door. June Cleaver does not work here. Not yet ready to decide my order, I ask about all the pastries, which are gleaming with halos in their little pastry case. The cashier walks over and describes everything to me individually. "Those are really good," she says genuinely after describing each item. I gather I can't go wrong no matter what I choose. So, I choose them all! Well, almost. I take a red velvet cupcake. A 'WHOOP!-ie pie!'" A maca-roon, and a cupcake topped high with vanilla icing and an edible poof of pink flower. With pastries tucked safely inside brown paper bags, I am now ready to order my lunch. This is easy. I let the smells wafting from the kitchen and the overflowing plates in front of the other diners guide my decision: nachos. As for the food... I take it to go. I am currently munching madly on my bursting to-go box of nachos. The vegan cheese and sour cream taste just like the real thing. The chips are plentiful and loudly crunchy. I'm half-way through the pile and my stomach is already content. This is a hearty helping! But I just keep eating. I can't stop. They're too tasty. Just one more. Just one more. Just one... oops! They're gone. Despite its use of faux chicken in my nachos, Sugar Plum Café is serving up quality fare. The ingredients are fresh, the flavors delightful. My favorite (so far) is the vanilla frosting-topped cupcake with edible flower. The frosting is creamy, sweet, and smooth. Underneath, the moist, white cupcake has a hint of cherry-bright almond. I'm not crazy about my "Whoop!-ie Pie." The creamy filling, like the frosting on my cupcake, is superb! But the chocolate cakey cookies are a little dry. My thoughts on the red velvet cupcake are exactly the same: good frosting, but the cake is too dry. But don't let that stop you from enjoying a delightful meal at Sugar Plum Café. There are plenty of wonderful items to choose from, and the prices are reasonable. I paid $11 for my nachos, and I could have easily split them with someone. Other lunch items include a roasted vegetable Panini for $9, house made vegan burgers for $11 and salads for $8. If you like good, fresh food, you're bound to enjoy Sugar Plum Café. But tell me if you spot June Cleaver. I'm sure she's hiding around there somewhere!
<review# 1496,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2010,6/26/2010,78,80,2,5,12>Maybe it's because The Habit is a Santa Barbara thing, and I'm a Gaucho.. or maybe it's the chilled-out atmosphere - but I feel the same way about The Habit as most people feel about In-N-Out.  I rave about it, I crave it - though I only go about once a year, I reeaally, really love it!Unlike In-N-Out, Habit has nice, crispy fries that have flavor, a limited yet diverse menu (including sandwiches, salads and curly fries), and best of all: non-greasy buns!The burgers are always tender and juicy with loads of toppings.  I LOVE their fries - crispy enough to still taste good if you take your order to-go.  I love that they have self-serve hot peppers and really listen when I ask for "extra extra EXTRA pickles"! Service is friendly and fast, and the food is consistently delicious & cheap - overall, a great value.

Support this place so we can ensure that delicious fresh in house made sausage is here to stay!Here's what i suggest....Weisswurst with parsley and of course the  Sheboygan bratwurstthey also have lots of little chocolate and other assorted candy treats... and you should just see there togo menu. they also will cure and smoke ham and bacon for you or process your kills if you went hunting...   no to mention they  do smoked chorizo...wtf smoked chorizo!!! awwww yeah.... come get some.
<review# 1498,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/8/2010,6/24/2010,512,236,3,6,7>Why... why.. why.. WHY did I do this to myself? Especially the day before the start of my new "eating healthy" routine....It was love at first sight when I saw the black olives and mushroom slice. I've only dreamt of a pizza so loaded with olives before, but now it was right infront of me! You do not understand my love for black olives.After a couple of drinks at our local dive my friend and I marched on over here, he was shocked I had never been there before so he ordered me to try it. I suppose the random hippies and bums that like their outdoor seating was what drew me away all this time.A giant slice is $5, reasonable especially since everything is made there and the products are top notch. Once get our piping hot pizza we head over to a little table they have in the corner, it's filled with all types of condiments and every hot sauce under the sun! Yum, I love condiments! It was a little too warm for us inside but they do offer indoor seating but we found a nice little table outside to enjoy the breeze.The pizza was delicious, just the right amount of everything and perfectly cooked. The best part was, the crust is stuffed with pesto. It was like having a different pizza slice at the end! If I could have pesto stuffed crust all day, believe me I would!Now if the staff would crack a smile, it would be the cherry on top.
<review# 1499,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/10/2010,3/10/2011,180,228,3,8,6>I have used Unseen Heroes for several projects over the years, specifically club fliers and business card design. In my opinion, their level of quality is pristine. These days, it seems, all you need is a bootleg copy of Photoshop CS on your computer and magically you're a graphic designer, pumping out preset template after preset template, using the same old fonts and the same old models in bikinis. Unseen Heroes takes it to the next level by staying up to date with the latest fonts and trends, stepping outside the standard idea of what a flier or business card should look like, and allowing their imagination to run wild. UH is also really good at analyzing your whole idea or theme and creating a logo or design that perfectly matches what you had envisioned. Other services they provide: web design, image consulting, event planning & management, social media... the list goes on and on. I recommend their services to everyone. Their prices are fair, their turnaround time is quick, and their attention to detail is unmatched.

The service is also on point. Felt like I made out like a bandit after I left this place.The down side is that only Coors Light, Bud Light, and Budweiser were $3, and there weren't any HH mixed drink specials. Il Fornaio next door had a much better selection of HH beers including Corona, Heini, and Guiness... AND they had 2 pages of $5 mixed drinks! I've also been here for dinner which I'd give a solid 3 stars, but that's a whole different review.My verdict: come here for the 5 star food and hit up Il Fornaio next door for the cheap drinks.

I wanted more the other night, when I had my first experience with their taste, But. was so full already. So I have to wait...... to have another delicious encounter with those balls, so red on the outside and white and creamy on the inside.I always thought this place was mediocre, but on Saturday, I discovered that they had Red Balls on the menu. Taka, I love your balls. Red ahi sashimi style, encasing a beatuiful, creamy, spicy and sweet crab meat, all sitting atop a pool of a sesame, chile type sauce. Or was it peanut? Perhaps it was peanut. Bust it! Give me more now! For only $9.95? Oh yeah. Sold.

<review# 1507,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/27/2011,3/2/2011,150,115,5,6,10>I absolutely could not complain about Chocolate Fish even if I tried. Their coffee and espresso are delicious and selected with love. The menu has a perfect mixture of all the cafe basics with no funky made up names. They do have a "from downunda" section of drinks as they'd be ordered in New Zealand. This gives them an authentic originality. They're decorated in a modern but inviting way that gives it a cool vibe.The baristas themselves make coming here even better. They learn everyone's names despite the huge clientele they get from PERS' regulars. Actually, I think we kind of suck for not knowing their names in return. I just have my own affectionate names in mind such as "guy with the really pretty eyes" and "guy with the amazing red beard" (I'm sorry, my husband has made me such a beard fan). Come here if you're looking for some tasty coffee and a warm environment to sip it in.

<review# 1509,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2011,7/12/2011,192,54,10,10,9>I've been to Press Bistro twice now. My first visit was amazing but I needed a revisit before I could really form an honest and though-out opinion of my experience.My most recent visit took place on Second Saturday. We called ahead for a reservation and, no surprise, they were booked until after nine. Knowing that my food karma has been in a positive flow lately, we decided to take a chance and walked over anyways. There was scattered seating at the communal table or a spot at the bar. We opted for the latter.Aside; Our bartender/server was Jordan and if you get the chance he'll give you the most for your money.We started with drinks; a Salt & Pepper for her and I had a Bourbon Julep. I was forewarned that my bev was VERY bourbony and yet I forged ahead. I'm not usually one for cocktails but this one was a clear winner. Intoxicating in more than the literal sense. The bourbon's heady bouquet filled my sinuses and tickled my synapse, causing me to suspect that the evening was headed in a very promising direction.As we were plotting a night out on the town we opted for a simple tour of soup, salad and small plates. Jordan must have sensed our energy building in anticipation for a busy evening as he offered to bring out our spread in fell swoop.Dizzy from the synergy of booze and high ceilings we agreed with matching dopey smiles. And so it came; at least five plates of perfectly portioned and plated heaven like so many bits of dreams made into reality.A brief rundown of the night's offerings; oxtail and onion soup, salad with goat cheese, figs, pomegranate, orange and shaved fennel, roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and a crepe with wild mushroom in  cream sauce. The food; incredible, and not finished. We had just enough appetite and lack of self control remaining that we ordered dessert: crepes again, this time with bananas and almonds and rum ice cream.While the food and the drink and the ambiance were all part of this recipe for success what really impressed me was seeing Head Chef and owner David English EVERYWHERE. Cooking our food, answering the phone, quality controlling and graciously greeting his pleased patrons. Truly a man with a vision made effective in its design.Now, I'm not Daddy Warbucks or even the Monopoly guy so I won't be involving the Press in my regular dining out agenda. I will, however, make every excuse necessary to turn any random and mundane evening into a spacial event worthy of a memorable visit to what may quickly become my new favorite dining establishment in Sacramento.
<review# 1510,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2011,7/11/2011,141,309,8,11,11>Drooool... *sniff, sniff, sniff* drooooool... *sniff*This place is NOT a happy place when I'm starving. As soon as I pull up, the air surrounding the place smells simultaneously of lime, spices, and fresh grilled meat, making my rumbly stomach less patient than kindergartners rushing off to recess. Tummy tells me, "I need it NOWWWW!!!" I wipe off my mouth, drag my limp body to the register, and grow impatient as the nice man makes my meal fresh.Perhaps I've been spoiled by Taco Bell (the quickness, at least - order, receive, scarf within 3 minutes flat). The guys at Chando's make each order as it comes in, so it can take up to 8 MINUTES!!!! to receive your food. Trust me, this feels like a lifetime with that god-like smell wafting out of the window cracks.My favorite is the fish tacos - not fried, just flaky, spicy, and fresh. Their horchata is out of this world - creamy and super cinnamony.

That being said, I feel sooo lucky to be an Elite with Alex as the CM. His events are so inventive and I love all of the themes. This one was no exception: Tequila Museo Mayahuel is a beautiful restaurant that was amped up with the amazing decor and wall paintings and slide shows. The Mayan dancers were such a nice surprise!As for the food, whatever little appetizers I had were delicious! I've never had roasted cactus before. I was not quick enough (read: I sat down and never got back up...I'll explain later) to get to the waitresses before the food disappeared, but I did try a few bites here and there and it was gooood. As for the drinks, the chili rimmed watermelon margarita and house margarita were really good...was there even alcohol inside? I guess it didn't really matter because Don Pilar was there, and he brought a TON of tequila. I did not hesitate to try a one, two........seven samples, which inevitably led to me sitting down for the remainder of my time there. Thanks to Melissa for the great pictures, and to Yelp for our snazzy watches and for throwing such a great event!
<review# 1512,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/15/2011,7/9/2011,648,305,9,18,15>Stellar service. (and not that fake stuff either) We walked in on a gloomy Monday, around lunch time in need of some kick-ass comfort food. Right away, we were greeted by the most gracious host/server/busboy (yes, all in one) and took a seat next to the window. I had read, as I always do, on this really cool review site (rhymes with "Help") that they serve a lunch buffet...Sold! We placed our drink orders, and dug right in. I tried to taste a bit of everything, (which was plenty) so Ill try to keep it short- There were SO many choices (including a salad bar) and the area was kept super clean- even for a lunch rush. Try the Dal soup. Its amazing, and full of lentils, herbs and unique spices. It was probably my favorite thing. I'm never really a huge rice fan, but the basmati was okay. The Chicken Tandoori? To die for - I'm really appreciating the mild use of spice here, since I just cant really take places that feel the need to go crazy with the allspice/curries. The naan was some of the best Ive ever had- not as buttery as Bombay, but much fluffier, and not too dry. Mr L had the Lamb Curry, claiming it to be tender, and seasoned perfectly, in fact, I lost count the number of times he dipped his naan in there (TWSS!) The chau chau wasn't anything to write home about, but I'm not complaining either. I'm not a huge samosa fan, but it was actually quite awesome. I had the veggie, and would probably try it again. I cannot recall the exact name, but I really loved the spinach Saag- kinda spicy, but made a great dipping sauce! There are a few other things I tried to make myself remember the names of, like this veg dish that tasted like a sweet citrus peel of some kind...it was pretty tasty. I know it sounds unbelievable- but that was all in ONE buffet trip! I love variety. The kiddo had the Rus Malai, which is a cheese I thought tasted much like rice pudding- I also suggest the Kheer...amazingness. We washed it all down with a mango lassi, for the wee one (better than Bombay's) a Himalayan ice tea (meh) for me, and chai teas. Hell. Yes. I'm coming back. With a gorgeous atmosphere, great staff and wonderfully priced rockin' food? Sooner than later.

Yes LOANED to me to come and take the part out so i could replace it with what I bought.  I didnt even know what was wrong i just took the thing apart and took a picture with my iphone told the guy it was leaking.  he took a look and said oh you need to replace this and said it required a special tool that he had and I could borrow and bring back to him.  My boys go get misc bolts and stiff in the cutting room ALL the time.  Sign up for their Ace Rewards club and save even more. And for a nice special treat they have dog biscuits at the front checkout counters for you pets when you bring them in with you, yes well behaved dogs are permitted in the store to shop with you so you dont have to leave them in your hot car.The garden department is a treat too with the Koi Pond in the back room with the indoor plants.  Come check them out.
<review# 1514,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/15/2011,7/7/2011,324,135,10,15,15>Deep in the heart of the cold, cold city--across from the Sheraton and next door to a Subway--sits Muntean's, serving hot soup varieties, bread bowls and sandwiches. This is a great little, no frills lunch spot with a walk-up counter and generous seating all around. A simple deli where you can sit, eat and watch the world go by.The soups are outstanding. An assortment of 6 to 8 at a time, broths and potages, some names I'd never heard of, others too saliva-inducing not to try. And they hand out samples like Halloween candy. It will test your decision-making.I settled for the lunch combo: pastrami on rye with a bowl of Ro Mulligatoni(their spelling) for $8.95. Added a bottled soda and ended up paying $12 total. When I picked up my order, I was disappointed to find that the sandwich, despite being made with care, had just a few strips of pastrami layered between what was probably supermarket rye bread. Maybe it's just the gluttonous American consumer in me but I was expecting(hoping) for the usual 2-inch high stack of cured, smoked beef. Didn't happen. The soup, on the other hand, was a fairly reasonable size but, all in all, the meal was a lot less bang for the buck than I was expecting(hey, Muntean...no bread for me? How 'bout a nice slice of sourdough for dipping at least? No?)Chalk it up to quality over quantity, perhaps. There are better lunch deals out there but Muntean's soups--hell, even that tiny sandwich--are delicious. The bread bowls call to me. The stews and chilies haunt me.I'll go back, likely before the summer sun warms the shadowy city streets, grab a bowl of curry potato, sit and watch the world go by.
<review# 1515,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/16/2011,7/6/2011,179,181,13,20,14>I felt a little weird walking into the Round Corner at 1 p.m. on a Thursday, but the draw of a menu touting BBQ AND vegan food - inside a local bar no less - was too much to pass up. It took a while to decide what I wanted since I am a lover of both, but I ended up with the West Coast Crunch, a burger topped with onion rings, bacon and BBQ sauce (goooooooodbye, diet!), and a round of cheese "stix" (for the Midwesterner lurking within me). The stix were pretty standard deep-fried fare (and probably would have tasted a little more amazing had I had a beer or two while waiting for my food), but the burger was deelish. It's hard to go wrong with that combo of toppings, and this place did it right. I'm excited to return to try the vegan fare. That is, if I don't get swayed by the lure of tri-tip. The atmosphere is, of course, dive-y, so I don't think I'll eat in-house unless I'm already there for brews, but there is takeout and for a $3 fee, Downtown's delivers. Things of note: * As of now, Downtown's only accepts cash* Don't think of taking your kids for a family, sit-down meal. They're not allowed inside * The prices on the web are cheaper than the printed menu someone left on my car, so expect to pay a bit more (although it's still pretty cheap!)Now if you'll excuse me, I must surrender to the post-burger coma that awaits.

There's great tasting ribs, chicken,  and tri-tip. All the great barbeque exquisite you can eat.. I liked the food here very much. Most of the things I've tried were delicious and had a hint of spiciness to it. The sides were pretty good too. I didn't quite enjoy the barbeque chicken though; the flavors didn't catch my palette's attention. I think the texture wasn't that great. The Ribs were pretty good and fell off the bone. It had quite a bit of smokiness taste to it.The Tri-tip was very very good. It was flavorful and had a good meat taste to it. The fries are easily pass over, its just you normal fries; not special too it. The spicy corn was good and different. The Green had a subtle kick to it but good. Overall, Sandra Dee's was enjoyable. I recommended for people to try.Pros: Good foodCons: Not for people who do not tolerate any spiciness to their food.Stars: 3.75
<review# 1517,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2010,7/4/2011,133,189,11,14,15>My friend and I threw a surprise party for my best friend and fellow yelper Candice C. on Saturday night.We called a few days in advance to book the room and they gave us the low down of what would happen. Since we were booking for a birthday party, we were able to get 20% off of the total bill and it would be $50 bucks per hour for 20 people. We were able to come in an hour early to set up decorations and food. You're allowed to bring your own food, but you gotta leave the beverages at home.On the night of the party everything went as planned. We had some friends set up decorations and snacks. The fellas at the front desk were totally awesome and our birthday girl was 100% surprised. Candice rocked the mic all night long with great tunes that everyone could sing along to. I usually don't do karaoke but for this special occasion I sang No Diggity by Blackstreet and Mambo #5 by Lou Bega. Oooh yeah!I totally recommend this place!

I have been wanting to try this place for awhile. I have passed it a millions times in my life and never knew what kind of food they served until I looked it up on yelp. I had such a pleasant experience that I will definitely be visiting time and time again.The hours are a little odd. They open for lunch, then close, then open again at 5pm for the dinner crowd. I arrived, unknowing to the hours, at 4:40, pulled on the door and found it locked. I was confused and peeked inside. I saw a woman behind the counted who began waving and smiling at me and giving me gestures that she is going to unlock the door for me. That's when I saw the business hours and thought, Damn, I'm going to have to wait here for 20min for them to open. grrr.. But nope, A man came over and let me in 20 min before opening. This I loved. The woman at the front counter was very nice. She talked to me about the weather and made other small chat. I ordered the dinner special which is ridiculously priced at $6.99 for your choice of meat, rice or noodles, two egg rolls, five fried shrimp, and a beverage!!! I became nervous thinking there has to be a catch for this food to be so cheap!After I ordered I noticed that hated sign that reads "Cash only" I said a ton of expletives in my head because I hate cash only places. I never have cash on me. The woman pointed out that there was a ATM machine across the way, so while she started cooking my food I took a stroll to the ATM ,said even more curse words as I accepted the $3.00 with drawl fee and walked back.   After paying, I sat and eavesdropped on the table of boys across from me talk about who had seen Toy Story 3. (ha ha) Looking around the place I noticed that it's very basic as far as decor goes, but I don't really rate on stuff like that unless I'm looking for a place that is supposed to be all ritzy and foofy.After all, I would much rather go into a shabby place to eat great food then go into a place that is cute in all its decor and eat mediocre food. Any who, the woman brought over my food and I left.I got home opened the box and dropped my mouth open at the sight of all the food before me! It was HUGE! SO MUCH KUNG POW CHICKEN, 5 SHRIMP, TWO EGG ROLLS, A MOUNTAIN OF CHOW MIEN! I changed into my stretchy pants and watched my soap opera on hulu, eating all this deliciousness. The egg rolls were so good. The cabbage and carrots inside had texture to them, it wasn't just a bunch of mush wrapped up into a crisp package like I'm used to receiving else where. The shrimp had the tails cut off, which I prefer, because I hate when I bite down on the tail of a shrimp. The chow mien wasn't greasy (yet another thing I'm used to receiving at a Chinese restaurant) The Kung Pow chicken was also very good. A little salty but very flavorful. I loved seeing all the chilies and  seeds on my meat, I also loved the whole peanuts they tossed in as well. It wasn't too spicy and yet had a good kick to it.5 star service5 star prices10 star portions (could have easily fed 2-3 people on one dinner special.)4 star food (I say four rather then 5 simply because it was, like I said, a little bit more salty then I prefer) I'm happy I finally try this place because this will now be my go to Chinese spot whenever the mood strikes me. Just remember, CASH ONLY! =)

<review# 1521,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2007,11/27/2007,267,274,2,2,4>I have to admit...I went to the Squeeze Inn because I saw in on the Food Network...What can I say? I am a sucker for anything I see on tv,All of their stuff says "The Best Burgers in Town". Usually when you hear restaurants or stores make that claim you just brush it off. How many times have you seen something like: "Best Coffee in America". Well...I think this place was not just making a claim...these really were the best burgers in town!I think we got very lucky when we made our way down to the Squeeze Inn. Every review I read spoke of people having to wait in an hour in a line out the door just to sit down at one of the stools. When we walked in there was no wait...just 3 stools sitting there beckoning us to sit down.ANYWAYS...back to the burger. We all ordered a "squeeze burger" with cheese. The cheese is the really the whole reason for getting a burger from the Squeeze Inn, it is not that bland American cheese, but cheddar...real good delicious greasy heart clogging cheddar. They put the cheese on the burger on the grill so it melts all over the grill and gives you a cheese "skirt". umm.. YUM.All the veggies on the burger are super fresh and crunchy. The french fries are delish too. Just the right consistency and huge portions (3 of us split a large and did not finish it).As an added bonus...I have a thing for ice...I love good ice. You know..the old style ice that taco bell use to have...like ice pellets?? or the kind of ice you get in the hospital when you are nauseous? If a place has good ice I am so excited.This place had delicious ice. See...the small things in life really do make me happy!So if you are ever in Sacramento and need a good greasy burger fix you MUST make your way over to the squeeze inn. Trust me ... you will not regret the extra calories.

It's seriously good for any crowd, and looking around once you get inside, you know it. Crusty punks who slept in their touring van after their show at Old Ironsides the previous night, to a couple coming into town from the delta to celebrate their 63rd wedding anniversary.But what about the food? Good stuff. I really like the french toast blast and the pecan waffle. I don't think I've ever ordered anything other than food-coma-commencing starch n grease breakfasts, but you hardly need to. It's not exactly sophisticated cuisine, but at least you can order anything on the menu and not be dissapointed, or at least not be grossed out. Too many similar places do several or just one thing well, and they'll screw up the eggs, or the toast, or the home fries. Not here. Across the board, everything is "mmm"-worthy.Yes, the waitresses actually attend to your coffee cup (like, religiously).Yes, you can buy a tacky birthday card with a humerous caricachure of a cowboy doing something stupid on it.Yes, you can get hash browns with that.Yes, there will be wall-mounted wicker crafts.No, you will not leave hungry or broke.They have a private parking lot, and it's usually ample, but don't be too surprised if it fills up one day and you have to park on the street. It's on a corner of a one-way street, too, so out-of-towners, please pay attention and plan ahead.

Everybody loves pie... and the pizza's really tasty too.

Why do I bring this up?  Because today I wished I could be genetically altered and crossed with a cow so I could have four stomachs.What prompted this?  The pure, unadulterated yum-yums at Banzai Sushi.  Banzai has been on our list of places to eat since reading Ally D's review.  Thank you Ally!  After being seated, we were handed TWO menus -- one for rolls (4 pages), and one for everything else (6 pages).  And BONUS, the menus had photographs of their offerings! What sounded good on paper was even better as a visual.  Didn't make our choice any easier...hence the need for more stomachs.The place was much bigger than we expected -- it looks like the place has been remodeled since earlier reviews were written.  There are 4 tables for 2, 4 tables for 6, and 6 tables for 4, and they were all filled tonight.  Last night (yes, hehe, we ate there two nights in a row), K had the gyudon (great flavoring), and I had the double hamachi roll (nice and fresh).  Tonight K had the niku udon (perfect), I had the hamachi kama (a little too salty), and we shared a plate of sea steak (muah!).  Jason kept us stocked with rice, and brought us our food within 10 minutes of our order.I'm just dittoing what everyone else has said -- the good news is there are more tables to ensure you too can get seated and enjoy the chow.

I think all my arteries were completely clogged after I finished my Gi-Normous burger! Sure, I've heard of this place. People talk about it. I've tried to come here once after work but it was closed.. what restaurant closes at like 6 pm?! Do Vampires come out when it's dark? Why does it have to close before dinner?! Maybe they were having a Valentine's Day clog-your-arteries-fest cause they were opened til 8 pm tonight. Or they were opened late to allow sad loveless individuals to commit suicide by obesity on this day (like me). At any rate, does it live up to the hype? Hell yes! That was one fine burger..The place is pretty small and the lines are usually long. I heard that during lunch time, the wait can be 45 mins or longer! I came in at a time where there wasn't a line but I still had to wait 20 mins for my burger and fries. I was starving! When I took the first bite of my burger, it was pure divine oily bliss... Mmm... Of course the burger comes out looking like a cheesy-meaty-flying saucer, I wasn't even sure how to attack the thing, or if it was going to attack me first. The cheese skirt seems to be Squeeze Inn's signature design, and it was quite delectable!     Squeeze Inn triumphs in the unique burger realm. Prices are reasonable ($5-$8), about the same as Five Guys but about 10x better. I will definitely come back.. maybe next Valentine's Day when I try to OD on cholesterol again. If you haven't tried this place, I would highly recommend! Much love to everyone tonight! Happy Valentine's Day! :)

This wasn't like most clearance racks. You know the ones where a bunch of super dingy dusty clothes from last season that are hardly wearable sit. Heart's clearance rack is completely different. The clearance items are super cute and totally wearable!  I stopped by and bought a pair of pants off the sale rack for only $12. I'm a hello kitty freak and they have a ton of that stuff to fuel my obsession too not to mention the lovely little charms and knick-knack accessories that are pleasantly displayed through the store. It's amazing what the owner has done with such a small space. Every inch of it is accounted for! Even a fitting room. I also love how it's decorated, very modern and chic.This is only 2 blocks from my work and I pass it everyday going from work to back home...ugh, it's unhealthy how close this is...

So this review will clearly not be about coffee.I do drink tea and, when ordering at a coffeehouse, I'll likely get a chai latte. But again, my taste for hot drinks isn't particularly discerning. So, this review will clearly not be about tea.Shine offers free wifi. But with the prevalence of hot spots, connect cards and smartphone apps, is it really a selling point? Not to me, so this review will clearly not be about wifi.Inconceivable, you say? That I'm writing a 5-star review about nothing?Here's something: ambiance. Atmosphere, aura--whatever you want to call it. Shine has it. In abundance. From the bar seats along the windows to the back-to-back living room sets to that giant denim couch, I've never felt more like I was in my own home than when at Shine. And I don't own THAT much denim.It's space, comfort and sunlight--Shine has lots of windows. Also, quiet. The openness dilutes conversations so you don't hear much more than soft music and the staffers busily going about their business. Ah, such serenity.Can you get a good drink at Shine? Probably. Can you blitzkrieg the web? No doubt. Can you enjoy all that in one of the most peaceful and relaxing environments in Sac?Completely conceivable.

I spring for the pricier shampoos & hair products, I don't think a DEP product has touched my scalp since 6th grade and I'm always fighting with the lay of the flop for at least 10 minutes in the morning to make it look right. I'm sorry Suave, your crap does not compare to the salon brands, as my hair feels like a Brillo Pad after I use your Vanilla-Appletini conditioner.   I digress. My point is, I really can't afford a $40+ hair cut right now. Oh I know ladies, you can pay $200+ for your stylin' looks, but for guys it's different, aight? We males often get our hair did every month. Ya'll women can go six months in between styles if you wanted to. Plus, unless you're Pete Wentz, dudes do not spring for highlights. Though I'd like to get the full treatment and style upstairs at this place, for now, I wallow in the downstairs paddock where they only charge $15 per cut. But the end result is 10x better than the chain shops. I honestly walk out of those places looking like an Asian school girl sometimes. Not that that isn't a good look or anything, it's just I'm not Asian, don't go to school and I have a wiener. I don't need no blow dry, I don't need no product up in this mane, getcha scissors or razor out and get all Barber of Seville on my follicles if you want. Just take your time.  And that's what I really appreciate most about this place. They take their time to make it look right. Yeah, mmph. Yeah, I'm lookin' good. Usually I throw them a large-ish tip down as I feel it's under priced, but don't get any funky ideas Space 07 - I like the current rate as it is for the transaction. Don't go jimmy jackin' the price up just because you wanna be ultra-sheik and keep your street cred. Right now you stand at 5 stars, don't make me deduct!
<review# 1534,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2010,4/25/2011,313,152,20,24,23>Shabu Shabu is a Japanese variant of hot pot, for those of you who don't know what hot pot is, it's basically an asian form of fondue consisting of a huge goblet sized metal pot of stock at the center of the dining table. You and you're entourage get drunk off of the cosmic soup of never ending fresh ingredients. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and are cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, won-tons, egg dumplings, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce and consumed with shots of sake, and mounds of good times and laughs.Ok enough of the boring mutual of omaha mumbo jumbo. I stumbled into this place to meet up with the owner (Anthony) and a few of my fellow yelpers and boy was I glad I did. The great service in conjunction with the awesome quality and quantity of the food is definitely going to get me to come back again and again.FYI, they're lemonade sake is made with holy water distilled from Buddhas own private stock of lemons, yeah that's how good it is. I tried to recreate the ohh my goodness effect in my lab but the concoction blew up in my kitchen sink. Try once try twice try three times but definitely try and try again.This place gets my coveted three HOLLA HOLLA HOLLA'S
<review# 1535,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/4/2011,4/24/2011,667,245,9,9,7>It was kinda embarrassing walking into a nice, hip, trendy restaurant while my friend (Chris I.) and I walked in dressed down, hella scrubby! Lazy Sunday's! I'm glad they didn't give us the stink eye! They still gave us the best possible service! The food is amazing here! I definitely recommend trying the Seafood Nachos! It has the perfect amount of spice added to it too! They were very creative and used fried wonton wrappers as the "nacho." The Volcano roll was pretty awesome as well! I loved the fried tempura they sprinkled all over! The roll was pretty ginormous too! Well worth the $15 for it! I love how there were a lot of pictures on the menu! Made me want to order everything! Between the two of us, we ordered 4 plates of food and killed it all. #FAT I know! I can't wait to come back here and try the rest of the yummy goodness on the menu! Definitely one of my fave Japanese restaurants now, next to Kru!
<review# 1536,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2011,4/23/2011,277,126,11,11,11>I had the pleasure of being CM Alex's plus one last night and further honored to be a part of a big ol' Funky Family Free-For-All that took place at House Kitchen & Bar.Everyone looked amazing! Shout out to all the sexy sistas with their Afros and Farah Faucett feathers and to the bold brothers wearing that tight polyester and platform kicks.  Yelpers have a lot of spirit and really  commit 100%!  First and foremost, I have to give the House bartenders lots of love.  I wish I could remember their names.   (The cutie bartender with the floppy hat and killer shades and the afroed beauty with the tats.) They consistently served up stiff liquid candies my way that nearly erased my short term memory of last night.  That's great service!   House generously offered two complementary mixed drinks: the raspberry ice pick and fuzzy navel and served Olympia beer out on the patio.  I didn't try the navel because the ice pick was so sweet-tart tasty I couldn't bring myself to cheat on it.  I can't wait to come back and enjoy the patio with a drink and dream on a hot day in the near future. I had a healthy sampling of the most of the appetizers and desserts:  deviled eggs, spinach & artichoke dip, lettuce wraps, BBQ slider, mac and cheese, red velvet cupcakes and cheesecake bites.   I forget how good a simple deviled egg can be!  And throw some capers into the mix and I'm sold!  I thought the food was a solid display of classic American favorites.  My top choices hands down were the mac and cheese and cheesecake.   What can I say, I love cheese anything!  These savory sneak peeks spiked my interest and I will be revisiting to see what the full menu has to offer soon.House is in a great location, smack dab in the middle of capitol mall.  I loved the spaciousness of the restaurant itself and the decor.  Minimal but warm;  wood paneling, windows everywhere and bright flowers lend itself that that homey/comfort feel.  After being at the party for about an hour I noticed there's a huge whisk hanging from the ceiling.  How did I not notice that sooner?  What can I say, I'm short and close to the ground.Details like the 8 track cassettes, funk albums, disco balls, abba-zabbas, tootsie pops and other retro goodies mixed with the all the Yelp swag at each table evoked that time warp feel.  I found myself drifting away from conversations because I was distracted by the Soul Train unscramble video clips playing on the TV screens.  I was determined to get ALL the scrambles right.Again, the house staff were beyond hospitable and really seemed to be enjoying the soul funk theme.  After all the mingling, munching, and imbibing, there was nothing left to do but DANCE!Asses were shaking and hips were gyrating to the funk the DJs were spinning.  The music was unbelievable!  All I can say is Gawd Damn!   Every song played was better than the next.  The DJs, Blaze and Lefty, accommodated to what us yelpers wanted to hear.  Towards the end of the night we shifted from funky James Brown to disco Donna Summer!  There was group dance (the Hustle), some free-styling, and a sick soul train line! All in all, there were some shameful and proud moments on the dance floor.  I am sure Minh captured them all (fingers crossed).  Speaking of, Minh was stealth-like; laying on the floor, crouching in a corner, snapping away during the event.  I can't wait to see the evidence!The Soul Shakedown event set up was perfect in that the music volume level, the amount of space, the buffet location, the number of people in attendance,  were just right for socializing.  Yelpers are some cool cats!  I got the opportunity to get to know some Yelpers a little better  and made some great friends.  Congratulations to all the prize winners!  Best dressed and dancers were aptly awarded to the right folks!Last night's boogie was FOR REAL!
<review# 1537,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2011,4/22/2011,648,305,7,17,15>I decided I had to become a member here a few back, and its one of the best things Ive ever done. Honest to blog. I go at least a few times a month, whether its for an Art Mix, event, a showing...hell, even shopping. Its never a dull trip. This is where I learned to lose myself in the beauty of a painting. Kudos to the Artistic Directors..Im always caught up in lighting/color schemes...frames too (if you've read my De Young review) The new addition compliments the historic mansion extremely well. The first time I went through in October- I didn't realize I had wandered into the old East wing. I'm am a tad upset about not being able to enter through the mansion doors anymore (Northside), but its nice to be able to say Ive done it... If you haven't come by yet... I feel sorry for you.I am in LOVE with Gottfried Helnwein. Ive followed his work for a while, and I feel honored as a Sacramentan to have his work on display right now. Its worth a peek even if you find it slightly offensive. I also suggest reading his memoirs before judging (judge what you may, its phenomenal ) Photo realism just rocks my socks. Alriiight, back to the museum- the cafe is brilliant- a wee small, but the dining area is bright and wide open. It'd make an awesome reception area. Food here isn't terribly priced either- Ill be back for that burger for SURE. I love the gift shop- its the coolest place to buy someone...a gift. I like to "gift " myself, so bought a set of watercolors and postcards to paint on. (The kid was pretty good, so she got some scented molding clay)Prices aren't shabby, and as a member, you'll get 10% off (cafe too) Truth is, Ive already paid for my annual membership..Ive been back over 16 (count my stickers) times since October- and every time I enter, I find something I had missed before. I HIGHLY suggest a visit. Even well behaved kids are in awe of its "awe"someness (mine's 4) Have fun, and Get to the Gottfried before it leaves in April- I promise you'll thank me.
<review# 1538,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/14/2011,4/21/2011,60,112,2,15,9>Came here last night for Steve Aoki and WOW!!  District 30 really went big!! This a completely new style for Sac and I LOVE it!!  This is just what K street needed.The club itself did not disappoint at all.  When they said they were bringing Vegas and LA to Sac they weren't joking.  It was much larger than it looks in the pictures.  The bar looks fantastic, the booths are comfy and the layout is perfect for the space.  The decor in general is exactly what you would expect from a higher end club.       Music: Before I came, I read all of these reviews about the place and they always emphasized the sound system.  So I had really high hopes and to be honest, it was everything they had promised and more!  Also, I Love House... so I have a feeling this is going to be my new spot.    Now onto the important stuff.. the drinks!!  They are really really reasonably priced.  $7 for a whiskey sour that wasn't skimping on the whiskey.  I can definitely handle that.  Service: The table service here is phenomenal.  We were out of cranberry juice and literally within a minute and without asking there was a new thing of juice on the table.  Also, the bar never really seemed backed up.  They took my order and got me my drinks in the same amount of time that it would take other clubs to acknowledge my existence.  And last but not least the security.  I have had bad experiences with security and I'm not even a rowdy, disrespectful girl.  But these guys were not only really friendly but they were really fun (while still doing their job of course).  Overall, two big thumbs up to District 30!  Ruby Skye and everyone who was apart of getting this place going... THANK YOU
<review# 1539,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/4/2012,3/9/2013,667,245,4,9,10>My pup celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday. We wanted to order him a doggie birthday cake to spoil him a bit, and I came across Bath & Biscuits after doing some research online. They have 3 different sizes of cakes in different shapes. We ordered the medium one in a bone shape for $16.99! So cute! We were also able to choose what frosting color we wanted and had "Happy Birthday Remy" written on the cake as well! The price might seem a little pricey to some, but  seeing your pup excited to stuff their faces with food they don't normal get to have everyday is priceless!
<review# 1540,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2013,3/8/2013,200,68,14,12,13>There where two instances that made me  realize I eat here way too much:1. I asked my friends if they wanted to get a quick bite to eat and they said "So I guess we going to Dos"2. I called in a To Go and they recognized me by my order.I make no apologiies for my addiction to Dos, or that some people don't  consider Dos "REAL" Mexican food.  I don't know if people expect an Aztec priest doing ritual sacrifices in between bussing empty tables and making the guacamole to consider it real.  Just enjoy the wonderful food they do offer.Their menu is huge and have a great variety of fresh salads.  My current crush is on the Yucatan chicken salad.  I have experienced the lights dimming and angels singing after digging into this salad with it's creamy chipotle dressing topping the sweet peppers, chicken, corn, green leafy lettuce and the other array of goodies.  And if your not in the mood for singing angels, you can never go wrong with the Border Burrito.
<review# 1541,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/18/2012,3/7/2013,648,305,3,16,12>Wow... how did I not know about you until recently? From the outside, I have always thought Iron Steaks looked stuffy, cramped and not very crowd friendly...I was sooo wrong! Inside there are these amazing spacious curvy booths..this is my new favorite place to sit in Sacramento...you dont even know youre off Broadway! My better half, ordered the Iron Steak Salad- apparently better than Inks (now thats a memorable salad) I had the Breakfast Buritto (I dont know why) and it was amazing! The steak is perfectly seasoned, and a great cut! The kid finished her french Toast, so I assume it was great. Bottomless Mimosas? Decent Prices? Fantastic Atmosphere? Its all here!
<review# 1542,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2012,3/6/2013,290,371,11,16,12>Broderick Restaurant and Bar is one of Sacramento's greatest newest additions. Ever since stopping in for dinner and drinks 2 weeks ago its I've been fighting the urge to drop in more often than I should. First off if you already love the Wicked Wich truck, welcome home baby! The owners of the popular truck are co-owners of Broderick so if you don't feel like going on a "wich hunt" you can always find your favorite french fry filled sandwich at the restaurant as well as some of their newer creations.The first night we stopped in I had to have their copa sandwich while my boyfriend decided to try the Bleu Burger. The copa was everything I expected- fresh copa with slaw and fries sandwiched between two fluffy slices of bread just like off the truck. My boyfriend's burger was huge! I don't know how he even finished all of it and his fries! We both enjoyed our food and agreed we have to return to try all the other already popular items on the menu. Aside from the food the other thing I really enjoyed that night was my pineapple upside down drink. It was tall, strong and really tasty. Definitely a dangerous drink for all you fruity drink lovers because its a creeper!The second time we stopped in was for game 3 of the World Series. We got their early and parked ourselves in one of their nooks with a bunch of friends.  I couldn't think of any better spot for watching the game (other than actually being at the ballpark) than in our own private nook, up close to the TV, with 4 pounds of super sized, meaty wings and bucket of beer for $25! Again the food was delicious and service excellent! The waitresses checked on us often and doorman even helped get us set up with a few extra stools in our area. This is a great spot for watching games. They have several televisions, great food and still don't get as crowded as some of the other places Downtown so you can actually great. quick bar service.There is also plenty of free parking in their private lot and have live bands with no cover on the weekends.
<review# 1543,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/25/2012,3/5/2013,406,278,17,24,17>Finally!! A ramen house that I can be excited to eat at!! If you've read my other reviews, you know that I'm pretty picky about my ramen. I mean, I can stay home and make some $0.25 cent stove-top ramen, or I can go out and spend $10 on a bowl of hearty goodness. And when I spend that kind of dough on some... well... dough (har har har), I want it to be good! I'm pleased to say that Ramen House Ryujin satisfies my craving for ramen. It definitely beats any of the other places in the area. I've tried to Black Garlic Tonkatsu and the "Spicy" Tonkatsu. I would hands-down recommend the Black Garlic Tonkatsu. The broth is so rich and thick with flavor. The "spicy" version has some heat but also a sour-taste that may be due to some kimchi (?) A single bowl gets me very full, so I wouldn't suggest ordering more noodles unless you eat a lot. I'm a 5'3" petite Asian girl but I sure can eat, so you decide. Their eggs are hit or miss. During my first visit, the egg was so runny and delicious! Now, every time I've visited, it has just been cold and not runny at all. I've also tried their Tako Yaki (which is just ok) and their Octopus legs (pretty decent). The staff is extremely attentive and friendly. You'll never want for water because your cup will always be full. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend you stop by and give this ramen house a try!
<review# 1544,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2013,3/4/2013,390,173,21,41,32>I felt so bad for the owner of the Cajun Wagon the day I visited. As I was approaching, another food truck (a truck serving Southern food no less!) pulled in and set up camp right behind him. I mean, come on...I know you have to expect competition, but this was ridiculous. It's one little area of office parks in Natomas. The other guy couldn't have found ANYwhere else to park for the day?Oh well, I wound up being very happy with my choice. I ordered seafood jambalaya and a combo of fried shrimp and catfish to get a little taste of everything. The jambalaya was some of the best I've ever had. A very generous portion of shrimp, fish, sausage, and vegies are served up on a bed of rice. The depth of flavor in that sauce coupled with just the right amount of spice was phenomenal.The fried shrimp and catfish were perfectly cooked and spiced. I was so happy to open the foil wrapped platter and not have mushy or rubbery food. The Cajun fries weren't as crispy as I would have liked, but considering they were wrapped and had to travel, it's forgivable. This combo was not advertised on his board, so I wound up being glad I asked.The truck can be found using it's Facebook page: facebook.com/TheCajunWag Sounds like he doesn't check his Twitter page as often, but if you'd still like to follow him his handle is @CajunWagon. Or he's also a member of the band of food trucks in the Food Mob ( GOFOODMOB.COM  or @GOFOODMOB on Twitter)The owner was proud to point out that he's been averaging five stars on Yelp since he took over the truck. Based on the quality of the food, I'm happy to keep his streak going.
<review# 1545,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2013,3/3/2013,136,157,8,11,9>Close to my house with great late night hours.Good selection of beer, I say good, not great because it seems it's a fairly common occurance to be out of that one beer I'm really craving..it's happened three different times with three different beers. (this is why it's four stars instead of five)Solid burgers, my favorite is the one with guacamole. If I feel like pretending to be healthy, I get a salad with my burger, if I'm throwing caution to the wind, it's garlic fries all the way!Ive also had the grilled ham and cheese sandwich, a stellar chicken sandwich, a great salad (fiji apple I think) and their cheese steak is pretty good too. You can't really go wrong here unless you're trying to stick to a diet ;-)
<review# 1546,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2013,3/2/2013,74,128,8,12,9>This is as good as it gets in my book.After going to a German store, then to an Khalsa Fabrics, an East Indian Store I was hungry.Pooja's Indian Grill was right down the street and after hearing so many good things about this place on Yelp here was my opportunity to see what it was all about.All of you who gave this place 4 or 5 stars are so right, those of you who did not do not know good food when you find it.How good is Pooja's? It is so good it is worth to cheat on Weight Watchers with, it is that good! This used to be the location of a German restaurant years ago, I have some fond food memories and some odd memories of the service.But this place is long gone and now Pooja's well presents the food of Northern India.I will be back.....(Said with a German accent)
<review# 1547,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/17/2013,3/1/2013,102,307,5,12,9>My co-worker and I were downtown for a training, it was freezing out so we decided that soup would be a perfect thing for lunch. Muntean's was just a short, chilly walk away, which perfectly prepped us for some hot delicious soup. Immediately upon entering we were heartily greeted and offered samples of any of the 12 soups they had on offer for the day. I saw them giving out samples even when it got super busy at about 11:45ish. I would recommend getting there early if you can, but they kept the line moving in spite of it all.I got the soup sampler, which was four small cups of soup and a generous portion of bread for 9 bucks. I chose the foccacia as it is perfect for dipping in soup. I like to try a little bit of everything, so this deal worked for me. I got the seafood bouillabaisse, the romanian onion, soupe de pesta and the mexicali (nice spicy kick!). All of the soups were served piping hot, fresh and delicious. It seems like there is something for everyone - hearty, light, meaty or vegetarian. My co-worker was impressed by the artichoke soup she got because it was not cream based and therefore lighter and to her taste. She also got a gyro on a homemade pita, which looked delicious. They serve many different sandwiches and many choices of bread. I would like to go back sometime when I am not so chilled and in need of the hot soup to warm me and try the other offerings. The decor of this lunch shop is fairly basic, but it will do just fine for a workday lunch. Everything is served in styrofoam bowls, with plastic utensils, so don't expect anything fancy. The food here is solid and the service is friendly and efficient, plus they are locally owned, for this reason it firmly deserves its high ratings.
<review# 1548,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2013,2/28/2013,434,368,18,28,21>My yelp elite days have finally caught up to me and I have joined a gym. Sigh. I've always been anti-gym membership because: 1.) I'm cheap, 2.) My workouts consisted of running outside for free, and 3.) I'm cheap. However, after seeing my sister's results and trying out the 10 day free pass, I was hooked to Fitness MD and the Fit Club classes. The classes are offered Mon-Fri and are the roughest 1 hour of my entire day. The workouts change daily; I've been a member since September and I've never done the same work out twice. The variety is both helpful for results and intimidating--you never know what to expect and I'm scared sometimes of what my body is going to have to go through (especially when the class title has the word "blaster" or "cardio" in it!). Don't let that scare you though! The range of gym members vary from beginners (I honestly never worked out with weights in my life before coming here) to really fit folks and you can always go at your own pace. The trainers are also really helpful and push you to work harder. I definitely need that accountability to keep me going. I'm currently working with Eric in radically changing my body for the next 6 weeks. He's added extra workouts and a recommended meal plan for me to follow. I'm nervous but I have a lot more confidence in my fitness ability now than when I first joined. Though it's a little on the pricey side for the Fit Club membership (I'm paying about $100 per month and have a 1 year commitment), it's so worth it if you really want to get a good work out and see results. See me in 6 weeks and I will hopefully be better, faster, stronger. Then I will return to my yelping habits haha.

Osaka-Ya is also known locally for its summer shave ice.  The "old" Osaka-Ya used to have a hand-operated turn-of-the-century shaver from Japan, similar to the shaver used at the famous Matsumoto's Shave Ice on the North shore of Oahu.  Unlike the American "snow cone" machines that crunch ice through holes like a meat grinder producing pebbles of ice, the Japanese shave ice machines use a sharp blade to scrape the ice off ice blocks to form the closest thing to snow you will find.  Osaka-Ya, probably to provide efficiency, has switched to a neo-mechano shave ice machine.  Sigh.  However, they have kept the Japanese-made syrup that carries a delightful blend of fruit and sweet.  If you order strawberry, the syrup tastes like a sweet strawberry.The snow cone window also takes orders for smoothies, ice cream, floats, and other fountain staples.  We usually order the small snow cone cuz the large is HUGE.  The Snow Cone window accepts cash only.  Our infatuation with Osaka-Ya is unwavering and we give it a 4.  Your inner momma says to get some shave ice while the getting is good - the snow cone window closes sometime after Labor Day.

The fish was fresh, the service was prompt and efficient, the rice was decent.  All the portions were HUGE though. The prices were equivalent to San Francisco prices, but the portions were like all-American Texas portions. The unagi nigiri my husband ordered had enough unagi on it for 6 pieces of nigiri. CRAZY! I ordered the Popeye roll, filled with, you guessed it, spinach. That was a HUGE roll! I couldn't finish all the pieces!

Ever since I worked at Longs (that is no longer there) in 1996 when El Super Taco was in it's old location in the same shopping center. I averaged going here for lunch about 3 times a week every week. For 4 years. And I wonder why my hips are so big?I'm a devoted fan of their namesake, the super taco. It's a great size on a really good not soft but not crunchy tortilla, cheese, meat, lettuce, tomato and the salsa of your choice from their yummy salsa bar. I like the parmesan cheese on the outside of the tortilla (just like at Jimboy's!) but I can see why some might find it odd.Service is always really good, the owner, Julian is always there and gets to know and remember his customers.

Then I could eat at Whitey's whenever I want.  Oh well, I guess Whitey's peach shakes will be a treat and require a trip to the gym afterwards, or I could accept the fact that after a few my butt would get so big you could park a car under the shade of my a$$.  The hot dog was pretty damn good, but then again, I love hot dogs.  The fries were inhaled but that might have been me not wanting to share with my 3 year old friend.  Good thing she prefers eating ketchup to her french fries because that means more for me.  Whitey's is old school Americana car culture, which we all love and hate.
<review# 1556,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2007,9/8/2007,3,10,8,12,4>I always thought Les Schwab Tires was an unusual tire shop... what with the "we come running" and "free beef" commercials.  Seriously, they claim that when you pull in, they'll come running to you.  And "free beef"??  You know, the promo they run every year  where you buy tires and get free beef.  What could be weirder than that?  So I never gave these guys serious thought when buying tires or needing any tire-related service.Well, I didn't need new tires, but I did need the valve stems replaced on a couple of tires from my boat trailer, so I thought, what the hell, I'll give these guys a try.  And they're not too far from my house.  I'll be damned... one of the guys from the shop came running out to my truck when I pulled in.  Not walking, running.  No kidding.I tell the guy that I need the valve stems replaced on my trailer tires.  He unloads them from the back of my truck, rolls them into the shop, and points me to the cashier inside.  The very pregnant cashier was doing about three things at once (including calling some customer to find out when they could make an obviously delinquent payment on their tires/wheels).  She took my info and asked me if I'd ever been in the store before.  (No.)  I munched on the free popcorn in the waiting area while I waited and browsed at racks of tires in the store.  (Only I would browse in the tire store... at tires in sizes and styles meant for cars I don't own.)After about 15 or 20 minutes, the tech comes in and tells me my tires are done, he's already loaded them back in my truck, and he's replaced the cracked rubber valve stems with shiny chrome metal ones to match the rims.When I got to the counter, I got the biggest and most amazing surprise - they did this all completely for free.  They just said "come see us when you need some tires."  Wow, that was pretty cool.  They just gave me about $25 or 30 dollars worth of service for absolutely nothing, just the odd chance that I may come back someday. Maybe I'll come back for the free beef.

Fortune Cookie flops.  I was soo bummed (I can't help it, no poker face here, just sad puppy eyes).  So the nice man said "wait a minute, I'll check to see if we have any more to make up a bag." (he could have sold me 1/2 or 1/4 of a bag and I would have been most grateful). He then comes back to me with a full bag of the lovely flops and says "They're still warm too."  OMG - Heavens to Murgatroid! I'm having a good day now!And they are actually easier to eat when they're somewhat flattened.Side note: One of my favorite ways to enjoy this delight is to eat one Guittard milk chocolate chip, then a bite of the yummy fortune cookie flop  - and repeat.
<review# 1558,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2007,9/4/2007,65,28,7,9,5>It is difficult for me to overstate my fondness for K Street's newest installment, or my affection for its infinitely charming owner.  I confess that Hina herself rather fascinates me, and I would support her establishment even if she pedaled the appalling and shoddy kitsch one finds at a roadside Stuckey's.  She is unapologetically sniffish about the quality of her product, and politely insists that it be consumed respectfully and knowledgably.  Hina will not feed truffles to swine.  I know this firsthand: when I confessed my partiality for southern sweet tea, she furrowed her brow and looked at me with an incomprehension and frowning curiosity that I will not soon forget.  I may as well have told a nun that God was dead.  For all her elevation, though, Hina is not insufferable, pretentious, or condescending in the least.  She learned about tea in order to share that knowledge with her customers, not to lord it over us like an insecure pedant.  Her willingness to share is fortunate, because you will need Hina's expertise to negotiate her enormous and (so she says) continuously evolving inventory.  They have over 250 different kinds of tea, and all are, it would seem, of the highest quality: most are single origin or estate teas, and all the fruity infusions are flavored with certified organic produce.  Some might grumble about the prices, but a pot of organic or estate tea actually costs more at Temple than it does at Hina's.  In addition, complementary sampling is allowed and even encouraged.   Each day features a new "mystery tea," an endearing if silly gimmick brewed up (sorry) by Hina's husband, an amiable and delightfully ironic German fellow.  Be advised, though: trying a new tea under Hina's watchful gaze isn't like snatching up a pizza roll from the sample tray at Costco.  She is as interested in educating her customers as she is in gratifying them; she will not only unpack all the flavors you are tasting, but also explain what makes them so good together.Every part of this establishment reflects Hina's enthusiasm and expertise.  The design elements embody vibrancy and calm, dynamism and repose, in much the same way Hina herself does (talk to her for five seconds, and you'll see exactly what I mean).  The dcor is sleek and sparse, but soft and inviting: think cb2 meets the Deathstar.  Birch veneer, glass, and the metallic sheen of Hina's merchandise accent white counters, tables, and chairs.  It all rests atop a grouted stone floor that is so smartly done that it actually made me angry that I hadn't---and never would have---thought of it.This probably reads as much like an assessment of a person as it does a review of an establishment.  But my guess is that this is how Hina would want it: the business is such a natural extension of her personality that it's difficult to talk about the one without also mentioning the other.  My experience with both was unequivocally positive.
<review# 1559,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2011,8/15/2011,100,90,25,33,24>Look, I don't want to get too specific here, but I had such a good experience that I wanted to write a quick review. I had the least painful wax of my life here. Seriously. It was like pulling off a band-aid. And I'm a tiny baby when it comes to pain so I really think you should take that into consideration as well. It was my first visit, so I could either have a free wax or a receive a more "deluxe" service at half-off. This means that what would ordinarily be $39 only cost me $19.50. Let me just mention that the last couple of  times I had this sort of waxing done at a different salon, I basically hyperventilated, made her stop twice, and still ended up paying nearly $80 of my hard-earned money for something that looks perfect for only about two weeks, tops. I'm just being honest here. Hair does grow back, and most of us can't drop $80 every three or four weeks. This place is budget-friendly and gets the job done, and uh, have I mentioned how it actually REALLY doesn't hurt? Plus all the girls are really sweet. Sam was a pro and put me completely at ease, which isn't easy, considering the circumstances. And yes, they do try to sell you stuff, but 1.) It's pretty good stuff and 2.) You're an adult. You always can say no.
<review# 1560,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2011,8/14/2011,287,110,19,22,20>I have to be honest, I was a little reluctant to have Mandie do my make-up since I've had some not so great experiences in the past. The last time I had my make up done by a "professional," she had me looking like Magda from There's Something About Mary. Yes, Magda, the overly tanned, orange, old lady with chalky skin and pastel pink lipstick. It was a god-damned nightmare! But, after looking at Mandie's online portfolio, I had to give her a shot--her pictures are just so damn beautiful. So, I brushed my fears aside and contacted Mandie to make me look beautiful for my recent graduation from CSUS (shameless shout out to myself, woot!). She did a KILLER job. Not to brag or anything, but I got compliments all day and into the night on how great my eyes looked. Mandie's knack for blending colors resulted in make-up that made my eyes pop without looking tacky or overstated. She is an artist through and through and that definitely shows in the end result. Her art background gives her superior knowledge in blending, complementary colors, creating highlights/lowlights, shadowing, etc. She's not only an awesome make-up artist, she's also a great person to work with. I voiced my concerns about previous make-up jobs gone wrong, and she addressed all of them professionally by offering alternative solutions and allowing me to be a partner in the whole process. We sat in my kitchen sipping tea and chatting it up like old friends while she hooked me up. It truly was more than just a make-up job, it was an experience. (And those of you who know me, know I love an experience!!)Thank you, Mandie. Yeah, you pretty much rock! (Meow)

They feature their best-selling rolls from the traditional Mikuni restaurants plus small plates that are perfect for sharing. Loved sitting out on the patio on a balmy Friday night and people-watching while enjoying a cold beer (or two). Had a couple of our favorites like the Pepper Fin Tuna and Freaky Edamame. Note: if you haven't had the Freaky, you gotta get it. The menu refers to it as 'seriously seasoned soybeans'. Spicy, savory, a teensy bit messy. Perfection.Some new dishes included the Illegal Asparagus which was blanched in hot oil and lightly seasoned with sea salt and Japanese sansho pepper. It was pretty tasty and worth ordering again.The Menchi Katsu is a breaded, minced pork cake that I felt could have been better seasoned. A tad bit dry, this one wasn't a home run.Server was great and offered up some nice recommendations. Restaurant itself is long and narrow and can get loud, but I don't know a sushi restaurant that isn't loud. Design is hip/modern with a long sushi bar perfect for watching the chefs work their magic.Good food. Nice ambience. Close to home. We'll be back.

However, this means that I now wear down my heels faster than my government salary allows for replacement pairs... :( But have no fear, Russo's is here! Walked across the street to Russo's on a Wednesday a little after noon, expecting my heels to be returned to me by Friday at the earliest. Instead, it was more like wham, bam, -insert intense sanding sparks-, and you have my amazingly re-conditioned heels! Can you say speedy Gonzalez? On top of that, he said if I was in any way unhappy with my shoes, or that they wore out faster than I expected, I could bring them in whenever, and he would redo them, free of charge-- he's definitely committed to getting the job done well and in an efficient manner-- I love that. He told me that a lady had come in to fix her heels, and she was in such a hurry, he asked her to time him. 48 seconds. Cobblerman of a high-heels obsessed, but government salary-restricted, girl's dreams.

No idea when & where... and at one point we had to swim after a lost paddle that fell off our raft.4. losing fellow rafters: Okay, I think I overdramatized this one...they're still alive but two of my friends somehow lost balance and fell into the FREEZING river. Struggles.BUT! Despite these over dramatized casualities, words can't describe how fun the rafting trip was! It was really relaxing just floating down the river. Unfortunately, we came here on a cloudy, cold, and sprinkling day, so we were freezing most of the time. I definitely want to come back in the summer when it's hot! I was too chicken to swing off the rope because it was way too cold. Props to my friend for actually doing it, while we watched from afar.
<review# 1564,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2011,8/9/2011,124,112,4,11,10>Our Negative One Anniversary deserved a special dinner, so I made reservations at Ella nearly a month in advance.About a week before our night, I had the pleasure of meeting Ella's Executive Chef, Kelly McCown.  If you watch many cooking shows, especially competitions, Kelly is what you would expect a chef to be like.  He's a good looking guy who talks passionately about food given the opportunity.  At Sacramento Bee's Food Forum, we chatted a bit about Yelp, current food trends, and of course, Ella.The Selland Group knows how to own a restaurant.  Hire a world class chef, and give him the reigns.  If the last time you went to Ella was more than a few years ago, go back.  It's different now.  It's better.Service is top notch at Ella.  Not 5 seconds into walking in the door, you're greeted with a smile.  We were sat at a table that our hostess noticed Amazing's discomfort in, and asked if we wanted to be re-seated.  We were without incident.   Admittedly, it was a little cold in the restaurant, but that was easily remedied with a stiff drink.  Without that though, I may have been a little uncomfortable.Skimming through the menu, it all seemed a little basic.  I'm a fan of eating adventurously, and only saw one thing that seemed very adventurous:  Roasted Bone Marrow.  So I had that, and it was pretty awesome.  Certainly NOT for someone who doesn't like eating anything off the bone, because this one, you're eating INSIDE the bone.  (It's served as the entire bone, cut in half, with the marrow inside each of the sides.)  Amazing was in the mood for a white fish, but we only found salmon on the menu for fish choices.  Looking closer at the menu though, you realize the complimentary ingredients to the feature of the entrée's are where the creativity and adventure come in.  Reading the whole menu, I became excited again.  We make our orders and I ask for "a sommeliers suggestion for by the glass wine pairings with each course.  Our server didn't miss a beat and told us her recommendations.After our appetizers arrived, our server got Kelly for us, and we chatted about the menu, his food and ingredients.  Before our entrée's came out, we got a surprise course from Kelly, Bass... the missing white fish from the menu.  Amazing was happy, and so was I.  That Bass was incredible, if it's on the menu when you are there, GET IT.  Pair it with a Viognier.  I ordered the Lamb Shank, and it was divine.  Any misgivings I had about an unadventurous menu were overshadowed by an absolutely perfect execution of my meal.Another surprise came along with dessert... we ordered two, and got three.  Added to our order was a dark chocolate sorbet that shocked your tastebuds and expectations of what it should taste like with every bite.  The rhubarb crumble was great, as was my semifreddo (I'd order that again.)  But the experience of the sorbet should not be missed.Kelly's vision of a world class Brasserie in Sacramento is being realized.  Our mayor was dining in a table next to ours with some NBA elite (not players... owners), and aside from that, it was a great atmosphere to give Amazing an 'anniversary band'.The only drawback of the evening was, even though we boxed at least half our entrée's, we were STUFFED.  I personally am looking forward to our next meal at Ella.

[sarcasm/]  Since I like to think of myself as useful, unique, and bringing something to the table:  Meatball Sandwich!   Meatball sandwich, meatball sandwich, meatball sandwich.   The tri-tip sandwich isn't half bad either.   Really, nothing is.  The sheer amount of dairy in the Rustique scares me, but I'm sure I'll grab one in a moment of weakness.  Once I was waiting for a sandwich and was given a sample of a meat sauce marinara that was done by someone's uncle from out of town.  Really?  A relative is in town and they have him make sauce.  Let's just throw that in the deli. Really?  I was blown away. The flavor profile was amazing!  I've never had sauce like that.  I'd say it was hearty, but that's beyond an understatement. It was like 75% meat by volume.   I dunno how often they have it, but WOW.  It takes a bit for them to craft your sandwich and they aren't the biggest, but the quality is there.  It's always worth the wait.  The Sampinos are super cool too.  Use your debit card once and they just might remember your name weeks later.  Again, legit!

The minute I stepped onto the outside patio entrance, I was immediately feeling more relaxed, just as I heard the soothing sounds of a water feature near the door. Then, as we entered the restaurant, we were guided to a comfy and cozy booth. The inside of the eatery is nicely decorated in dark woods and romantic lighting. There is a full bar, with 3 flat screen TVs that had baseball and soccer playing. Somewhat loud dance music was playing overhead, but wasn't that bothersome. It actually kept me happy and alert! Our waiter spoke in a heavy (yet sexy) Spanish accent. I know, this is an Italian restaurant, but a foreign accent still works well here!We immediately were served complimentary Italian bread with dipping sauce. I also ordered one of their specialty alcoholic beverages called a "watermelon lemonade" that includes a watermelon flavored vodka as the main ingredient. A definite must try! It didn't take long for us to order one of their delicious sounding gourmet pizzas. We decided to split a large mozzarella & Gorgonzola cheese pizza with sliced, baked Fuji apples on top! It was heavenly to say the least! Our appetizer was a plate of polenta fries. Fried perfectly into finger strips. Crispy brown with a hint of rosemary on the outside and "polenty" flavorful on the inside! You get 2 kinds of dipping sauces along with it. One is a mayonnaise and the other is a ketchup mixture of seasonings. Both were very good!We eventually had to end this pleasant evening with full but satisfied stomachs. Still had plenty of left over pizza to take home and enjoy again! Temptation forced us to throw our diets out of the window but it was well worth it!  My sister says they serve excellent salads here too.  Maybe I'll try it out next time!

Supposedly, it injects the cuticle with protein and creates a moisture barrier for hair compromised by flat ironing, highlighting, and other destructive procedures.As militiant a skeptic as I am, I could no longer ignore the drooling fanfare this product line has earned--so I caved. And it was everything it's cracked up to be, though I have to debunk a couple of myths. First, it's not nearly as noxious to the senses as claimed by many. It's no more fumey than an ammonia-based haircolor. Secondly, it's NOT the same as a Keratin treatment; you can wash and style your hair as soon as you want.My advice: Anyone who's considering getting a blowout should check out Mecca.

You examine the damage and it's as bad as you feared. A nice spider web of shattered glass meets your eye. Panic sets in.

Yes, I have heard that Sandra can shell out some pretty great BBQ, but I wasn't really counting on great service or anything good besides the BBQ....so yeah, expectations were low.But, I definitely mustered up some excitement after seeing some other Yelpers who came out for the CMYE. sat down and took a peak at this well-rounded menu. Grits, collard greens, red beans and rice - all the fixings and more. The iced tea was flowing and the fried chicken was cluckin'! Eventually, I decided to go all out and order some pork ribs! Spicy BBQ sauce please! I'll take the red beans and rice on the side and order the mac and cheese as a tasty little treat before the main event. Let's get this out of the way first...I hated the mac and cheese. They were creamy when piping hot, but after a few minutes went by, the artificial cheese practically solidified and became cold and unappealing. Ok, now that I've gotten that out of the way - onwards! I was truly blown away with the ribs. They were fall off the bone tender and the sauce, while not as spicy as I would like, was sweet and delectably complimentary to the smoky ribs. I was very happy with my  choice, and so much better the next day for lunch. But, the standout, by far was the red beans and rice. They were spicy, earthy, hearty and little dirty....it's everything you want in a southern side. Oh yes, I was thrilled. I'm coming back for sure!Thank you Sandra Dees - not only for blowing my expectations out of the water, but for our waitress who handled a rowdy Yelp crew and gave us the true meaning of Southern hospitality!
<review# 1571,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2011,5/18/2012,156,217,7,6,13>I figure that having Phono Select three blocks from the office has saved me about 1500 miles of driving to and from Amoeba Records in order to pick up the newest titles on In the Red and Siltbreeze (for about $5 less than Dimple (*IF* Dimple will get it))...plus whatever unexpected surprise I find in the new arrivals section.Any record store carrying new releases likes to say "We can order anything", but I think they mostly just say that 'cos they feel like they hafta, and I'm sure they'd prefer that no one ask for a special order. But Phono Select goes way above and beyond such trite record store lip-service. When you are a reliable repeat customer there, they actually ask what else you'd like to see there, and they go get it for you even if you don't promise to buy it. Few other stores around here have ever had the guts to go get some of the titles they carry. Not only do these guys know good music and even NEW music...They trust that someone among Sacramento record geeks will actually buy it. There's no "this is too cool for Sacto" excuse. Finally...a record store that believes in you, Sacto!

I realize, now that I'm older, that was sage like advise from a very wise man. Of course as a younger man I put that theory to the test.14 sexual harassment, 8 fraternization, and 2 paternity suits later I realized what he was talking about, and that I could buy my bread and meat at the same store. But I digress.The Tri Tip here is out of this world. The only time my kids, or anyone for that matter come around is when they hear I'm going to make Tri Tip. The original marinade is my favorite. It tastes like the meat was carved from Jesus himself. They will not release the recipe or sell it separate from the meat. Like KFC's 11 hearbs and spices I'm pretty sure something in this is going to give me cancer. It's that good.I bought Kangaroo, Elk and Antelope here too. It's a Vegan nightmare and I love it. they also have a great selection of fish and shell fish.The prices are great. The exotic meat gets a little pricey though, but what are you gonna do? Fly to freaking Australia and kill a Kangaroo for dinner? I didn't think so. Just drive to Roseville and get it there.
<review# 1573,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/14/2011,5/16/2012,41,198,,11,7>This place has some real potential. Some minor issues to be worked out for sure, but it's only been open for 5 days. The restaurant looks like a completely different place than Celestin's. It's got great wood floors, a nice dark wood bar, mason jars for glasses, etc. etc. Very charming and nice. It's a nice place for business lunch or a night out on the town. The menu was filled with some interesting and delicious sounding items. We split the cornbread skillet to start. Chopped bacon inside, honey-jalapeno butter and green tomato jam to top. Incredible. So much better than Bandera's skillet. It was moist, delicious, a little sweet, a little savory.Then we split the grilled cheese with jack and swiss, bacon, spinach, and red bell pepper marmalade. The marmalade was such a great addition to this plate. It gave all of the richness of the cheeses and bacon a little sweetness. The bacon was nice and crispy, thick cut, and flavorful. The cheeses were nice and melty. It was a bit on the buttery side maybe but better than the alternative. The shrimp po' boy was also very good. The slaw and avocado gave a nice contrast again with some tang and creaminess. The shrimp were a good size with a lot of flavor with the cornmeal batter. The housemade ketchup was another hit. There was something in there besides just tomatoes, perhaps peppers? Not sure but it was really really good. We'll have to go back and try some of the other yummy looking things. They also have happy hour specials and some interesting sounding cocktails that we'll be back for. They could speed up the service a touch but it was very friendly, and as mentioned, it's brand new so I'm sure it'll pick up eventually.
<review# 1574,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2012,5/15/2012,1084,373,5,11,8>Hear, Hear! The Big 4 has dropped on the scene!  Get on the train before it leaves the station!  This new micro-brewery has opened up its garage doors and looking to take off.  Hidden in the very industrial area near Sacramento City College off of Sutterville Road, this brewery emerged at the beginning of 2012.  The venue is quite literally an industrial garage, but they have transformed the space into a cozy, carefree place to enjoy some great beers.  They have several couches, nice picnic style wooden tables and a tasting bar with the stainless beer tanks in the back drop.  The service here was great.  The beertenders are very friendly.  I was here during Sacramento Beer Week, and they had brought a wood-fired pizza vendor just outside to make sure everyone had an option for nibbles.  However, they do not appear to have food options normally.You can get a pint for $4, a taste of the 5 brews currently on tap for $1/ea, or take a growler home for $18 new, $12 refill (the Big 4 is $20 new, $16 for a refill).  I decided to order up the sampler.Big 4 Strong Ale - (9/10):With 168 IBUs, I was in hop heaven.  Obviously this kind of structure in the beer allows for remarkable alcohol content, and this checks in at 10%abv.  I was pleasantly surprised with the balance this beer has.  The first taste is a wallop of hops, with the malts subtly giving a smooth finish.  The alcohol is held in check.  Beware!  This one will sneak up on you fast.  It is so smooth and balanced you wouldn't guess that it has 10%abv.  I believe this one will pick up as a local favorite in no time and is a perfect complement to the Sacto brew scene.Belgian IPA - (7/10):I picked up a nice floral burst from this IPA. The hops were tamed and subtle, but they were there.  This will be a nice summertime IPA.Alkali Wit - (7/10):This Belgian Wit had subtle notes of coriander and citrus.  It was a smooth Wit.Daylight Amber - (7/10):IPA meets Amber. This had a unique, complex taste.  It was a smooth brew. Soulman Stout - (6/10):This brew had a nice roasty malt taste with notes of chocolate.  There was an earthy aftertaste.Overall, I believe these guys will be successful and eventually grow. Get out and support them!

There's nothing fancy about this place, so don't feel bad about tearing into your food like Saturn devouring his children. You can be bug-eyed, half-naked, and snaking down those burritos like your life depends on it and you'd still fit in with the rest of the crowd. Just be aware that lining up here at 1:30am on Saturday may lead to bizarre conversations with weeaboos, hipsters, hoochies, and the homeless as you're waiting in a line for half an hour. If you're not up for socializing, just stare at the oversized posters of food they have on the windows and try to figure out how to pronounce "tlacoyo." Feel free to say it out loud like some crazy meth head, nobody will care.All joking aside, I really do like this place, but the Los Angelino in me won't let me give this place more than 3 stars. The portions are ridiculous, the prices are fair, and the ability to eat at 3am is amazing... but nothing on the menu has really impressed me. That being said, let's start describing some of my favorite dishes here:Super BurritoBe sure to add some sour cream to this sucker, as it can get dry pretty quickly if you don't tell them to hold the potatoes. This is my go to item.Azteca BurgerYour standard mexican joint burger. Pretty damn tasty and slowly winning a place in my regular rotation.TlacoyoChorizo, sour cream, lettuce, etc. on a fried flatbread. Pretty damn tasty, although impossible to eat cleanly or pronounce.Guerra Taco Basically the same thing as the Alambre, which is a fajita. Instead of getting a couple tortillas and a plate of fajitas, you get fajitas stuffed into a single tortilla. Super cost effective.Super NachosThis doesn't get any points for aesthetics, but once you start prying apart the brick of nachos, you won't stop eating them.Random Note: Some of my friends get the runs after eating here. Some think it might be the green sauce, but I have no idea what they're talking about. Then again, I'm used to eating street food in 3rd world countries, so I can eat just about anything.
<review# 1576,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2012,5/13/2012,268,316,4,10,8>I usually reserve a 5 star rating for the best of the best, and I gladly award it to Taylor's Kitchen. My wife and I had a Valentine's Day dinner after the fact, to avoid the crowds, and it was nice, since the restaurant was busy but not packed to the gills.We were pleased with everything about our night at Taylor's: the starters, entrees, dessert, and service. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have the pork belly bruschetta but the mussels made up for it nicely. They were cooked perfectly which was a delight for me since all the times I've had mussels elsewhere they were always cooked to eraserheadness. The day boat scallops were seared perfectly and the flavors presented with it made it truly mouthwatering. My wife had the NY strip and it was also cooked perfectly and the truffle butter was heavenly. We had the strawberry shortcake w/ sorbet and it was awesome as well.Our server seemed like maybe he was new but he was great and always pleasant and never snooty. The portions are very generous which make the price very appropriate for what you get. You definitely will not leave feeling hungry.I'm grateful for the fact that Land Park has such great neighborhood restaurants!(Give Riverside Clubhouse and Masullo a try too!)

(only $8).  I mean how could you go wrong?  Give them a try. Tell them I sent ya.

<review# 1579,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2013,4/20/2013,171,53,10,19,16>I am so excited that I was finally able to try this place out!!BUFFET?I had been having a hard time finding a good sushi place in NorCal, until now. I went here for the all you can eat sushi buffet and man was I pleasantly surprised. I was nervous going to sushi buffet because I was terrified of the thought of sushi sitting out for long periods of time. However, that was not the case, all the sushi rolls I ate were amazing and fresh. They had it all from fried shrimp tempura rolls to the raw fish floating on the sushi boats. They even had a section with orange chicken, chow mein, and fried rice...almost like a Panda Express in a way. Even with all that it definitely doesn't have the "buffet" feeling to it. Feels like a sit down restaurant were you just go get the food yourself. Service:The service was a little lacking. We waited quite a while for them to refill our drinks. Yes, they were busy during the lunch rush, but being good at refilling my drink increases your tip.You definitely can't beat the price. I paid $13.95 for the all you can eat!I will defiintely go back and recommend everyone try it out if they haven't already done so!
<review# 1580,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/17/2013,4/19/2013,356,378,9,19,12>It's not often I come to these parts of town, but when I do, I have to cross out some of my bookmarks. When I hear a place is a called an "izakaya," I imagine it being more like a gastropub, mainly serving alcohol and small plates. Sure, The Izakaya served beer and sake, but their list of appetizers was nothing unusual. There's your typical edamame, agedashi tofu, and a variety of gyozas to choose from, but what about yakitori (food on skewers)? That doesn't seem much to ask to be served at an izakaya. Their menu does offer something I've never experienced before at a Japanese restaurant: gyu-niku, beef cooked on a hot volcanic rock. For $15, it's served as an appetizer, with 8 relatively thick marinated pieces of beef that you cook yourself at the table. Would I do that again? Probably not, since for another $15, I also got two bowls of ramen. Plus, I could probably do AYCE at a Korean BBQ place with a little more than $15, but this was something interesting for a Japanese restaurant. As for the ramen, it wasn't really mind-blowing. I got the chicken ramen where the chicken was cooked teppan-style but together with the other toppings, they didn't really worked together to create a unified bowl of goodness. The ramen noodle was cooked, but I felt it was a little bit over al dente. And the broth didn't taste like there was any particular depth to it either. Even though The Izakaya didn't meet what I thought an izakaya would be, I had hoped their food would make up for it, but unfortunately, no memorable experiences were created for me to really make an effort to come back for more.

Ok, glad I got that out of my system :) As with many of my recent reviews, this review is for a fine establishment to which I've never been before. Oh yeah, I admit I've driven up and down Jefferson Blvd many, many times before without giving Whitey's much thought. Thank goodness I've rectified this.Everything I had was excellent. My Whitey's Special burger was hot and juicy and quite the bargain at only $3.25! My side of onion rings were hot and crispy and some of best onion rings I've ever had, at only $1.95. And the piece de resistance was that awesome, delicious,superb peanut butter shake...so thick, so creamy, SO FRIGGIN' GOOD! I loved it and will go back again and again just to try their other wonderful array of shake offerings (banana shake, here I come!).The ONLY drawback was the time it took to get my order, but that's just something I've learned from my first outing and will not let happen again. Just expect that if you go during lunch, expect at least a 20 minute wait. Plan accordingly, unless of course you WANT an excuse to take a loooong lunch :)Wow, now I'm craving a Whitey's shake! Off I go :)

The infamous Mo Mo's Meat Market did not dissapoint me and the fellow co-worker last night. Word to the wise: If you go like right after work maybe around 5:30 watch out for A-Hole D-Bag Crapbag drivers in that area. Holy sh!t!OK back to the review. Before even walking into the place Glenn the master bbq'er waived and welcomed us to the establishment from his smoker/bbq. Holy politeness! GIenn's wife is a peach too! She's so warm and inviting. I thought, already a plus. You walk into Mo Mo's and the smell of bbq pulls his arm all the way back and clocks you in the face with a right hook. I was so hungry I almost got the 4-Way (that is how it's listed on the menu so get your mind out of the ghutter).Each menu item comes with 2 sides. We were lucky as they had black eyed peas with rice instead of the read beans and rice. Shoooooot. I almost yelled out HOT DAMN THIS IS GOOD! The co-worker got the last of the collard greens and he said they were brilliant. We both tried one of everything on the menu. Potato salad, Chicken, Hot Links, Tri-Tip, Ribs, AND we got to test out some dessert! I almost felt like I was on Cupcake Wars at the chef's table. They let us sample German Chocolate Cake..Meh. But the Eggnog...oh the eggnog cupcake. How I wanted to take one for the road!!! Glenn and company please have the Eggnog Cupcake for sale next time ok :-)I will be frequenting this establishment for sure. I woke up this morning thinking..."Damn they were friendly!" That's a good thing in my book. The fact that I was even still thinking about them the next day is a GREAT thing.

Half of it I don't even know what it is. Did you know curry is from a leafy plant? Some of the produce is packaged but most of it is not. They had pickling cucumbers in February!!! So out of season who knows what hemisphere they came from. An aisle of just noodles! Every thing Asian: Japanese, Philippines, India, China, Indonesia, Korea you have it here. Frozen fish of all varieties. Sake. More soy sauces than I knew existed. Vinegars - coconut, brown rice with apple cider, blows your mind. A Korean deli! A tortilla factory with the most delicious chips. Russian, Polish, Eastern European products - sausage, cheeses, pickles. A meat market where you can purchase a pig's head, trotters etc. Quail six to a pack. Duck and goose. A bakery! It takes me an hour and a half just to cruise the aisles to figure out what they have. In Rancho Cordova off of Zinfandel. I am a grid girl who stays within my 66 block radius but I make a pilgrimage every couple of months.

It's one of those..."well I'm paying a pretty penny for it, the service better be friggin fantastic" - and it delivers on that front. Don't get me wrong, this is not a service for the average joe. It's pricey people, there's no getting around the obvious. BUT...if you want a taxi service that picks you up in a nice, clean, car that quick - go with Uber. There's even tiny waters for you! Score. Hydration is everything when you've been out drinking....take advantage!The app was extremely easy to use. Drop a pin in your current location, what 2 seconds for a cabbie to get your message and away you go. You're able to see the cab's progress on a map and it shows you approximately how long it will take to get you. Both times was under 10 minutes. The second time was 6 stinkin' minutes. Plus, you can rate your cabbie and they can rate you back. So if you're a loud drunk, you'll be rated pretty poorly - and they won't accept your service anytime soon. So beware drunkies!

I loved our beloved Bookman's in Tucson, so naturally I am required to check out any and all used bookstore I come across. My first impression after walking in was HOARDING: BURIED ALIVE. But I kinda liked it. There's a little bit (or a lot) of the hoarder in me (it's in the genes), so I felt pretty much at home here. Books EVERYWHERE...not just on the sagging shelves, but all over the floor. The Sci-Fi section was a monstrosity!

It's one of his favorite places for Vietnamese desserts and he definitely got me hooked onto it. Service is quick since they already have it pre-made and in the fridge and all that needs to be added is the liquid. I've been here a couple of times and I've tried their desserts #2 and #6.Dessert #2: red bean, white bean, green/mung bean, taro, pandan jelly, pearl, and combo jelly.I liked this dessert but I personally thought it had too much bean so I don't think I would get this one again; not much of a fan of a lot of beans. Dessert #6: lychee, longan, red tapioca, jackfruit, palm seed, pandan jelly, jello, and young coconut. My favorite dessert so far just because I love fruits a lot.My boyfriend also recommended to get #1 the Bambu special and I will be coming back again to try it out!Che definitely makes you full and happy and I recommend those who haven't tried it before to give it a try!NOTE: Cash only!

I was really grateful to the Sacramento SPCA for being gentle and kind to both my son and his critter when the time came for, in my son's words, their "forever farewell."I think that is really all the details I need to give on that subject aside from those who might want to know the cost - which was $35.On a happier note, my mother adopted a dog from here last year. She had been down in the dumps ever since the passing of her little doggy, but was hesitant to look for a new one. I think a news article or something prompted her to come down and see the dogs up for adoption at the SPCA.  Looking for a little dog similar to her Cairn terrier she instead came home with a Staffordshire. Whoa, really, Mom? But you know... she is a wonderful dog and has made a great companion for my mom. The center was clean, the staff kind/friendly, and they offered many services for lower costs that most vets. I would follow the other Yelper's advice about lining up early for the vaccinations as the queue was pretty long when we were there in the afternoon.When the time feels right, I think my son might want to take a trip down to see what they have in the adoption center.

I'm an observer of interior aesthetics, and this place has it. The great thing about Mix is the big city swank without the big city snoots, don't you agree? The layout, and the ambience is sexy. The bartenders are quick and friendly, the security don't come off as jerks, and the crowd seems to be a little more sophisticated. The weekends are really jammed and  the lines almost always wrap around the corner, that's why I prefer to come here on Sundays. My favorite part of Mix is the bathroom. It's mainly glass and mirrors, so beware! The glass is so squeeky clean that I almost walked into it thinking the sinks were to the right, instead of the left! Haha, dork alert! Dork! ALERT!Wear what makes you feel pretty or handsome, and check this place out. You'll like it.

So the Ladies are business casual and looking good. Now what really matters. A $3.50 Marg, on the rocks with salt. Not stellar but it's good and it works. Phase 2, polenta with meatball and a fresh delicious tomatoe sauce. This is one of the best polenta recipies I've had in a looong time.  There are only two others that compare, and that's in too many years of dining our. Cream, butter, and fresh corn added, nuff said. The meatball is fine but the sauce and polenta blow it away. The next step is the flatbread and hummus, keyword being flat. Think super thin pizza dough baked, like a thin pita. Then sprinkle a bunch of fresh parmagianna cheese on it and bake it. Parmagianna cheese is hands down my most favorite cheese in the world. When fresh it's almost sweet. It is almost always dry. In this case, baked, it is dry. So dry cheese, on dry flatbread, then hummus on the side. Nope. Its a dryfest!  I need a beer and tonight is not beer nite.Still, I have faith from the impressive polenta so I push on. I order the mussels with Garlic White Wine.  Now some of you have never touched mussels and you're missing one of the sea's great gifts. However, my nite has been ruined a few times by a bad mussel. It destroys your mouth and desire to eat for a while. Not tonight though. They are great!  A little too much butter in the sauce but since we're in the midwest I'll forgive them. To wrap up a chopped salad with feta: simple, fast, and perfect. I'm down with Lucca's Happy Hour!PS. Every dish I described is under 3 bucks. PPS. Everywhere between SF and NYC is the midwest...
<review# 1591,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/19/2010,12/4/2010,120,64,3,17,3>I have been to this theater three times now with three different dates, and am starting to think I need to find a new date because I have been craving this.  It is in my opinion one of the easiest date ideas, but it goes beyond that.  This is great for bachelorette parties, anniversaries, and just hanging with friends.  You have to make reservations sometimes up to ten weeks in advance, but I have always just asked to be on the waiting list, and normally receive a phone call two days before the show, so it has worked out.  They will ask for your name and your date's name along with the reason for visiting them.  It is nice because they will write your info on the menu and you can be dorky about the whole occasion.  The four stars is for the overall experience, however I have mixed feelings on certain aspects.  The show is cheesy, and near impossible to guess.  If you want to win, look at the evidence table VERY closely, but you probably will never win.  I do hope to get it sometime because the last trophy that matters on my rack is from participation in Minor B baseball.The food has been nothing but amazing for me.  You have different options, but any option is usually the right one.  Before this place, I had never eaten a salad; now Caesar salads are one of my favorite dishes.  Drinking a few before the show on the boats balcony is also a grand idea to loosen up.The location of this event is also prime.  It is on a nice classic river boat and is next to a beautiful river promenade that has just been extended.  The boat has very tiny rooms, but if you are planning a night away from the kids, the Embassy Suites are a block away as well.  The show ends around 10pm, so I always suggest people go to a few bars after, have a few drinks, talk some more, and just walk around.  I think the location really is five star worthy.Writing this review has me looking into my black book, because I can't help but remember all the great memories this place has brought me, and it is one of the most sure bets I can suggest anybody on a date.
<review# 1592,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/23/2010,12/3/2010,149,373,16,11,11>Crack.  I must've been smoking straight CRACK when I wrote my last review.  Okay seriously, I just read it after having yet another fantastic dinner at Tuli's and I'm seriously wondering what kind of illicit substance I was on when I wrote that review.  I'm here to redeem both myself and Tuli's and believe when I say, Tuli's is by far my favorite restaurant.  Why, you may ask?1.  I've been here +/- 20 times in the last two years and haven't ever been disappointed THAT I CAN REMEMBER.  (I must've been in a drug-fueled stupor when I wrote that last review)2.  The chefs here are amazing, and consistently on point with every dish, from presentation, to flavor, to portion size.  (Three people here can do what six people in other places often times cannot)  3.  The prices are NOT inflated for what you get.  (Hint: when you finish eating a good meal and go home, you're still supposed to feel fabulous, not gross and regretting your meal)4.  While their small daily menu rarely has a vegetarian entree on it, the chefs ALWAYS make a delicious vegetarian meal for me each and every time.  At no point have I ever felt that the chef "punished" my vegetarianism by: simply omitting meat from a dish, resulting in an anemic unbalanced meal, overcharging me for the "inconvenience" of a special diet, or giving me the same tried, true, and boring "pasta primavera" most people think is God's gift to vegetarians.   5.  Speaking of God's gift to vegetarians, their Harvest Salad may be it.  Warm chevre, toasted almonds, mixed greens, honeyed roasted bartlett pears and a perfect, light dressing.  Getting my veggies has never been so enjoyable.  6.  Their menu may be small, but each and every item on it is prepared with meticulous care even at the most hectic times and is seasonally appropriate as well.  Scallops, quail, Guinea hen, sweetbreads, pork belly, rabbit, California albacore, mussels, flank steak, the list goes on and on as the menu changes, but know that nothing you pick will ever be bad.  7.  What's that?  You think quail, Guinea hen, and rabbit are either a.) gross or b.) too frou-frou for you?  Well then order one of their phenomenal wood-fired thin crust pizzas.  Which, yeah, they'll make vegetarian for you if you wish.  8.  Between here and Ginger Elizabeth's, I'm going to have to retract my statement of "I hate sweets" and "I'm not a dessert girl."  LIke the rest of the food here, the desserts taste fresh, clean, and portioned just right.  I certainly hoped I've answered any rhetorical questions you may have had cross your mind when I initially wrote: "Tuli's is by far my favorite restaurant."  If you still have any doubts, go try it and prove me wrong.Seriously though, Crack is no laughing matter and I strongly discourage the smoking of crack while writing Yelp reviews.  Although using crack as an attention-grabber does seem to work.  You're reading this right now aren't you?

<review# 1594,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2010,12/1/2010,80,156,3,9,4>FINALLY!!! I've finally found awesome Thai food in Northern California!!! This is quite the feat, I feel like I've searched all over Sacramento, Davis, and San Francisco to no avail! Khun Suda is as good as my ultimate Thai obsession, Pookie's in Westlake Village, which I compare every single Thai restaurant to! Anyway, my friends and I ordered three items, the pad kee mao noodles, spicy eggplant with beef, and the special of the day, mango curry with shrimp. The pad kee mao was beautifully cooked. The noodles weren't overcooked or undercooked, nor too oily, like the noodles I've tried in other restaurants. My friend is allergic to garlic and the lovely owner (wonderful Thai lady) was happy to accommodate us. Nothing was cooked with garlic, and being an avid garlic fan, I didn't even MISS it! They used other types of herbs and spices to flavor their dishes -- ginger, shallots, basil, etc. Beautiful!  The spicy eggplant was delicious too. But my favorite dish has to be the mango curry!  I'm not a big fan of mixing fruit and savory cooked food but decided to give this a try. Seriously, I could have DRANK the entire bowl of soup by itself. They had chunks of fresh sweet mango in the curry and it was a delicious combination! In the middle of our meal, the awesome owner came by with a plate of pad Thai on the house because we mentioned we learned about her restaurant on Yelp. OOOOOOOH YUM!  It was way too much food but we couldn't put our forks down!  It tasted authentic!  Unlike pad thai from other places, this one is the real deal! Beautifully flavored and perfectly balanced, this place is a GEM! Everyone come get some amazing food!!! You won't regret it!
<review# 1595,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2010,11/30/2010,125,189,2,8,5>I'm not sure why I didn't just rate it 5 stars the first time, but Sal's once again, does not disappoint.For under 10 bucks, you can get the Sal's #1 Deal, which includes a ground beef taco, enchilada, beans, rice, and a huge Pepsi.  Normally I just grab a burrito or two, but I branched out and got the meal this time.The taco was crunchy, and the meat juicy and flavorful, which I was pleased to discover, considering after all these years of coming here, I had never had one prior to yesterday.Sal's doesn't skimp on the portions, so plan on stuffing yourself.As always, the mosaic art is gorgeous to look at (done by Sal himself if i'm not mistaken), the staff is nice and friendly, and I discovered recently that they offer discounts when you can score one of a few coupons.  This particular go-round, my brother had a "buy one entree get one free" coupon, so for 10 smackers, the both of us had hearty meals.  While we were there this time, we also picked up some coupons that entitled you to a second breakfast for free if you buy one breakfast and two drinks.  That's another 10 dollar meal, free of charge!  They just have these discount coupons sitting out on the counter, ripe for your picking!!
<review# 1596,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2010,11/29/2010,511,116,7,14,7>Can't beat $8.95 for AYCE during dinner time.Coming from someone who's never (EVER) liked Mongolian, Great Wall, has officially turned me out.  Not exactly sure what it was... maybe it was the friendly service, maybe I'm just getting old, or maybe it's cause my gf paid for the meal -whatever it was, I enjoyed the food and the whole visit here.  I wouldn't think too much of the appetizers (soup and salads = bland) as they seemed cheap and "tacked" on to the meal as freebies.  Instead focus on the Mongolian BBQ since it's where you'll get your money's worth.Definitely will be coming back soon.
<review# 1597,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/16/2010,11/28/2010,72,83,11,7,6>As soon as I opened my car door, I noted one thing: It smelled fantastic. No, really, if my nose could leap right off my face and do a little jig, I think it would have. I walked in and saw that they had bathrooms near the entrance. Kind of a dine-and-run dream. There was no one at the front for a few minutes, and when the hostess came out, she talked on the phone for another five minutes before hanging up, and looked up at us with what I can only describe as irritation. That's it. No words of acknowledgment, no smile, not even a "what the hell do you want?" She just openly stared and I stared back, confused. Were we going to have a staring contest to decide whether I was good enough to eat here? As much as I love a good staring contest, I was hungry! So, I timidly asked, "Table for two..?" Apparently, we had passed the test because she stoically led us to a table. Thankfully, a different waitress came to take our orders and was extremely nice. She explained how everything worked and what all the meats were.The food was okay. It tasted like the meats had the same marinade, so after awhile, it didn't really matter what type of meat you had them bring out--it all tasted the same. Price is decent for what you get because a plate of gal-bi in a typical Korean restaurant is about $15-17, and here you get all you can eat for $20 at dinner. Tip: Order lettuce to wrap your meats in. It's delicious!
<review# 1598,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2010,11/27/2010,66,86,11,5,7>I am very fond of cupcakes.  The only happy memory I have of my three months in Catholic kindergarten was buying cupcakes at the bake sale for fifty cents.  In fact, cupcakes are the first thing I remember actually buying with my own money.That having been said, this cupcake craze has been wonderful for me.  I know mediocre cupcakes.  I know OK cupcakes. I know downright crappy cupcakes.  Esther's?  NOT crappy cupcakes.  Cake?  Good.  Icing?  Not quite the consistency I like, but good.  What are these one-star reviewers talking about?  Did we go to the same place?Seriously.  What. Is. Up. Your. Butt?Esther's is cute.  The ONE girl working there was super nice.  There is a display shelf that looks like icing.  They serve cupcakes "for here" on a plate.  A PLATE!  They even have a larger plate if you want to share with a friend.  And, they serve milk.  There is ample seating inside and out (but mostly out).  Their menu actually has descriptions of the things they serve.  Take a look at that shelf to your right if you didn't get the chance - hot damn, it does look like icing, doesn't it?I mean, really - if you gave this place one star, do the world a service and check your butt.
<review# 1599,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/9/2009,1/8/2010,28,138,6,3,1>If you are looking for that late night grease fix to aid in soaking up all the booze you drank, this might be the place you are looking for. With all the "hustle bustle" I thought that this might be fantastic, but I am sort of neutral. The Pesto slice, lacked Pesto... The mushroom and olive was pretty good, but it needed a little cholula.The one thing that was utterly shocking, was the heavy security. SECURITY? At a pizza joint? Now I've seen everything! LOL! Okay, Okay, I know it's in Midtown and there might have been some altercations with drunks, but 3-4 security in black uniforms with gloves? COME ON PEOPLE! I sat there with my group of friends talking about the way they were walking around trying to look hard. It was as though we were at some strip joint rather than a pizza place. I was waiting for the "Dont touch the pizza, the pizza can touch you, but you can't touch the pizza".  That was worth the price of admission, let me tell ya!
<review# 1600,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2009,1/7/2010,99,154,1,4,5>(ok verge folks, you're right, you'd all been there about a year before i reviewed ya. but i moved into the neighborhood right before i wrote this, so pardon the mistake......)This place is huge! It has potential to be set up in many configurations with different spaces and feels. I can't wait to see what they do next.I can see its bold blue exterior from my sidewalk. yay for things being walking distance! That detail is irrelevant to most folks though. The actual best thing is the art, artists and art aficionados here ... as opposed to that cop-infested saturday sideshow. side note: a few folks have allotted five stars to verge gallery, but I'm toning it down to a four-star review since they have only been open a few months and I've only been in there a few times.
<review# 1601,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/24/2009,1/6/2010,81,212,3,9,6>The store was gorgeous. The layout was a design piece. I loved everything ... but the employees. Maybe if they dropped their pretentious omg-sacramento-is-too-cooler-than-san-francisco attitude at the door they'd have more customers.Update: After writing this review I got a nice yelp note from the owner. I appreciate the sentiment and have definitely not written off this store.
<review# 1602,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2009,1/5/2010,100,71,5,7,8>Simply remarkable. Dad's mixed the usual and the unusual to create amazing concoctions that pleased everyone in our family.From the Angry Road Man, to the Reuben, to the Chicken and Dumplings, every entree was thoroughly enjoyed - and remembered. The fries are worth a visit on their own merits; I prefer the plain steak fries, but the family liked the seasoned fries best.Quote of the day as overhead at the table next to us (in relation to the largest hot dog construction project I've ever seen): "You're going pretty hard on that thing." The response by the rather large man was, "My god, this is good."I love Dad's rockabilly crew, and I have a lot of respect for Dad's sense of self - never bending to mediocre fare, but always accepting of changes and substitutions.Visit. Eat. Keep Dad's on Freeport Boulevard. I'd do it alone, but my wallet nor heart would survive.
<review# 1603,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/9/2009,1/4/2010,44,127,5,4,5>Domo arigato Mr. Roboto.  I know, I know, corny.  But I have to.  I always come out of Arigato singing the Styx. Have been here several times, and the food is always quality, the place is usually packed and the service is pretty good- even though there was that one time...  Someone needed a swift backhand to the face.Anyway, 1/2 off sushi rolls makes Nick very happy.  Not the best sushi, not even in my top 5, but it is still 4 stars in my book.  Try Lucky 7 roll, it's muy bueno.  Cheap, tasty, fast and they don't drown their rolls in sauces like some other Sacramento area establishments.
<review# 1604,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/14/2009,1/3/2010,177,61,,9,3>Lot's of things to like about this place. It's a perfect distance from the apartment to get in a good walk and enjoy a post night of debauchery breakfast in peace. The seating is perfectly spaced out and there are plenty of small tables as well as booths and a couple of large tables to accommodate whatever size group. The menu has all the classic breakfast staples with some added character such as the banana blackberry pancakes. I like that they aren't doing too much to try and be all super unique and cool but they also aren't serving your run of the mill breakfast fare and charging you because your simply to lazy or hungover to cook yourself. Just a few things irked me and took my focus away from all the things I liked about Orphan. I ordered the roast beef hash and overall it satisfied my hunger, but what I received I honestly would not call hash. It was pretty much some eggs with a few slices of roast beef on top of some potatoes with few pieces of toasted bread. I was assuming it would have been shredded beef mixed with the potatoes and some eggs on the side. Now the food still looked and tasted good but it just wasn't what I was expecting for some hash. I was ready to overlook this and just proceed with tearing into my plate but first I needed to get it sauced up just how I like it with hot sauce and ketchup. Problem is they don't serve ketchup. This really kind of left me dumbfounded...well at least disappointed. Instead of just enjoying my meal there all I could think about was taking it home and getting it to my liking. I understand it's the owners prerogative to stock whatever condiments they like or don't like. I could understand too if I was asking for something a lot less traditional like Jufran but c'mon it's freaking ketchup. Like it's cool that you don't personally like ketchup but shouldn't your concern be catering to your customers taste instead of distracting from what could have been a fine meal. This place is cool and I'll mos def go back it's just kind of a bummer when you have to take your food home from the restaurant to completely enjoy it.
<review# 1605,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2009,1/1/2010,109,241,4,8,3>I finally made it to Cookie's today after working near it for a couple of years.  It is your typical greasy burger joint.  It isn't super clean but it didn't seem dirty either.  The big plus for me is that they serve ostich burgers.  After spending my college years in Davis, home of Murder (no, not Redrum) Burger, I've become a fan of the ostrich burger.  I noticed that people keep mentioning that they're afraid to try ostrich and I say, fear not!  Ostrich is healthier than skinless chicken...lower in fat and calories and higher in protein.  The burger itself was yummy.  The fries were crispy.  I'll be back!
<review# 1606,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/12/2009,12/31/2009,137,68,3,6,4>I have NEVER been disappointed by this place.  I used to come here on a weekly basis but i don't work out nearly enough as i should anymore so that habit has slowed itself down.  This of course makes me really sad because Oscar's has accomplished its goal at "hitting the spot" every time I have come here.  I frequently order the #23 breakfast burrito, no meat.  It's delicioso!!  And they have only messed up that order once!  Which is a lot to say because most places don't understand when I say "NO MEAT" when ordering.  I guess they think it's just a joke or maybe they think it's a funny joke to put meat in it.  But not Oscar's, they have only made this mistake once.   And when this did occur, they were gracious when I confronted them and replaced my order immediately.  I love this place on a Sunday morning and practically any day of the week.  i am so happy this joint has survived over the years!  I will be there this week for a burrito fixing, I'm sure!
<review# 1607,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/12/2009,12/30/2009,89,170,3,2,4>Tried the stuffed chicken wings and would have been happy to stop there. They were quite good and really, all I needed was a cup of steamed rice and I would have been content.But do we ever stop at just one dish? Nah ... I was born in America ... we eat till we can't fit into our jeans and then order another plate to go. We got the imperial rolls (can't mess these up really) and a spicy plate of beef that the waitress recommended. Everything was good ... pricey ... but good. Topped it off with some coconut ice cream and we were content to sit around and stare at our bulging bellies in the mirrors surrounding us.They should take the damn mirrors down. Less guilt means I order another container of stuffed wings to go.

We definitely people watch all night long with our friends.I've had lots of awesome memories here! from playing pool with trannies, eating homemade chips & salsa with trannies, carrying my drunk gay boy out of the bar, to blacking out with my boyfriend. It's VERY diverse here hahaJust bring cash with you because the atm has a pricey fee.But for good times with good people for sure stop by here!

There's music going on and there's a pretty good size crowd inside as well so we decide to sit outside as the day is very nice.Ok time to order drinks and it's a diet coke to share with my pOOh and some H2o as well, for the entrées we go with,Pancetta con Rucola which is crisp warm pancetta, mozzarella, arugula, evoo, balsamic reduction and pizza rock meatballs for her.Classic Caesar salad which is hearts of romaine, Caesar dressing, house croutons, parmigiano-reggiano andSt Germain wings that are buffalo style chicken wings infused with germain liqueur and creamy gorgonzola dressing on the side.Food arrives,, salad is crisp and fresh, the house croutons are like garlic bread mmmmmmmmm and OMG what's this, anchovies?! first time EVER on a Caesars salad for me and from what my woman tells me, a true Caesars comes with anchovies and well, pretty damn good,, the BEAST likes.The wings are a damn good size and they too look delicious and well they really do turn out to be just that,, DAMN GOOD with a bit of a kick at the end.As for my woman's entrées,, well they are also just as good. How do I know you ask!? well it's only because we like to share. but if you want to know just how good her food was, then you're just going to have to read her review.

Parking= sucks ass and that equals to -1 star haha maybe they should validate parking.And that all adds up to a total of 4 stars from me.

<review# 1610,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,11/29/2014,1134,72,9,11,14>Great food and great service!Had a little date night with my wife and decided to try Amicis out because we had only been like once before and wanted some pizza. So theres two sides of Amicis that you can park on, try to park more towards the middle of the Nut Tree because thats the front entrance side. Otherwise you have to walk all the way around. Its not far, but when it's 100 degrees in Vacaville you want to get in that AC as fast as possible lol.The hostess seated us in kind of a sunny spot so we asked if we could just move one table over. They said yes and apologized. The restaurant was really clean and service was good. Food came out fast, waitress was really friendly.The food was the best part though. We ordered some garlic bread and a little side salad to split before the pizza. I totally forget the dressing that we got on the salad but I know I liked it a lot but wifey didn't. One of the vinaigrettes. The garlic bread was really good and kind of different too. It was pretty crispy on the outside edges but soft in the middle. Flavor was really good too. The pizza was hellllllllla good. We got the Amici's combo. Pepperoni, meatballs, bacon, mushrooms, and olives. And then we added green peppers. We ordered a medium thinking we would be able to take some home for leftovers. But once we started eating we couldn't stop lol. We ended up only taking one piece home.Recommend if you've never been before. A little bit more expensive then chain pizza places but worth going every now and again.
<review# 1611,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2014,11/28/2014,85,66,11,13,10>I love Total Wine and More so much, I would marry it. It satisfies me in every single way, price point, selection, and friendly staff. I have been here over a half dozen times this year and I have never walked out disappointed. They have everything I have ever needed and then some. Inside the store, everything the laid out well and all the aisle are well labeled with a lot of signage that separates wine from spirits from beer from mixers and then all the labels in between, Chardonnays' from the Pinos', Whiskey from the Vodka. Toward the back of the store near the wine is a little wine tasting booth set up for certain times of the week. For ten cents you can taste some new wines. Ten cents. "Brother, can you spare a dime?"Price: Extremely reasonable, as in the best prices I have seen. Sometimes I still saunter down the 'Wine & Spirits' aisle at the grocery store and cringe at the prices in comparison to the lusty summon of my love, TW&M. They also have the tiny bottles that I love when I want to try some of the funky vodka flavors without buying a whole bottle. For 99 cents I can try one of each. Speaking of tiny bottles they also  have half bottle sizes of top brands in their own little section. I would rather buy the big bottle for a better price but when I see all the half size bottles all lined up together, something in me wants to coo at them. Service: I have always had the best service while shopping here. I have come ten minutes before closing, albeit knowing what I wanted, ran through the store, picked my product, and never received even a hint of rush from the staff who were starting closing procedures. My last visit me and my brother were wandering the spirits aisle trying to decide on our newest cocktail inventions, when a crew member, tall guy and very friendly, came up to us and told us about the ten cent wine tasting, we thanked him for letting us know and really wanted to participate but we didn't have much time to pick out the concoctions from our brains to the bottles. Deep into the hunt, we go down another aisle and a few minutes later the same guy asks us if we heard about the wine tasting, we say yes indeed from himself as a matter of fact. We all laugh and go back to shopping. Just as we have everything picked out the very same guy comes over and asks "Hey! Have you guys heard of the wine-haha just kidding" and he also approved of the bottle of vodka I was holding, proclaiming it was one of the best priced and very smooth, so we did end up purchasing it. When a store has such friendly staff (who encourage sale products and onsite drinking) it makes me happy and gives me a smile that I remember when coming here. I wish I could remember his name so he would get his shout out. If I find out, I will post it. Also the cashiers are very pleasant and carefully wrap your selections for you, unlike other retailers who just toss the bottles in the bag, clinking together. Total Wine and More is THE store for me and if you haven't been their yet, you must go and check it out. The store is huge and there is a nice sized parking lot. It's easy to get to and in a good location. The price point is 'ah-ma-zing' and the staff is always so nice. I couldn't have more than good things to say about them unless it was next to my house. But maybe that IS a good thing...

Zero for some of the staff though.I love the pastries here too, (you get what you pay for though) so I was excited to at least set up a tasting for our wedding cake.  But when I asked who do we speak with to set it up, the guy at the counter was a dick, rolled his eyes and said I don't know if that date is available, let me go see if she's here.  He went to the back and came out and never spoke with us again.  I was like, well screw this and I went online.  Seeing their starting price too, I was like well, there goes that idea.But I'm glad I got a recommendation from my cousin and I gave them another shot, and I'm glad I did.  Maribeth got back to me the next day, and my wife and I had a great experience.  She offered us coffee and her binder and let us look on our own.  After a few minutes she asked which ones we liked and how many people.  She pulled out her trusty I-Pad and had it linked to a tv on the wall which gave us a different look at it.  She was super friendly, and did not have a "I'm Ron Burgundy, I'm kind of a big deal" aspect like the guy at the counter, although with her design skills she definitely could.  But that's what EXCELLENT customer service is, and that is what she provided.  When we told her we liked about 5 designs, she asked what we liked about each one and broke it down.  She had an artistic aura about her, and took what we liked and envisioned our cake for us, which was pretty awesome.Then came the really fun part:  TASTING!  She brought out a full slice of all of the flavors on the menu.  Then she gave us a warning:  Just take a taste of each one.  If you want to enjoy it here, fine, but it can be overwhelming.  I can pack it up for you to take home to REALLY enjoy it.  SOLD!  All of the cakes we tried were good, so it was tough to choose.  Luckily for us, we had 200 people to serve, so we were able to pick 5 flavors. Plus, we get a fresh new cake for our anniversary instead of having to stick the top layer in the freezer, which is AWWWWWESOMMMME!The design of our cake was everything we imagined, delivery was on time, and we got comment after comment from our guests on how pretty it looked and how good it tasted.  Wedding cakes are not cheap, but we planned our budget to spend on things that we really wanted.  Give the keys to your wedding cake to Maribeth, and let her escort you to the wedding cake of your dreams.  We did, and we loved our experience with her.

TRADITIONSDia de los Muertos - or "The Day of the Dead" -  is a sentimental Mexican holiday that is practiced and observed throughout Mexico and in other Latin cultures around the world. The holiday focuses on gatherings of family and friends to pray for and remember friends and family members who have died.

You pay for your beers per ounce. The beer prices varies depending on brand. (And boy do they have a variety; cider, ales, IPAs, stouts, even a special one at 10% alc!) It is very innovative technology where you scan the logo on your bracelet to the star located on the bottom-right part of the screen on your selected beer. It is a very fun experience! Try as many of the beers you like, as much as you want! (Though the bracelet limits to up to 32 oz pours...subsequent glasses may require a new bracelet?)We ordered a extra large Berkley Vegan pizza (18 inches) to go along with our beer samples. The service was attentive and friendly. The waiting and cooking time however, was pretty darn slow. But who is blaming them? 'tis is opening week! Expect long lines for food orders and long waits for tables as it is a "first come first serve" sort of deal. So after a couple drinks, our glorious pizza arrived! It was piping hot and crisp! The veggies would have probably tasted nicer in their "roasted" versions, however the veggie burger crumbles were extremely flavorful and delicious. The Vegan cheese melt nicely and tasted really close to the "real deal," you won't notice the missing diary! My only concern for this pizza is the lack of sauce. But it is a personal preference, I love tomato sauce :)Great service, nice beers, good food, a bit steep on prices but, definitely a fun restaurant to dine in with your friends, family, and/or significant other! There were also tons of big TV screens for the games! I am hoping they will rotate their beer selection time to time so we could sample different ones :)

As the food kept coming mini gyros, full gyros, souvlaki pork and chicken, beefteki patties our table got smaller and our bellies got fuller.  All of their food is amazing with such a unique taste.  But my favorite was my order which was the Athenian Pikilia plate, come on even the name is cool Athenian.  I was a gigantic plate that came with two beeftekia, two souvlakia , loukaniko (Greek sausage) and a beef/lamb gyro served with rice pilaf, Greek yogurt and pita bread. Needless to say we had food for the next day but everything was worth letting out the button on my pants. Their staff kept coming over seeing how we were enjoying our food and with our mouths full we just nodded with approval.  They were even nice enough to bring us one of everything on their dessert menu, now I think they were trying to show off because the only thing that could top their food was their desserts.  I couldn't even begin to describe or do them justice on how tasty they were.Only thing that surprised me on how small the place is, given the surrounding restaurants.  I have eaten in those and by far Petra is my favorite.

Bun Bo Hue is my favorite Viet soup and I couldn't wait to try theirs; it did not disappoint. In fact, I didn't even have to add Hoisin or Sriracha to it....and I am quick to shoot the Sriracha right off the bat. Their bun bo hue is ridiculously flavorful with just the right amount of heat, I highly recommend it. Their prices are obviously a bit higher than what you would pay at most Viet places on in South Sac, but that's to be expected given their location. The service, however, is notably better than most Little Saigon places. I recently attended a Community Managers Yelp Event here and, even though they encountered many unexpected problems, they were still quick, attentive and polite. Go check them out, step out of your pho comfort zone and order the bun bo hue. Don't worry about pronouncing it, just point to it on the menu, you'll be glad you did!

Hot Blonde.  Angry Road Man. Maybe a burger!  Food feels 2 bucks pricey, but it's organic, grass fed, and quality stuff.  Alright, I'll pay for it.  600+ reviews about that stuff.  Read those.  I tell you what though, for me, Dad's is now my go to neighborhood bar. I go every Tuesday.  EVERY Tuesday!  For two reasons I go each and every Tuesday: Tyson and happy hr drink prices all day!  Well, #3 is I am degenerate drinker, but who's counting?  The beer selection rocks.  CA micros raining from sky at $4 a pint is what's up. I think they got about 26 taps and switch it up so much you are certain to find something new and delicious.  Hibiscus IPA from Coronado?  Yuh. Tyson holds it down deftly making sure you get your food order in and not go thirsty.  The taproom feels like a garage.  Part of that is the roll down door for sure, but it overall feels like some handy beer loving dude built it over the years decorating it with kitschy beer schwag.  There are 2 TVs, wait, nevermind who's garage has 2 big flat screen TVs...okay not quite like someone's garage, but you get the point.  It's cozy and there is beer.  I'll be there next week eating half a Hot Blonde (the other half is for later) and drinking beers.  How's your Tuesday looking?

You know, the regular kid type stuff. It wasn't a huge area...just enough for a semi-large group of people.  If I was putting together a party back then I would have probably opted for Oakwood Lake Resort, but Pollardville's Picnic Area would have come in a close second.

<review# 1623,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2013,8/27/2013,574,469,32,32,29>Wow, this was the only good part of this craptastic Zoeyless weekend. Ugh. I hate when my child is not home. She is like a beacon of light in a sea of darkness. Before I paraphrase Johnny Cash any further or start getting religious, let's get down to this business of Über.I am no stranger to taxi cabs. A cursory look at the address book on my iPhone might leave a person with the impression that I am some kind of slut. This would be wrong. It's just that I  know who to call for a cab in Sacramento. They happen to all be men. And I am not that kind of girl that will just get in any dummy's cab. I'm picky. I hate bad driving, and since I ain't begging, because I'm paying, I'm choosing.But once in a while, I'll call my usual "after 3" friends and I'll be SOL as they'll be on Mack Road or in the North Highlands with another fare. Usually I'm calling cabs during the prime time, so this has been happening more than usual.Enter Über, found by my sister, who uses cabs all over the United States for her job. She wooed and raved, and when my favorite ride told me he couldn't make it in 30 seconds like he usually does, I decided to have my sister do her Über magic. Actually, no, that isn't how it happened at all. I wanted to stay at the Club Raven to possibly 8 am the next day, so Sunny took it upon her bad-assed self to arrange the ride without making a single phone call. I was pretty impressed. That shit was pretty efficient. She casually slipped right on by right when I got myself in a little bit of a jam with some person I have met before, and not in a good way, and cheerfully inquired, "Burgers and Brew?" She shot the old ex-O down before he could breathe, grabbed me, my purse, and my phone which was plugged into the wall. The girl means business. When it is time to go, it is time to GO!There, a big fancy cab was waiting with water and a doorman! But as I'm getting into the cab, momma bear starts getting that "baby's in trouble" feeling. Then I found some random guy puking right in front of the Bird. I told him he was "a poor baby" and I gave him my water. He didn't look like he wanted that shit at all. But he reluctantly took it. I tried to convince him he was in great shape because puking means no hangover tomorrow, right? Anyway, the cab guy was extremely patient. He also got me another water and double checked to see if old pukey was OK when I asked him to. I don't want anyone around me getting sick or having a sad time. This is just who I am. I am not mean. I don't care if the guy is puking in front of the Club Raven every night. If I am there I'm going to be feeling pretty bad for him. Puking sucks.The driver was also quiet and nice. He was also extremely prompt and the car was dope. Ok I don't really remember much about him at all except his massive tolerance. But I do remember Burgers and Brew. He got us there from the Club Raven without wasting a ton of time. Don't be afraid to try it! All that for 12$, no tips allowed, is what I'm talking about. I prefer choosing my own driver, but in a pinch, this shit is the bomb 4sho. Very good.
<review# 1624,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/7/2013,8/26/2013,433,220,32,25,23>This is a great place. I try to come here at least twice a week. Now, you rarely see a smiling runner. I am no exception because I generally do not enjoy it until it's over but since I am in an ongoing battle with fatness, I have to keep doing it and I find that this park is the best place to burn off that man butter. You don't have to run though, there are tons of activities you can do here like tennis, duck watching, people watching, yoga, flower smelling, volleyball, picnics, or if you're a total no-life asshole, you can light the playground on fire (which someone did last year). I just come here to run. The other runners seem to be nice; there seem to be a lot of East Sac housewives running with their twin purebreds, not smiling of course. Maybe she knows that, while she is trying desperately to hold onto her once youthful body, her husband is taking his hot new paralegal out to sushi for lunch. Or maybe she just doesn't like running either, I don't know.Anyways, I think this is a great park. I think the only thing it needs are some pull-up/dip bars. The wooden bleachers by the tennis courts are only about three feet tall, so they are perfect to use for platform jumps or elevated pushups - people look at me funny, but I don't give a care. So if you haven't been here yet, you should definitely pay this place a visit and do park stuff. Bring the kids.
<review# 1625,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/12/2013,8/25/2013,474,133,19,26,23>In an epic day of gluttony I just made my second burger place opening of the day (Giant Orange was my first stop).  I fell so far off of the wagon of mostly healthy weekday day eating that a couple of wheel tracks in the dirt are the only remaining evidence that there ever was a wagon. Is it possible that I have an issue; yes quite possibly, but there was no way I was missing the opening of a burger place that I've been waiting on for months to open.  Upon reaching the counter I to an emphatic "welcome boss" and quickly confirming that Bruce Springsteen indeed was not standing behind me, I was met by a very friendly and customer service oriented man who I would presume was the owner. A gaze of the menu brought typical burger options with standard fare add ons, various alternative burger sandwiches, hot dogs, mostly standard burger joint sides and for good measure, a couple of token salad options. Of note and not completely clear from the above counter menu, the burgers come as #1, 2 and 3, single, double and triple quarter pound patties. For my choice, I went with the standard #1, single quarter pound patty with an add of cheese and bacon. My initial thought was that the single patty seemed a bit on the thin side.  As I'm a fan of saying, I like my burgers like I like my women, just a tad on the thicker side. I guess you could say I'm a third pound guy and not a fan of doubling up on patties. Though a little on the thin side, the meat did have a nice flavor with a perfectly seared texture. The veggies were fresh and once I removed about five unnecessary layers of lettuce I was down to business. A major plus here for me was the bun.  It definitely was not your run of the mill set of burger book ends. Given the slightly oblong shape and thick pillowy texture of flavor I am guessing freshly delivered from a specialty bakery. The fries on the other hand, a very basic pre-packaged common cafe fry that was underwhelming to say the least. I also tried a side of garlic version which brought the below average fries up a notch. In addition, the owner was kind of enough to bring out a free sampling of the sweet potato tater tots which proved to be the best of the sides I tried.
<review# 1626,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2013,8/24/2013,390,173,22,30,24>There has definitely been a lack of barbecue in Natomas. Dickey's to the rescue! Sensing a sure fire hit here.We were greeted at the front door with a smile and a "Hello, welcome to Dickey's!". Off to a good start, we forged ahead to...the wrong place. Yup, I missed that big yellow sign saying "Order Here" right there at the front door. I tried to console myself that it was above my head. Who thinks to look up? Right?Anyway, after placing your meat order at the front counter, you head down the assembly line for your sides and salads. This was the only area where we ran into a little hiccup. Since the BF was ordering a salad and I had sides, my meats from the front sat on the tray getting cold while the salad was assembled and sides were prepared by one worker. Seems like they should have at least two people in this area at all times as the poor guy was overwhelmed trying to man the fryer and work the cold items quickly.I thought the two meat plate was a pretty good value. The meat guy seemed apologetic about only giving me two ribs, but considering that there was also a full sausage link and good portions of the two sides, plus a roll, I didn't really feel slighted at all. Ah man...those ribs. I could seriously munch on a whole rack, no problem. Perfectly tender, but not mushy, they had this incredible caramelized crust that had me in porky heaven. The meat was smoky and delicious with just a light brushing of sauce. Perfect!The spicy cheddar sausage was good. I'm wimpy when it comes to spice and I'd classify it as medium. If it would have been warmer (temperature wise), I think I would have liked it a lot better. The cheese inside was cold and therefore not the best texture. But it worked well sliced and stuffed inside the roll for an impromptu sausage sandwich. Love, love, love that they have fried okra! It was super crunchy and nicely seasoned. The potato salad was creamy and had a slight bleu cheese flavor to it which I liked.I snuck a few bites of the Smokehouse Salad and am a big fan. The smoky, tender brisket, onion rings, and cheddar made for a wonderful flavor combo.I have to admit, we were ridiculously disappointed when we discovered the free soft serve machine was out of order while we were there. We felt silly, but we were looking forward to something sweet, creamy and cold as a capper to our terrific meal. Needless to say, we had a couple of momentary sad faces over that.I like their big yellow cup drink promotion. It's their huge $2 plastic cup that you can order while you're there, take home and wash in the dishwasher and reuse, or as it says, it's microwaveable (who does that?). It's also the name of their customer loyalty program they offer with discounts and specials if you sign up on the website. Service was very friendly, we were even checked on twice while eating at one of three outdoor tables they have. The dining area is inviting with a couple of TVs. It was very warm inside and the weather outside was only in the 70's the day we visited. That had me a little concerned about those 100 degree temps to come. Sure hope they get that ice cream machine fixed.

When I drove up to this humble little strip mall with a payday loan next door servicing the needs of the community, I kind of assumed it was a no frills fast foodish kinda place. But lo and behold I walked into a lavishly decorated little piece of Persia. Granite tables for all and ornate ceiling adornments galore. I found it amusing that most of the waiting staff were older Persian men, reminded me of Goodfellas. They were efficient and cordial, and were overall pleasant and attentive. First off let me say, the basmati rice blew me away! It was the fluffiest, most fragrant basmati rice I've ever had. Infused with saffron and most likely cooked in some kind of broth, I could eat it plain and be done with the meal. The rice alone deserves a 5 star review. However, the other elements, bring my rating down to an overall 3.5 star. I had the lamb shish kabob and the meat was tender but cooked well done, and not seasoned much at all. I had to sprinkle salt on it to taste and the waiter actually told us to load it up with the sumac seasoning. In my mind I was expecting something wonderfully seasoned in a way I could not do myself with my limited knowledge of kabobs. But alas, I think I could've grilled a tastier meat on my Weber at home. Now combine that with the $20 price tag and I'll have to knock it down a few stars.Overall, rice was fantastic and alone deserved 5 stars, but man does not live by rice alone.

I'm there to eat, not avoid meatheads with overly sculpted eyebrows.Anyway, the food is pretty decent and the chips come with multiple sauces, which is great for an indecisive person like myself. The rice was super delicious. Drinks were kind of weak and a tad expensive. Also, the inside of the restaurant can get pretty loud, so if you want to have a conversation (or avoid meatheads) try get a table outside.

As is true with any public space, keep your eyes open, watch your "6 o'clock", and trust your instincts. But I have tell you, we haven't had any trouble here, just fun fun fun!"HEADS" UP!:  Be prepared to change a diaper in your car -- I can't recommend the bathrooms. When I lamented to a local politician about the cold, strange, steel toilet seat and the lack of a changing station, he said that they have had trouble with fires in the bathrooms. Apparently, the toilet seats and changing tables have been used as camp stove holders. Wow, sad on so many levels.BEST SCULPTURE!!! You must go investigate the aliens in the ex-Airstream spaceship. On cloudy days and at night, you see the neon and LED lights. Done by local artist Joe Scarpa. At night, we wave "hello" to the aliens as we drive by on W Street or on the freeway :)

<review# 1633,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2007,1/30/2007,11,56,,6,2>This place gets four stars for one reason only - we live up in the Sierra kneehills, and it's hard to find fairly close restaurants with reasonable dim sum. If it were San Francisco, it would garner 3 stars - at best. Don't get me wrong - we enjoyed our meal there. It's just not as good as some of the reviews make out.Location/decor/etc: It's in one of the not-so-nice neighborhoods of Sacramento. You probably wouldn't want to hang out here at night. They have surveillance cameras for the parking lot. But the place itself is nice; clean, roomy and reasonable decor.Service: as well as you can expect when half of the staff can't speak English - but those who COULD were very attentive to our requests.The FOOD (bet you were wondering when I'd get to that): We went on a Monday for dim sum (served 11am-3pm), which would pretty much guarantee that it wouldn't be their 'best foot forward'. All in all? Pretty damn good. The selection wasn't as large as I would have expected, and they didn't have anything that could strictly qualify as  'dessert', but again - it was a Monday, and the place was almost empty. I suspect that the peak days (weekends) would have much more items. If we try it again on another day, we'll update our review.Price: not bad as far as dim sum goes. It averaged around $3 per plate (as far as our selections went) so two people can get out of there for $25-35.Summation: We enjoyed it, we wouldn't mind going back again - especially since it's a helluva lot closer than San Francisco. But don't confuse it with what can be had in a major 'Chinatown' community.
<review# 1634,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2006,1/29/2007,25,91,,3,2>The first thing you will notice is the sign.  It is the original neon pink sign that was orginally put there in the 50s.  The building itself hasn't changed much either.  And the window displays are always very festive and creative.  The absolute best thing to purchase there is the strawberry cupcake with real pieces of strawberry in the cupcake.  And frosting.  Oh. My. God.

<review# 1636,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2006,1/26/2007,207,336,1,3,3>They have Macy's, Nordstrom, JCPenney, and Sears all at the same mall.  Plus they have tons of stores that I love.  The people are kind of ghetto, but I could care less.  They have Ann Taylor, Black and White, Abercrombie, Forever 21, Cache, Sephora, Pottery Barn, Frederick's of Hollywood, Gap, Spencer's, f-ing everything!  Plus, they put on a great display at Christmas and Easter with Santa Claus and an Easter Bunny.  Whenever I go back to Sac Town, I try and hit up the mall for a bit and get my 7.75% sales tax on!
<review# 1637,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2007,1/25/2007,255,791,,4,2>Large juicy beer steamed hotdogs! Loved this place when I lived in Sacramento, used to stop here on the way to A-1 comics all the time. Their walls are covered with sports pictures and funny bulldog posters. Lots of cute flare to look at while enjoying your meal. They usually have a TV on showing the local game too. The hotdogs are excellent, hot, filling, with a little snap to them. The fries are salty, hot and very plentiful! We used to order the tiny and split it between 2 people and still never finish them all. Get a large order and it's basically a cafeteria tray full of fries. Carb-o-licious! They have beer, sodas and a large selection of dogs! Its a smaller restaurant but doesn't feel that small inside as they have plenty of tables. I also appreciate the ketchup and mustard squeeze bottles and that they have plenty of napkins on hand. The food is cheap, hot and wonderful! Bring Cash, as they don't except anything else! Perfect place to grab a huge lunch for 2 for under $20! Mmmmmm!
<review# 1638,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/19/2006,1/22/2007,207,80,,6,4>There is absolutely nothing more important than insuring that your pool is secured to prevent drownings.  I spent six months researching various options (enclosed gate, pool covers, digging up the pool) and after repeated interviews with various contractors and pool safety specialists I decided to have Katchakid install a safety mesh net.Overall I was extremely pleased with the installation, it took 3 people approximately 5 hours to complete the installation.  The net complies with all federal, state and city safety codes and guidelines.  Rob (area manager) was extremely helpful during the installation and instruction process.  In fact his team made a subsequent trip to make final modifications to make me comfortable with the safety of the net.A warning: this solution is dependent on a bit of manual labor during the removal and re-installation process.  Once you get this down it only takes about 3-5 minutes for removal and re-installation. Definitely do your homework as each pool and surrounding landscaping is unique.  Their Northern California office is located in Sacramento, they do installations throughout the Bay Area
<review# 1639,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/10/2012,5/20/2013,211,129,8,16,14>Saigon Bay has lately been my #1 pick when I'm craving Vietnamese food.I've tried a variety of things on their menu and so far I really like their Pho with the thick noodle. I tried the Pho Ga and loooved the broth! I was tempted to not add any additional sauces into it, thats how much I loved it. I also tried their Bun Bo Hue and to me, it's probably the best I've tasted in Sacramento! They have such a wide selection of food on their menu and they have pictures on them too! HUGE PLUS! Their drink menu have awesome dessert drinks and I also saw some alcoholic mixed drinks on there too. I am a fan =)
<review# 1640,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2013,5/19/2013,675,207,8,10,9>Wow what can I not say about Smash Burger that is the question!I have always driving past Smash Burger with the curiosity of trying the place but I never found myself making it there. One day I was invited to go there from a friend who was ranting and raving how good this place was, to my curiosity I decided to check this place out. I was greeted by a young kid very friendly and very eager to make sure my experience was the best, he gave us lots of helpful ideas to choose from. I decided to go with the classic with sautéed mushrooms and cheddar cheese and the Smash fries (cooked with olive oil and rosemary). After waiting about 10 minutes our food came. I noticed that my burger had Swiss cheese(which I cannot stand) the gentleman who brought us out our food said no problem and that they were going to cook me a fresh new burger! I was amazed since most places would just take off the Swiss and replace it with cheddar. Once the food came back every bite was like tasting a little bit of Heaven in my mouth. The burger was cooked to perfection and not too juicy, just simply amazing! Oh and the Smash fries were to die for!! Not too oily just nice and crisp with the beautiful taste of rosemary hitting my lips. I don't think I can have fries any were else now!! Over all I would give Smash Burger a 5 star rating for their customer service is superb and their food is amazing!Thank you Smash Burger for this great experience!I'll be back soon!
<review# 1641,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2013,5/18/2013,70,200,8,11,8>Quan Nem Ninh Hoa was where I fell in love with Vietnamese Spring Rolls. I was introduced to it a while back where I had to make the damn thing myself, and of course, it turned into a mess so that turned me off a bit.At Quan Nem Ninh Hoa, you can either order the spring roll where the ingredients are provided and you put the spring roll together yourself OR you can get the order where they roll it for you and comes with 4 neatly wrapped spring rolls. You can guess which option I usually go with, right? The thing that makes their spring rolls so good is the pork that they put in it and that crispy wrap that was also in the spring roll. Oh, and the dipping sauce....awesome! It might look weird because of the orange color and the texture, but hey, it works! Aside from their spring rolls, they also offer noodle and rice. The rice plates seemed a little small to me, but their noodles were plentiful and pretty filling, if you get the noodles with the spring rolls though, of course!
<review# 1642,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2013,5/17/2013,398,256,16,15,15>So far, impressed. LowBrau is the new kid in the "Lavender District" of Sacramento. Large community tables, giant glasses of beer and duckfat fries. What else can you ask for??A large group of us trampled in decked out in nerdy and geeky awesomeness. We stood out, and that's fine with me. They have a several beers on drafts, and a good selection of German made ones. I really wanted a weissbier, but they were out so I settled for a hef. I had to wait a few minutes for the new tap to go, but I was okay with that, so I got myself a liter. The damn thing was as big as me!!!  In addition to that, they have a good selection of eats. Sausages (naturally), fries and salad. I wasn't that hungry, but I wanted some munchies to go with my liter of beer. Duck fries were definetly in order. Fries came with a choice of dipping sauce, and well, bier cheese sauce sounded right up my fat-asses alley, but they all sounded delicious (the herb one sounds promising).I can't wait to go back and grab some sausage (giggity!) and beer and just enjoy myself (giggity!!).
<review# 1643,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2013,5/16/2013,574,469,37,32,28>I have always liked this park. I am also the Duchess of this park, according to Yelp. I do not live here AT the park, like I tell many people in my check-ins. I do not live in the Zoo either, though at times I feel like I live at the Zoo. I live in a normal abode very close to this park.There are plenty of good parks in Sacramento. But Land Park is the Mother of all of them.I used to park here to hoof it to SCC back in the day. I have had several dates here. They were cheap. I don't think I like where this is going.Let's break it down in terms of stuff you do at the park.1. Take a walk.This is a superior park to take a walk around. I actually think I walk more now thanks to the size of this park. Where I used to bitch about parking more than a block away from anything, now I am pretty content to walk all the way home from Downtown/Midtown if I need to go home. I used to live by McKinley Park. I wrote a review of that park as well. Having lived near Land Park for over 6 months, I am pretty comfortable with the fact that McKinley Park is inferior to Land Park. Walk around McKinley park a couple times. Then walk around Land Park a couple of times. Feel the difference? Land Park is freaking big.2. Have a picnic.At least you'll have your privacy from the Republicans at McKinley Park, with their bleached, little, super-short tennis shorts that wear like a diaper. Seriously though, on the weekends you can expect the maximum occupancy levels to be reached at McKinley Park. Clearly I am not over some of the BS at McKinley Park. I am over 30, so I am going to go ahead and check myself now and shut-up about the bourgeois assholes at McKinley Park. Oops. Spoke to soon!3. Take the kids.Not only can you take the genetic replacements here, they might actually like it. There is plenty of space to run around, there is a zoo, there is fairy tale town that is just about as full of BS as it sounds (God, just kill me,) and there is a serious hyper-jungle playground too that, which I am hoping, I too will get to play on when Zoey is big enough. Damn. "Thassa BIG PARK!! Wow." That was Z-Train.[Pro Tip: that hyper-jungle playground is called Funderland. There are coupons for it in that Sacramento Calendar they put out at Vic's every few years in Dec/Jan. Just watch out though because the Vic's coupons will make you F-A-T. True story!]4. Have a run.There are a ton of seriously enthusiastic runners that come here. I try to absorb some of their energy but I just end up passing out at Midnight as usual. Oh well. One day I will get into exercise. Though I tend to believe needing to exercise is akin to needing to get a life, where you move around enough to be your desired size. Correction: one day I will get a life.5. Feel out of shape.6. Be a Hobo.This park is not without its Hobos. There are just much better places to hide here. Stay in populated areas unless you are one of those crazy types that likes fighting AND you are by yourself. I get you, but no one wants to be involved in all of your mischief/nonsense. 7. Play a game.This is a great place to play a game but for heaven's sake just because you are at a game with your child doesn't give you the latitude to abandon your child until the game is over. Zoey and I went to the park the other day to have a look at her "Docks" kby the smaller lake, and there was this kid there who wandered over from the game and he looked very confused, and was seriously gnawing at a tree branch. When Zoey decided to gnaw on a branch too, I spoke up and I asked him where his Mommy was. He gestured toward the game, but everyone playing looked grown. I don't know why these helpless children always gravitate to me. Doesn't any one worry about where their kid is? This kind of shit happens to me all the time. They come at IKEA, they come here at Land Park and every other damn  park. I don't take my child out in order to watch some stranger's kids. That's a whole lot of drama that I would rather avoid. I hate talking to other kids' parents unless it is planned or unless I have known them since before they had kids, (ie., since BEFORE they were perfect.) I mean, I especially do not want to meet any bad parents. Not trying to be a jerk, but I'm also not trying to have an intervention at the park. You wouldn't believe some of the problems I have with OPKs at the parks.Aside from all of that, I like coming here. I recommend minding your own business, (which includes your children's business,) and avoiding this on busy days like the weekends or on holidays. Also avoid in unpleasant weather. The park is outside.
<review# 1644,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2013,5/15/2013,1934,564,17,28,27>Comfort food with a twist!This place just opened up on April 1st (no April Fools joke) in a small shopping center in North Stockton If you didn't know it you might think it wasn't open yet.  It was only because a friend happened to see the "now open" sign on the curb that they tried the place out and found a hidden gem.Apparently this is a first-time restaurant venture for the owners...the owner used to be an IT guy and his wife is an amazing cook so they decided to open their own restaurant.  To hear his wife tell her story she had some health problems and decided to cook healthy for herself and she ended up losing 20 pounds and becoming healthy just because of her food choices. She has now brought that attitude to her new restaurant. Even the water and ice cubes are filtered. (They have plans to make homemade healthier soda in the future as well...)On a tip from a friend I ordered the Cluck Sandwich...it was made with free-range chicken and a blueberry/blackberry yogurt sauce.  The fries were just amazing...fresh cut, not too greasy...just like grandma would had made. All of this for around seven bucks, and I went away full and feeling great about what I had to eat. The restaurant itself is just getting off the ground so there are a few little quirks...don't expect this to be fast food, it is a family place and the family works there so plan to relax and sit back while eating.  Also at this very moment they only accept cash and checks but they should have a credit card machine shortly. I am happy to say I was one of the lucky few to have eaten here at Green Leaf Bistro early on...I am sure that with their fresh, tasty menu and great customer service they will be hoppin' and busy in no time.  Totally worth a try.:0)
<review# 1645,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/12/2013,5/14/2013,317,342,11,16,7>New ownership, new name, new paint on the walls, but same seating set up in a modestly large-ish place.  But how do you not give your patrons menus right when you seat them?  Even the other employee that we flagged down had an amazed look on his face when we asked for menus, shook his head, and apologized.The salt and pepper wings were really tasty and piping hot, but I was really disappointed by the calamari.  Sure, it was crispy, not oily, but had no flavor to me other than with the sweet and sour dipping sauce.  I can say that this is the best place to get Pho... in Natomas, but that's only because there are not very many places around that offer it.Joy Luck Garden almost always looks empty when I drive by, and I can see why.  It's not great, but it's also not terrible, but they do offer a lot of variety since they have Chinese and Vietnamese offerings.  I would add it to the list of go-to places for Natomas-ites or Natomasans whatever you want to call us locals.
<review# 1646,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2013,5/13/2013,1134,510,10,15,15>Walked in and saw the special of the day was a steak sandwich and a side for $7.99.  I was all over that and ordered 2 to go.  Friendly guy at the counter.  He gave me a postcard that provides me with a free drink every time I come in.  Awesome!  My order came up in no time.  I was the only one in the restaurant at the time.  I got home and devoured the sandwich and fries.  Neither had a chance.  The steak was cooked medium (although I ordered medium-well), and was tender and flavorful.  My man (a steak and eggs kinda guy) loved it and was ready to go back the next day.  Seems that they are only a lunch place, as they had abbreviated hours (but it was NYE), so it might be a little hard to make it for dinner.  Other than that, I'm willing to try their burgers and other stuff 'cause they sure did do the steak sandwich justice!
<review# 1647,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/4/2013,5/12/2013,277,126,9,15,11>After my third visit to Mangia!, I'm convinced that this sandwich spot is just a-ok.  My sandwich was tasty  enough (Heatseeker) and plenty spicy, but its just not that memorable of a place.  The service is okay.  The ambiance is okay.  The food is okay.  You order at the counter and given a pager which will buzz when your food is ready for pick-up, so why is there a tip jar? The portion size seems to be just right, and just in case you can't finish your sammie, there is "to-go" foil at your disposal at the condiment station.  I think the wait time for food is a little too long considering that they are never crowded or what I would consider busy at lunch time.  I also think its lame to charge 50 cent for a pickle. Really? C'mon guys, don't make me pay for my spear.  I'm not going to go out of my way to visit Mangia! again unless someone in my party insists upon it.  It's not terrible, it  just lacks that certain variable that would inspire me to come back.
<review# 1648,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2013,5/11/2013,144,58,20,21,18>You guys were so RIGHT about this place!! It was Deeeeeelicious!! Where do I even begin? The staff was great from start to finish and the food was amazing! If I could, I would give them a gazillion stars all the way across!! :)My cousin and I planned to come here for breakfast/brunch on a saturday morning but woke up late. And with such a busy day ahead of us, being worried about the wait, I quickly decided to pick another place. But something told me to go anyway since I already had my heart set on trying this place. So I called them at11:30am and was able to get reservations for 12:15pm. YES! And boy was that a great decision!Thanks to Yelp's great tips, we carefully watched out for the restaurant sign as we got closer so we wouldn't miss the entrance. And yes! We found it and got front parking! ;)We arrived exactly at 12:15 and were seated immediately! Looks like we just missed the breakfast crowd, and slid right in to cut the lunch crowd. Menus, water and coffee were all quickly brought to us. I'm totally loving the hustle and bustle of this place right about now. So don't hate me but I don't care for biscuits and gravy. I've had it in the past and it just wasn't my cup of tea but eveyone raved about the gravy so of course I HAD to try it. And you know what? Thank you!!! Because I absolutely LOVED LOVED it. I am now a believer of biscuits and gravy- Evan's gravy that is! :) Biscuits and Gravy $6- Two split biscuits covered in this famous meaty gravy. Perfect size for sharing. I took my first bite.... what the?!?! My eyes widened and rolled back, senses enlightened, my mouth orgasmed and when I looked across at my cousin, she had the same expression! Lol. We couldn't believe how good it was and we couldn't stop laughing. The gravy was soooo good, I don't even know how to describe it. It's like punch your boyfriend in bed good! Yes, that good!! I feel like I've been missing out my whole life and to make up for all that time, I want a whole pot right now. Just to eat for fun because I'm not even hungry and it's almost 4am lol. I'm so telling everyone I know about this gravy!! :)Wendell's Benny $9.25- Juicy sausage patties and the hollandaise was not too thin and not too thick. They went hand in hand together- perfection!The Little Al Omelet $8.75- I picked sausage, bacon and mushrooms for my omelet. They did not skimp out on the meat, totally Yum! The potatoes were so crispy and tasty too, I wish I had room to finish everything!Awesome Staff- The hostess was Fantastic! She had a great attitude and you can tell she really enjoys her job. She greeted everyone and sat them down, and when there was no one at the door, she even came around and checked on tables, refilled the glasses and took away plates! I love it when people take the initiative to help out and do beyond their job expectations. I was totally impressed with her and if I owned my own business, I would've so job offered her! Our waiter, Alex(I think that was his name, sorry! I took too long to write this review, I can't remember) was fast and sweet. He came to check on us often and our coffee and water were kept full the entire time. So I'm giving them a well deserved 5 stars for the fast service, 5 stars for the happy and friendly staff, 5 stars for the awesometastic food and a gazillion stars for their gravy alone. I can't wait to come back to try the other items and of course I want YOU gravy! ;)
<review# 1649,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2008,4/30/2008,493,361,10,7,13>One of my friends took me here to celebrate my birthday.  My friend didn't want to watch me age slowly and wither away, instead she preferred me to go and attempt fate by a single ripcord and if I should die it would be much better to be in the blaze of glory and create one hell of a cocktail story...We went through tons of signature sheets and liability release forms, basically saying that if something goes wrong and you get seriously hurt and/or dead you promise you won't sue.  I always thought it would be entertaining to imagine a zombie would come back to life, put on a nice suit and go in and take someone to court.  OK, back to the jump!  They gave us a short instructional motivation video to keep people from chickening out after having to sign all those death release forms and finally a person came into the room and had us refine our technique on benches showing how we should exit the plane and what to expect out there.Flying up to 13,000 feet the plane's felt like it was bouncing around and a little "wobbly", I liked the off and subtle smell of spent diesel fuel  from the engines, It almost felt like I was in one of those 101 airborne movies getting ready to parachute behind enemy territory...  (I know I have a wandering imagination...)  As we ascended the air temperature dropped and I could see my breath, I would then come to realization that I was breathing way to fast and because I was nervous and excited...  to this day I'm not sure which one it really was... We were hooked into the instructors, and stood up as we approached the jump point, in the jumping group, it was just my friend, myself and this other guy who would jump first.  As he got to the door he started to have second thoughts, as his hands were pried on either door preventing the jump, he kept screaming, "I don't want to do this, I don't want to do this"  "awww &#%*!  I'm out"  Pretty much the instructor and a videotape guy came over and gave them a shove out the door and I can hear his scream slowly disappear over the sound of the plane.  Needless to say being right behind this, it made me feel a little uncomfortable, still, you go in front of that open door, and stare out at the open horizon, it was amazing, clear beautiful day, hardly a cloud and I could see the golden gate bridge in the distance, I'm not joking we are in Davis and I could see the city from here in plain view, those 100 miles seem like nothing from up there.  Then we jumped out and the free fall was felt awesome my blood was pumpin like no other and when the moment came I got to pull the chute.  On the way down my guy was really cool and let me steer, we did some hard spirals flaring out and going into a tight spin as we descended to earth.  He even gave me some control with the landing too!  We hit the ground and that's when the adrenaline left and my legs went limp, we crashed way off course, those spirals threw us off course and we landed before the guy that jumped before me...  Got an awesome grass stain (I swear it is a GRASS STAIN!!!) and refuses to leave my pants to this very day.I had a great time, we jumped at 13,000 feet for about 200 bucks, naturally I figured that I would be a great excuse to have a camera person tape the experience, little did I know that the video and pictures become a source of entertainment for my friends and family over the coming years.    They do offer training course so you can be able to jump on your own down the road to!  I'll be back soon!

I don't drool over Cherry Garcia, although I do really like clever names in marketing. I just like ice cream, like most everyone does. This BJ is in a strip mall. (It would make sense to get a satisfying licking from a "BJ" in a "Strip" mall.)  It is about 5 blocks from campus. It is actually about the closest place you can park near UC Davis without having to have a parking permit. For students, its an easy bike ride here.The blonde who took care of me, er, well, I mean served me, uh, I mean got ice cream for me was named Danielle (it's on the receipt! I didn't ask!) She was very perky and friendly, eager to take care of me and fulfill my sweet dreams of oral delight. (Get your mind out of the gutter!) I ordered a non-fat vanilla yogurt, I thought. I was expecting it to be  soft like all the other times. You know,  just a quick lift and pump of the lever, then a jerk and shiver of vibration, and with a low groaning like sound, out it would come in a creamy white stream. What a sight! But instead,  she grabbed her tool, bent over and grunted because it was still hard, and straining to get a good full load, emerged with a couple of balls to go with my cone. I guess BJ has a different approach to frozen yogurt. No matter. It was a happy ending!

This family owned local creamery is pretty much the definition of ice cream bliss. All of their ice creams are made on site and you can even ask your waiter for their "secret" or "hidden" flavors to find out the best flavors of the day which aren't put on their normal menu. I made it a rule of thumb to only ever order a secret flavor whenever I went there which usually include special seasonal ones or just random concoctions they invent, and I have yet to be disappointed and I have eaten quite a lot of ice cream in my day (which is why i love my taebo class now!! ha ha) And their hamburgers and creamery combo which comes with a burger and milkshake are one of the best deals by far!! They also have sandwiches just like the old ice cream parlors, but we always got an order of fries to dip in our ice cream---TRUST ME  don't mock it until you've tried it!!!!Favorites include the black and tan and the giant banana splits which beware, only crazy people can finish on their own, and I am not one of those!!!!
<review# 1652,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2008,4/26/2008,323,1092,5,11,12>My future hubs bought me a gift certificate to see Zach for Christmas, and I'd been saving it, thinking that at some point I'd start exercising enough that I'd actually get sore and want a massage.  Since I've become lazy/busy in my pre-nuptial days, exercise hasn't been happening as much as I'd like.  But, I realized recently that all of the wedding planning, working multiple jobs, and going to school that I've been doing had somehow settled in my upper shoulder and neck region--making me a stiff, headachey mess.I was so tense and stiff when I showed up that I really felt bad for Zach.  But I quickly realized I had nothing to worry about.  He really is an incredibly warm, genuine person.  I felt comfortable talking to him about my medical history and he took time to show me around his office and point out all the details of it.  And more importantly the massage was great!  If he was thinking I was a crazy mess (which my shoulders would have suggested) he kept it to himself.  He made sure to check in with me about pressure levels, but otherwise he was quiet and the whole experience was relaxing and very healing.  I went in feeling pretty crappy, and left with a huge smile on my face.  The hand written thank you card I got in the mail a few days later was a nice touch.I would highly, highly recommend Zach to others.
<review# 1653,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2008,4/25/2008,45,96,2,6,6>SacTown is a fantastic publication that takes a high-end approach to all things Sacramento. SacTown, unlike Sacramento Magazine, presents Sacramento as a growing, changing, exciting city with many facets. They report on the cool stuff that goes on, the famous people and events here, the innovations and the fine dining. The photography bears that out, and has won national awards because if their high-quality and unique perspective. I think the design is not trying to be too Luxe or too Heckler, but it appeals to a diverse audience.
<review# 1654,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2008,4/24/2008,247,159,3,14,17>Ok, so I used to be a distance runner..many many many moons ago.  Since then I doubled my body weight! YIKES.  So, after a lot of soul searching and a promise I had to keep so someone dear who passed away.  I decided to start training for the California International Marathon.  My first hurtle was, my size.  My size 22 butt was huge, and I was very embarrassed and scared to go into a store that I always saw skinny runners going into.  Needles to say I swallowed my pride and went in.  The staff treated me no different than anyone else, suggested things for me to try and made me fell very comfortable.  I joined in their Shamrock'n Half Marathon training group, again afraid to be the slowest and biggest one there.  Alas, I was not.  People of all sizes, ages, and abilities were there.  I made a lot of new friends, I feel awesome, I ran that race, and dropped 4 dress sizes.  I am still a chubster, but you know I am keeping with it and the coaches, staff, and nutritionists there are wonderful people.  I never felt like a "customer" as in just something they wanted to get money from.  I got water bottles there that broke in two weeks, the replaced both of them, no questions asked.Fleet Feet, I just want to thank you deeply.  You have helped me to find myself again, and are helping me train to keep my promise to my sister who passed away and a promise I made to myself to be healthy again.Thanks!
<review# 1655,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/24/2007,4/22/2008,12,20,11,5,6>Wow.  The Old Tavern.  The first bar I really frequented during my formidable early (legal) drinking years.  It's one helluva dive.  It's got feral cats, construction oddities (is that a huge hole in the ceiling with rain coming down and pouring onto the TV?), the old carpet from America Live!, people that most likely sleep on the floor there after they close just to wake up at 6AM to start drinking again, random crap in the back patio area, hepatitis-infested beer lines, random fights, patrons that vomit on the floor and each other, and bathrooms that could be their own horror show.But the beer is cheap, sometimes the jukebox makes good noises, and you run into some classic characters that might not actually exist outside of the place.
<review# 1656,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/24/2007,4/21/2008,66,86,7,4,6>I was stuffage.  Pure stuffage.Birthdays with the BF are a little more low-key these days, considering our busy schedules and old man sleeping patterns.  This year, we celebrated November 19th at "Sacramento's Most Famous Restaurant," a place I personally had never heard of, The Firehouse.  When I walked in I wished I hadn't left the smoking jacket at home and thought maybe I was turning 60.  Thankfully a mirror at the bar reminded me that I'm only 24.  Snide remarks aside, the interior is decorated with some notable artwork and the building has been nicely restored to a nostalgic splendor that reminded me a little of one of the rooms in Monterey's Sardine Factory.The food was at what the BF and I consider "birthday prices."  The sad thing about dining at some of the city's best restaurants on our budget is that we only get to visit once every few years.  For instance, last year he took me to Waterboy; as five-star as Waterboy is in my book, I may not go back there for a few years due to, uh, financial constraints.  The BF got the Caesar salad and the halibut and I ordered the dungeness crab, potato and leek soup and the osso buco.  Both courses produced well-balanced flavors in hearty portions.  I, naturally, had leftovers to take home for the sake of saving room for what was one of the best desserts I've ever had.The service was very attentive.  Servers were patient, well-mannered prompt.  All of the food arrived in a timely manner, and the presentation of the dishes was optimal without being fussy.  They even served me a cafe latte creme brulee, on the house, with a little candle.  They didn't sing, thank God.Overall, a good birthday.  I may come back here in a few years.
<review# 1657,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/17/2007,4/20/2008,6,52,,6,9>My sister-in-law needed a birthday cake for my baby nephew, whom we just found out has allergies galore--to nuts, dairy, pretty much everything."I'm getting a vegan cake for the baby's birthday," she said."Vegan?"  I asked doubtfully.  "Is that gonna be any good?"  I had visions of a butter-less and egg-less cake with all the taste and texture of sawdust."Trust me," she said.  "It's from Freeport."Any place that can make a vegan chocolate cake so ultra-moist, sweet (but not cloyingly so), and nearly as dense as fudge gets five stars in my book.  Other doubters at the party later that day were like, Vegan cake? but were silenced when the in-the-know Sac residents said those two words knowingly: "Freeport Bakery."  How cool is it when just your name (your brand) elicits that kind of confidence.Oh, and pick up some Linzer cookies while you're at it.  They're just subtly spicy with a thin layer of jam in between.

<review# 1659,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2013,10/11/2013,184,59,12,21,13>oh yes, yes yes!!! Stopped by today for a quick lunch while running some errands for work. I don't think I can rave enough about it. I came just in time before the lunch rush -- literally 5 minutes before 12 when all the madness happened. Thankfully, I was able to grab a plate and a few dishes before the hoards of people came.Another comment I'll make, if there are a lot of Indians coming here for lunch, that has to mean something, right? I mean, i'd say at least 70% of the clientele today was Indian and they were STACKIN' their plates. Good sign to me!The inside is very spacious and it gets busy; they really pack you all in. But hey, at least you don't really have to wait.My first round I had butter chicken, basmati rice and lentils. HEAVEN. Very good butter chicken with flavorful sauce. The overall selection is great in general; good vegetarian options, good meat selection and authentic soups - nom! Since I went during the buffet, the important thing for me to review here is the organization. It was on point. There was an older gentlemen, who I can only imagine was the grandpa or something, patrolling the restaurant to make sure people's plates were cleared immediately and their sodas/waters always filled (free refills on the soda, btw). I have no complaints, whatsoever. They clearly know what they're doing.All in all, I had a great time. It was fast, delicious, and super affordable. The lunch buffet is only $8.99 and my soda was a flat 2 bucks. Not bad at all! Thank you Ruchi staff!! I've wanted to try you for quite some time (heard great things about your Folsom location) so today I am a happy guy! :)

She's personable, flexible with her schedule, and one of the best in understanding style desires and how to make it work. "You know, kind of a-line Great Gatsby." She understood this request, and let my natural curl come through as well. I love my hair finally, thanks to her!I never, ever have a hard time finding parking. There are usually open spots by the park. The shop itself is adorable on the inside, with lots of natural light and light colors.Feeling parched? They have water and wine to refresh you while you get your hair did! Yes, wine! Get drunk and cute hair? Don't mind if I do.This place is adorable, and a pleasure to go to. Ask for Emily!
<review# 1661,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2013,10/9/2013,582,450,9,21,17>Bandera is fan-freaking-tastic!!I took my husband and some friends there for my husband's birthday and we were so happy with both the food and the service at Bandera.  Seriously, everything was spot on and done so well!  I love the smell of the wood-fired oven that fills the restaurant.  I love the intimate booths tucked into dark corners, and I was very impressed with the service.I would highly recommend making reservations, as they are extremely busy all of the time.  Another side note, they don't accommodate parties of more than eight people.  If you've never been to Bandera you will quickly see upon arrival that there is not room to move tables around.  Most all of the seating is in booths big and small, so eight people is the max per table.We had eight people in our group and were tucked into a corner booth.  Let me just say that you will be getting cozy with the people in your party, so be prepared to rub elbows (literally).  That isn't a huge deal because the food and service make up for it.Our waitress was awesome!  Drinks were never in short supply, the food was prompt, and the table was cleared as soon as everyone was finished.  We ordered the GRILLED ARTICHOKE appetizer and the DIP DUO, both were suggested by a friend.  Wow!  The grilled artichokes are to die for.  They are tender and delicious, and are served with a creamy tarragon-like dipping sauce. I could slather that sauce on shoe leather and it'd be good.  The dip duo was a cold cheese dip (yes, cold and delicious) and guacamole served with tortilla chips.  A great way to start off any meal!  Talk about class... we were give hot, steamed towels to freshen up in between our appetizers and entrees.  Wow!For my entree I had the WOOD GRILLED SALMON and MASHED POTATOES.  Simple and mouthwatering.  The salmon was light, flaky and perfectly grilled.  As for the mashed potatoes... I think they had crack in them.  I could not get enough!My husband had the MILLIONAIRE CLUB CENTER-CUT FILET with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  I was lucky enough to try his steak and it too was simple perfection. Bandera provides an overall fantastic dining experience.  We will definitely be back!
<review# 1662,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2013,10/8/2013,136,72,16,17,21>Just sitting down to write this review I think I gained a few pounds. Everything here is freshly made and served with love and smiles. OK, so when you walk in, you will be greeted by everyone that makes eye contact with you. Oh yeah, don't be scared by the mannequin at the door. As you look around your eyes will see some of everything from old license plate, pictures of  clowns or crickets, and my favorite, the train above the tables. Some think its cluttered but I think its just eclectic. Whatever the decor, the food is Awesome. I'm not typically a breakfast person but this place I crave. I have been coming here for 9 years. I have yet to be disappointed. The service is exceptional with everyone attentive to your needs. The food is always hot and you may need a to go plate because of the quantity. My favorites are  the Country scramble, rootie hoop potatoes with country gravy, any omelet, grandma's french toast, biscuits and gravy, and you can't leave without the peach cobbler. I swear they have my grandmother back there making it.  If you mention it is your first time, they will ring a bell and you will get to pick a prize from their basket. The prizes are just some different toys and stuff that will probably bring back childhood memories for most. Go enjoy and savor every bite.
<review# 1663,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2013,10/7/2013,209,356,12,18,17>My family came here for my grandparents' anniversary. We were that annoying large party that required the employees to push tables together and double-team to get us all served. From beginning to end they handled it efficiently and with a smile. Zero mess ups, zero rudeness, zero seeming stressed out or rushing us. Seriously, thank you.While it is a little cheesy, I can't help but love the decor. Some time I'd like to come back and sit at the bar. I think they have some happy hour deals of some sort.The portions are giant and the prices are fair. We were all happy with our meals and drinks, and everyone left stuffed and content. We ordered the appetizer sampler to start and I was impressed with how big it was and how good everything looked. Even with all of us chipping away at it, we couldn't finish it. The onion rings are the lightly breaded, thin, shoestring kind - which I love and are hard to find. For dinner, I had Pete's Special, which is basically just steak (medium rare, please). The sides come out family style so you can help yourself to as little or as much as you want. The steak was juicy and cooked just how I had ordered, and the meat seemed to be decent quality. When we left, my grandma asked for a box to take some bones home to the dogs. The waitress returned with discarded steak leftovers with giant bones from other tables as well, some still with meat on them. Let's just say my grandparents' dogs were singing her praises that night.I'll be suggesting this place for the next family dinner out!

<review# 1665,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2013,10/5/2013,127,153,4,10,7>RIBS!!!I am stoked on this place.   You can order two ribs to go ($5) and they're DEEE-licious!Macaroni and cheese, fantastic, creamy, cheesy. I love the commitment to the local Police, Firefighters, and Military Servicemembers.  These people are dedicated to community and will do what it takes to get your food right; which is pretty easy considering everything was dang tasty to begin with. I'm not going to get picky on whether the pork belonged on my burger or not; it came on the dang burger... so it was good. If it wanted no pork on my buger, I would have ordered the regular burger.  Food was prompt (enough).  Though you do order at a counter, it's not a fast food joint so don't get your panties in a bundle when it takes more time to prepare your meal than it would to grab a soggy bun burger off the warmer at McDonald's.  Even my sweet potato pie was yummy; not a lowcountry hunk o' pie like I would expect in the Carolinas, but I'm not in the Carolinas.. I'm in California and this individual little pot of sweet po pie hit my right where it needed. My only question, what party can I plan to try their catering services?
<review# 1666,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2013,10/4/2013,136,282,5,9,11>I finally tried their hot wings and they were pretty yummy! My husband liked them too because they weren't overly spicy. Some people might think they are not spicy enough though but I found them to be tasty and I'm not even that into wings. I ordered them for delivery with a vegetarian pizza. Had to get some meat to appease my meat loving husband. I actually order delivery from them all the time and it always arrives fresh and hot although you do usually have to wait about an hour for it to arrive. Its worth the wait though! They do deliver everything on their menu, I asked. I just find this to be a step above most other pizza places that deliver. It costs a little more but I feel its worth it for the taste factor. They really pile on the toppings on their pizzas. Also the delivery drivers are always really nice and friendly. This is my favorite pizza. I like the vegetarian one best but my husband likes their combination one best. I will admit I don't go into the actual restaurant that often since I'm so accustomed to getting delivery from them.
<review# 1667,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/14/2013,10/2/2013,136,157,8,7,9>You have to eat here. Have to. I mean it!So good I ate here three days in a row.Order at the register and they'll call you when the food is ready. Super friendly service too!Day one:  babaganoush and warm slightly crispy pita bread. Absolutely delicious, and take note midtown eateries that charge 2$ for extra naan- this pita bread is 49 cents! Three pitas  (cut into quadrants) we're the perfect amount for the three of us to scoop up the Delicately spiced perfectly mashed moist favorite appetizer ever (I'm a sucker for eggplant in any form)Also had a beef shawarma. I don't know what they seasoned the beef with, but it was perfect, and then topped with a very nice tzatziki sauce.Day two: Gourmet potato cake. Kind of like shepards pie with ground beef, mushrooms, cheese topped with mashed potatoes and baked. More babaganoush. Love at every bite.Day three: what? Some crazy chick ate all the babaganoush? Okay-falafel and a side of tabouli. Again, flavorful, delicate spicing and just plain good food.I'll be back, frequently, as soon as I can think of a reason to go to Vacaville.

If you find a better one please let me know!!!Dined here last weekend with Luci N., and loaded up as many dishes as our groaning plates would hold. Vegetarian dishes, tender and moist chicken tandoor, and tender and meaty lamb vindaloo. What more could I ask ?  ....except for a little fresh naan - wait - our server, beautifully dressed in traditional Indian sari, brought us a steaming fresh basket! {eyes roll back in head}Weekday lunch buffet $8.95 - weekends $10.95 - check in on Yelp and get 50% off the second plate. They were actually apologetic for the lack of greater variety in the buffet ... apparently they were gearing up for a special Indian new year's dinner that night, with more than 50 entree choices.Go, eat, groan, pay, walk Davis, repeat.
<review# 1669,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,11/10/2014,234,54,13,15,15>I am so glad I took the drive out here- lunch was AWESOME!  I ordered from the vegetarian menu, and it was every bit as good as the reviews say. I got a veggie combo plate with a chile verde tostada and a chorizo style soy meat   soft taco. Both were spiced just right, tasty and loaded with veggies, potatoes, sauce, tofu, and one had the amazing home made guacamole.The rice was basic, but the beans were fabu! Spicy and doctored to a higher taste level, they had the choice of regular cheese or vegan cheese. I have had both, and both taste great.Note: The salsa bar is above and beyond MANY other Mexican salsa offerings:Not only did they have the traditional pico and peppers with carrots and onions,  but they had an AMAZE-BALLS mango/onion/cilantro salsa. I could eat this on its own - it was very fresh and the sweet of the mango and the bite of the raw onion hit the right spot. YUM YUM.I cannot wait to go back to try their other vegetarian options....the sope looks too good to pass up next time.One small little teeny tiny miniscule note- the staff were super friendly and helpful, but they jumped on my friend and I every minute until we ordered. I just needed 2-3 minutes. You know what- Eager is cool- I would rather that than being ignored! :)
<review# 1670,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,11/9/2014,267,761,11,12,11>This place has been recommended to me several times by coworkers and friends. It's been in my bookmarks for a while. Finally made the trek out here for a random middle of the week date with the hubs.I'm not sure how many people they have working here normally, but it seemed it was only the husband and wife duo and maybe a 3rd person in the kitchen? Service was really slow that day but I didn't mind as much. It gave me time to chat with my hubs. So for my first visit, I thought it would go big or go home. I ordered the Special Chirashi! Hubs got their ramen. I was totally blown away by this masterpiece!! Everything was so thoughtfully placed. Fresh cuts of sashimi and perfectly flavored sushi rice. Yum yum! It was definitely a treat for me. Hubs enjoyed his ramen too. The broth had good flavor and the noodles were good. Now if I want some good chirashi I know where to go! I hope they upload their menu on to their facebook page.
<review# 1671,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/11/2014,11/8/2014,122,117,6,11,10>I have been wanting to try a Chando's taco ever since I saw the long line outside of their Arden location. I have not been able to catch up with their truck in Elk Grove either so I was  delighted when I drove down Power Inn and saw the restaurant. I was on my way to the traffic court and couldn't stop but made a mental note to come back soon. My 17 year old son ( who has a big appetite) and I went in this past Saturday around 1:30pm. I was happy to see they had a 3 taco combo with a drink for under $7. Unlimited sodas are a must for my sons when dining out. I decided to order a taco, tostada, and I think a Mulita. Not sure but basically it had melted jack cheese in with meat. After about a 10 minute wait to order, we waited about 5 or 10 minutes more for our food to be called out to pick up. I was surprised how small the portions were. I know street tacos are not large but these seemed really tiny. The other items were small in size as well. Now don't get me wrong, I definitely need portion control and had plenty of food for me, but for my 6"4" 200 pound son, he inhaled his 3 tacos within 2 minutes literally and was staring hard at my remaining items. I shared the melted cheese taco with him, and contemplated in ordering him some more food but settled on getting him some dessert somewhere else. Unfortunately he wasn't impressed, but for teens quantity is more important than quality so take that for what it's worth. The taste of the meat, ( carnitas, carne asada and chicken) was a Little on the salty side to me, I was also hoping for chunky style guacamole as advertised but it was more of an avocado style salsa. The meat was tender though, and flavorful. I am willing to give Chando's another shot either with my husband and most likely off the Elk Grove truck if I can find it  or their Arden location.
<review# 1672,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2014,11/7/2014,255,144,13,21,18>I. Am. Saved. Yang's Noodle is the ANSWER. I felt like a fish without water living in the Sacramento area without authentic Taiwanese or Chinese food. Yang's Noodle has been on my bookmarks for a long while, but finally when my parents came up to visit me I decided to try this place out with them. Initially, my mom and I decided to venture into this restaurant after a failed attempt to eat in Davis. Yang's is in a questionable part of Stockton Blvd. so I was definitely feeling cautious as I turned into the rickety looking parking lot. However, as we sauntered in, I immediately felt at ease when I noticed that not only was the restaurant busy but also every customer was excitingly babbling away in Chinese. It felt homey and familiar like I was eating in a Chinese restaurant in the city I was raised. During my first visit with my mom, we tried the seaweed, spicy tendons, bean curd, beef noodle soup, beef rolls, and minced pork rice. In later visits, I tried the sour napa cabbage and pork soup, dumplings, fried rice, and the lion's head meatballs. The dumplings were just how I like them, the skin has a purpose!! What exactly do I mean? Sometimes when you eat dumplings, it's such a flat thin skin with no chewiness it feels like the only purpose it serves is to stop the meat and juices from following out. When done right, the texture and pleasant chewiness of the skin won't give you the thought of trying to separate the skin from the meat to save stomach space. Instead it's the perfect balance of skin and meat that makes you want to finish eat morsel in one full satisfying bite. In Taiwan, there are two types of minced pork rice, one being Lu Rou Fan which is directly translated to Stewed/Braised Meat Rice and uses pork belly and fat. The other type is called Rou Zhao Fan (Minced Pork Rice) that is from a different region of Taiwan that generally has lean minced pork in a similar braising sauce. So, in America when a restaurant calls it minced pork rice, you could be waiting to eat either types. No way is the wrong way, but I prefer the one with the leaner meat and this is what they serve here. I find that not only is the flavor lighter it's also more suitable for pairing with other dishes as opposed to eating it alone as a whole meal. I paired it with the spicy tendons and the bean curd. What I love about their spicy tendons is the chili oil that they toss it in. Rather than just being spicy you can taste the fragrant aromas of the peppercorn which is the mark of a good mala (spicy) oil. It gives a tingly numbing sensation that the direct translation of Mala (Numb + Spicy) is supposed to have. Don't worry, it's not overly spicy it's just a fragrant dish. Their beef noodles uses knife cut noodles that are rare to come by these days because it takes a different type of technique that uses the knife rather than hand pulling to create thick long pieces of chewy doughy goodness. Those are just a few highlights of this place, I could go on and on about it but you'll just have to try it yourself!!
<review# 1673,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/21/2014,11/6/2014,195,127,9,14,13>Thai food is one of my favorite foods and I've tried a variety of choices in Sac. I finally came here because I had a coupon and my sweetie thought I would like it. This is at a great location on J street and they were smart to have outdoor seating out in the front of the restaurant. Food-We had the papaya salad- nothing different than most Thai places. It was good and good portion size. We also ordered the spring rolls- also really good and with fresh ingredients. Our entree was the eggplant stir fried (pad Makuah) and we asked for brown rice- yummy! The meal was very affordable. All in all I would give the food 3 stars.The ambience/service-Very friendly service, great atmosphere, clean and modern looking. Extra-The owner is the chef and this is her first business. Her sister helps out in the restaurant too. The fact it's locally owned and family operated, good and affordable food- I give it 4 stars and would come back here again!
<review# 1674,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2014,11/5/2014,58,54,9,14,19>Do you like ice cream? Do you like donuts (doughnuts? I'm never sure how to spell it). Well then Parlor's Ice Cream Puffs are the dessert for you!Think of the ice cream puff like an ice cream sandwich except instead of cookies you get two halves of a donut. You can also have toppings added to the inside together with your ice cream. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, well that's lame, all you have to do is cut a donut in half and stick some ice cream inside. I could make that at home. And you'd be right, kind of. At Parlor though they then stick their ice cream puff creation in their little griddle/press things and that ends up somewhat sealing the donut back together and also warming it back up. So what you end up with is a warm donut with nice could ice cream inside. That's certainly something you can't (well maybe you can, I can't) do at home.How does it compare to an ice cream sandwich from somewhere like C.R.E.A.M? Way better. Ice cream sandwiches are too messy. If your cookies aren't soft, you bite into it and it ends up pushing all your ice cream out the back. That's stupid and you end up with a big mess.I managed to eat my whole ice cream puff without getting any ice cream on myself. My finger still ended up a big sticky cause of the glazed donut but that was manageable. Oh, I should mention they had glazed and unglazed donuts so the unglazed probably would have left no mess at all. The shop itself is cute, there's only 2 tables and some benches and chairs inside but I imagine you could have 10 or so people seated without any issues. Since we went during their grand opening they had a lot of staff there. When you order they ask for your name and write it on the little wrapper they put your cream puff in. My girlfriend and I both have common names but with different spellings and yet they wrote both our names correctly. Not sure what kind of voodoo magic they used but that was nice to see. The staff was polite and let us try a bunch of the ice creams. I'm definitely planning on going back next time I'm in the area and I think you should too.
<review# 1675,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,11/4/2014,134,108,15,20,17>Soooo.... Wanted to see what's this big craze about Cronuts. Since I was in the area, I decided to drop on by on a "Sunday afternoon" - Lighter shade of Brown.The parking lot is oddly shaped yet managed to park right infront of the store (making my own spot). Lol!Walked inside and noticed the two workers were hustling back and forth taking orders from the drive thru window and in the store. They don't have Cronuts posted on their menu but when i asked them, they whip out their ipad and showed me pictures of their variety and different flavors. The guy said they have the biggest selection compared to other Cronut spots and I believe him because he showed me about a dozen of different types. So here's my order (yes I'm a fatty): Plain glazed: Cronut dipped in a white glaze. You can never go wrong with plain glaze as it's delicious.Red velvet: Sprinkled red velvet sugar with a light white glaze. Pretty good if you're a red velvet fan.Bacon maple: Generous pieces of crumbled bacon pieces with a nice maple glaze to hold the bacon on top of the Cronut. The brown sugar taste from maple makes it taste even better.Nutella with cinnamon sugar: sprinkled cinnamon sugar all around the donut with a zigzag drizzle of Nutella. I love Nutella (no homo) and the cinnamon sugar complements it perfectly. Espresso maple: glazed maple with espresso powder tossed on top. Great Cronut if your an espresso lover as this is a little strong.My favorite, Nutella cinnamon sugar, bacon maple and plain glaze. Yes I couldn't narrow it down to just one because they were all so CroLicious!!!I'll definitely make a couple of more rounds here to try the other different types for the experience. FYI, be prepared to bring a few extra dollars because you pay the price for Goodness.

I pulled it up on my app and placed a to-go order. The Meatball, Hot Pastrami and The Cowboy. Once we arrived, we were definitely in for a treat. There were samples of their delicious sausage on display (we ended up buying a few), made our way to the cash register, only to be diverted to their gelato window. We got three expresso and one vanilla bean. Their packaging for to-go was so efficient and cute!Back at the office, the madness unraveled. All the sandwiches were huge and fully packed! The Meatball and Hot Pastrami are both equally delicious and are at a neck-to-neck tie at being my favorite. The Cowboy (tri-tip) was good, but I wish there was more sauce! So good and filling, I waddled back to my desk...unbuttoned my pants (I had a shirt long enough to cover the top) and went about my day. Good stuff!!!
<review# 1677,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,11/2/2014,161,58,14,19,17>Aww snaps! I was so super psyched when i heard they opened Starbread up in my hood.  I lived in vallejo before i moved to sac and starbread was almost at every gathering i've been to so this stuff is very dear to my heart. The Filipino bakery's got it going on.Its located in the little shopping center across from McDonalds on Truxel.  Its a little hard to find but it in the corner by baskin robbins.  Of course you come here for their famous Seniorita bread. Small, buttery, sweet, soft, and chewy rolls that i guarantee you can't just eat one.  I always got to get extra when i come here.  Usually i end up getting like a 20 piece or more.  And you must eat a couple when you get it because fresh is the absolute best. It'll even taste pretty darn good a couple days later.  Just 10 seconds in the microwave and for set.  They have other little snacks and rolls there too and all are good.  I always grab a bag of pork rinds or chicken rinds if they have some.  So really won't be disappointed with what you getPerfect for bfast, lunch, dinner, parties, work , or just because it a tasty treat.  I especially like it after i putt random meats in it.  I know i'm gushing about this place but i can't help it.  I really like em and so will you.  Get some now you won't regret it.  Now i feel like getting some after i finish this review. Lol
<review# 1678,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2014,11/1/2014,202,116,11,15,13>With so many good restaurants, I usually don't choose chain restaurants like Applebee's or Chili's. But here is a chain that offers a nice casual but clean atmosphere, and more importantly good food!I'm not sure how they do it with such a massive menu (like Devo said, akin to cheesecake factory), but everything is actually done well. Deviled eggs in marinara is a surprisingly good combo. Tomato basil soup was perfect. Pizzas/salads - all good! Only miss I tried was their queso dip, which had a stringy rather than consistent texture (a common west coast mistake for some reason).They offer an entire vegetarian section - but not just vegetable sandwiches. They offer "Gardein" which is a chicken substitute that, if done well, is nearly indistinguishable from the bird. I like the gardein hot wings, although the presentation of the BBQ pizza wasn't my fav, with one long strip on each piece.Best of all is the beer selection. As others have noted, over 75 on tap. Available in a couple sizes so you can try a couple different "shortys." They also have beer samplers.Combine all that with good service and an abundance of flat screens showing the game, and it's a recipe for a chain restaurant that actually works!
<review# 1679,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/18/2010,1/27/2011,356,378,2,23,20>I saw their 6 dollar lunch buffet promo on Yelp and took my coworkers here. Being that it was Tuesday, there wasn't much of a lunch crowd the entire time we were there, so they didn't make much stuff. Since it's a buffet, it's understandable that some of the pizzas would have sat around for a little bit. I think their combo pizza was pretty darn good for hanging out under the warming lamp awhile.  The staff was extremely nice, coming around to make sure our cups were full and allowing us to order stuff off of their specialty menu. So we requested the vegetarian and K St pizzas. They came in their standard small/medium size for the buffet, but the vegetarian was made half with red sauce and the other half with white sauce. Both weren't shabby at all. The K St was very interesting since it had bacon on it, which means immediate flavor. For 6 bucks, I left full and satisfied, especially since I was able to try everything that was out. It's a little out of the way, but I wouldn't kick it off the options list for lunchtime dining in the area.
<review# 1680,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2010,1/26/2011,354,195,5,11,9>-Great menu online with pictures. (I love knowing exactly what I'm getting)-Great customer service. The cashier was really helpful and friendly to my indecisive friend who didn't know what she wanted.-Clean and Cute decor-Selection of regular BBQ and Spicy BBQ sauce that I was able to bring to my table and sauce my sandwich up to my hearts content.-DELICIOUS JUICY MEAT-GREAT PRICES-Diet Dr. Pepper (Rarely do I see this at restaurants so its a plus for me)-Fast ServiceI ordered the roadhouse buck with a side salad. The BF and BFF both ordered the Bacon Cheddar one with a side salad the other with mashed potatoes. Mine was so tasty and loaded with blue cheese and onion strings. So much so that I was able to supply my BF's sandwich with an ample supply of onion strings still leaving a ton for myself.I took a bite of his sandwich and it was great! Mashed potatoes were lookin good as well. I will be back to share the meaty goodness that is known as Buckhorn Grill.
<review# 1681,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/14/2010,1/25/2011,113,112,7,9,6>I went here last night for a little bit of debauchery and karaoke, the two fit together naturally.  They have drink specials on long island iced teas and "purple hooters"... More on that later.The food is pretty good and they have a fun way of handling money.  If you order a drink at the bar, they can either charge you for the exact amount and close the tab, or charge you for an even amount in ten dollar increments.  They then hand you your change in "chips" that you use as cash at the bar.  Cool concept and fun for drunk people... You feel like you've won something when you find chips in the bottom of your purse (or at least I did??)So back to the issue with the purple hooters.  OK, so I don't know if I was trained improperly on how to make a purple hooter so correct me if I'm wrong.  1 part Vodka+1 part Chambord+Splash of 7 up +Ice+Shaker=Purple hooter.  Chambord is a raspberry liquor.Now they were doing 1/2 part Vodka, 1 part blackberry syrup+something unknown from the fountain.  OK, they were only a dollar so I shouldn't complain too much, but I do feel like they should call it something besides a Purple hooter at least.  Blackberry syrup/=/raspberry liquor and 1 part vodka/=/1/2 part vodka.All that being said, I enjoyed listening to the nails on the chalkboard downstairs (karaoke).  Also this place is an awesome venue and has four stories of fun to be explored.
<review# 1682,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2010,1/24/2011,410,518,3,13,10>Surprise Anniversary Dinner on a Friday night was a success. The BF really knows how to pull out all the stops on special occasions. What can I say; I'm a lucky chic! The service was amazing. Our waiter definitely looked after us despite a busy night. He knew we were celebrating our anniversary and greeted us appropriately. He knew we meant business after buying a semi-expensive wine :) There is currently a 50 year anniversary special going on at The Firehouse. They have a 3 course meal going for $50 a person!!! I seriously can't wait to see their menu for Restaurant Week!! Despite having the special; my BF insisted that we order what we want. He didn't want to cheap out on our anniversary. Before even starting our meal, the waiter came by with a complimentary cucumber shot of soup. YUMMY! Our First course consisted of a cheese platter for him and a shrimp dish for me. The cheese platter was amazing. And there was so much of it, you could share. Of course my fork and knife traveled over to his plate a couple of times. Second course was a soup for the both of us. Lobster Bisque :) Perfect for a cold night. By the time our main course came in we were so full! Plus, we ate the complimentary bread, complimentary cucumber soup shot, and another complimentary sherbet to clean our palate. Did I say the service was AMAZING? Our main course was the lamb shank. $44 dollars a plate, but what can we say? It was our anniversary. After polishing off the entire wine bottle and main course, our waiter came with a complimentary creme brulle for dessert. Dinner, ambiance, and service were all amazing. You do get what you pay for :)
<review# 1683,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2010,1/23/2011,554,328,3,7,8>I have to say I love it here. The first time I came here was to meet my brother and I was kind of confused when he told me it was in the ally....but it is easy to find. They have excellent high quality coffee. This is the type of coffee you do not want to hurry through a drive through and drink in the car. I find this is the kind that you want to sit in the shop and enjoy it - maybe make some conversations with some of the patrons. They also have excellent food.  It is even better to sit and enjoy my coffee with a snack.
<review# 1684,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2010,1/22/2011,323,1092,4,16,10>In the past my dog has stayed at Elite Dogs, just down the road in West Sac.  Recently she's been more and more unhappy seeming, both when we drop her off and pick her up. So we decided to splurge and try out Wag Hotels.  From the minute we pulled up I felt more comfortable leaving my dog here.  The office park it's in doesn't necessarily look nice, but the interior of their lobby is beautiful.  The woman who greeted us was very friendly and didn't seem annoyed when our dog didn't want her to put the required sticky ID collar (she's very shy around new people).  We booked a medium, standard room and added on the all-day play option.  We were a little worried about her going into the play area with other dogs without us there (she can play really intensely sometimes), so we were very pleased to hear that they actually ended up putting her in with the little dogs because she'd been shy around the big dogs, and that she'd played really well once they did that.  Normally she comes out of boarding super amped up, like she's been locked up for days.  This time she was passed out tired the rest of the day.  The dog report card is a nice touch.  It was funny to hear what other people thought about our dog.And even with the all day play added on, the cost was only $5 more a day than Elite!  For my dog's sanity, I think that's totally worth it.
<review# 1685,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/10/2010,1/21/2011,187,255,5,11,9>Holy crap!Try the food at Golden Bear...you will not be let down!  I know what you're thinking....but seriously...the food there is not "typical" bar food.  It's actually a very well put together menu, that can rival gourmet restaurants in town.  The tacos, and the mac-n-cheese are to die for, and made fresh to order.   The tacos are fairly big, filled to the brim with tender chicken, toppings, and a hot sauce that will make you cry! :) The mac-n-cheese is homemade with a cheese crust on top of it that is just amazing! Spiced just right, it's the perfect comfort food dish.  Good place for drinks?  Amazing food?  Friendly service?  Can't get any better than that!!!
<review# 1686,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/26/2010,1/20/2011,651,150,14,16,21>The year was 1989.  In the hamlet of Long Island, New York, a virtually unknown sage scribbled furiously in his notepad penning a treatise that still haunts us some 20 years later.  Today we know this modest and humble father of 27 as none other than Flavor Flav.  His epic words? "Don't Believe The Hype".  I was reminded of those words shortly after visiting Gatsby's.Now don't get me wrong, I liked Gatsby's.  It's just that it didn't live up to the hype.  After looking at quite a few enticing options, I decided that I'd stake my claim on the namesake choice of the Gatsby burger.  Now for my burger aficionados out there, one of the first things you'll notice about the Gatsby is that you have to pay an extra dollar for cheese and an extra dollar for pickles.  Seems to me that a burger joint that charges $8-$10 for a burger would include these items.  I understand it with items like bacon. Nonetheless, after asking for it cooked medium-rare it was cooked to perfection and the fries that came with it were enjoyable albeit a tad over-seasoned.  Service was kind of spotty for my party.  Our server was friendly, but we didn't seem to see her much.  One person in my party ordered some sliders sans cheese only to get them with cheese.  Our server took the order back to the grilling station only to have the cook peel the cheese off the sliders and then send them back out.  Overall, the product seems a bit overpriced to me, although I give credit to Gatsby's for the use of fresh, whole ingredients.  I'm surprised in reading other reviews that only a few people mentioned the accident waiting to happen, otherwise known as the greasy floor.  Minus one star for feeling like I was taking my life into my hands by traversing this grease rink.  Plus one star for being able to essentially be able to moon walk to my table.  Me thinks the vents above the grills need to be working overtime to alleviate this situation.  Come to Gatsby's for one of the best burger's this side of the West Egg, but temper your expectations.  This place is just A-OK.
<review# 1687,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/1/2010,1/19/2011,702,960,16,24,24>Came here for happy hour the other day. It ends at 6:00 pm. All I can remember is that well drinks are $3 and you can order small plates for $5. We tried the fried green tomatoes ($5) as I remember reading a book of the same title when it was trendy way back when and wondering what the heck they tasted like. These were tart, lightly crumb-coated served over a aioli-resembling sauce. In a word: delish.They even have Olympia on tap for $2! And hey, it's not half bad. (I still have my 'Olympia on Tap' neon beer sign at home. Found it at a garage sale for $25.)I love my vodka tonics. So you can imagine my joy and happiness when I learned that their tonic water is created on the premises. Yes! Homemade tonic water! A first for me, but definitely not the last. Refreshing without the bitter aftertaste. Lots of attention to detail when it comes to the decor. From the metallic chandelier hanging over the bar area to the red velveteen wall paper, even the red cocktail napkins with their logo gives this place just the right touch. You don't come here for a cheap night out. The drinks are meant to be sipped, the dark wood and classy interior relax the senses and the mini plates of food should be savored instead of inhaled (like a basket of fries).Oh yes, I'll be back! The tonic water alone is worth the trip.

We slider'd.This was my first time here although I've passed it by on 2nd Saturdays here & there, but never quite made it through the front door.We sat out on the patio facing Faces, but it was a bit windy last evening and we ended up taking our drinks inside.  It has a very cool vibe and was lounge-y as expected.  We decided to try the Chicken Curry Spring rolls and the Lamb sliders.   I was a little iffy on the sliders as I'm not really a lamb person as I find it to be a bit gamey.  Unfortunately, I could only take a few bites as it was just that.  That's not the Lounges fault, next time I will order what I know and like.  The rolls on the other hand where very good!  They were served with a ginger-jalapeño ponzo sauce.  I would definitely order the rolls again.  I would also like to try the fried mac n' cheese next time.The staff was very attentive and it was much appreciated.  All in all, a good time.

<review# 1690,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2010,5/10/2010,244,170,3,9,7>Okay, so I'm home starving and browsing Yelp to see where I'm going for dinner that's close to home. I don't want fast food and want something close by but am completely drawing a blank. I see the great reviews for here and see there are all 5 star reviews. I figured I better check it out. I call at 8:13p to see what time they close for the night. 8 o'clock the man tells me. Me: Oh, okay, thank you. El Pollo: Did you want to get something to eat?(I can't remember exactly what he said, but this was the jist) Me: I did, but since you're closed, I'll try another day. EP: No, what would you like? Me: Well, I've actually never been there before, what do you recommend? So he went on to tell me that they're known for their chicken, and everything is good. He tells me they have single meals, family sized meals, nachos, enchiladas with red or green sauce, etc. I'm shocked by  what I'm hearing. Where did customer service like this go?!?! I go with a 2 piece meal w/ rice & refried beans and the carnitas Happy Nachos (thanks A.K.). I tell him where I'm coming from and he says that's fine. I show up and it's him and another lady, bagging up my meal. I'm greeted like I'm a regular there, so warm and friendly. Another customer walks in and he's definitely been here before. He asks if he's too late and is told of course not and places his order. I'm really interested in their "coleslime". It's like coleslaw, but instead of mayo, it has lime juice and other seasoning. I dove into the nachos tonight and at first thought it would've been nice to have a slice of lime to squeeze on the pork. However, when i bit into the cheese and pork covered chip, I realized this meat had been marinated well and had the hint of citrus I was looking for, built in. There was guac instead of sliced avocado on the nachos, but that's no complaint. I took a bite out of my chicken leg and really liked the grilled/smoky taste. This could definitely become a local haunt for me! I'm still just blown away by the service of the man who answered the phone.

Lots of big tables.The service was ok - you had to grab them when they were walking by..otherwise you would not get to order anything.Good Pho, good calamari and excellent spring rolls. I will be back!I did bring a dessert from the nugget and they offered to put it in the fridge for me. At the end of the meal they brought it out with a candle and everyone sang happy birthday. That was really nice - I did not even have to ask if they could do that.

And aside from the limited parking, THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! Sumatran Coffee? Yes please. Now, when I ask for coffee, I'm expecting your average 6oz or so sized mug. This tankard that appeared magically before me? I probably could have swam laps inside of it. I wasn't interested in the specials that day, so I went for the roast beef hash. My precious went for the special - vege biscuits and gravy (mushroom gravy). The portion that was laid down before me? More than ample. Everything about it was good - the toast, the rosemary potatoes, the meat itself, the eggs... oh emm gee. The tastes were awesome.The biscuits and gravey with mushrooms (and no sausages, vege all) were delish!Overall, its a little pricey, but the food is worth it. Also, they only take cash or credit, but they have an ATM on site. So that's a useful option.All in all, I'll be back. Just you wait.
<review# 1693,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2010,5/7/2010,247,159,10,33,28>I wanted to wait to write this review until I tried several of the dishes here. I have dined at Anatolian Table three times now. I have never left hungry, disappointed, or from the side door of shame as the owner jokingly suggests. So, here I sit still thinking of my meal last night. It kind of blew me away. 13 years, 13 years since I have been back to Turkey to see my family. 13 years since I have eaten Chupra (Sea Bream of the Aegean Sea), 13 years since I have eaten proper Iskender Kebab (a lovely lamb dish smothered in tomato and yogurt sauce named after Iskender aka Alexander the Great) , 13 years since I had good Manti (pillowy soft hand made lamb raviolis) not made by me, 13 years I have been searching high and low, west of the Mississippi River and all along the western United States and Canada to find authentic Turkish Food. Guess what! Eureka I found it in California! The whole night last night as I dined on my lovely grilled fish of perfection I would close my eyes from time to time and could almost feel as if I was back on the shores of the Bosphorus, or on the Aegean Coast.  It was so lovely; the salad accompanying it was perfect as well.  Tears came to my eyes.This is the place that I have been searching for 13 years.  Authentic Turkish Cuisine, prepared as it should be: made daily with fresh quality ingredients, with a passion and attention to detail that makes it your own.  There is a saying in Turkey that my mother used to always tell me when we cooked together and I complained about the amount of time and effort it took to make meals.  She would say, "Elif, Turks don't cook food, we get cooked with the food."  She is of course, as always, right.   The owner clarifies his own butter, bakes his own bread in house daily, the desserts are made fresh daily, his walk in only contains whole vegetables and meats, and he is looking for a buffalo milk supplier so that he can make kaymak, a decadent and surprisingly elegant thick cream not unlike Devonshire cream.  Nothing is preserved or ready made.  This place passes the Dolma test as many of you have seen as my indicator of authenticity for any restaurant claiming Middle Eastern or Mediterranean cuisine.  The husband wife team who own and operate Anatolian table have successfully brought a little part of Turkey to Sacramento. I really recommend this restaurant to anyone who really wants to know and understand Turkish Cuisine. Tell them Elif sent you.
<review# 1694,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2009,5/6/2010,464,293,6,20,10>A friend of mine moved to Sacramento a little less than a year ago and over the past 10 months or so I have been responsible for introducing him to Midtown food and drink. I enjoy this task because I am like what Gertrude Stein once called Ezra Pound: "the village explainer." Jamie's didn't come to mind until recently. It is very easy to forget about because it is so deep down Broadway, tucked between the Section 8 housing and News 10 TV Studio; out of sight, out of mind if you will. After the appearance on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, however, it has been hard NOT to think about. I finally drug my friend over a couple weeks ago and as I was sitting at one of the low to the ground tables waiting for our drinks (Anchor Steam, Bass Ale and whiskey), I said to him, "this place is so old school and great, but there are so many great spots like this in SF that I doubt you will be THAT impressed."Yes - I did the dreaded "if I were in the Bay Area" comparison. But it's true - SF has so many old school Irish pub / restaurants that serve good whiskey and sling mean hash. Regardless, we are lucky to have Jamie's because it is really the only place like this that we've got and I would say their food far surpasses most of the comparable SF establishments.Jamie's is a bar and restaurant and in my mind, never combines the two. I have never sat at the bar and drank while also eating. I either go there to drink at the bar OR to eat at a table. Their clam chowder is hands down the best in town. Not too thick, not too runny. Finely minced carrots, celery and onions. Never fishy or too rich. The Garlic Steak Sandwiches have been mentioned so many times that I am hesitant to bring them up again, but they are so damn good I would be a fool not to! Just share a plate with someone and you will be in food heaven.Their specials are usually amazing, too. I had the Shrimp Louie once and the house made Thousand Island was the best I have ever had, with a crisp lemon flavor. So, if you have a friend in Sac from out of town, consider taking them to Jamie's. I really cannot see how you could go wrong.

This has been a total experience of pain and pleasure. The wonderful counter girl scoops about 1/2 gallon of ice cream into this container as I remember that I am lactose intolerant and this is not going end well. After a cup of hot fudge and real whipped cream, nicely chopped nuts (as the sham-wow guy says, "you are going to love these nuts), and of course a fake maraschino cherry, the masterpiece is done. I paid my 9 bucks, tip included and walked to my car. I couldn't wait and scooped 5 bites consecutively into my mouth and instantly made all the fillings in my mouth hurt. Damn it was worth it. Then i keep eating and i get a mini brain freeze. Definitely worth it. I am done now. I cant believe i ate the whole damn thing. It was the size of a toddlers head. It was sooooo good. Now my stomach is starting to hurt as that being lactose intolerant part is kicking in. Thank God I live alone, but damn was it worth it. GO HERE if you like ice cream.

<review# 1697,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2010,5/2/2010,92,271,5,5,5>The taps were a flowing and the Belgians graced us with their sacred ambrosia. Vegetation lay scattered along the alley ways, only leaving traces of the past, and sparking the birth of a new food commodity. We came, we sought, we glutton-ed.     The war party gathered at sunrise to greet the new day and prepare to seek out new spoils. We traveled on the majestic Amtrak, and set sailed on our epic voyage. Many of us were still tired and began to speak in tongues as a means to find common ground. It was only when I discovered a bottle of Corona that I gained insight in what awaits us over the horizon.     We traveled down an alley filled with many flora, vegetation, and my peoples. Upon passing the cross way where the tower of untold vegetables stood, we arrived at the Oakland Grill. We pillaged, greeted a mafia member loading "vegetables" into his silver Volkswagen Beetle, then proceeded to Jack London Bay. The local beasts of this region, which they called "Pee johns" were feasting on a local delicacy which my peoples in the gold country refer to as Pizza. This is where we came to an epiphany. Why not capture the elusive beasts known as the "Pee johns," and use them for toppings for the Pizza.     We were in search for the golden fleece, but the legend of the sought after goat show eluded us. The party crossed through a crowded trench filled with mushrooms, chocolate, bread, and salted pig parts. Many temptations lured us to stay in this Labyrinth, but our wills were strong, and not even the street sirens had the enchantment to keep us there.     Our Journey led us to many places such as Vesuvio, Naia, Columbus, and Rogue's before we could reach the cave of the Belgian god's known as La Trappe. Some of us had discovered our fathers, watched a local activity known as Baseball, learned about Mystics of Scientology, communicated with the Chewbaccans, became Disney characters, and discovered John Lequizamo making balloon animals as "The Violator."Some Highlights:1. Yves: Learning to speak Japanese well enough to get a 2 for 1 discount on riding the Ferry.     2. Katie: "Taste the Rainbow" is code for "Watch out for the Laser Beams!"3. Eduardo: God loves Belgian Beer4. Mike: A woman will show you her cleavage if it involves a camera and a few drinks.5. Joe: Adding salt to your pig part will make people line up to get a piece of your delicious goodness. 6. Whitney: Lying to Merchant's will make them feel less pleasant after forcing them to give you a sample of their entire store.
<review# 1698,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/6/2010,5/1/2010,518,148,5,9,8>3.5 stars. ALMOST 4 stars. Maybe next time. The great thing about dining with a group is getting to travel around the menu tasting this and that. This is what I did today with Hubby and a group of lovely friends. Lots of good food and great wines. First off, the interior is upscale comfy. Not pretentious. Great for a business meeting, although the overhead music seemed a little loud. If you're aware of the background music, it's not in the background anymore. Here's what we had: Salt Cod Fritters - Hubby said they were fancy fish sticks. I gotta agree with him. Bruschetta - My fave dish of the day. Grilled garlic rubbed bread, crushed chickpeas and rapini with a chili oil. Was really, really good. The chili oil gave it a little kick at the end. Could eat an order of this with a glass of wine (or two!) for a meal. Seriously! Fritto Misto - Standard fare. Although they did include sliced jalapeno peppers which was a nice touch. Insalata di Salmone - Kind of a deconstructed salad of salmon, potatoes, beets, capers and egg on arugula. Never saw a beet. It was ok.Meatball Sandwich - Liked this a lot. Could have used a tad bit more provolone. Funghi Pizza - By the time I got to the pizza, it had cooled off but was still quite delicious. The smoked mozzarella gave it a nice smoky flavor. Carbonara - Good, but hard to compare to the real thing I had in Italy at the restaurant that created this dish. This interpretation had red onions that I didn't love. Tagliata - This was a grilled skirt steak that I found a little chewy but had great flavor. Valdostana Burger - Hubby thought this was a little over-seasoned. I really liked the fries that were on the side. I'm a fry connoisseur, so I give these fries my stamp of approval. Melanzane e Olenta al Forno - If you love eggplant (and I do!), this was a great dish. It was served with a creamy polenta baked with fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce and fresh parmesan. Fab! We ordered every dessert on the menu, but by then believe it or not, I was pretty full, so I didn't partake in all the deliciousness. I heard lots of yummy noises coming from every side of the table, so they must have been good! Service was attentive if not a teensy bit hovering. Certainly did not spoil the ambiance or the parade of incredible dishes that kept arriving at the table. Had a wine aficionado at the table who ordered two amazing reds and a white that I liked a lot. So into the food, I totally forgot to see what we were drinking other than I know the reds were from Italy and were quite good. Solid, almost 4 star experience. Have a feeling I'll be back and giving it 4 stars soon!
<review# 1699,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,5/12/2014,313,152,29,33,26>I've eaten Pho all over California and up and down the mother land, Vietnam and I can honestly say that this place has the best pho in the world well at least my world. See the problem with pho is that most people think that they can make it better by putting MSG in it and not think that the customer knows and to add a side note adding trendy ass marketing to your pho bowl, like it's pho real, its phoking good just makes me believe that your pho is pho phake. Back to the MSG dilemma. You know when pho has MSG in it because all of a sudden you get redonkulously thirsty an hour later like you ran a marathon in the desert and all you to had to drink was black coffee. Then your face gets all ashy because of the dehydration, like you;ve been running laps inside a volcano and got covered with ash.Then you get this pasty feeling in your mouth and your boobs get all sore. Ok maybe not everyone has sore boobs but I'm just trying to explain that MSG has real side affects. Pho in my eyes should do these things for you to be considered awesome. 1. Help you get over a hang over or a cold2. Not make you feel all weird after an hour or two.3. if it's good stuff two hours later your hungry again4. Have enough meat and beef balls. I hate places that give you three slices of thin ass meat and one meat ball sliced in half, seriously? wenesday, thurs, fri (wtf)5. clear  your nasal passages better than a netty pot. Pho Xe Lua, I can say has no MSG to my knowledge and gives you reasonable portions for the amount of money you pay for each bowel. I would highly recommend this place to the pho lovers of the world. Ps. I know I spelled bowl wrong but bowel seems so much more fun to say in a sentance.
<review# 1700,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2013,5/11/2014,202,116,12,17,15>I'm not normally a fan of chain restaurants, especially one set in a mall. I scoff at unlimited breadsticks, speed past Applebee's, and wouldn't step foot in tacky orange Hooters (ok maybe I'd go to Hooters once in awhile).But Seasons 52 is different. The upside of a chain is that they have a formula for success, and here they execute it well. Walk in and you won't have any idea you're connected to a mall. The atmosphere is upscale and relaxing. Staff is courteous, professional, and friendly every time, especially the wait staff.Every recipe is tried and tested. I've never had anything bad here. Ingredients are fresh and they have seasonal selections. The flatbreads are super-thin so they won't ruin your appetite - I highly recommend. The truffle salad is my favorite salad ever, seriously! I've liked every fish entrée I've had. The dessert deal is kind of cool - they bring them out to you, shine a fancy light on each one while explaining them, and then no waiting, you just get to grab one or two (or three). Dessert is not bad, but not my favorite part of the meal here, probably because they do keep the portions smaller. The big difference between Seasons 52 and most other chain restaurants is that here, everything is somehow kept relatively light and healthy, but all without sacrificing taste! No 1000 calorie salads, deep fried or heavy anything!A great cocktail list and wine selection too, all featured on their oversized menu. Ask about the wine flight + flatbread special served every day before 4:30 pm. Next time you're thinking about going to a nice dinner, keep this place in mind.Also, free valet!
<review# 1701,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,5/10/2014,466,199,15,20,21>If you prefer the Costco-style pet stores, this may not be for you. Incredible Pets has a smaller selection but what they carry is quality stuff. I switched my kitties to Blue Buffalo dry food and Incredible Pets carries all the sizes and varieties and the prices are in line. I've had nothing but great service from the young staff and they humor me when I joke around with them like a crazy old dad at Olive Garden (if you know, you know).A big bonus for dog-owners is that they have samples of dry dog food - up to two per customer. No one likes to buy a 30 lb. bag of food that their pet refuses to eat. They also carry frozen and freeze dried pet food.I use the Breeze system litter box and have finally found a local store that carries the pellets and pee pads so I don't have to make the trek out to Natomas. Incredible Pets is conveniently located next to Trader Joe's, so when you're done buying healthy food for your human family, pop in and buy some healthy grub for the furry members of your family.
<review# 1702,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,5/9/2014,1137,179,22,28,25>HOLY MOLY...I'm usually never this quick to review a place I just tried for the first time but I got to say...best sushi place I have experienced so far in the area I live in. Located in Woodland and kinda near Costco, Jinju Sushi is by far a great place to satisfy your sushi cravings and hands down great service overall. Though this place is quite small for a sushi restaurant, they also have a back room for larger parties as well. My boyfriend and I decided to go here for our 9th Valentine's Day together because it was recommended by one of our friends. I was surprised that I never heard of this place before, but I'm so glad we decided to go :) The whole place was decorated with heart balloons too :PThe boo and I arrived at Jinju Sushi around 7pm on Valentine's Day (a Friday night) and it was quite packed already especially for a tiny place. We were actually seated instantly cause they had two spots at the bar. My bf and I didn't mind since we were hungry anyways and we though..."might as well sit somewhere different" :P Though the prices were a bit on the pricey side, I thought it was definitely worth it. "You get what you pay for"...and we definitely got A LOT for what we paid for ;) The boothang and I ended up starting off with a Sake Bomb ($4 each)...downing it like it's no big thang. Then we decided to order 4 rolls to share: *Lobster Roll ($15)- It was something unique and interesting! But I liked it a lot especially with the spicy garlic sauce, balsamic glaze, and sweet chili sauce that complimented the lobster ;)*Main Street ($13)- This one was good but don't think it was anything extremely special compared to the other rolls. *Big Papa ($13)- One of my favorites! Big Papa was for sure BIG alright! ;) Hehe fried in panko and filled with salmon, crab, amazing sauce and the bottom of the plate was layered with creamy crab salad that was underneath the rolls.*Woodland Roll ($15)- Another one of my favorites! This roll is also huge! Each roll had an ENORMOUS spicy tuna piece on each of them. So you can definitely say you get a lot of meat in your mouth for this roll ;)While eating our rolls, the babe and I decided to get a large hot sake for about $7. We took shots throughout our dinner. It was a good thing we sat at the bar cause we started talking to one of our chefs that served us (His name is Qui btw). He was really cool and friendly. So awesome that we ended up taking another sake bomb with him, another chef at the bar, and a few other customers around the bar. After more eating and more talking happened with the chefs, we decided to go for another sake bomb...that happened...and then another sake bomb happened unexpectedly because Qui ordered it for us. Gabe (my bf) and I ended up meeting the other two chefs that were working as well (Young and John). We also got 2 chocolate covered strawberries and Strawberry Sorbet Champagne. Both were quite good especially the champagne; something different. I'm not sure if it was a Valentine's Day special because we ended up not being charged for that. Let's just say Gabe and I had a really good time at this restaurant. With amazing/fulfilling sushi and a total of 4 Sake Bombs (3 with the sushi chefs), I would for sure come back to this place again. Gabe and I got the check and we ended up paying half-off for each sake bomb and also getting 2 sake bombs for free! Oh and we were charged for "Love" apparently...for free though (refer to my receipt picture). Oh, what a good night indeed :)Shout-out to Qui for making sure we enjoyed our meal and everything was alright. And also just having a good time with us ;)Jinju, I'll be seeing you again ;)
<review# 1703,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,5/8/2014,1059,313,18,32,28>This place is fairly new and I really wanted to try it.  I walked in for lunch and the first thing I noticed was that polished floor.  Not the place for me to wear high heels immediately came to mind because I can see myself just sprawled on the floor while on my way to the table.  Don't get me wrong, I can be pretty graceful but I'm a graceful klutz that needs to know risks involved and now I know it's a flats type of place.Enough about the floor...The place was pretty empty around lunch and that's just the way I like it.  I asked our waitress for suggestions because I wanted more than one thing and she suggested the bento box.  I got a California roll, sashimi and nigiri.  Delicious!! The person with me got the bento box too but they chose the California roll, sesame chicken and beef teriyaki. I tasted the chicken and beef and they were delicious too.  This comes with a little salad and white rice. We also got a spicy tuna roll to share and I really liked it.  Our waitress was very nice and very friendly.
<review# 1704,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2014,5/7/2014,222,224,14,20,19>I've been itching to try this place out! After surviving my first bridal expo with family, the bride to be suggested we have dinner here. I can't tell you how excited I was when I realized this was the spot Yelper buddy Johnna frequents! Since we got here before the dinner rush, we walked in and saw a sign that said we needed to place our orders at the bar. Line went quicker than I expected, leaving me at the register struggling to come to a decision (I can get indecisive at restaurants I've never been to before).  I decided to go with the avocado cheeseburger with garlic fries.  Before looking around for a table, we stopped by the bar to get water.  I ain't mad at a place that let's you get your own water, especially if you're like me and drink at least 3-4 glasses with a meal!We found a nice table and it was only a mere 15-20 minutes from the time we ordered that our burgers came out!  Love it, quick service!!  I was really diggin the pub atmosphere that this place had going on.  The burger?  Oh.my.god.  I am in love.  I seriously wish I lived closer because then I'd probably come every day.  My cheeseburger was cooked absolutely perfectly, so juicy and tasty with fresh avocado!! The garlic fries were delicious as well!  I was thrown off by the lack of parsley, but they had the right amount of garlic-y goodness that I don't think I could come here and NOT order them with my burger.Love this place.  Love it.  Instantly became my favorite burger joint.
<review# 1705,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2013,5/6/2014,1214,515,16,16,12>What was a five star review on our first visit, is now four stars. Our first visit is outlined in detail below, followed by the most recent experience.Having wanted to try a new gourmet Mexican restaurant (after all, there aren't any in Sac that I know of?) that recently opened in our hood, we called on a recent Saturday night and were told by the owner that they might have a table around 7:30pm. As a favor, she agreed to call me when the table was ready for us. That turned out to be a one-star bonus as we were able to kick back at Bonn Lair in grand style, enjoying foamy pub pours and sporting beer mustaches whilst awaiting our phone call.As sure as 49ers drink & drive, our call came at 7:29 pm and we were off, dashing across Folsom Blvd and only suffering a glancing blow from a distracted texting driver. What a nice surprise to walk in to the tune of "Girl From Ipanema" as I ushered my Brazilian-born sweetie through the front door. Yup, live lounge music as smarmy as it gets, and just perfect for the occasion.The new owner/chef, originally from Tequila Mayahuel, has done a fantastic job in creating dishes celebrating Mexican cuisine and heritage, artfully arranged and exploding with interesting and exciting flavors.  We decided on the nopales verde soup and the arrachera steak, based on the extensive explanation from our Mexican-born waiter, Eduardo.The soup was delicious, with a savory, clear broth accented by the flavors of the ingredients. While the steak arrived slightly under cooked (by my standards, a medium rare is a bit more red and striated), it was a large (10 oz) serving, under slices of marinated nopal and queso. En mi libro, a taste worthy and tender arrachera requires a day or two marinating in Mexican beer and lime juice, and this dish did not disappoint.Decor? the new paint and interior are very inviting. Casual yet nicely done. Friendly staff, delicious food. Desserts? We were too full. That's what "next time" is for, si?FOLLOW UP VISIT: We had been jonesing for another meal at Cielito Lindo, so we coaxed our friend (and Mexican dining aficionado) to join us. Second experience didn't live up to our expectations: the soup was a tad off, and the service, from a different waiter, was below par. Still enjoyed our meal, but hoping next time it's back up to "stellar!"

No need to worry thought, this night was equipped with Free Complimentary Valet Parking. :)Upon entering the restaurant, I was blown away be the remodel.  So distracted, that I didn't hear the lovely host behind the counter ask me how I was doing tonight.  The décor was warm and welcoming. Dark woods with a rustic, almost country feel.  I apologized to the hostess and told her that I was doing excellent.  I gave her my name and was approached by the manager.  He welcomed us and we were promptly seated.The seating was a mixture of booths, tables and chairs and tables with both chairs and bench seats.  Don't get me wrong, the bench seats are basically booth seats.  The chairs came in two varieties: arm chairs and standard chairs.  Both were comfortable and fit with the décor.I remember the manager suggested I order the fritters.  Looking over the menu made me tummy anxious and my mouth drool.  I was looking for the fritters, when I spotted it on the menu, under Appetizers.  Corn & Crawfish Fritters......I love crawfish!  We ordered the fritters and Smoked Trout & Artichoke Dip.The menu has something for everyone.  I don't know how they do it, but they cover all the bases with selections of:  Salads, Sandwiches, BBQ, Vegan....yes Vegan and Homemade Sides.  I ordered the three item combo and chose:  Tri-Tip, Pulled Pork and Hot Links.  My sides were: Grilled Corn and Collard Greens.Corn & Crawfish Fritters: 5 Stars....Simply Wonderful!Smoked trout & Artichoke Dip: 4 Stars.....because I found a bone :(Tri_Tip:  5 Stars.....beautiful ring of smoke, tender and flavorful.Pulled Pork:  5 Stars.....tender and moist with a nice amount of smoke and pork flavors.Hot Links:  3 Stars.....not HOT, but medium heat.  Perfectly smoked link had excellent flavor.Grilled Corn: 3 Stars....grilled corn.Collard Greens: 5 Stars.....Simply Wonderful!The Grunter: 5 Stars....Banana pudding, vanilla wafers, sliced bananas & whipped cream. Served family style....need I say more??!!!Cheese Cake:  5 Stars....Fresh and light in flavor. Crust must have had caramel in it.  I can still remember that wonderful taste :)  Gold Pig on top....Hmmmm...Overall:  5 Stars....this will be a very hot spot.  Once you get inside, you'll know what I mean.  It just fits....and makes you want to hang out.  There is a small patio in front with pillars of fire to supply the warmth on cool nights.  The bar is wonderfully stocked and the barkeep creates elixirs that will remind you of SLS.  The staff is super friendly, knowledgeable and professional.  Don't be afraid to ask, they are all very approachable, from the Hostess to Wait staff to Management.Did I mention they smoke all their meats out back, so you wont smell smoky when you leave...Simply Wonderful!!!!

That's the best way I can describe Vampire Penguin despite one picturing either a) a goth club, b) some garage band or c) a Japanime penguin parasite. Located in a shopping center that has other restaurants and businesses, you order either a small or large size and can choose between flavors such as:* Green tea* Mango* Coconut * Taro* Chocolate* LycheeI'm sure the flavors vary, but the cool part is that it isn't just ice with syrup on it. This is frozen yummy stuff that they shave! The texture is unlike anything I've ever tried. Really melts in your mouth and you don't feel bloated - unlike a visit to the ice cream parlor. With a small ($3) you get one free topping, with a large ($5) you get two (or maybe three?) toppings. You can pay extra for more. Seating consists of tables and chairs and even though it does get crowded, people tend to move through here fairly quickly. Great presentation, and it seems like a good choice for the calorie-conscious!

Not gonna lie, I was a teeny bit wary about what the food would be like considering the lunch buffet was only $6.. But it's actually quite good! If you're starving by lunch time, you can definitely get your moneys worth from the selection that they have to offer. I've been there a few times already and the usual items seem to be: egg flower soup, honey walnut chicken (my favorite!), beef & broccoli, orange chicken, salt and pepper fried fish, fried chicken wings, some type of vegetable stir fry, egg rolls/potstickers (they run out fast so get em when they add em) fried rice, chow mein, salad, and some fruit. The good thing is they're always putting out new, fresh food since it runs out fast especially during lunch. So you probably won't be stuck with soggy fish or sad looking wilted broccoli. Quite a steal for the price!

The manager came over and was gracious with the explanation and apology. Cool no issues there--- Nothing to see here folks keep it moving!

The vibes range from edgy, boho, sultry to cute and all pieces have a wonderful femininity about them. I can tell that lots of thought was put into the selection by the awesome owner, Vanessa. Seriously, I almost don't want to review because the less people that know, the more product for me (bwahaha). Yeah, I said it. But I couldn't let you down, Yelpers. I love to review good places.Boutiques are generally heart-breaking because they carry such fab items... that is, until the dreaded price tag flip. You know what I'm talking about. I can only pretend about 3-5 times that $90 for that piece of cheap ass cloth is no big deal. After that, peace out. It makes the shopping trip such a drag. These qualms are true of many boutiques, but not at Heart. Don't go nutso thinking the prices are comparable to F21 or some other cheap clothing store. The costs are reasonable and right on target for the quality and style you get.  I bought this aMAzing sheer, aquamarine, fully micro-pleated, one bell sleeve, floor-length dress (sorry, I wanted to be detailed 'cause I love it so much) for a wedding I was attending in Hawai'i. I got tons of compliments on it. You'd never guess it came from a tiny boutique in Sacramento and for $60!! Whaaaaat?! YES. Yeh-heh-hessss.  Click to see a photo that doesn't do it justice: yelp.com/biz_photos/_VTfOn another occasion, I bought a black, backless peplum style dress for a mere $50. I wore the hell out of it in Vegas and it made me feel drop dead gorgeous. It was a definite neck-breaker, lemme tell ya. And I can't forget about my pleated polka dot top with the Peter Pan collar and 3/4 princess sleeves, either. Swoooon. (Yes, I have a thing for pleats.)  Wishing I had a better pic of this beaut: yelp.com/biz_photos/_VTfWhether you buy clothing, jewelry, accessories or shoes from Heart, practice these two words: "thank you."

<review# 1712,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/4/2011,7/17/2012,53,209,6,5,8>Mo Mo's meat is definitely the real deal, as evidenced by the proprietor standing over 2 smoking kettle grills right in the parking lot.  I ordered a combo of chicken, tri-tip, and ribs, which is more than enough meat for 2!  The 'Q is very good, moist and full of smoky flavor, not at all dry (a fault which dooms many practitioners of the craft).  The sauce is a bit sweeter and thicker than I like, but I acknowledge that there are many viewpoints in this category.  It is a good sauce overall, well-balanced and tasty nonetheless; I'll get it on the side next time.  I have to say that Mr. Mo Mo seems to be in full control of his smokers.The only two negatives on Mo Mo's?  First, there is absolutely nowhere to sit, so it's all strictly to go.  I was told they're working on this.  Second, and more important, the sides were just ordinary at best, under-seasoned and devoid of texture.  Them greens need some pork!  Overall, I would give them 3 1/2 stars, but the meat is really good...good enough to rate on the 4-star side.  A place worth revisiting, for sure.  I should add that the proprietors are super nice, friendly, and enthusiastic, a definite plus as well.  So, support your local 'Q!  If I find out you bypassed Mo Mo's in favor of Chili's baby back bullshit, I will liberally season your entrails with my proprietary blend of herbs and spices and grill them over oak wood for hours until tender!
<review# 1713,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2011,7/16/2012,1166,182,6,13,9>Writing this review's gonna be fun!!!I'm back in the Batcave, basking in the glow of, once again,  having a great-smelling dog with trimmed nails, and a wife content with the decision I made to take our 122 lb Black Lab, Vader, there. I have to admit that I was THIS close to not bringing Vader here. When I looked up how to get here, I saw that there were reviews available, so, curious, I read them. Holy crap, some were REALLY bad!!! What kept me on task was the fact that I had met the Owner, Pamela Demarest, at a networking group put on by one of my favorite people. This was an by-invitation-only select group, so, I knew Pamela must have something on the ball.  Honestly, I'm also courting Pamela for another by-invitation-only networking group I work with so, I figured, as a way to generate good will, why not take Vader there? Plus, I really liked her.. She was really cool.  I figured I had to find out for myself. On my way there, I had my son pull up Yelp reviews on my iPad. Again, some really bad reviews, but some really good ones as well. The good reviews outnumbered the bad reviews. Common themes were a vicious German Shepard no one could control, an out-of-control, narcissistic  owner who chases dissatisfied customers out into the parking lot while she berates them, and nicks on doges that are trimmed.Full of trepidation, I walked in with Vader. There was "evil" Pamela right there. There was also the "mean" German Shepard. I was prepared to hightail it out of there, as soon as I heard the first growl...   Nothing  could be farther from the truth. I had a GREAT experience. Pamela more than lived up to the class, professionalism, and expertise I saw in her when I first met her.She has a great staff. Friendly, accommodating, and they KNOW animals. There was a cat, so at ease it kept walking on the forms I had to sign.  She also asked me earlier for Vader's immunization records...Hello??? PetSmart doesn't do that!  There's also all kinds of cool pet foods and treats and odds and ends that I've never seen at any other store. I was instantly at ease when I saw Pamela, her receptionist and the amazing young lady who was to bathe Vader and trim his nails.   I left him there, feeling great about it.They called me at 1:30 pm , 30 minutes before I told them I would be by to pick him up. That was perfect because it was going to take be about that long to get there. I immediately called my wife and asked her to meet me there, because I wanted to "show off" to her a bit. (She had always handled our pets' affairs)  I knew she'd love the place. We both arrived at about the same time and I asked for Pamela as soon as I walked in, Pamela cane out, greeted us and out can Vader!!! Happy, content, and excited!   He smelled great !! He looked good, and they put a Halloween "costume" on him (Devil's horns). Ann picked up some doggy treats while there as well. The young lady  told me that, along with the bath and the nail clipping (she actually used a grinder, which is much better), she also brushed his teeth, and clipped hair that had grown adjacent to his pads to give him more traction. Cost: $38 for the wash/clip and $5.94 for the Chicken treats. Add tax and a $9 tip, and they charged the ol' Visa $53.40.  Ann said that that was in line with what PetSmart charges.  Again, she was REALLY happy.. Vader was happy. So, I'm golden!! I don't know, nor do I care about what may have been written before, but as for MY experience, this place isn't LaunderDog & More, it's Launderdog IS More!!! We're going back!!You all know that I don't give out 5 star ratings very often, nor very easily... This place deserves it!!Get here!!!
<review# 1714,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/14/2012,7/15/2012,299,309,4,12,9>All you can eat sushi BUFFET!!!  and when I say sushi, I mean the good stuff (not crab salad filled rolls, rolled with as much rice as they could possibly fit -trying to get you filled up quickly/cheaply).  They have the type of sushi bar with the boat that floats around with different plates of sushi rolls, nigiri, seaweed salad, or many other popular items.  They are always kept rolling full of everything, and I never have to wait long to pick up my favorite, salmon and tuna nigiri.  Where this place really shines though, is with their sushi chefs, who work behind the bar and are ready and happy to make something special for you.  They take your requests and quickly make it for you, and this can be anything from a plate of mixed sashimi, to some tempura, I even saw someone order raw oysters here!  Some have commented that the quality here isn't the best, but I actually think the quality of the food is pretty dang good (way better than some of the more pricey establishments you'll find in the downtown area) and I would give them about a 4/5.  The salmon here (my favorite) is excellent, as is almost every other sushi item, though I have to say the tuna they use isn't the greatest, and neither is the warm buffet food (the non-sushi food like fried rice and chow mein -but honestly, who really comes here for that?).At 13.95 for lunch, 17.95 for dinner, it can be a bit pricey, but that just means you have to eat your money's worth, and I'm okay with that.  And to be honest, anytime I go out for sushi, I already expect to be paying at least $20 anyways.  This place has quickly become my favorite sushi spot in the Sacramento area, and I'm quick to recommend it to anyone looking for sushi.  So if you've got the appetite, bring it to Fuji's, and they'll take care of you.
<review# 1715,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2012,7/14/2012,129,87,7,9,9>C'est Tres Bon! I hadn't been to La Bonne in a very long time...so I happened to be in the area for work today and thought "I want soup and a sammy!" What better place to get soup and a sammy than the soupe cafe?!Of course I got the French Onion soup. The huge croutons floating in the decadent broth of onions and herbs and the cheese....OH MY LORD THE CHEESE!!! The gruyere melted over the top of the soup to form a little cap of love that you break through to get to the goods below. Tons of onions...TONS OF ONIONS!!!!The sandwich is one of my all time favorites...Prosciutto and Brie on a toasty baguette. The bread is toasted but not hard. If their is one thing I flipping hate it's when you get bread on a sandwich that cuts the roof of your mouth open! This bread was so good that I was dipping my entire sammy into my soup. The brie was warm and gooey and wraps itself around the salty prosciutto like it's giving a bear hug.If you haven't had the pleasure of eating at this lovely little establishment I suggest you treat yourself. They have expanded their menu and always have a cool special on the little black/whiteboard.
<review# 1716,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/21/2012,7/13/2012,257,251,11,15,13>I walked in here with no expectations.  I really didn't think that I could given the low prices that they show on their menu.  I figured it would be your average restaurant, with average Italian food.What a pleasant revelation Vaiano was.  Very lovely, relaxed atmosphere and decor.  Excellent service.  And the food... well.  The food was pretty damn amazing.I tasted everything on the table.  So I'll just list off everything that was basically heaven in my mouth.  Or I should say heaven in the mouths of 9 people because everyone at our table was happy!Antipasti:Steamed clams (that broth was exquisite)Noci e Pancetta CrostiniCarpaccio de Salmone AffumicatoInsalata MistaEntrees:Pizza MargheritaPizza con Pancetta  (Bacon.  Nuff said.)TagliataLasagna Tradizionale Toscana (One word.  Beschemel!)Tortellini alla Boscaiola (The flavor was insane.)Dessert:Panna Cotta al Limone (like silk)Some other super rich chocolately deliciousness (I forget the name!)Another dessert with biscotti and chocolate and dessert wine (this one too)Honestly, for what we paid, I feel like we robbed the place.  I really cannot wait to go back.  I may leave the fridge open when I get home.  "Oops all the food went bad.  Where should we go?" Hmmm...
<review# 1717,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2012,7/12/2012,194,122,5,8,5>There's only one thing I get here and it's their bun bo hue, spicy beef noodle soup, because it is so freakin' good!  When I feel like having some simple and authentic bun bo hue, this is the only place I resort to in Sacramento.  For people unfamiliar with this soup, its distinct broth ingredients are lemongrass, beef, and Thai chili.  A bowl of bun bo hue includes beef shank slices, pork hock, and a cooked congealed pork blood cube.  If you're not open to the idea of congealed pork blood, I would just ask them to not include it in your bowl.  The bun bo hue is not too spicy, but just right.  I really like the bun bo hue here because the broth is rich in flavor and has just enough spices that I don't have to add any other seasonings to it besides lime. That's really because I love lime. It could probably do without it too.The interior of the restaurant is basic and the food is inexpensive.  Like other family-owned Vietnamese restaurants, the service is prompt and their is no kissing ass to the customers.  The servers won't tell you their name and try to convince you to have dessert or anything like that, and I like it like that when I'm hungry and just want to eat!  This is a good place to dine in if you don't want anything fancy, but still would like something good. I also place take-out orders for bun bo hue when I'm in a rush.  It tastes maybe even better when I take it home and reheat it!
<review# 1718,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/10/2012,7/11/2012,413,239,8,7,10>Came here during their happy hour and......it was nottttttttt crackin' with people. But that's not a bad thing the food spoke for itself. This place was bigger than I expected the bar is huuuge (s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com)  Came with a friend and it was funny as we were checking out the menu we hear a couple blasting their music off their phone ... maybe because there was no music and it at first it was awkwardly quiet. Maybe they got the point after that because music came on and the game was on tv. Service was great, their happy hour menu isn't too bad the prices are awesome. (s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com) Cool thing was you know most places with their deals or happy hour menu the portions are smaller? Well here they're the same amount/size as non-happy hour times. The gyoza (s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com) & seaweed salad (s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com) are good. With our big appetites we went for other rolls off of the happy hour menu we went with the two favs, Mom's roll: Spicy Tuna Fried Shrimp Avocado Tuna White Tuna Tai topped w/ Special Sauce Green Onion Massago and lightly (s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com) & O.M.G Roll : snow crab avocado spicy tuna topped with deep fried oysters green onions and house sauce (s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com). Ok... the mom roll was good but nothin to rant and rave although the O.M.G roll...literally saying OH MY GAWD!& laughin singing Usher's O.M.G (youtube.com/watch?v=1RnP) "There's so many ways to love yaGot me like, ooh myy gosh I'm soo in love,I found you finally, you make me want to sayOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,Ohh myy gosh"  & "This was something special; this was just like dynamite" those lyrics go perfectly hahaha We said they need to play this song every time servers bring this roll out to the tables since it is called the O.M.G roll. Alright thats a roll worth trying there are lots of deep fried oysters on top of this roll they don't bitch and give you like 5 little pieces. Ended that meal with their deep friend ice cream Uh-Mazing! (s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com) I believe is deep fried with panko which was different from other places I've had deep friend ice cream. Service good, happy hour good, and that O.M.G roll great. I'll be back...
<review# 1719,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/19/2007,8/9/2007,247,159,2,5,4>I went there today with some doubt in my mind.  A fast food chain of greek food.  How good could it be.  I was plesently puprised.  The Gyro is well seasoned, the Calamary tender and comes with three different dipping sauses.  All very well done and authentic.  Thier Pita bred is warm, soft and fluffy on the inside, a little crunchy on the out side.  The Gyros come with tomato and letuce the Tszatsziki is on side.  Just how I like it so you don't end up with a horrible mess again.  It is fresh and I enjoyed it.  Opa Opa has got nothing on this place.  I will return.  However the true test will be when I sample thier Spanikopita.  Yummy yummy in my tummy.Cool thing is you can also pre order or order online and come pick it up.  Nice for when you are pressed for time.

<review# 1721,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2007,8/7/2007,43,95,1,11,10>Esoteric is a tiny, cramped store in a run-down strip mall across the street from a monstrous Wal-Mart.  And that's the only bad thing I can say about it.  Everything else is good.While some independent used record and CD stores flaunt their hipness while offering the same old stuff (The Beat, I'm talking to YOU) Esoteric quietly stocks their shelves with obscure treasures and classics.  I've found George Jones, Buck Owens, Wanda Jackson, Hawkshaw Hawkins, Neko Case, Jim Reeves, Junior Brown...okay, you may not know or care for these artists, but this is my kind of music - and Esoteric has it.  They happily ordered a Flying Burrito Brothers CD for me after Virgin, Tower and Dimple all said they couldn't get it.  I've been satisfied with the prices, happy with the service and thrilled with the selection I've found at Esoteric.I don't visit as often as I'd like because I no longer work in the neighborhood, but a special trip may be in order.  I'm getting a hankerin' for some Loretta Lynn, and I know just the place to find it...
<review# 1722,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/28/2007,8/6/2007,42,78,3,6,3>I have been to Gaesorn's many times.  They have the best noodles in town.  Here is what happened the last time I went there with a group of friends:When we got to the Gaesorns and braved the tough downtown parking situation, we were met by the owner, Jerry and his wife Sara.  He is super friendly, and if he is in the right mood and not super busy, he may surprise you and pull out some magic tricks ( I am not kidding).  The funny thing about this guy is that he always walks around with 1 headset in one ear, a bluetooth in the other, and with his pda in his hand.  He is the "ubber-geeky" waiter/manager.The first course was fresh rolls with the traditional sweet and sour sauce.  The rolls were rolled tightly, filled with lettuce, mint leaves, cilantro and shredded carrots. They were good, but generally underwhelming.  Neither the cilantro or the mint was really present, so the sauce overtook most the flavor.  Then we had a choice of 3 main courses with steamed rice. First we had a very tasty dark mild curry sauce. It had strong flavors that mixed well with the generous portions of beef and broccoli mixed init. It was an unusual curry for those that frequent Thai, unlike the green, or yellow curry, this had a nutty flavor to it, with a slight hot finish at the end of the bite. Then came the drunken noodles, wide rice noodles sauteed in onion, basil, bell peppers with a mild chili paste, but just enough to engage the runny nose. I wassurprised at how much I like the stir-fried shitake mushrooms and green beans, they were tossed in an oyster sauce and both the beans and the mushrooms were still a tad crispy, which greatly enhancedtheir flavor and textural experience. Finally for dessert we were presented with a serving of sticky coconut rice with a sesame sauce, and accompanied by a small serving of custard. The sticky rice was true to its name and stuck together while emitting that strong coconut essence. The custard was mild, and enhanced the rice well.All in all a great meal. Gaesorns prides itself in using a lot of fresh spices and herbs and the freshest ingredients, and it shows. We all left very pleased.The only downfall to this restaurant is the poor location for nighttime dining, and the challenge in finding parking, but as Thai goes it ranks as one of the best in Sacramento for me, especially for their drunken noodles and the pad si ew.
<review# 1723,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2007,8/5/2007,292,112,4,19,16>I love this place; they saved my Dad's life when he only had a 30% chance.Plus they let me stay way past visiting hours in the ICU.  And the staff is friendly and on top of the care.  The facility is super clean and modern.VA hospitals get a bad wrap - they are not all created equal.
<review# 1724,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/14/2006,8/4/2007,2300,8619,1,8,4>This is one of those places that you always see the ads for in practically every in flight magazine. For years and years I'd those pictures of the super thick filet mignon, shaped perfectly, with a triangular wedge cutout, exposing a perfect medium rare. I'd then go on and read about the other top steak places around the country  and wonder if I'd ever visit all these places and their steak houses.I've actually driven by the RC  on Van Ness in SF tons of times but never dropped in, always thinking this was a destination I needed to make after flying somewhere. So after half a trip back west  from the Sierra Nevada mountains,  it was time to look for food. Roseville is one of those places where the gas is actually pretty cheap compared to the Bay Area so in doing that we also stopped for food. After finding that most of our options were closed, Ruth's Chris ended up being one of the last options standing. So in the vein of trying something new we went in.As you enter the space through the large double doors, the space is separated by a large podium/reception area in the front and the bar area to the right, which hides the dining room behind. The first unusual thing I picked up on was the fact that they asked for my name even though I said I didn't have reservations, which turned out to be something they give your server . Your server then refers to you very formally with Mr/Mrs/Miss throughout the dinner. Very interesting touch. Now when someone calls me Mr or Sir it makes me feel really damn old but as we were seated, I looked around I figured out why the formalities. Not only did I feel pretty young here, I felt pretty under dressed. I think for the most part my parents would feel young and I haven't seen so many suits and ties during dinner except in 50's television shows. So the vibe was very special occasion, celebration, power meal, etc. The place is dimly lit and with what you'd expect from a classic style steakhouse, there were deep earthen reds and brown accents, with the use of dark wood and other materials.As my dining partner was in the restroom, my server greeted me as "Mr" and proceeded to ask about beverage choices. Somehow we got to talking about the NFL, our teams and then the next thing I know , we're talking with the table of older couples behind me also. I guess the place isn't so stodgy after all!  After having perused the menu a little bit, our server gave us a bit of history behind the restaurant , the broiler used in the food preparation, and how the steaks were prepared with said broiler. So we decided on splitting the house salad, a huge-mungous baked potato, a filet mignon and the NY (which is my steak Holy Grail). The salad was pretty standard, not bad but not particularly memorable either. The potato was fairly tasty and I noticed that the bacon bits had this really interesting sweet carmelization to them which gave it a certain flair and I couldn't stop eating them. The same affinity could be said for my partner's devouring of the sour cream. The steaks however were definitely the highlight. Broiled at an extreme temperature with only, butter, salt and pepper, they both came out on our plates sizzling, perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I've had NY's cooked in many ways in many places and even though this was a pretty minimalist  preparation, it was still every bit as good as what I've had elsewhere. The dessert menu had quite a few items on it and we were feeling pretty full from the hearty steak and potatoes meal, but then the words "chocolate cake" popped up, splitting one was in our destiny. Unfortunately  the cake was felt to be somewhat average and since I'm not much of a dessert expert, I'm siding with the more professional opinion of my dessert counterpart :)I definitely felt well taken care of by the staff and at first felt like I was being too well if there is such a thing. Some of it has to do with the type of place it is and I think after a while I warmed up to it.  The prices here are definitely geared towards the business and special occasions crowd so I can't say that we escaped on the cheap. So if I balance that part, the dessert not being up to a connoisseur's liking, versus the excellent steak and service, I've landed on subtracting one star. Definitely not a place you'd go often unless you're made of money but definitely something you should check out if only to focus on the steak.
<review# 1725,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2007,8/3/2007,23,123,1,4,3>Ocean King is a Chinese seafood joint and a damn good one. Don't bother with food that didn't originate from the sea here - pick something perky and squirming out of the tanks, get it fried up, and enjoy an excellent meal.We began with the Manila clams in black bean sauce, our usual go-to dish for Chinese restaurant. These were great - the clams were huge, chewy and briney, just the way they were supposed to be. The black bean sauce was flavorful and rich but not too gloppy. Excellent.The chinese spinach in garlic sauce came out next, which was a tremendous pile of flash-stir fried greens in a delicate sauce. These were crisp, fresh, and incredibly green, and I ate tons of them, seeing as I adore well cooked vegetables. The portion was immense but we ate them all anyway.Next came an amazing version of salt and pepper squid, served in a massive portion. I was thrilled to find that they fried up the tentacles too - many Chinese places don't do that. The batter seemed to have some sort of five-spice infusion and was both flavorful and light as air. Combined with the sliced fried jalapeno and garlic, it was a delicious and deeply pungent dish, just the way I like it. My favorite dish by far was the garlic and scallion crab. This was a whole pre-cracked crab stir fried with a little bit of batter and a wonderful garlic and scallion sauce, which manages to infuse the entire crab, meat and shell, with flavor. I was in absolute heaven as I sucked, slurped, and cracked my way through the oversized beast that was placed upon the table. Warning: don't wear a nice white shirt here if you're going to order the crab, because you *will* end up wearing it. Ambience isn't half bad for a Chinese seafood house. The exterior looks small and rather bland but the interior dining room is rather nice, full of big tables with lazy Susan's perfect for big family banquets. The night we visited roving packs of screaming children were casing the place, but I think that kind of comes with the territory with most Chinese restaurants. Ignore it and focus on the food, or find somewhere quieter to eat. Service was quick and efficient. The food didn't arrive instantaneously as it does at some Chinese places I frequent, but that's probably due to the freshness of the seafood. (They do have it to pluck it out of the tank and kill it, after all.) Order a ton of food, sit back, and enjoy yourself.

NO. I kid you not dear yelpers.My friends and I picked up Yellow curry with chicken, rice, pad thai with shrimp, pad kee mao and spring rolls.Both noodle dishes were good, not great, but good (as a side not, I consider myself a pad thai connoisseur). The Spring Rolls were good - nice and fresh with good sized shrimp in them.The Yellow Curry was KICK ASS!!! It was spicy and had lots of veggies and chicken in it - good sized pieces but there was this incredible SWEET aftertaste that was so unique and so FABULOUSLY WONDERFUL - I cannot wait to have it again!!

<review# 1727,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2007,7/29/2007,22,46,1,8,2>What's this?  An independently owned, non-chain, upscale restaurant in Citrus Heights?  Yipee!!  Booyah (named after a traditional Wisconsin soup, apparently) has been open since last fall, and my husband randomly stumbled across it while running errands one day.  Not surprisingly, it's located in one of the city's many strip malls.  (is there anything in Citrus Heights that's not in a strip mall?)Apparently tons of other people have discovered the restaurant recently as well, after a positive review ran in the Bee.  We showed up at 7:30 on a Saturday night, and the place was teeming with people.  There was about a 30 minute wait for a table, and the waiting area is tiny (as is the restaurant itself).  Since there is no bar, the hostess/owner had wine lists ready, and took drink orders from those who were waiting for a table.  The wine list is small.  If you're hankering for a full-bodied zin, this is not the place to go, as there's not a zin to be found on the wine list.  I was a bit disappointed, but found something else that I could live with instead.Thankfully, the menu is much more diverse than the wine list.  Booyah offers everything: burgers, seafood, steak, & pasta.  My salmon was excellent, as was my husband's prime rib.  The service was outstanding as well.  The server was friendly and attentive, and the owner stopped by to offer dessert and chatted with us about the restaurant for a bit.The only real downside to the restaurant (aside from the limited wine selection) is the atmosphere.  Given the building that the restaurant is in and the limited space available, they've done a great job in making it feel like a nice restaurant (gorgeous stained concrete floor, neat paint color & art on the walls, modern wire track lighting above the dining areas).  But, the entire time I was eating, I could not shake the feeling that I was dining in a suburban strip mall.  Perhaps it was the old, not-quite-white dropped ceiling tiles, or the harsh fluorescent lighting near the front of the restaurant.  Or, maybe it was because two sides of the restaurant are windows that look out on an expansive parking lot, a very busy street, Togo's, and countless lighted signs.  It would be great if the ceiling was painted a darker color, to match the walls, and I'd love to see floor-to-ceiling fabric hung on at least one long wall of windows, to soften things up a bit and insulate diners seated along the windows from the "strip mall" feeling of the place.To sum things up: I'm really glad that this restaurant has opened, and expect that we'll be dining here regularly.  It's nice to have options beyond the usual chain-restaurant fare, and I love supporting local businesses.  I'd give Booyah 5 stars for the food & service alone, but given the small wine list and strip-mall feel, have to give it four stars.  Also - call ahead for reservations!
<review# 1728,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/16/2007,7/28/2007,41,154,11,3,5>Tried this place after the all day property lecture at McG's.  Just in case you don't know about property law, after 8 solid hours of hearing it the students who didn't manage to fall asleep had begun to plan their suicides (or at least their escape from the lecture hall; law students as a group don't have much common sense after all that legal training).So back to the restaurant.  I chose it because it received the most promising reviews on Yelp for any sushi place in Sacramento.  I had been anticipating the amazing and wonderful platter of sushi we would share, and the new and exciting tastes that would pass by our tongues that day.This was going to be the lunch/dinner (supper?) to remember for weeks. You can imagine my horror and disappointment when BFTB ordered chicken teriyaki.  Yes, I said CHICKEN TERIYAKI.  WTF?I didn't think anybody really ordered chicken teriyaki on this side of the mason-dixon line (where there are other things to get on the menu of a Japanese restaurant).  I thought it was on menus to let bad parents train their kids to be picky eaters.Anyway, I was constrained to order "sushi for one." On the bright side, it was really good.Thank you, Miyagi's.Oh, and I'm sorry, Meredith H.  I realize this probably counts as one of those reviews that treats those with differing opinions like they're idiots.  But I just had to get it off my chest.  I'm sure the chicken teriyaki was very good.  BFTB said it was.
<review# 1729,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/16/2012,2/17/2013,343,568,10,13,13>I love this place....it's like ultimate comfort food that doesn't make you feel like you want to die afterward.  It's a tiny spot with limited tables, so it's not a bad idea call ahead.  And the fact that is feels like you're walking into someone's house is actually why most people LIKE it....because in essence, you are!  The owners (husband and wife) are the only employees, so they are open only Thurs-Sat for dinner, and weekdays for lunch.  You actually see them preparing your meal after you order it...hearing the schnitzel pounded and all!  I was pleasantly surprised on my first visit to learn that Hungarian food is very similar to German food...but the exception here is that it's much lighter, not so heavy and dense.  The spatzle is amazing, and doesn't sit like a giant lump in your stomach for hours afterward as most spatzle can do.  The pork schnitzel is probably my favorite: pounded so thin you can cut it with a fork, breaded and fried.  The goulash is also delicious, with it's marinated beef so tender you barely have to chew it!  The chicken was also extremely tender and moist.  There are combos available for lunch too, but I don't work close enough to try them out....although when my husband goes for lunch get gets the sad panda look from me afterward.The three course meal includes bread and salad or awesome homemade soup, your entree, and a delicious not-too-sweet slice of apple strudel for dessert.  The price of a meal is around $12-16, so it's a great deal!  It is cash only, so be prepared!
<review# 1730,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/13/2012,2/16/2013,1134,510,15,12,13>Are you freakin' kidding me?!!!  This was the ULTIMATE,  the BEST, the QUICKEST DMV visit ever.  EVER!  (all caps is definitely deserved here)I made an appointment online for the next day.  There were plenty of available choices.  I took a chance and made it for 12:20pm on a Friday, hoping I could get it done during my lunch hour.  I arrived 10 minutes early.  The lot was full and there were plenty of people hanging out in the front smoking.  As soon as I walked in, I glanced around and got that icky feeling....like I was about to get in a welfare line on the first of the month.  I checked in, was given a number, and found the nearest empty seat, while trying not to make direct eye contact with anyone in particular.  No sooner than I pulled out my phone to "check in" on Yelp and FB, my number was called.  Really?  Cool.  Since I was there to renew my license I signed my paperwork, scanned my thumbprint, did a quick vision test, and gave them some money. "Window 1 for your picture."  Seemed like everyone else whose turn it was at a counter had some kind of issue that would not be solved in 5 minutes.  Suckers!  I smiled for the camera and was back in my car at 12:19pm.  Aside from the initial icky moment when I first walked in, the whole process took less than 10 minutes and was pain-free.  I wouldn't say the staff there are the friendliest people, but who cares?  They got me out of there in the most no nonsense and efficient manner.
<review# 1731,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/9/2012,2/15/2013,296,61,6,13,10>Took my dog in for the first time.  Got tired for paying $60 at PetSmart for his grooming.  Here they charged me $40 for shampoo & haircut.  He's a small dog so forty is much more reasonable. I know of a place that charges $30, but its in South Sac and they keep my dog all day and sometimes they fail to call to pick him up.  Bubbles & Bones were completely professional, asking me detail questions of what we service we wanted for my dog like how is tail hair should be cut, did you want to leave a mane on him, and brushing his teeth.The one thing that distinguish this dog grooming business from others for me is their attention to detail.  I had requested not to shave too close around his testicles as every hair cut he gets, he has razor burns and scoots his balls against the carpet afterwards.  This is first time hes razor burn free even when I given others the same instructions.They have a friendly staff and they truly show the love for animals.
<review# 1732,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/8/2012,2/14/2013,1934,564,10,15,10>It had been YEARS since I had been here.  I grew up down the street from the place and used to go here on a regular basis as a kid.Now days pizza seems so much more important to me...even though it probably was just as important years ago.I can't bring myself to give Dante's a 3 star review even though I really want to.  This is a family owned place and they do a really good job at what they do, so I guess that gives them the extra star.Why do I think about 3 stars?  Two reasons...one is price.  We went with another family tonight and we ordered two large pizzas, a salad, a personal pizza, some soda and a couple beers and you know how much that cost?  100 bucks.  Holy hell, thats a crap load of money for a couple pizzas and sides.  Was it worth the cost?  Probably...but that kind of price will keep me from going more often.On the other side, Dante's has lots of great things associated with it.  Its basically a North Stockton institution.  Their crust is just the stuff legends are made out of...its thick as can be and is almost a meal in itself.  Our two pizzas were loaded down with tons of fresh, tasty toppings...I can not complain about that in any respect.  The wait staff and the owner (or maybe manager) were all nice as can be and were totally respectful of the kids that were with us.  It was a busy Friday night and it was good to see them happy.  A few small things to remember, they do not split bills, they don't take checks and they add gratuity for groups (like most restaurants).Just make sure you have a fat wallet when you come and you will go home with a whole lot of great pizza.:0)
<review# 1733,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2013,2/12/2013,318,132,23,30,22>I have to admit, I was a little embarrassed to write this review because it's about BRAS! But, after much debate with myself, I reasoned that I must share and spread the word about this place to help my fellow females! So, gentlemen, please move on, this one is for the ladies (that's right, I said Bras, not Bros)!Did you know that 8 out of 10 women are wearing the wrong bra size?! 8 out of 10!!! I'm one of the 8, and I only realized this after a visit to Soma. I was instantly greeted upon entrance into the store and helped by Joanne. First, she took me into a dressing room and measured me. Yeah, it's a little awkward, but just relax because it's the key to getting THE bra for you. And, as I mentioned above, I was wearing the wrong bra size! So, we started from scratch. Joanne was lovely! She showed me all the styles they carried and listened to what I liked and didn't like. She pulled tons of bras for me to try and laid them out on a table in the dressing room. She stayed very close to the dressing room and checked on me every few minutes to make sure I was okay and to observe the fit of the bra. She was incredibly helpful! She kept getting more bras if the fit wasn't right. And, I just wanted to hug her when she helped me find a strapless bra that was actually comfortable. Yes, comfortable! I thought that a comfortable and perfect-fitting strapless bra did not exist prior to my visit to Soma. After I had found several bras that were worthy of my bosom, Joanne then showed me which of those picks had the best deal. She even went above and beyond to search for the styles I liked in the sales rack to see if I could get one on sale. And, she found one and I snatched it up for $20 (normally $50!). As I checked out, Joanne also pointed out how to store the bras so that they'll last longer. Wow, I learned so much about bras! I also like that Soma isn't covered in pink and sparkles like their competitor (which carries overpriced undergarments that are of poor quality and are not comfortable). Overall, I had a bra-tastic experience here! No woman enjoys bra shopping, but at least you can do it right and leave with the appropriate fit for your body. Ladies, this is the place to have a Bramance!
<review# 1734,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/8/2013,2/11/2013,340,642,5,12,7>Went to check their happy hour last night and boy do they have a big happy hour!  First off the place is like being inside a huge western fort or log cabin very rustic.  The bar is probably the largest I have been to in sacramento (for restaraunts with a bar) it was about the size of 3 fast food joints stuck together, lots of seating a huge fireplace and lots of TV's.  Happy hour is from 3-11pm and the menu starts with items costing $2!We had the following:Lemon Pepper Zucchini; lightly breaded zucchinni not much lemon pepper flavor but the zucchini were fresh and not soggy like most frozen stuff-yum  $3Chicken Wings wiht asian sweet ginger sauce: not big wings but the sauce was good $4Calamari: not a big portion, but let me tell you the stuff was fresh and almost melted in our mouths-big yum! $4Steak chili nachos: avoid these not good $5Windowmaker Burger: a huge burger with bacon, cheese, avocado and hand dipped onion rings----LIP SMACKING GOOD!  $7 and worth every penny.Non alcoholic pina colada/strawberry daquiri: big glass and not bad either $4Long Island Iced Tea small for a long island but strong! $4Service was good but the food took a little longer than normal to be served considering it was all appetizer type stuff.We will definately be back to try some more of the happy hour items and maybe a dessert if were not to full :)  If your tired of meeting friends at a happy hour place that doesnt have enough room go to Claim Jumper!  Last night was the BCS Championship Game and there was still plenty of seating available.
<review# 1735,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2012,2/10/2013,202,116,6,13,9>FIRST TRIP: Being from the south, I'd been missing rich, indulgent Louisiana-style cooking! So this upscale take on southern fare seemed promising. But my initial trip to the Porch, back when it first opened, was a little underwhelming. While the atmosphere was nice and the service was great, my shrimp po-boy was too fancified and gloppy for me to enjoy. The sides were hit or miss, and it seemed like they wanted to add bacon to everything, just for the heck of it! Cornbread doesn't need bacon if you ask me! TAKE TWO: I returned recently to find that the service was superb (one of the best servers we had ever had) and the atmosphere was still welcoming. I also learned that they had revamped the menu, making adjustments based on customer feedback (apparently I wasn't the only one anti on bacon cornbread)! This experience was much better. My fish was flavorful and tasty, and wasn't drowned in a heavy sauce. All of the sides were exceptional, and the desserts were delicious! I really didn't have any complaints. They also serve interesting cocktails, like a blood orange margarita, and a black and blue martini. PRICE: It is a little pricey - around $14 for burgers and sandwiches, $17-23 for entrees, with similarly priced big salads. This place isn't an alternative to Sandra Dee's or Mama Sue's. It has an atmosphere and price level more along the lines of the Press or Formoli's, with cuisine similar to the New Orleans-style Angeline's in Berkeley. Worth it because of the well-executed gourmet twist on the southern concept.VEG: When it first opened, it wasn't veg friendly (for my fiancé). Now, they actually have a vegetable plate, so she doesn't have to order a bunch of sides! The only thing left to do is to label the menu with a little V next to veg items, which would be helpful.SUMMARY: Good date night potential because it's a little bit different than most nice places in town. This is an example of a restaurant that listened to diner feedback and adapted. I'm glad I gave them a second chance and I'll be back soon!
<review# 1736,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/12/2012,2/9/2013,675,207,7,10,10>Four Sisters...What to say about this great new breakfast joint. After hearing great things about Four Sisters we decided to give them a try. We arrived around 10am on Sunday morning to see about 20 people outside waiting. Before immediately leaving I was curious to know the wait time so I went in. Approached by a nice young girl she quote me 15-20 minutes. We figured that woas reasonable and decieded to come check it out. We lucked out and had an open spot on the bench indoors waiting for us to sit. After waiting approx 20 minutes we were greeted and taken to our seat. Immediately we were asked for drinks. Even though this was was extremely busy they did not fail to approach us in a timely mannor. After about 5 minutes we were greeted again for our order. I asked for the Four Sisters omelet and the wife waffles and eggs and beacon. We waited for about 15 minutes and were brought our meal. The Four Sisters omelet which was made with bacon that's cured, smoked, and sliced in house and includes white cheddar cheese, with a medium egg folded in the middle! The meal also came with my choice of toast or buiscuits and gravy and potatoes or fruit. I went for the buscuits and gravy and potatoes. I am soooo glad I did!!! The Buscuits we warm and soft with a sweet buttery taste and the gravy was amazing with pieces of sausage mixed in. Have I died and gone to heaven??? The potatoes had the perfect crunch with soft golded edges, made to perfection. Now for why I gave the resturant 4 stars instead of 5....Eating breakfast if you are like me it is a nice peacful time to enjoy the start of your day, my only hesitation of coming back is the mucis preference. I know the joint is a more modern type feel but to play music like Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Rhianna and other top 100 artist during my breakfast just threw me off. Infact it put a bad taste in my mouth...Call me old fashion or whatever you would like but I would like a more relaxing type of feel while eating my breakfast. They did have a bar with tv's of sports playing and maybe that's why they have the music of chice to blend in with the sports bar but I think after 12:00 or so then they can change the mood and become more like a sports bar.Overall the place was amazing and we will be coming back, I just hope they listen to what I have to say and change the music preference. Great job girls, keep up the good work!
<review# 1737,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/17/2012,2/8/2013,277,126,8,13,13>My heart skipped a beat as I saw the space next to Juno's being renovated.  I immediately thought, THEY ARE EXPANDING! As it turns out, I was wrong, but its not a bad idea because this teeny, tiny eatery is where it's at and more people should know about it and eat here on the regular. The Chicken sandwich and the Sopressa salami sandwich are my go-to orders.  I can't bring myself to cheat on them and try something new because I love every morsel.  I love the fresh simple mixed green salad that comes with my sammie; just enough tang and with edible flower petals.  Visually gorgeous and my belly agrees, too.  But if that doesn't toot your horn you can get house potatoes or a quinoa salad.  The bread is baked fresh daily in house and it's perfect.  Perfection is a flakey, crisp, thin hard shell crust that outlines the soft, spongy melt in your mouth carb goodness of a sandwich.  So if I haven't said enough about how great the food is, go just for the service.  Staff at Juno's are gracious and go out of their way to make sure you have your water filled, utensils and follow up mid way into your meal.  Yes this place is tiny, but you place orders at the counter so naturally I did not expect this level of service.  I can't praise this spot enough and as an added bonus, they are dog lovers and dog friendly. Awwwwww!
<review# 1738,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/1/2012,2/7/2013,195,127,9,9,10>Came here on a Friday night and it was my first time here. I found it to be very noisy busy, probably because it's fairly new and at a great, happening location. I sat at one of the tall tables in the bar because you don't have to wait to be seated. I ordered a flight of beers- tap walk for $8. I should have asked what was on tap because I had tasted most of them before. It was lagunitas, shock top, a porter and one more that I can't remember. There were a quite a few good beers listed on the menu. For dinner ($16) I had the ahi tuna burger with dakon and avocado and side of criss cross fries. I love my dinner! It was delicious, very flavorful and I almost cleaned my plate. It was a generous portion.Although this place is pretty packed, I think it's worth checking it out. I would come back.

When I have something in my mind, I can't let it go! Banh Mi Banh Mi Banh Mi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Walked into Duc Huong's the other day, and like other Yelper's who are not Vietnamese or Regulars, people cut in front of me.  So I stood strong, held my place in line and placed my order!  I said: "Small #1 please and a Full size #3 please." The cashier's response with her head tilted to the side: "Have you had #1 before?"  I said: Look lady I am aware I am African American but you have no clue how I eat! I want a #1 stat!!!! I'm all about head cheese! Don't question me!. . . OK that is SUCH A LIE, I just said, "Yup!"With my sriracha bottle in hand, I went to town!  And sadly I ate BOTH!!! The grilled pork banh mi was my favorite but only because the #1 did not have much of the pate on it. The bread was very soft.  Both I would and will order again.  Prices at $3 and $1.75, is music to my ears!
<review# 1740,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/5/2013,1/21/2014,233,33,20,23,20>I was invited to dine here with a couple coworkers and vendors that were in town.... I had no expectations of this restaurant other then what I read on Yelp.Moxie is a very small restaurant tucked in a cool midtown neighborhood. Great intimate atmosphere except for the few loud mouth customers (that would be us). I felt kinda bad for the young couple having a bday dinner beside us. The owner did ask us to keep it down a little bit (which I totally agree with and RESPECT).The Menu is very small and I can imagine would turn customers off (including myself). When the server introduced himself (later to find out was the owner) he read off 10 things not on the menu. He asked each of us to remember a different item. At the end of reading off the specials he then repeated in reverse order. This was something I have never seen before... and I thought it added a great touch to my experience. There was a few people at the table I didn't know and this made for a GREAT ice breaker.One of the guests at the table was a regular and did all the appetizer ordering for the table. All the appetizers were AMAZING especially the crab cakes..For the main course I had the Lamb... and it melted in my mouth. One of the best I have had. I didn't have any room for dessert but It looked delish. I can't wait to revisit Moxie with the Wife (Kimi F). I mentioned to the owner I was going to Yelp his restaurant. He stopped gave me a high five and shouted (we were the last customers btw)... "We love YELP!"
<review# 1741,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/17/2013,1/20/2014,702,960,31,37,30>"Hey, you wanna try some authentic food from the 'hood?"My curiosity got the best of me. "Uhhh...as long as I don't get mugged, why not?".A few minutes later, my co-workers and I piled into my car and we zipped off to the OTHER side of Natomas. The part that my brother (ex-cop) usually frequented chasing down questionable types. Being that it was day time, it wasn't so bad. The bars on the windows were comforting (?). Thai features prominently on the menu, but my Hmong and Mien colleagues insisted on trying the Lao food. They got the papaya salad which they swore by (a bit too salty for my taste) and we all got kapoon. Never had it before. Reminded me of the laksa I used to order in Australia -- coconut milk base, noodles and other delicious items. Fantastic, hands down. Plenty of flavor with just the right amount of spice. I'm dragging my family out here to try this stuff out! Maybe during daylight though... The spartan decor fits in with the hole-in-the-wall ambiance but the food is good and the price is right. I believe I got out the door with tax and tip for less than $10 or so. Minus a star for dissing customers on Yelp! In my opinion, there are ways to show professionalism when responding to a complaint.
<review# 1742,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2013,1/18/2014,1059,313,22,30,21>Puerto Rican and Cuban cuisine are very much alike. It's what I grew up on and what I still cook.I love eating Puerto Rican food that other people cook. Don't get me wrong, I cook it delicious but there is something about eating other people's cooking that I just can't even explain.  I entered Puerto Rican food on Yelp and for some reason this place came up.  I was happy because since it's so similar I would be satisfying my craving.The restaurant's decor is very similar to the little Dominican/Puerto Rican holes in the wall I would frequent when I lived in NY and visited Brooklyn. That made me feel all warm and Hispanic. hehehe  The music playing in the background cracked me up since it was early 90's Spanish music and people I haven't heard in years that just fell off the face of the earth.  I liked that too.A guy whom I'm assuming was the owner came by the table, gave us some menus but didn't have that Carribean attitude I've always loved.  He didn't start off too happy.  My sister and I both ordered the same dish.  Cubans love their black beans! Black beans are not my favorite and I prefer red or white but that's all they served so I went for it.  Rice, black beans, steak, "tostones" (fried green plantains that are not sweet, those would be ripe), "relleno de papa" (ground beef potato ball) and a soda I had never heard of.  When I was placing my order the guy's attitude kind of changed and he looked at me with a smile like, "DAMN GIRL THAT'S A LOT OF FOOD JUST FOR YOU!" I guess he's used to seeing non-Hispanic girls trying to count calories. hahaha Sorry, it's just that most Hispanic girls (that I know) don't count calories, love their thunder thighs and big butts (I was cheated out of those but I'm still hoping... some day they'll come).The food was good! I ate absolutely everything on my plate and when he came back to give us the check he opened his eyes as if surprised that I had eaten everything and finally said, "that was a lot of food."  The food was good but personally I would have added a tad more flavor.  By flavor I am not speaking of "hot/spicy" as that is not really in this type of cuisine. I mean more seasonings. When people just start to add hot sauce to food they haven't even tasted or simply think it's supposed to be spicy when I've served someone a dish, I just want to take it away! If you want spicy food... eat Mexican but don't alter the flavor this food is supposed to have just because it's all you know.  You either like it or you don't. I'm taking a star off because I find that the price for the food is absolutely unrealistic.  I know this food and I can tell you that paying almost $40.00 for two of the same (all the things that my sister and I ordered, see pictures) is WAY too much.  In fact I could make two of the same things we ate there for an entire week with $40.00.  I know I'm at a restaurant and therefore they charge for their time, their electricity, the rent, etc... but that made me want to start selling my cooking because this place is making a killing.
<review# 1743,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/4/2013,1/17/2014,266,563,9,15,13>The supper was superb and the drinks were delectable were at Arthur Henry's Supper Club and Ruby Room! We attended the soft opening last night and the experience was pitch perfect.Setting plays a reasonable part in my dining experience and this place has ambience in spades. I was instantly intrigued by the stark red door and no signage at the entrace. I felt like I was about to enter a speakeasy and was secretly giddy. We entered into the Ruby Room (the bar area) which was dimly lit in warm red lights and the glow of a old school jukebox. The juke provided an awesome soundtrack to the evening- everything from Hank Williams to Frank Sinatra to Journey to Madonna, while still keeping in line with the smokey, seductive atmosphere. I selected the tequila-based Grant's Pass and the gin-based Remission from the menu of artisan cocktails; the cocktails were delicious and the smoked salt rim of the Grant's Pass was amazing. (Plus I give an instant star to the Yelp rating when my drink comes with a little umbrella. Viva la tiki!) The jukebox, the door beads near the bar, the vintage television and the framed painting of nudes gives the feeling of a classic and classy dive bar. I would've been sold by the bar alone! The rest of the venue is also intimate and cozy. It's not a huge space with vaulted ceilings and bright lighting; the restaurant is styled like the supper clubs of yore. You feel like you could look to a booth near the corner piano and see the Rat Pack or a group of Italian businessmen discussing... business. The centerpiece of the restaurant is the fired grill where patrons get to prepare their own entrees. FEAR NOT, those who are green to grilling, there are instructions on how to cook your meat to your preferred specifications. And if the instructions aren't enough to ease your mind, the friendly staff (or the other patrons!) are happy to help you. My friend chose the New York Strip and I selected the Porterhouse, an 18oz powerhouse that dwarfed the other appetizing meats on the grill. The grill was a fun spot to spend a few minutes, cooking meat and warming garlic bread while enjoying a drink and chatting with other grillers. Our dinners were fantastic and every last bite was enjoyed. Nothing makes me feel better on a freezing cold night than a big hot hunk of steak!The overall dining experience was flawless and we left feeling incredibly happy.  Save me a booth, Arthur Henry, because I will be back for more meat magnificence.
<review# 1744,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2013,1/16/2014,52,78,9,13,9>For all your costume needs.small place but it is packed to the ceiling with so many neat costumes, from a clown to a donkey to a matador (bull fighter) and even a mariachi. How cool is that.When we arrived at the store, there's a lady leaving and WOW we have the store all to ourselves, the guys are in the spirit and in costumes. very friendly and quite knowledgeable when it came time to ask questions about the paint that goes on your face, I did not know there was such a thing as SPIRIT GUM, then the different types of paint, who knew,, maybe you but not I.OK so we need some face paints for our costumes and the guys are more than helpful as they recommend on the different types of paint, colors to blend with and what you might need as far as if you're wanting to place some BLING on your face or pretty much whatever you want to add. That's where the SPIRIT GUM comes in to play, now don't forget to purchase the SPIRIT GUM REMOVER or you will be stuck with a face full of glue and some sand paper trying to remove it and you really dont want that now do you! (and YES this is all safe to use, except for the sand paper)PAINT SEALER,,, You might also want to purchase the paint sealer so it won't smear off, and there's a lil secret for you that tend to sweat quite a bit,,,, ready? here it is,, wash your face, pat dry and rub some antiperspirant on and that will seal the pores and you won't sweat the paint off, pretty cool huh!! This came straight from the pros at the store.   My woman was the one that had mentioned the sealer bit to me as I'm really clueless when it comes to this stuff, I usually just buy a mask and I'm done but not this time. Now we came out of there with all the things we needed and a new place to get our costume supplies as well.So weather you want to purchase or rent a costume,, this is your one stop shop. And there's so many to choose from you'll go nuts even though all the costumes are sectioned off in their categories.The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because I really don't know much about the pricing on the supplies but I personally thought it could've been just a tad less, but nevertheless it was worth it.Great lil shop you guys have there and the service was nothing but awesome.
<review# 1745,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2013,1/15/2014,189,452,5,13,11>I arrived here to attend a class.  It's located in Old Elk Grove and it's in one of those adorable houses on the main street.  After walking in, it gave that comfortable home town feel.  The office is located upstairs and it was beautifully decorated with spiritual images and objects.  The owners, Michelle and Cathi are wonderful good hearted people.  They know their stuff.  Meditations, Thetahealing, Healing Touch, Reiki and Essential Oils. They really know their stuff.I participated in one of their exercises for their Thetahealing class.  It was a mind blowing experience to work with the other students.  There are beginning students and advanced students.  Overall, the energy felt really good and I like the environment.  I will go back again next weekend to attend another class.
<review# 1746,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2013,1/14/2014,129,87,15,16,18>May the forces of Pesto and Pepperoni UNITE!!!! PESTOOOOOORONI!!!! Wandering aboot last night and hark! Thou hearest a loud sound grumbling...oh that's my freakin stomach eating my spine! Food...need to find food now. Pieces, but wait do I have cash on me?! O M G I do! It's on like Donkey Kong.As you have already read in previous reviews this is one of the few establishments left on planet (soon to be zilch) earth that is cash only. Is that a pain in the arse? Sometimes only if you don't have that paper on ya, but I do understand it.Luckily the place wasn't packed so I was able to take my time and fog up the little glass partition that separates a hungry fiend like myself from the display of pizza pies on the other side. I wanted pesto that's for sure, but there wasn't one with pepperoni already on it......"I can put some pepperoni on a slice for you if you like" says the lovely voice on the other side of the glass. YES YES PLEASE! "How about some fresh garlic on as well?" .......Have we met? Are you psychic? Throw on the garlic you pizza angel!Got a nice cold Stella Artois to go with my slice and I was back to being human again. Everyone has their favorite pizza establishment. I heart this neighborhood pizza joint and am totally infatuated with the pestoroni with garlic. If you have cash or enough loose change stop in and grab a slice.
<review# 1747,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/25/2013,1/13/2014,92,91,22,15,14>Let me start off by stating how huge Kings fans these guys were. Holy crap. So much they painted their whole restaurant purple with Kings posters all over. I mean.....super tacky, but you do you boo boo. So as a man who's NEVER tried Ka Soy in his life, I felt that today (September 24, 2013) was the day I tried it. My table ordered Ka Soy with the exception of the only female ordering Kapoon. Let me tell you guys right now.......that the Ka Soy was thumbs up delicious and satisfying. However, I did try some of my friend's Kapoon and I have got to say, that is the best damn kapoon I've ever. The broth was very good. Nice and coconutty along with that distinct kapoon flavor. Guys. This place KNOCKS Loas Kitchen out of the ball park. Holy Angelina Jolie, I was very impressed with the Kapoon's broth. I'm definitely getting that next time I go back. Back to the ka soy, I really enjoyed it. I loved the wide noodles, however it's really difficult to chew. Maybe just me, but that shit was slippery. Big mistake was adding WAY TOO MUCH chili into the broth. Cause I basically was crying from eating my ka soy. Too spicy and also the broth was hot. Lol not fun. However, if you add the tamarin powder, it does improve the flavor. It gives it that slight sour tang. I liked it a lot. I was fairly surprised on how inexpensive a bow was. Medium bowl was $6-$7. And that bowl was good enough to fill me up. The environment was more like a club or a bar than it was a restaurant. But I see this more as a place where a buncha asian dudes get together, eat some papaya salad and noodles, and watch some sports. I HATE how there are not damn blinds in this restaurant. The sun nearly blinded me, so I was basically wearing sunglasses most of the time. Our waitress was nice. didn't talk much but I liked that when I said how their food was better than Laos Kitchen, she was like "way better." I like that confidence gurl. One annoying thing was that they let their kid run around the place. Very distracting. But they played Dexter's Laboratory while I was eating so cool points for them.In conclusion, ORDER THE DAMN KAPOON and KASOY. Papaya salad is alright. However, I ain't about that $6 papaya salad life. too pricey.
<review# 1748,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/23/2013,1/12/2014,146,90,13,19,17>For those of you who aren't familiar with Greek/Mediterranean food, look no further because Café Europa is one of the best hidden gems that Sacramento has to offer. Located on Howe Ave. in a smaller strip-mall (than neighboring "Howe Bout Arden"), this place can be a tad bit tricky to find unless you know exactly where it is. Fortunately the parking lot always has an abundance of empty spots so there is never a need to hunt down a spot to park.I've been to Café Europa at least a dozen times simply because of exceptional service, quality of food, and close proximity to my home. I've dined here alone, I've dined here with my lovely lady, and now I am dining here with fellow Yelp friends Todd G. (with his daughter) and Devo S. We all meet for lunch around 1:30pm as the dining area has a few tables occupied but overall it is not too busy at all. And as I mentioned how great the service is here, the owner actually remembered me from nearly a year ago! He was very polite and had a great positive attitude which already made this experience a very welcome one.For those of you that have dined here, the inside is very no-frills. There are basic tables for dining complete with wood paneling throughout the counter and walls. You will also find a small flat screen TV as well as a giant mirror in the dining area that gives you that illusion that the restaurant is bigger than it really is. But enough about me talking about the inside, let's get on with how their food is!As I've already tried their Kabob entrees, falafels, and Greek salads, I've actually never had their gyros. And I don't why I waited so long! After seeing many positive reviews on their gyros, I give in and order the "Beef/Lamb Gyro" (for $6.25). The gyro itself includes large seasoned slices of meat in a warm pita pocket and is completed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions and their signature Tzatziki sauce. And for only $2.99 more, I opt for a side of regular French fries and a pink lemonade.My meal comes out in less than 7 minutes and this thing is loaded with meat! The Tzatziki sauce comes on the side which is a nice touch. And the gyro, well let's just say that It is so big, I only wonder how am I going to pick it up and eat it without making too much of a mess? Well I successfully took my first bite and was literally in gyro-heaven. The portions and seasonings they use in the beef/lamb was tender and cooked to absolute perfection. The warm pita bread was absolutely heavenly while the lettuce and onions created a nice crunch to every savory bite.Overall, Café Europa is my #1 go-to spot for some amazing Greek food in the Sacramento area. The portions are generous, the food is amazing, and the prices are very reasonable. If you're looking for a no-frills restaurant that packs some amazing Mediterranean flavor, look no further because Café Europa is the place to come!
<review# 1749,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2010,12/26/2010,53,209,4,10,6>Upgrade (from an already good 4 stars)...another visit affirms that Palenque lives at the top of the food chain among local taquerias due to:1.  Clean, user-friendly facility2.  Super-friendly staff who love to talk about their food and didn't even drop their smiles for a second after my kid spilled my soda all over the place.3.  Tasty, affordable food with heavy accents on flavor and freshness, while avoiding being heavy or greasy.  Big props especially for a great poblano soup (never-before encountered by me around here) and their menudo, full-flavored and cooked just right (I tend to dislike overcooked, mushy menudo you find some places).  Salsas are also worth mentioning, vibrant, fresh, and flavorful.    As I have mentioned in reviews of other excellent locally-owned establishments, these are the sorts of places we need to be spending our dining dollars, not chains, no matter how good/convenient the latter may be!  Palenque is a true go-to for fast, fresh Mexican in the Arden area.  Take it from me...as you see above, I am the Final Arbiter of Taste!
<review# 1750,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2010,12/25/2010,642,604,6,11,10>Came here with Joe K & David O. the night after the Yelp "White Hot Bubble Party", which was a Sunday evening.   Met up with several other fun, diehard Yelp friends to continue the festivities.  This is one of the local bars located on Folsom Blvd.  I found it to be a very cozy place to socialize at.  The bartender was nice to talk to and he seemed to enjoy his job.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced.  There was no skimping on the alcohol either!  This place has plenty of room for a medium group of people to get together, listen to music, watch TV, play some shuffle board, darts or pool.  All the amenities a decent tavern should have.   There's also a separate room for smokers which looked, small, boring and out of place.  But I'm not a smoker and wasn't too concerned!This is a good place to include on your agenda when bar hopping or just stay put!   I think you would like it here!
<review# 1751,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2010,12/24/2010,149,559,5,7,6>I keep forgetting how cheap this place is for breakfast in midtown, when you order strategically. Sure, there are a bunch of $10-13 breakfasts, but you probably shouldn't be eating that much food anyway. Ok, I will stop judging you, and make that an "I Statement". I probably shouldn't be eating that much food for breakfast. At Lucky Cafe, you can get a delicious waffle with two strips of bacon or two sausage links for $6.25. They heat up the syrup, too. I am a sucker for warm syrup. For $6.50, you can get two eggs, a ton of hash browns, and either toast or a pancake. They let you substitute a pancake (with warm syrup!) for toast. That's awesome. It means you never have to choose between pancakes and hash browns. (Why is is that pancake meals never come with potatoes, anywhere? Only the egg meals do. What if i want a straight starch breakfast?)The hash browns aren't the best ever, but they are good. The service is friendly, they serve pepper plant sauce, and there is Odwalla juice. It's a good diner-y breakfast option.
<review# 1752,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2010,12/23/2010,570,275,9,11,12>You guys...I'm an addict.  A karaoke addict.  And for the first time I was introduced to live band karaoke here.  My addiction now is full force, and this place is not serving up any rehab. Have you ever noticed how crappy people can sound at normal karaoke?  Through the magic of live music and a little stage fright, this place turns anyone into a rock star.  A full-blow, kick ass, bad to the bone rock star.  And my Jack & Coke enduced trance from their ever so friendly drinks were not confusing my mind, I swear.  Everyone sounded great!This place somehow encaptures the feel of a well-kept dive bar, yet posses the size of a resturaunt.  I comfortably spent 3 hours here, feeling welcomed and totally comfortable.  I really enjoyed my time here.  In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I am returning again tonight!  Make sure you get there in time (before 11pm) and put your song in asap.  Once the list gets too full, they start charging $5 a song.  But even if you have to pay, it is definatley worth the price considering there is no entry fee.  Viva la karaoke!

It was made from fresh avocados and had nice small chunks of jalapenos in it.  The burger itself was perfect. It was on a good solid bun and perfectly cooked with fresh veggies too! They definitely don't skimp on ingredients.  The gauc was overflowing from the burger and they give you tons of fries, and the waiters are really attentive with the soda refills. Also, the garlic fries, whoa!! Like, whoa whoa! They are good! Like on a scale of 1-10, they are a 10! But buyers beware: no garlic fries on first dates.  Those things are a breath killer... like dragon breath status. They have a good selection of beers too, and ciders, so this place is an easy 4 star joint.

It changes every week and you can order a bottle of wine or a pitcher of beer to go with your meal. Last time I had gone was for one of their pizza Dinner for Two deals. It came with a really easily drinkable red from Lodi that was priced at $12.95 in the store. The pizza was hot and crisp plus tasty. I could have used just a smidge more toppings, as in, spread it out a little bit more. There was a just a wee too much crust going on. We had also gotten a small portion of their mac n cheese which was also very good. It was almost painful to share that great mac n cheese! Although busy, it had a good hum going on. Can't wait for the weather to get better to sit outside! Tip: to find out what's the new dinner for two special, either follow Randall Selland via Twitter (@RandallSelland) or be a fan on FB.
<review# 1755,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2010,12/20/2010,61,271,5,10,5>Yum!I was lured in  to this venerable Sacramento institution by the Sunday dinner special:  Choice of 1-lb whole lobster, 5 oz lobster tail or prime rib, with soup or salad, and dessert for $19.95.I opted for the whole lobster, clam chowder, and strawberry tart.   My dining partner opted for the prime rib, chowder, and chocolate mousse.The server brought out some good fresh bread with butter right away.  Soon, the clam chowder arrived.  It was creamy, tasty, and not overly salty, which I appreciated!   It had good flavor!  Our server paced the meal perfectly and brought out the entrees.   My lobster arrived whole and on a plate with a serving of the very excellent garlic mashed potatoes, a shell bowl, a bib, and a pair of pliers!  The large, red front claws were plump and full of juicy, delicious lobster meat.   It's a good thing they provide a good pair of pliers, as the spiky, hard exoskeleton was formidable!Every bit of lobster that I extracted was dipped in a small butter  container and dribbled with a squeeze of lemon juice before consumption.   Yes, the process is a bit messy.  Those who prefer not to get their hands gooey can  get the 5-oz lobster tail that doesn't require any major shelling.(I tried a bit of the prime rib, and it was tender and tasty, too.   However, it was not lobster,  and I was happy that I'd chosen the seafood entree.)The strawberry tart had plump, juicy berries served in a tasty shell with fresh cream.  It was  a perfect way to end the meal.  I was full, but not too full.  The restaurant also has a nice bar area that looks well worth visiting for a happy hour, sometime.
<review# 1756,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/16/2010,12/19/2010,98,296,3,5,6>How is it that I haven't written a review of Fat Face yet? Because I am completely infatuated with them. I'm so infatuated that last night at a Yelp event I made an ass of myself because I saw Sarah and Coleen from Fat Face and I got all excited. They don't really know me but since I see them all the time at the Farmer's Market booth or the L Street shop, I feel as if I know them.But I digress. If you love a good sammich (and that's how we spell it over at Fat Face, kids, get used to it) you will love Fat Face. Want a breakfast sammich? Go to their stand at the Davis Farmers' Market and get the hook up. The special with bacon, cheese and egg is delicious, but so is the vegetarian sammich and the one with braised greens. Want lunch and it's Wednesday, Thursday or Friday? Go to the L Street shop and take your pick from about 3-4 options. My friends swear by the grilled cheese; me, I like the hard boiled egg with arugula and whatnot. It is damn good. I also like the bacon sammich but last I saw, Fat Face owner Jaymes had taken it out of the lineup for a while. I don't go for roasted or pulled pork but I hear amazing things about her pork sammiches.And for dessert, you gotta have a popsicle. This is not your momma's popsicle, either: these are flavors that will blow your mind. My friend Kevin came up with a great analogy for Jaymes' popsicle menu: "It's like buying music on iTunes. You have the popular songs - the ones you already know and are a safe bet. Then there are the B-sides - a little different from what you are used to, but they are worth a shot. Finally, there are the deep cuts, which are only for true aficionados." Some examples of Jaymes' popsicle deep cuts: heirloom melon chai (sweet melon and spicy chai combined in one delicious icy treat), avocado lime, Thai tea & sweet potato. Pop hits include strawberry lemonade and blueberry lemon yogurt. The menu varies somewhat and it's always good to ask what "off-menu" popsicles are available - better yet, go to their Facebook Page, become a Fan, and you'll find out what new frozen treats are available. I got to try a peach cinnamon basil with champagne popsicle because I saw something about it on Facebook - holy crap, that popsicle was so good I wanted to slap somebody.I'll stop now, because this is making me drool. To put it simply, Fat Face rocks.

For 5 bucks the mix burrito and the $5.50 Carnitas breakfast burrito was just the thing my coworkers where looking for this morning. After being away from my desk for 6 weeks, I had alot of thanking to do to for covering my desk and these burritos did the trick. The counter guys was nice enough to cut each burrito in half and then wrap them so everyone could have a sample of each burrito. Thanks to Jalapenos for making my coworkers happy, and thanks to my coworkers for working my desk for 6 weeks. That's my story.
<review# 1758,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/6/2010,12/17/2010,179,181,4,24,10>Like another reviewer, I initially expected to spend more time underground, but that being said, the tour's setup was a balanced blend of historical reference, above-ground perspective, and underground experience, and I understand why the one-hour tour ends up being that way. If nothing else, you'll learn from the tour guide that despite legends of there being long tunnels running underneath Sacramento, in actuality each building owner was responsible for raising his building, which meant first that often the support that was built was unique to each building by following property lines and was NOT interconnected among properties, thus no wandering through a "neighborhood" of tunnels. Second, it's unfair to assume that an underground tour in one city means it should be similar in another city. Most buildings in Sacramento were raised by hundreds of jacks during a renovation that lasted well over a decade. Few owners chose to bury the first floor entirely, which means for us today, there are few store fronts, if any, to see down below. And once you've been underground to see the brick buttresses, archways, and retaining walls that put Old Sacramento over 10 feet over its original elevation, do you REALLY feel like you've been let down because you're not able to go under another building to see the exact same thing? For me, it was more about marveling about the engineering feat and how people in the 1800s reacted and adjusted to that. With that in mind, the tour was great. I am a Midwestern transplant to the city, so a lot of what was said was new to me and was made even more interesting by witnessing the buildings above me and the engineering below me. The guide and the slideshow were essential supplements to what we were seeing above and below ground, and it's obvious a lot of thought went into making this a well-rounded tour.

The only other dog park that I knew of in West Sacramento is Sam Combs Park off Jefferson and Stone Blvd, but am glad to find another one in the West SIDE! Brought my whiny little dog here last week because I felt bad that he be stuck in the house all day while I'm at work. Also, his big butt can use some exercise. There are two separate fenced off area for dogs. One larger one and one significantly smaller one for tiny dogs. My dog is super territorial, so he had a field day here. He didn't even want to run. All he did was sniff around the whole area and marked his territory all over. Bags are provided for dog parents to pick up their pet's business. Also, there are water fountains specifically for the dogs. Besides the fenced off areas for dogs, there is also a large soccer field, a play area for kids, and a full court basketball court. For so many amenities, there was surprisingly no one there given the gorgeous night on the day I came...but good, keep it that way so I can start practicing my And 1 moves (youtube.com/watch?v=LW48) without anyone judging me!

Like, husband and I are avid movie-goers (think 2-3x monthly) and will drive 25 minutes out of our way to go to this theater. It's always clean, the concession area has a cool, unique layout, and the very-most-important-part- the clientele. One of my seriously BIGGEST pet peeves is people who are disruptive in the movies. I'm usually pretty laid back, but if you're messing with your phone or making loud snarky comments (OMG, HA-HA, DID YOU HEAR THAT COMMENT THAT GUY JUST MADE, WOW, WHAT A RIOT, HE SURE TOLD THAT MOVIE SCREEN), I will start a fight that would shame my family and I don't care who knows it. I don't know if staff is stricter here or if it's just the neighborhood, but it's always nice, quiet, and respectful movie watching here. Happiness!

With that said you must go out and try it right NOW. I've yet to try their regular ice cream but their 50/50's are awesome. It comes with a fruit freeze of your choice and vanilla ice cream but I'm guessing you can change that as well. Anyways the ice cream is super creamy and paired with the fruit freeze, it's a magical combination. Their regular food, not so good though. I've had a cup of their soup and it wasn't good but hey this is an ice cream shop! The customer service is excellent. The prices here aren't bad AT ALL; definitely not bad on the wallet. A small 50/50 will set you back $2.90 which I doubt will make you miss your next mortgage payment. They don't have a bathroom though. You'll have to go to Pangea across the street but they aren't open on Mondays so boo!
<review# 1762,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2014,9/18/2014,107,81,10,16,16>A Sacramento iconic restaurant for sure. It's not surprising the wait for their brunch is so lengthy because it's so good. Even better news is they serve breakfast until 3 on weekends. So if you're not an early riser, like me, you can still get your French toast and mimosa fix! Their Famous French Toast is beyond delicious. Mmm...So is the Chicken Apple Sausage. I never really stray away from those items because I'm always so pleased, though everything else looks quite tasty. I also like to come here late at night for their desserts. They are open 'til midnight on Fridays/Saturdays, and it is the perfect way to end an evening of fun. Their mousse, pies, cakes, and other treats are enough to satisfy this sweet tooth of mine. Plus their atmosphere is fun. Whether you dine inside or outside, you feel transported to an exotic place where ever you sit.
<review# 1763,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/17/2014,9/17/2014,222,224,8,13,13>Been wanting to check this place out since I found it on Yelp last year. Easy to find off W Texas, downtown across from BoA. Walked in and it's a nice shop with two sections.  Very old fashioned (outdated) decor, from the signage to the refrigerator where you can get canned soda. Lady working the counter was very nice. I asked her what the most popular items were but they were already sold out of them for the say except for the champagne cake. No prices posted behind the counter or on any of the bakery items. Noticed mini cookies in the left-hand side of the store where you can find examples of the cakes they make as well as their pastries.   She told me what each type of cookie was and let me know that they are per weight price, $15 for 1lb.  Went with 10 mexican wedding cookies and it came out to $2.75.  That means that the slice of tiramisu that I bought was about $4 since my total was $7.10.Would be nice if there were prices listed somewhere. Hopefully they can afford to breathe some life into this bakery and redecorate. It's a really cute bakery with lots of potential. I'll definitely come back to try more items!
<review# 1764,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,9/16/2014,910,555,9,11,11>Decided to dine at Sushi Paradiso for lunch yesterday because I wanted to see if I should purchase the LivingSocial deal for it.  Conclusion: deal is on!We arrived around 1pm, peak of lunch hour, so it was a full house when we walked in.  The hostess told us there was a 10 minute wait so we just sat down and admired the decor.  It's pretty nice inside, I love all the gold details.  There are a few minor kinks but they're only minor things that a slightly OCD person like myself would even notice.  One thing that had me "literally" hot and bothered was the heat!  For a sushi restaurant especially, it was pretty warm in there.  By the end of our meal, my bf felt really uncomfortable and we had to rush out of there to enjoy some fresh air.  Besides customer comfort, isn't that bad for the sushi, too?Anyway!  Besides that, almost everything else about our experience was great!  I say almost because I was pretty bummed that I wasn't able to order the Paradiso Roll for lunch.  It's only available for dinner now.  Also, their lunch combos have gone from $9 to $10, which is fine because they are running a business after all.  In the end, I was actually glad we didn't order the Paradiso Roll because our 2 lunch combos had us really full!For my "choose your side, sushi and entree" combo, I opted for their NY steak ($4 more), sashimi (another $4 more) and calamari!  That means my lunch combo was actually $18 but it was so worth it!  The miso soup was a bit lukewarm but I don't usually eat miso soup anyway.  The salad was so refreshing!  It was a spring mix with a couple cucumber slices and drizzled with a very light dressing.  The NY steak was UH-MAZING.  At first, I was disappointed because I expected maybe a COUPLE more pieces for the additional $4.  However, I bit into my first slice and had an orgasm in my mouth!  They somehow managed to keep my steak medium rare while maintaining a thin and crispy outer edge.  The sauce that went over it wasn't too overpowering, either.  If I can order that on its own, I would!  The sashimi was really fresh and melted in my mouth.  It came with shredded daikon and cucumber, which I love because I need the crunch to pair with sashimi after a few bites.  The calamari was also a hitter!  However, you have to eat it quick because it'll lose its crunch real fast.  The lemon garlic aioli that came with it was divine!!!As for my bf, he opted for the black cod ($4 more), jalapeno bombers and spicy tuna roll.  Everything on his plate was pretty good, too.  He only chose those because I had already called the shots for the good picks, haha.Not quite the full 5 stars but solid 4 stars in my book!  I can't wait to come back for that Paradiso Roll!  WIsh I lived closer and parking wasn't such a B, I'd come here for that lunch combo often!P.S.  I did take note that they have a perfect area for big groups in case I wanted to throw a birthday dinner here.  They have a booth along the wall that could connect a few tables and fit about 15 people comfortably!
<review# 1765,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/2/2014,9/15/2014,702,960,32,29,28>Located next to Hock Farm, you can even enter through a side door. I don't recall if there is a cover charge or not since we had dinner at Hock and walked through. Love the chandeliers, the open air space in the front and intimate vibe. Came here on a Saturday evening. Earlier on, the music was good. Like, Sacramento-has-grown-up type of good. I could even request stuff, like Kaskade for instance. But then as the masses arrived, the vibe changed. Let's just say I'm not a fan of certain mass-marketed music. Especially if the song has lyrics like: "My dick - size of a pumpkin/Your dick look like Macaulay Culkin." The least they could've done is played the comeback by Awkwafina "My Vag." youtube.com/watch?v=z726The bartender rocks. Um...yeah, I forgot his name, (he used to work in Tokyo!) but the shots on the house were a nice touch and my cougar friend tried to persuade him to leave with us (!!!), but that's another story.Heck, I know I'm old, but I'm not THAT old. I can handle a little testosterone, but really, is it necessary to bump and grind on me like I'm your scratching post? Methinks that this is not the scene for me. But like all things in life, you have to try everything once.
<review# 1766,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2014,9/14/2014,108,125,8,11,12>I attended the Bastille Day event  submitted by our CM, Alex L.  It was a hot sunny July afternoon which was perfect for celebrating the French Independence Day.  At high noon there was a waiter's race in which the participants had to carry a waiters tray with a full bottle of Perrier sparkling water and 2 wine glasses also filled with water.  There were cash prizes which made this race even more exciting.  The contestants took this event very seriously, and it was fun to see how fast these "waiters"were walk/running by... while gingerly balancing  their trays.  Might I add that one waiter stumbled and tipped his tray which crashed onto the blacktop spewing Perrier water everywhere.  The crowd erupted in a large roar as we  watched this contestant become eliminated in a flash.  (Or should I say crash.)The Yelp booth had a large spinner wheel set up for people to spin and win free prizes.  Families, groups of adults, and dogs wearing french flag bandanas lined up and waited their turn to spin the wheel.  It was so exciting to see the look on the painted children's faces when they would spin and win!!  I enjoyed explaining to people (who asked) how to check in when they visit places around town.  And listened to stories from many people on how they rely on Yelp reviews in making decisions on what or where to patronize.  I was delighted to see my YE friends again and I enjoyed talking to Jenni, Alex, Michelangelo, and Priya.
<review# 1767,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2014,9/13/2014,174,424,9,10,13>I really like this place. I have spent many a Friday/Saturday nights at Capital Dime.If you can, sit outside. The seating behind the restaurant is so nice!I've tried a few different things and all of the food has been really, really good. Love the mac n cheese and I typically get the steak sandwich, both I highly recommend.Great selection on beer.Never been here for brunch, but I should get on that.. on a day where I don't plan on doing anything else.I don't want to call them out by name, but I do feel obligated to write this is my review. Sometimes the service is awesome. I love when Locke is serving because he's fabulous. But I've often gotten another server and every time I do, I get the same "don't want to be here/drop off the check and not ask if you'd like another round of drinks" attitude and that's definitely taken off the 5th star from my review and caused me to not come in as often as I was in the fall. I even asked the hostess to have someone else serve our table and we still got this person. Bummer.Overall though, I really like this place and think it's one of the best places to eat in Sacramento.
<review# 1768,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,9/12/2014,67,123,10,21,9>SHAME on me for taking entirely too long-- although it HAS only been a week-- to review Lotus Nails & Spa. FORGIVE me; as I DID post a picture of your hard work on Yelp and Facebook!So ANYway, my friend and I decided, after an incredibly long and inconceivably terrible day at work, that we needed a good pampering; and chose Lotus due to their reviews--and yes, I'll admit that the proximity from work was a rather strong draw.We arrived at Lotus at 6:30 PM. When we got to the door, we realized that they close at 7:00. Perfect, right? Cherry on top of the disaster of a cake last Saturday was. I looked (probably pathetically) over at the two women behind the counter and asked, "Do you have time for us? Pretty please? It's been a really bad day." They looked at each other, looked back at us and then smiled as they enthusiastically said yes!Please see below for the reasons why I will ABSOLUTELY return to this location, and why I will ABSOLUTELY encourage others to do so as well:1)The conversation with the nail artist (I was lucky enough to have Anita) was fantastic. She was engaging and seemed interested the entire time. There was not even ONE moment where any of the artists in the place were talking in a language I didn't understand under their breaths.2)They used the foil and cottonball technique to break the seal on my gells instead of dunking my entire hand in acetone.3)The filing and actual polish work was flawless.4)They let you take home the file and buffer they use on you for no extra charge! Not only is this a nice gesture, but it's also an incredible sanitation move!I love you ladies. Kudos.
<review# 1769,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2008,12/16/2008,9,30,,9,6>Yes it's a Hillstone Restaurant. Yes it's a "chain." Blah, blah, blah. But at least regionally (I have eaten at the one on Michigan Ave. in Chicago and it had a hiccup or two), it is in this person's humble opinion, one of the most consistent restaurants in the Sacramento region in terms of food quality and flavor. And in the restaurant industry, consistency at high marks is deserving of high marks in their review. After years of frequenting this place, I can count on one hand the instances where something was over-cooked or served not-to-par.Critics aside, it is undeniable that their basics deliver homers almost every time. If you're new, try this on for size and you'll walk with a smile:1. Start with a Greyhound, call your fav vodka. (The best in town for sure. Squeezed to order, fresh ruby reds every time.)2. Apps course: The grilled artichoke never disappoints. If they have it, the clam app special is tasty, as is a good slice of the jalapeño cornbread or smoked salmon plate.3. Entrees: If they have the Teriyaki Rib-eye, do it up, if you're into a plate of perfectly cooked (medium-rare if you're a connoisseur) well marbled steak. If not, ask about the fish specials (the halibut usually delivers solid as does the Ahi special.) From the menu, the Steak and Enchilada (yes you heard me right) is clutch. And, the good 'ol fresh ground Hamburger and Prime Rib French Dip is worth writing home about.4. Desserts: If it's the Fall or Winter, ask about the Apple Cobbler dessert. If it's any other time, go for the Oreo Cookie Dessert. A FEW HONEST NOTES: The sides are hit and miss so I tend to navigate away from them for the most part. The Seasonal Veggie is the only thing I'll indulge in if it suits your palate. The stuffing, Mac and Cheese, Rice, Cucumber Salad, etc . are average. On the other hand, almost every app is worth trying, as are the entrees - even down to the basic spit-fire Rotisserie chickens and the extremely tasty Macho Salad. Lastly, there is no corkage fee so bring great wine! One last thing: you can get the mashed potatoes plain or Colcannon so give 'em both a try and you decide.Either way, I've eaten and indulged at everything from Ruth Chris', Gallagher's, Morton's and more, and have rarely met a consistency at this level where I feel the quality and value that you get, far exceeds the money you shell. Flavorful. Well seasoned. Consistent quality. And an overall great culinary experience.
<review# 1770,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/27/2008,12/14/2008,42,177,,9,12>I gave Texas Restaurant 4 stars the first time, because the food was excellent, but I experienced a mishap or two relative to the service; no big deal.  But then I received a very gracious response to my review from the owners, Michael and Griselda.  They invited me to come back.  Well, yesterday I went back, and it was one of the best experiences I've had while living in Sacramento.  I took my wife and niece in the middle of the lunch hour on Thankgiving Eve. Chips and salsa were very good, as usual.Just as we were about to order, we got a cool surprise:  Michael walked up and told the waitress that he would have us sample several dishes.  He told her he'd take care of us.  My man had the apron on and everything....for a guy who owns several restaurants, it was cool to see him do his thing.Michael started us off with a fresh chicken soup.  This was the favorite dish of my wife & niece.  Big shreds of chicken with rice, finely chopped veggies and avocado bits in a red broth.  Very, very good.  My wife really isn't a soup person like me, but she was diggin' this soup; probably because it was much more interesting than your average chicken noodle.Next, BrothaMan surprised me with my favorite....chile relleno, covered with pork and chile verde. This one was different; I tasted it right away, because the pepper had a slightly dry texture and roasted' flavor.  Most of the time, chiles rellenos are really soft, and the batter is kinda mushy.  I guess most restaurants prep their chiles rellenos waaaay in advance; sometimes days in advance. These were apparently made that day, and it makes a big difference in taste.  Next we got "signature nachos."  Large tortilla chips fitted and baked with beans, cheese and huge cuts of whatever meat you like - we got steak, chicken and carnitas - then topped with sour cream, guacamole and fresh tomatoes.  If you like beef, you MUST order a dish featuring steak when you come here.  It's tender, juicy, with a light, tasty seasoning.  Trust me, it's off the hook.Finally, we received a fajitas dish....grilled steak, chicken and shrimp, topped with grilled onions, red and green bell peppers, and served with hot flour tortillas.  By this time, the wife and niece were stuffed, but I forged ahead, 'cause that's what I do.  Delicious, for real.  I was able to ask tons of questions about the history of the restaurant, his approach to managing his business, and his part in the revitalization of K Street.  You know what I didn't ask?  They run several restaurants in the area, and I failed to ask which ones.  Damn.  But it's really cool to see that Michael's in-law's food traditions are being upheld and shared with the downtown crowd.  A major national restaurant chain once bought many of mom-in-law's recipes.  Didn't do them justice either, if you ask me.  Anyway, thanks to Michael and Griselda for the amazing hospitality.  Wasn't really necessary; they had me with the charra beans on my first visit.  But getting to meet them and have a first-hand introduction to the downtown institution that is Texas Restaurant was a bonus that we won't forget.
<review# 1771,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2008,12/13/2008,44,281,2,8,7>It was a little surreal to enter the former location of Taka's, my old sushi haunt. The walls were a different color, and the reggae music had been replaced with a chillout mix. I stuck with the nigiri and 2 specialty rolls, and enjoyed everything. The salmon and hamachi were fresh, and the ziggy handroll was overstuffed and flavorful (maybe a little too spicy though).  Prices are in line with most sushi places in Sacramento. The food came out a bit slow considering that we were the only diners at the time, but our server was friendly and attentive.Update: On recent visits - I had some amazing uni and mackerel - served up by Taka himself - a great sushi meal. Taka said he was opening up a Brazilian restaurant downtown soon - can't wait!2 things I can NOT recommend: The Red Balls, and the Wasabi Shu Mai (holy crap I think they exploded my sinuses...)
<review# 1772,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2008,12/12/2008,903,380,9,5,5>Went to check this place out with Emily W.  The kitchy exterior paint job and proximity to the Dollar Tree were just too much to resist!!I had a chicken gyro and tried a little of the lamb/beef one. Both meats are tasty and absolutely piled on the pita bread with lettuce, tomato, feta and tzatziki sauce.  I can't emphaized it enough these are not pickup and eat gyros.  These are fork and knife gyros.    I haven't tried the dogs, but they have the 2nd half of the dogs & gyros duo down for sure.  Notes:  The lamb/beef gyro really is lamb/beef.  I don't know how you get a lamb and cow to make sweet love, but their offspring is quite tasty and somehow makes for a cheaper gyro (5.95) than chicken (6.25).  There are real Greek owners behind the counter with old country, old timers clientele.  It's pretty cool but make sure your defensive driving skills are up to par. LOL
<review# 1773,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2008,12/11/2008,123,431,7,14,12>I took my colleague Christy out to lunch here for a decadent girl-talk/bitch-about-work session. It's a gorgeous place, with a modern meets rustic design sensibility. We sat at the bar and were treated like goddesses by the very sweet and attentive Jeremy. (Or was it Jason? Justin? Jamie?)I ordered the pappardelle pasta with poached egg, crispy prosciutto, and preserved lemon butter sauce. It was very rich and slightly salty, but oh so good. Christy ordered the steak salad which came with perfectly cooked steak; she couldn't have been happier. For dessert, we splurged on the strawberry tres leches cake, which was nice if not exactly what I was expecting, and the milk chocolate peanut butter bombe (MIND-BLOWING).It blew my lunch budget out of the water, but it was totally worth it. Hopefully next time, I'll make it there for dinner.
<review# 1774,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2008,12/10/2008,156,217,3,7,6>I think that this is in the top three or four of all Sacto burritos,  Yes....the food is plenty good! I enjoyed my al pastor super burrito about as much as the one at Cd. Neza, and almost as much as the one at the Taco Fresco trailer on Florin near Power Inn. The service was also very sweet. I think the server's name was Rosa. She was a total peach. She knew everyone's name, gave hugs to some old ladies, and made my friend and I feel very welcome.But what really knocks my socks off about El Herradero is how well they've managed to reuse this strange building that obviously used to be a oil & lube or tune-up shop. I forget the name, but there was a competitor to Jiffy Lube back in the 80s that took the trendy fast-food-restaurant solarium idea from Wendy's and Arby's (actually, it started with Rax!), and made it the key feature of their own building archetype. With a high roofline and solarium windows skying all the way to the top, these shops had really funky proportions. The building's taller than it is wide.Now, I know what you're gonna say...."A taqueria in an ex-oil/lube shop? That's gotta be hella-janky!" But, dude...You could totally take your parents to eat here!The building is small and semicircular, confounding to the Tetris-logic required to create a good seating scheme. The wheelchair accessible table is cleverly placed, and the custom bench along the curved east wall is a rather attractive piece of work, and plenty comfortable, too. Horse-themed art looks like it came outta some antique store. Sponge-painted walls usually annoy me to no end with their monkey-coulda-done-it uneven application and tacky salmon, pink, and orange color schemes...but these walls are pretty subtle! Nicely done, folks!!It's as if the proprietor hired HGTV remodeling and staging experts to transform the space from a tiny spartan oil/lube-shop waiting room into a warm, inviting dining environment. It's like this place was designed to be a little eatery all along!

I'm not thrilled that my precious pup is placed in a cage before being groomed, but we typically reserve the first appointment of the day in order to mitigate puppy lock-up. Overall, Petco's groomers are professional, courteous, and as a plus, remember my dog's name, and haircut.
<review# 1777,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/7/2008,12/7/2008,801,1755,5,9,7>I always wondered what that sign-less, nondescript restaurant was on the corner of S and 21st... turns out this was what people were always lining up for! Tuli is owned by a Chef who started/cooked for a number of famous restaurants, including Bouchon, Flying Fish, and Sac's very own Paragary's.Despite the long line and having few tables, I was able to snag 2 seats by the bar in less than 10 minutes. I was really disappointed that they didn't serve the Flat Iron Steak today because I had my mind set on getting that based on the online menu, and the choices for lunch were so limited. Sadness!Instead, I decided on the Crispy Bird Sandwich. And I HATE breaded things.Tempura? Ew. Breaded chicken? Ew.But the Crispy Bird Sandwich was DELICIOUS. The foccacia was dense but soft and toasted on the grill, the chicken was salty and crispy on the outside (not soggy like most breaded chicken patties), and the inside was so moist. They gladly accommodated my request for "easy ranch" and extra tomatoes.Plus, lunch is an affordable $8-$12. Can't wait to come back for dinner!
<review# 1778,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/16/2008,12/6/2008,80,99,9,9,10>We ate at Woodstock's on Saturday night while visiting some friends in Woodland over the weekend. It was such a flashback to our college days (Woodstock's was an institution to Chico State students)- eatin' a great pie and drinking beer in nice laid back atmosphere. We ordered an x-large Davis Classic- pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, olives and extra cheese. It was loaded with toppings and definitely hit the spot. Extra points for 32 ounce beers and ultimate fighting on the flat screens.
<review# 1779,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2012,10/22/2012,92,91,8,6,5>I like this place. The only thing i dont like about it is that parking was a bit of a drag just to eat here. But lo and behold i found a place and I didnt have to pay the parking fee cause it was just passed 6. Woohoo. I was meeting up with a friend but she wasn't there yet so the waiter sat me down first at the bar. I didn't like sitting at the bar cause it was really cramp and I would have preferred a table. Immediately we were greeted by the kind sushi chef. He introduced himself and gave us some edamame to snack on. The awesome part about that day was that they had a back to the past menu where there was a list of rolls that costs as much at they did years ago. So we definitely took advantage of that. We didn't get out miso soup so I had to ask this waiter, which directed me to another waiter, to tell him that we haven't gotten out miso soup yet. He was a pretty nice guy, just like the sushi chef. The sushi chef made small talk with us and we complimented him on the rolls. It was a good meal. Then my friend got to spin the wheel cause it was her birthday. She landed on "Mikuni hat" and out waiter says "The hat is really ugly. Would you prefer a t shirt instead? I can get you one instead of the hat." Of course she went with the shirt.Really good service. The waiter and chef we got were really kind with us. Would i come back? Fuck no. Parking is a bitch.

(Can't touch this)  (Dancing with MC hammer pants on) :) Finally got to try the sandwiches in this place  I tried the muffaletta because that was the one I remembered from the yelp event.  I must say it was better than I remembered! The staff here were really great and very courteous.  I have been to this place twice already and both times have been the same.......Very good!  If you are balling on a budget then you better look elsewhere. My take for sandwich, chips and sip....$13.75-----  Kind of on the high side but TOTALLY worth it.  The place inside is beautiful!  You can never go wrong with leather, brick, and wood.  It feels  totally upscale and not like  a dirty sandwich joint.  Great spot to see and be seen. Overall great food, service and great location!
<review# 1781,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2012,10/19/2012,451,183,7,15,10>Oh my Spanish goodness! How could I have not reviewed this place yet? Bad Stephanie! You want tapas? This is the place to go! Not the Americanized competitor down the road- that place you go for atmosphere.Aioli- Great food, and a beautiful restaurant with a gorgeous patio. Little water fall and trellis with vines outside on the patio. What a little hidden getaway! And when you sit, they give you complimentary french bread and focacia, WITH a dipping sauce that is a white bean puree with a hint of tomatoes and mint. I could go there for wine and bread/dip alone. But, I don't.  I can't help but order tapas, which is mostly what the menu is made of. Sure, they have a few large plates and a specials menu printed daily. But I usually stick with the small plates. The tapas. They are divided into an easy to read menu of hot and cold tapas.Here are a few of my favorite things:1. Sangria!- Best in Sacramento, lots of fruit and citrus flavors with a hint of perhaps cardamom or cinnamon.2. Octopus Escabeche (cold tapa)- marinated octopus with pickled vegetables. Mmmm.3. Amatraciana Buccatini ( large plate special sometimes)- my favorite pasta noodle with my favorite pancetta tomato sauce. A bit of spice.4. Spanish chorizo and white beans. Oh mon dieu!5. Rabbit- in a creamy white sauce. 6.White Chocolate truffle soup! Oh soo beautiful... white chocolat anglaise in a shallow bowl with hand rolled truffles, and raspberry puree swirl. The service can be great (male server with red hair) or snobby (tall snobby guy). Of course, that doesnt deter me from going back! His poor attitude is his problem, not mine. The food is worth 10 stars!The prices are comparable to its competition, and the flavors are more prevalent in all dishes. If you haven't been here, at least come for the sangria. Solo or with a buddy. Or with a date ;)

You are going to have to drive.  Costco trips are impossible without a car.  Soccer moms DO NOT see bikes on the road.  I'm convinced that's why there aren't bums in Elk Grove- van/SUV driving soccer mom tunnel vision bum genocide  Anyway, it's the burbs, you need a car but you can save some wear, tear, and gas $.  Get yourself an abacus and do the math: Gas is $4 a gallon and downtown parking costs a grip too.  After slapping the beads around you'll find mixing in E-tran makes a lot of sense if you work downtown during regular business hours. It's a no brainer for state workers getting a hefty chunk the RT pass reimbursed, unless you have to do things like drive JR to basketball practice after work. The drivers are cool for the most part.  I was worried when that last lightrail home was later than usual, but my man in the EG one five six had my back well past 10 o'clock waiting for that last train.  Passengers are commuters, not RT "interesting" or aromatic.  Stops are also by places you can leave your car all day, pretty much without fear of them being jacked.  I can walk to and from my stop though, which is great.All I'm saying is E-tran is a solid service.  Grab a whiskey drink after work, let someone else drive once in awhile, and lower your carbon footprint.   FIRST!

Winters has the luxury of being able to house this amazing little gem of a restaurant.  From the cute decor...to the delicious food...and the tasty drinks...I can say with confidence that Ficelle has won over my heart (not to mention my stomach!).  This was my first time having Spanish tapas and I am grateful to have had my first experience here.  My friends and I ordered the following which I would definitely recommend: - plato combinado - chile relleno de la noche- gambas al ajillo - cordero parrilla- sangria (most delicious sangria I have ever tasted) I especially LOVED the lamb that they had here.  It was perfectly cooked how I like- medium rare.  Very tender, juicy and flavorful.  All of the other dishes did not disappoint either, but the lamb definitely stood out for me.  I also remember that the bread comes with this wonderful Ajo sauce that is just pure garlicky perfection to the taste buds!  Moreover, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  Goody points for them!    They have one unisex bathroom which is located on the side of the restaurant.  I was hesitant to go because I don't really like using public restrooms, especially if they are located outside.  However, one pitcher of Sangria later I surrendered and went in.  I held my breath and prepared to enter yet another public restroom of doom but OH.MY.GOODNESSS. Not only did it smell wonderfuly but it LOOKED BEAUTIFUL inside too.  The cutest and cleanest public restroom ever. Ficelle. Wait for me. I will be back for more. XOXO.

If fried food was my girlfriend, she would cook me a ton of my favorite food when I get home from work but essentially would deliberately call me fat once I'm done. ouch. hah. JJ's Chicken & Fish. They've graduated with a major in fried food and a minor in southern hospitality. Well done, JJ's Chicken & Fish. You were successful in bringing in a new customer with your low-budget commercial I saw while watching an episode of Maury on TV. I'm not sure if you guys got to choose which show to insert your commercial but during an episode of Maury? Absolutely genius. hah After finding out if Lamar was the father, I got off my couch and drove out to South Sac to find this JJ's. The place was quite easy to find because JJ's has got to be the only restaurant in Sacramento to have nearly their entire menu displayed on their roof. I think I was done deciding what I wanted to order before even walking into the door. After ordering my food consisting of fried chicken, fried calamari, fried shrimp and french fries. I knew I had to eat it there due to me not being able to fully close the foam container. The portion was generously large, heck, I got full before I could even make a dent. Just understand that the price you're paying will be above the $10 mark because well.. seafood isn't cheap. The fried food here is well cooked, consistent, and very flavorful and service is excellent from my last several experiences here. When coming into the place, I'm determined to save room for the slice of red velvet cake they have. But always finding myself hitting a food wall. and there goes another chance at that red velvet cake. The food is amazing and you know the food is amazing when you find yourself setting up an intensive two week running regiment on your calendar before you're allowed go back to JJ's. It's a love-hate thing. JJ's keep it up! Your food is great! I'm definitely a fan!

<review# 1789,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/19/2013,3/23/2014,289,200,16,14,14>I tried this place when it first opened five or six years ago and was turned off by our waiter's pompous attitude. "This is not the Americanized sushi that you're used to," he told us, "This is authentic." Super, thank you for letting me know that I if don't like it, it's the fault of my unsophisticated American palette, what an incredibly enlightening experience this will be for me! It was a horrible first impression and I never went back until earlier this year when I finally decided to forgive and forget.I returned for happy hour with the bf, also known as "eat and drink all the cheapest stuff until HH is over." We sat at the bar and got good service, though I swear I heard a regular commenting about us drinking the cheap sake that was on happy hour special - I know, how incredibly indecent of us! I guess everyone here has earned the right to have a super snobby attitude; however, I can't fault Kru for a loud-mouthed customer.Most recent trip we went with a large group for a birthday dinner, and received very accommodating service from the waitstaff and hostess. Having spent the day nursing a hangover I wasn't really in the mood for raw fish, so I went with the duck confit ramen in spicy miso broth. It was really good (as long as you don't mind paying $15 for ramen)! It comes with a yummy little crispy skin duck leg and the bone just fell out of this mass of tender leg meat. The broth had just enough heat to it and came with a decadently soft boiled egg. The only problem was the serving spoon they provided - it's so thick you can hardly scoop up those last few sips of delicious broth out of the shallow serving bowl, so in keeping with my history of gaucheness at Kru I called "bowls up!" and slurped up my last few sips right from the dish, like the savage barbarian that I really am.

I decided to order a dozen for a work meeting anyways so I went in a day ahead to order. Came in at 9am the next morning and my cronuts were all waiting for my coworkers and I to devour.If you aren't calling in to reserve, they finish preparing their cronuts around 9am so get here around that time or you will come out empty cronut-handed :(I got every flavor but only tried two - Red Velvet and Nutella. Their amazeballs. You must try it. Also, they travel very well and still retain that crispiness throughout the day.

I know salad is just salad. They're just standard produce mixed together, how can there be such a huge difference in rabbit food? No joke, there's just SOMETHING about Plutos. There's always a fat line at plutos. Pluto's is one of those salad bars where you choose a type of lettuce and 7 toppings of your choice. $7 for leaves aint worth it. Why would it be..but I'm telling you there's just SOMETHING about Pluto's that's different than any other salad joint. My main diet in life is salad, but I come here every day for a reason. Even if I bought every ingredient in the world, it wouldn't be plutos. It's fresh and refreshing and I just can't say enough about it. Oh, you can add meat too! I like my steak bloody rare, omg so damn good. Foccacia bread is on point. Dip it in ranch and it reminds me of pizza. mm gunna def go tomorrow ^^v

Carne Asada Super Burritos x2 @ $6.10 each were the poison of the night and they were true super burritos in size and served up to us within 5 minutes or less after we ordered. And I only ate half of mine saving the other half for lunch the following day and it reheated remarkably well too with a good 1/2 cup of sour cream to drown it in from home too.... Yummy! I had one hell of a long work day and was wanting some delicious adult elixir to quench that thirst so was thrilled to see that they served booze so I went with a Coors light which was icy cold and delicious along side the burrito. As always burrito was ordered minus the rice but was full of freshly prepared, perfectly cooked and tender pinto beans, cheese, sour cream and asada. So far one of the better asada burritos I've had on my search for the best carne asada burrito in Sac. The meat isn't grilled which is how I prefer it as it gives it so much more flavor verses the boiled/simmered type like they serve here... I did dislike however that they did not attempt nor offer at all to make up for the void of space within the burrito that the rice would have filled and should have as there was entirely too much tortilla if that makes any sense at all; next time I will specifically request them to however with either extra beans or maybe even a lil extra meat and beans and see if they attempt to charge for it or not which they shouldn't. I know how cheap rice is to purchase and make however that is irrelevant. Self refill on the soda's too which I love as I have a thing for fountain drinks and love the self serve option so you don't have to depend on an employee to get your drink on. I LOVE LOVE LOVE flaming hot food and was blown away as soon as I sunk my teeth into the first of what would be many pickled jalapenos from their salsa bar as immediately my entire mouth lit up with the waves of mouth numbing heat as the pickled juice and jalapeno flesh scorched it...... IT was amazing and the highlight of the entire meal for me actually... No joke it was as my mouth, lips, throat and stomach were toasty warm for a solid hour after the meal was done... Heaven on earth........
<review# 1793,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/5/2013,3/19/2014,102,307,9,15,11>After taking my boys to the Folsom Zoo we were a little late for lunch and needed to eat before the little ones got cranky. When we first arrived because it was after the main lunch rush we waited a little bit at the podium to be seated. However, this also meant that there was no issue getting a table outside by the playground. You should have seen my kids' eyes when they realized they got to play after we ate. They were actually really good at waiting until the food came before playing (I didn't want them eating with germy hands). You don't know what a feat that is for 2 and 4 year old boys with an abundance of energy.We started with the Skip's Dip, which is a large round of hot bread and olive oil, balsalmic, spices and parmesean to dip it in. This was huge, enough that the boys and I ate our fill and still had enough to bring home and eat at three more meals. I ordered a small pepperoni pizza for the boys to share and a caprese salad for me. The boys each had a fairly large piece and I tried one (you know, for science) and we still had half a pizza to take home. I thought the pizza was pretty good, but I like a lot of sauce on my pizza and this had that, so it makes it tasty in my book. Then I released them to go play.The boys were overjoyed to get more playtime after lunch and I was able to sit back and get a few refills on my soda and relax. There were several other parents there doing the same but with beer, wines and cocktails. I would have loved to imbibe, but not when I was the sole driver of my kids. It would be great to come here with a group who had kid and a designated driver. They even have a TV and a fireplace so you can warm up and watch the game too.Our server was nice and friendly, however, my one criticism was that they do not have a dessert menu, but instead encourage you to go inside and look at what Italian pastries and gelatos they have in the case. This didn't really work for me since I did not want to leave my kids alone outside and there was no chance I would be able to drag them away from the playground before it was time to leave. Not an issue if you are there with more than one adult, but a problem for me being there alone.

<review# 1796,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2013,3/16/2014,81,103,2,68,68>I love the dentist. I won't go so far as to call it my happy place, but I enjoy a nice trip to the dentist. Clean teeth = happiness. Even though I enjoy the dentist, I have heard horror stories, and finding a new dentist/doctor can be a little daunting. Walerga Dental Group is close to home and close enough to work that it's not a hassle to get there. I have a PPO plan, so they accept my insurance with no problem. When I called to set up my appointment, they were very friendly and they send an e-mail link so I could fill out paperwork before my visit to save time on the first visit. I appreciate small things like that, because it means less time I have to take off of my busy job. On arrival, I had to sign a few more electronic forms - standard doctor's office type forms - and then it was time to get those chompers cleaned! The thing that stood out for me here is that I met with the dentist (Dr. Kaur) in a little office and we discussed my concerns/goals, etc. I don't think I've ever had that happen at a dentist before. It seems like I'm normally just strapped into the treatment chair and away we go! It's nice to be able to talk to the person who is going to be sticking their hands all up in your toofs, if only for a few minutes, before you have fingers and instruments in your mouth preventing a real conversation. My concerns are few: I don't want all my teeth to fall out and I would like my teeth to be clean and fairly white. After conversing with the dentist, I was taken back to get x-rays and then brought to the treatment room. There was a little bit of a delay before I saw the dentist again, but not horrible. I had a magazine to read for those few moments, so I was okay. Dr. Kaur came in and reviewed my x-rays with me and then checked my teeth. Before my cleaning, a benefits coordinator came in and told me what was and wasn't covered by my insurance and how much my out of pocket would be if I had a certain cleaning done. I opted for the fluoride cleaning, paid my small co-pay, and was good to go. On the way out, I made my next appointment for six months down the line. A clean mouth is a happy mouth (that can eat more yummy food).

I have been disappointed with most of the German dishes served throughout the Sacramento area, and being such a big pretzel fan, this was the first item I tried.  I wanted something large, with various texture, and plenty of salt. SCORE! This place delivered.  Plus it even came with delicious cheese sauce and a traditional mustard that was unexpectedly spicy. I also tasted the derfinator dog. This thing was awesome.  It was cheese filled and bacon wrapped. The sausage itself was the best I've had since capital dawg closed down. The bun had a nice garlic spread and cream cheese too. Make sure you try this one! The menu also includes sandwiches with waffles as the bun.  I'll keep you posted.With 32 handles, DBGs beer selection is impeccable.  Not only can you try some of the hottest craft brews from around the country, the German selection of beers is bloody fantastic! Some beers you can order a litre at a time!  The glasses and mugs also add to what ends up being an overall outstanding atmosphere.The design of this place is outside with decorative wooden borders, and a flat unpaved surface.  That makes DBG dog friendly and a beautiful place to enjoy this record draught.  There was even traditional singing going on at times. The tables look hand made, and the building itself, modified shipping containers, is very tasteful and a nice addition to what used to be a deserted lot. There is bike parking out front, and seating right next to the sidewalk.  Everybody will love something about this destination for drunkenness debauchery. I was fortunate to attend the soft opening, but after coming to the grand opening, there is no doubt that Der Biergarten is my new favorite place in Sac!

Throw some fruit and sugar in it!  Mmm.+/-  Tapas.  We got the mushrooms, empanadas of the day (ham, black beans, and cheese), potatoes w/ chorizo, and grilled chicken strips.  The mushrooms were good and covered in a buttery, garlic sauce.  Which mostly just tasted like garlic.  The empanadas were our least favorite dish.  The breading was too heavy and took over the filling.  The potatoes w/ chorizo were good but only if you took a bite with a piece of potato and a piece of chorizo together.  Separately they weren't as tasty.  The grilled chicken was delicious and had a refreshing cucumber sauce with them.  I appreciate that they offer grilled chicken strips instead of the fried variety.  The sangria and live music would be the things that would encourage me to return but I won't be making a special trip for the tapas.

Same with my friend and her longboard inquiries. They didn't have a huge selection of snowboarding boots, so I didn't end up getting a pair there, but it's the service that counts, right?

I got in and the place was poppin'. I got my drink pretty quick and the bartender made it stronger than usual. Another damn PLUS! One of the crazy things I noticed about the place too is that it has an elevator! So if your drunk ass can't climb the stairs, you can always use it! The upstairs lounge area did have more seats and a small dance floor with a bigger bar. The upstairs was poppin' too. The music was great and the guy/girl ratio was not bad at all. A lot of pretty ladies too. I would definitely hit this place up again.
<review# 1806,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/26/2009,5/21/2009,149,559,1,5,7>The collective wisdom of my party of 8 was that it was a "B-/C+". They all liked the burgers more than I did - I found it to be nothing special, and pretty pricey. $4.39 for a "small burger" - In-n-Out regular hamburger size. Around $8 for a regular sized restaurant burger, before fries.But, the saving grace was the milkshake - DELICIOUS, fresh, prefect. Its $4, which is actually reasonable for a milkshake these days, and there are a variety of flavor options - one of which was peanut butter. Seeing also that chocolate was available, I asked if it was possible to get a chococlate-peanut butter milkshake. Without hestiation, the gal at the counter said, "Sure, we can do that." It was huge, had impeccable texture/consistency, and used real chocolate ice cream and crunchy peanut butter. The result was tiny bits of peanuts in my  peanut-y chocolate shake. I'm not doing the description justice, but it was heavenly. Feelin' like this won't be my lunch spot, but I will definitely be back for many a milkshake.
<review# 1807,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2009,5/20/2009,105,90,3,3,5>The Lido is simply a great breakfast spot. Two little birdies told me so, their names are "sweet potato pancake" and "homemade cinnamon roll." In another part of town, those might sound like streetwalker handles, but not in Carmichael son.  Those are two of the many standout delicacies waiting for you on the Lido menu. Add to that the spot-on service and the great coffee and you've got yourself gen-u-wine breakfast perfection. Other than the fact that the owners of Lido didn't call me personally years ago to tell me how good their grub was, I can't find fault.
<review# 1808,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2009,5/19/2009,26,27,4,7,5>Holy shat!! yes, indeed. damn, this is good! That is pretty much what i said and how i felt when i first dived into the classic cheesesteak sandwich with peppers and onions. I didn't go with the grilled onions since i was a bit confused at the menu and didn't realize that the sandwiches came with grilled onions OR hot peppers....but i guess i could have requested both. Anyway, the sandwich was perfect with very lean thin-sliced grilled beef, peppers, just the right amount of cheese all wrapped in a soft hoagie roll. Much better than my expectations! I highly recommend getting the steak fries and onion rings with it, just to complete the culinary experience. I highly recommend this place. Excellent all around.
<review# 1809,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2008,3/17/2009,109,241,2,4,4>A couple of my friends and I decided to try a new restaurant every week.  I turned to Yelp and found Evan's.  We went on Sunday morning/early afternoon.  It is located in Antique Row in East Sac.  We walked in to see a bunch of large groups and families.  We were seated right away at this massive table, which was sort of strange seeing as how there were only three of us.  We take a look at the menu and make our choices.  However, we weren't even acknowledged for a few more minutes.  Finally, a waitress comes over and tells us that it will be just a couple more minutes.  I understand that we were the smallest, and youngest, group there but I felt very overlooked.  In the meantime we notice that there are a lot of kids there.  They even have a little play area set up with toys and whatnot.  The problem is, it seems like parents like to treat this area like a babysitter.  There were kids running all over the place, like around and under our table, and no one seemed to notice or care.  I'm not the biggest fan of children, especially misbehaved ones, so I was not amused by that.  Anyway, once we finally get some service, our waitress was quite nice.  They were out of my original choice, crab cakes benedict, so I had a veggie scramble.  My friends got the country fried steak and one of the sandwiches.  My friend commented, before we got our food, that he thought this would be the kind of place where the food is so good that it makes up for the poor service.  Turns out, he was totally right.  Everyone enjoyed their selections and we left very full and satisfied.  Bottom line, I would recommend this place to a friend without reservation but only if they had patience for children and very average service.
<review# 1810,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/26/2008,3/16/2009,7,29,2,6,7>I was totally unsure as to whether I should even go or not because of the somewhat not good reviews here on Yelp!, but I'm glad I did go.It was pretty packed inside, and they said it would be about 45 minutes. Eh, alright, my parents and I wanted to try it so we waited. The sucky thing is is that there's about 3 chairs inside for waiting guests and nothing else, no benches outside or anything. Luckily, we nabbed those 3 chairs.After only about 15-20 minutes of waiting, we were seated. Super noisy in there, but oh well. Our waiter was extremely prompt and on top of things. We decided to get the Garlic Fries as an appetizer, and they were good. I personally think they needed some more Parmesan cheese on top, instead I dipped them in balsamic vinegar to compensate (Nasty, eh? No, Yummy!) The focaccia bread was also pretty good.We got our food soon after. My Mom got the Tequila Lime Turkey Fettuccine, my Dad just got boring Pepperoni Pizza, and I got the Cajun Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo.The Tequila Lime Fettuccine has such a unique taste, but it was reaaaal good. I did prefer my Cajun Fettuccine though, it had a nice kick to it and was a good change from normal fettuccine dishes. My Dad said his was good, but he just orders pizza wherever we go so he doesn't really count. :DOverall, the service was excellent. We got seated much faster than originally stated. Our waiter was on top of everything. We even had two other waiters stop by our table and grab refills for us (sweet!).The only downside is that at three people the bill was about 62 dollars for thee entrees, 1 appetizer, and a small salad (plus 2 lemonades).

I haven't had to get the size 16s, the 14s, or even the 12s out just yet, but I guarantee that if I keep eating here at this rate, I'll be in the upper double digits in no time.I've had the meatball, the Italian sausage, and the Chicken Pot Pie (random.) Their meatball sandwich is the best in an 80 mile radius. Bring me a better meatball sandwich, and I'll do cartwheels for a block on J Street. Neither will be happening anytime soon.I had the chicken pot pie on the younger Sampino's suggestion and it was beautiful. I mean, I didn't even want to eat it. Sampino Jr. was quite proud of it. Love that.*****Warning: I'm about to be an offensive bitch*****What the HELL is going on with that chick that gave Sampino's 1 star because their f***ing marinara has meat in it? Hello, do you know what Marinara even means? Technically, it's a red sauce made in sailor style. To be more precise, the sauce is necessarily hearty and simple. There's no vegetarian prerequisite to qualify a marinara sauce. Some Italians put seafood in it. There is no rule, unless you're having some Marinara at the Thunder Valley Casino Thunder Buffet or on an airplane. Just because Sampino's doesn't apply the Olive Garden standard of redefined Italian doesn't mean they're WRONG. I say thank god it doesn't apply that standard. Because if I wanted that, that's where I would go. To the Olive Garden. To give Sampino's one star and BJ's Brewery four should be a flaggable offense. Even the guy Sampino insulted and called "full of shit" was realistic enough to give them 2 stars! And I would bet you 20 dollars that if you went back to Sampino's and informed them of your blatantly ignorant assumption and of what happened, they would comp your next sandwich.Bizarre.

I called the night before the Tuesday beginner drop-in class to ask for about some details. The lady was nice about answering my questions, unlike another place I called before, who was a little standoff-ish. She said it was $10 to drop in and that Tuesday nights would be the best for beginners to come. She also said that the intermediate and advanced classes are immediately after the beginners lesson and that we can stay to watch, without charge.When we got there, it turns out that the first class for newcomers is complimentary, and I sure was not complaining! The main dance floor was spacious, in which only half of it was used that night. The instructor, Fahad, was really nice and friendly. Don't be intimidated because he goes over the basic steps slowly, and we went through each move several times. Plus, the age of the people there that night ranged from 11 year-olds to a 70 year old. Though there were a few who were a little more than beginners (and really trying to show off) most were really patient with my friend and I.No doubt, we both enjoyed it, picked up a few basic salsa steps, danced with some interesting people, and are both interested in coming back!

I'm a 2nd generation Luigi's fan, so I'm biased.  Sure, there are better pies out there, but I love Luigi's because they're crispy, thin dough is so yummy, but also because they're old school Sacramento and are still going strong.I recently had to order a truck load of pizza for my kids' birthday party and I thought, "Oh crap, no one opens before noon except disgusting Papa Murphy's."  Actually, that wasn't true, since Round Table does open early. They also wanted $150 for four pizzas.  Eff that!  Then my pea brain kicked into gear and I remembered that Luigi's is actually really reasonably priced.I ended up paying less than $70 for four of the biggest pizzas I've ever seen in my life (we still had leftovers after 30 little boys and girls went to town on those pies) and once again, I was reminded of how awesome this place is.

Pa Nang Curry with chicken - it had enough spice and the sauce was creamy.  This is always a safe choice.  If a Thai place messes up on their curry, then WTH!!  Thank goodness this was the bomb dot com!#50 Prik Khing Tilapia - Fried Tilapia filet in a spicy red chili with loads of green beans.  The tilapia was crunchy and the sauce was a nice touch.  You can put it on your rice as well.  Sooooo good!!#38 Fresh Ginger with beef - this stir fried dish was scrumptious!!  Every bite was awesome!  I loved how this dish had so many vegetables to go along with the meat.  It had carrots, string beans, snow peas, and broccoli all topped with crunchy garlic bits. After making the order, the waitress looked at me concerned, "that's a lot of food!"I looked at her and smiled, "I'm hungry!  I KNOW I'll finish it!"AND HELL YES I DID!  Sooo  good I may just convince the BF to go again today for Fat Tuesday ;)PS.  They had at least 2 pages full of vegetarian options.  I'm definitely a carnivore, but just so y'all know!!

Jasper's and a florist on one side and Adalberto's on the corner. Once inside, there is a small sushi counter on the left and cozy seating throughout. On the smaller side, you really get the authentic vibe here. All the customers - except one table - were speaking Japanese (good sign for a Japanese restaurant in my opinion). Here for lunch, I had the C combo ($10) which included a choice of aji fry or broiled, four pieces of sushi, hiyayakko (cold tofu w/ fresh daikon), rice and hot miso soup. When I lived in Japan, I used to eat aji all the time (Spanish mackerel) and it brought back memories of being in Matsudo.Mom had a different lunch combo for $9, it came with miso, California roll, rice, vegetable tempura and saba (mackerel). In Japanese restaurants, the sushi and tempura are my barometers of authenticity.  The tempura was delicate and not oily. I have to admit, I have had fresher sushi (the live fish is diced up in front of you, cruel I know, but tasty), but this was good. Service is authentic and warm. I noticed a few reviews complaining about the slower service, don't come here if you are pressed for time. You're meant to sip the complimentary hot tea, brush up on your Japanese and get your wasabi high on. The bathroom boasts a Toto toilet, which means that the seat is not only heated, but offers the option of a "feminine wash." I wasn't in the  mood for that option, maybe after a few shots of sake.

Nice crowd and a good mix of people.  Two pool tables in the back a huge plus. The service is excellent.   If you love beer then this is your spot!  This place is the Panama City Florida Spring Break mecca of spots for beer!  Over 100+ choices of beer to quench that thirst.  Heck as the Knight of non drinking (Dubbed Sir Abstainalot by my military friends) even I could probably find and try a beer that I liked but I will stick with the Pepsi. Now only one kink they need to work out...The BATHROOMS... all that beer makes people feel the need to relieve.  One stall bathrooms are not a good idea for a place like this. The male and female bathrooms need at least 4 or more stalls. They have to work that out.  Overall the place was great!  This place will get better as the weather gets warmer.  I can't wait!

I HAD to check it out because it's just too darn close to work, and I needed a little something for lunch today.  They had me at "Stud Muffins" "meatloaf wrapped in phyllo and topped with mashed potatoes and parmesan"... um, they didn't mention bacon too - Yum. Really, the stud muffin was indeed, tasty. Kinda pricey for the size (average size cupcake) at $7.25!  Hmmm? I thought the sign said $6.25? Maybe that was for the bacon quiche, which also beckoned.They also offer all kinds of baked goods, sandwiches, soup of the day, and salad.  There were quite a few people in there for a late lunch. I'm always looking at other folks' plates, but I didn't really see anyone eating.  As, I ordered my stud muffin and brownie zingo (raspberry brownie with a cream cheese frosting), I noticed plates of sandwiches coming out (meat ball sands.) with a side of potato chips. The sandwiches looked tasty, and of average size for the price (about $8-$10).Giving a higher rating for the variety they offer, but I'm not thrilled with the prices. And, I overheard one of the owners' mention that they are working out the "sizing" of their goodies.That's it for now, I gotta go take care of my stud muffin... so needing of my attention!

This place just sparks nostalgia for the old and bring new memories for the young who don't know about drive ins. This place is pretty cool! Sure the place looks dated and set in a third world country. That's part of it's charm! There is nothing better than watching a movie in the outdoors with friends, joking around and having a picnic. This is the perfect spot to encompass all three of those elements. I had a blast! The concession stand was fairly fast even though the line was long. The 188181877% markup is in full effect for food items- -just like in every other movie theater in America--but you already knew that! I supported it anyway. I don't want to see the place close because of non support. I also brought some good snacks of my own as well. That's part of the fun. The price of $6.95 for a double feature can't be beat even if the movies blow BIG chunks...like ours did! It was still fun! A good way to hang with friends or family on a summer night.
<review# 1831,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/15/2011,11/28/2011,291,553,1,10,6>I've been to Chocolate Fish several times now and I am confident in giving a five-star review.  From the mocha, cafe au lait, flat white, they've all been amazing.  No matter what time it is, there always seems to be at least a few people at Chocolate Fish, and that's a good thing.  The workers here are very friendly and very helpful in describing the different types of drinks.  There drinks are all made right when you order them and it's pretty interesting to watch.  So much passion and dedication goes into each cup and the foam artwork is always impressive.  Each of the drinks I have had here have been full-flavored and very smooth.  One of my favorites is the mocha with whipped cream.  It's delicious. The pricing is fair and overall, this is a great place to grab a quick cup of coffee, read the newspaper, or have a chat with friends.  There is seating both indoors and outside, on the patio.Notes:-Free Wi-fi-Beautiful foam art-Free street parking across the street on 3rd.
<review# 1832,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/1/2011,11/27/2011,290,371,4,6,7>Oh Yelp Elite... so this is what I've been missing out on all these years! This was my first Yelp Elite party and it was fabulous. I was surprised to see how many dressed up and stuck with the theme. I'm glad I dressed up or else I would have felt left out!The venue was interesting. My friends and I thought all the paintings and and decorated sugar skulls looked really cool. The large sugar skull in the back room looked amazing! I saw the shirts that were being designed but didn't get a chance to participate since we were busy engaging in all the other activities and the line was long. We'll have to come back and visit Sol Collective on a regular day.The food was catered by La Placita. I really enjoyed the pork, rice and salsa from La Placita. The pork alone had me sold and I'm looking forward to having dinner at La Placita with friends in the future to try their other menu items.The cupcakes from Vanilla Bean were delicious. They sweet, moist and melted in your mouth. Since I didn't try any of the alcohol I popped mini cupcakes instead.I could tell the drinks from Jose Cuervo were good and really strong. I determined this by the status of my friend post party- she only likes drinking fruity drinks (so it must have tasted good) and she was a little tipsy after. The DJ gets two thumbs up. We thought he did a really great job and enjoyed all the songs he played.We missed the face painting but did get two shots in the photo booth that night. Earlier in the the night there was no line and the booth was easy  to use. It was pretty self explanatory. Toward the end of the night I think we waited almost 15 minutes to take another picture because the owner said the booth was abused and having problems. In the end we did get our picture and thanks to the company for letting everyone get their picture taken before taking down the equipment. Thanks to Minh for the event pictures and Alex for a great start to the weekend and awesome party to honor the dead.
<review# 1833,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2011,11/25/2011,1059,313,4,27,17>For my 100th review I wanted a local business/service that really made an impact and so here it is. Bassil Kamas is a Massage Therapist in the Fair Oaks community. He is not the average Massage Therapist though. For ten wonderful years I made a living as a Massage Therapist as well and during that time I received hundreds of massages. Some OK and some good. Neither one of those terms describe Bassil's massage.  As far as I am concerned, Bassil is a true master of his craft.I arrived at Bassil's work place Thursday morning and I was immediately greeted with a smile and offered water. I filled out a basic form and then was escorted to the room I'd be receiving the massage. It was beautiful, it smelled great and the lighting and music were immediately relaxing. Bassil began the session by providing a few instructions which I appreciated as it prepared me for what was to come. I was experiencing some discomfort on the traps and neck area. I requested firm pressure and left the rest up to Bassil. This is what I would describe as a Massage with a purpose. His pressure was consistent, he made sure I was comfortable with it and really worked the areas of discomfort as well as the surrounding areas making every stroke count. The only areas ever exposed were those he was working on. His draping is excellent and I'm mentioning this because that is very important to me as I don't like feeling unnecessarily exposed. There was something not average about this massage or Bassil's touch. It was respectful, compassionate and with a purpose. I could feel Bassil's love for what he does through his touch. In my eyes massage is not a luxury but more like a necessity. The therapist should always keep the client in mind and make sure they are comfortable with the pressure, know his/her anatomy and be professional. I have finally found the perfect touch, the perfect therapist, the perfect match for me and for as long as Bassil chooses to perform this art and share it with others, I will be a loyal customer.
<review# 1834,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/20/2011,11/24/2011,209,356,10,15,17>Is "I love you" an acceptable review?I've been coming here a lot lately and am totally in love. They have a creative and crave-able vegan menu, but a robust and no-bullshit meaty menu to balance it out and make dragging your carnivore friends somewhere they don't want to go a thing of the past. I believe they even have gluten free options on many things.Things I have eaten so far that were totally bad ass: vegan potato taco, tri-tip taco, bacon cheeseburger (vegan and regular), lumpia (vegan and regular), loaded fries (cheddar, bacon, and sour cream), vegan Unicorn sandwich, falafel sandwich, and fried mushrooms. Actually, everything I've ordered from here has rocked. I've been bringing friends here and everyone leaves happy.If nothing else, come try their fries. They're like potato wedges (skin on and fresh), but cut into medallions, and then in half. I've never seen anything like them before and they are really flavorful.Service is really laid back and friendly. They can be a tad slow if they're busy, but for pete's sake just grab a pint and sit down for a few minutes. If you aren't 21, they have curb-side pickup. If you're 21 but too damn lazy, they have delivery. Prices are totally reasonable.Easily one of my favorites spots in Sacramento right now. See you there. Bring cash or be prepared to hit Round Corner's ATM.Also, I keep hearing that they're now serving breakfast. I'm going to need to get in on that ASAP.
<review# 1835,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2011,11/23/2011,63,109,11,14,15>This will definitely be one of my favorite certified farmer's markets in the area, not to mention that it's close to home and work! Great food, produce and music all around. The band, community tables, the smell of kettle corn and hot dogs - you really feel like you are at a festival in a way. The turnout on the opening day was great too, I was happy to see so many people attending. Mr. Stew D. Tomato was also present to take pictures!As far as prepared food, the selection was so surprisingly large that I had a hard time choosing  what to snack on until I saw Pooja Indian Grill. They have the best saag paneer! Wicked West pizza, tamales, hot dogs and numerous other sweet treats in addition to beautiful local cherries, mushrooms, tomatoes, strawberries...I could go on and on! There were also olive oil, bread, herbs/flowers,  and nut vendors and I'm sure I missed some. What a great way to stock up on fresh produce for the weekend!If you bike to the market, you can receive a "Market Buck" and if you take the bus you are eligible to receive a return fare. They even accept EBT, which is great since the money is going towards local businesses.As Borat would say "Great Success"!
<review# 1836,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/5/2011,11/22/2011,372,323,10,13,10>I've been here a bajillion times! But... I was waiting to get the perfect words down to describe this unique and lovable restaurant, known as Thai Chili.Food here is very well priced, two can leave full for under $20. It's the best combination of fantastic food + cheap prices = heaven.All time favorites have to be...Pad See Ew - flat rice noodles tossed and stir fried in a thai soy sauce, get it medium spicy. The broccoli in this dish are so freaaaaakin goooood!Avocado Curry - I like to get it with Chicken because chicken and avocado are lifelong lovers who get along together so well. Get this medium spicy as well, spoon it over the top of some hot steamed white rice and you won't regret ordering it!!Duck Curry - VERY RICH!!! But tasty!! Get it as spicy as you won't because nothing will cover up the flavor this baby is packing!Order up any of their house thai fried rice. It's to die for man... they even have some yummy desserts like Fried Banana with Cocconut Ice Cream, reading that already sounds dreamy right??I don't know how the chef's do it, maybe adding crack and overdoses of nicotine into their food. Whatever it is, keep doing it!! As long as it's legal.
<review# 1837,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2011,11/21/2011,147,109,13,12,16>Oh boy, well I guess the secret's out.  I've been holding off on this review so that I could have Mo Mo's all to myself but it seems that word of their amazing service and high quality meats have finally reached you.  Welcome.  Mo Mo's is the quintessential local butchershop with a limited bbq carryout menu and it's no wonder that in less than a year of opening, Mo Mo's has four and a half stars across just about 50 yelp reviews and a steady stream of loyal customers all day long.  The couple behind the counter are Glen and Sharon, and they turn up some awesome barbecue.  And it's not that crazy 'slow cooked for 17 hours' barbecue, Mo Mo's is more like 'I'm kickin' it with my friends and grillin' some amazing food' barbecue.But the menu isn't even where it's at.  Men, prepare the grill.  We're firin' it up tonight.  Glen, the owner, has apparently been a butcher all his career.  The man knows how to pick his meat.  The beef ribs, on the grill, will be like nothing you've ever tasted at a restaurant.  Juicy and flavorful, tender and meaty- two or three of these babies will put you to sleep.  Next, pork chops.  Guys, I burnt the SH*T out of these pork chops and they were STILL incredible.  Seriously?  SERIOUSLY?!  And last, you'll never guess it, but the boneless chicken leg and thigh will just about convince you that, "chicken: it's the ONLY white meat".  So, what's the damage?  Well, a rack of beef ribs, 3 fat pork chops and 4 pieces of chicken, all for around $20!?! That's cheaper than ONE ribeye steak from Whole Foods!So, admittedly, I kept this secret little gem from you, my friends, my yelp community,  yes.  But rightfully so!  I can't have all you rushing over there at once and making me wait 30 minutes for what should be a quick 10 minute carry-out of delicious bbq!  Why don't you just be grateful now you finally know about it.  Like I said before, Welcome.
<review# 1838,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/22/2011,11/20/2011,280,194,4,10,9>I don't know if it's men in uniform or just how they normally are, but I was greeted like a superstar and had superstar counter service as I waited for a take out order. I was given a complimentary water while I waited and was patiently advised and informed of the best selections that customers have chosen. Even the chef came out from the back to explain their Cole slaw after the hostess gave me a sample. I decided on the half catfish filet entree. It comes with 2 sides. After a quick and confusing review selection, I trusted Sunny's review and went all out. It's a little pricy I'm the $12 range but the quality was perfect. Let me begin by saying that although it does state half a fillet, that's half a fillet on the long side of a moderately sized catfish. It was perfectly crunchy and breaded. I too, think that this was given a deep fry and broiled treatment. After getting beyond the crispness of the breading, the filet itself was moist. I wasn't expecting this gourmet from a place like this. This dish would fall under my "best things I ever ate" list. Alongside with this tasty dish, I selected collard greens and their coleslaw. To me, an indication of how southern a place is is their greens. The smoked hammocks were tender and not dried out and the greens, all of the leaf and stem melted away, with every bite. The Cole slaw was the least of the favored dish. It just lacked a little oomph next to spiciness of the greens and the catfish. Their homemade tart sauce was delicious. I'm not even a tartar sauce kind of guy either. To me, this place was well deserving of a 4 star rating for service, vast selection of entrees and food preparation. I'd definitely come back again and again.
<review# 1839,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2010,9/25/2010,118,107,3,9,11>This was an awesome grand opening!   I don't know why it's not getting better reviews.  I had such a great time that night!  I had just become a Yelp Elite and received an email inviting me to the grand opening of Crescent Club and the theme being speakeasy/prohibition era.  I was stoked!  I love this period and especially the fashion at the time.  And there's a prize for the best dressed couple?  Okay, now I got really excited about coming up with a costume.  My BF and I RSVP'd and started to go to work on our costumes.  We even got a password to use.  I thought that was pretty cool.  We drove to old sac and found parking right away as someone else was just leaving.  We didn't know exactly where Crescent Club was in old sac, but we figured it's going to be walkable and couldn't pass up that parking spot.  We get out of the car, decked out in all our prohibition era attire and saw another couple dressed in the same style and decided to follow them.  We arrived around 9 ish and it was apparent that we were at the right place.  Ladies were looking sultry and the gentlemen dapper and dangerous.  Can you guys dress like this more often?  So hot!  We were surprised that we were able to walk right in and didn't need to use the password, but no biggie.  That would have been cool, but certainly wouldn't ruin the night.  At first I was confused and didn't know where to go, so my BF and I just wandered around.  We venture into the underground part and immediately get the sense of being transported back in time.  It felt mysterious, and also kinda naughty -- maybe I shouldn't be here, but it's good to be bad.  The place had pictures of naked girls on the walls.  *gasp* boobies! But they were drawings/paintings and went well with the theme.  The furniture and ambiance was on point.  There was this beautiful chaise lounge that I really wanted to take a picture with but it was occupied.  The music tied it all together.  I was a bit confused because I guess I was expecting free drinks and food, but then realized this was a grand opening, not a Yelp Elite event, so that made sense.  The BF and I ordered a vodka tonic for me and martini for him-- $5 each, not bad.  We went outside to the patio area for the wine tasting and got to sample this delicious ice wine and were told that we could get it from Nugget!  Then got in line to try the caviar.  It was so good.  I was expecting it to be salty, but it was delicious.  I can see why there's someone there serving you, and not help yourselves!  After that we saw our friends Heather C. (whom we met at my BF's very first Yelp Elite event) and BF Dan.  They are such good sports! You guys know what I'm talking about.  Dan got us absinthe with a sugar cube in it.  The sugar cube did not make much of a difference.  This drink is strong!  Be careful!  After that we heard on the loudspeaker that the burlesque show was going to start so we went back inside.  I was surprised at how risque it was.  This was the closest I've come to going to a strip club.  But the show was very entertaining.  We ordered some more drinks at the bar, took pictures, and watched a few more shows and before we knew it, it was past midnight.  We had a lot of fun meeting new people and the BF was having a blast, everyone wanted to play with his Tommy gun, which he made himself.   We were wondering if they were still going to do the costume contest and later the owner himself, Mike comes over and says we unanimously won!  Sweet!  Now we get a a free dinner and spa treatments?  How could this night get any better?  But it did!  Mike said that for the next 15 minutes, the bar would be serving drinks at Prohibition Era prices.  Yep, that means .50 a drink.  We ordered a couple of long beaches and Mike introduces us to his wife Natalya.  They are very nice and down to earth people and we even posed for a few pictures with them.   We decided to call it a night after watching the last burlesque show.  Sure there are a few kinks they need to work out, it's expected on opening night.  But that didn't prevent me from thoroughly enjoying myself.  It was definitely a night to remember.
<review# 1840,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/20/2010,9/24/2010,83,184,20,4,3>Ok, I am taking away a star. Why you ask? Because they took down the sign in the mens room that was so poorly written everyone was correcting it to say obscene things. HILARIOUS!The food here is still great, the line still a mess, and the ladies that work here make Hitler look friendly. They are really mean old Asian bitches, seriously. The only place I have ever had worse service or friendliness is Lai Wah. Just remember, when you approach the female staff here, you are insulting them simply by your presence. Do not expect them to smile, help you, or do anything other than scowl and take your money. I have seen more smiles at the DMV.
<review# 1841,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/16/2010,9/23/2010,58,48,35,14,19>The biggest complaint I hear about his place is "it's not Mexican" or "it's not authentic." So you're telling me that when you walk into a La Bou you're expecting the best croissant you've ever tasted  served to you by a guy in a mime outfit wearing a beret... When you go to a Pita Pit you expect a halal-filled menu and a few hookahs to puff on while you wait for your food? That Daphne's feta cheese will be aged to perfection and that when you visit Pancake Circus, you expect an elephant will walk by and take a dump on your table while you order a short stack of flapjacks? If you really expect to walk into a chain restaurant and be taken aback by the incredible authenticity of the food items it's paying homage to, you're kind of naive.Chiptole is the Pete's Coffee of  Mexican joints. Sure, there are a million small cafés  that serve up a stronger, tastier, albeit more expensive cup of brew - but the bottom line is Pete's is good stuff and perfect for when you're in a rush and just need some coffee.Same with Chipotle. It beats out La Salsa and Baja Fresh which are similar in comparison and it's quick, cheap and made with quality ingredients. If you're going into this place with the expectation of getting something your bisabuela would serve up on your quinceañera - you're loco.
<review# 1842,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2010,9/22/2010,434,368,3,4,7>Mr. Pickle's, I heart you. The dutch crunch bread is superb and the ingredients are fresh and delicious. The Big Jake is my favorite specialty sandwich. How can you go wrong with turkey, avocado and cream cheese?? You can't!! You can break the bank with that one for $7.49 though. Ouch! But it's way more worth it than a $5 foot long or $4 12 inch from other chain sandwich stores. I could barely finish the entire thing, but best believe i devoured that sucker. Big Jake had no chance.
<review# 1843,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2010,9/21/2010,574,469,25,11,14>Freeport Bakery makes beautiful cakes. If you need a cake for a special event, this is where you should get it if you're in Sacramento. My sister got our wedding cake here. It was small, special, and delicious. I don't remember much about my wedding but I do remember the cake. It was all gone. NO leftovers.My best friend Liz R. got our baby shower cake here, the strawberry-champagne variety. It was spectacular, and HUGE. We froze the leftovers because I was too out of control with it! Pregnant Johnna and huge champagne cakes DO NOT mix. (FYI: Their cake freezes well!)Liz also got me this little, bright neon green double-layered cake as a special gift for my baby shower. I ate the ENTIRE thing that night in front of the TV. 1 hour later, I threw up. I don't want to gross anyone out but I'm about to do it anyway: it was seriously the best-tasting throw up ever. I threw up after most meals all 10 months so this is significant.What I'm saying is that Freeport Bakery knows how to make a cake worthy of your special occasion, and that it's even good coming back up.
<review# 1844,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/28/2010,9/20/2010,119,121,5,7,6>With the heat that has set in this week, Cafe Morroco offers some great light and fresh menu options that won't make you feel all sluggish in the triple digits. My man friend and I went right before 6pm on Friday and completely beat the dinner rush. There was only one other occupied table in the place, so our friendly server was especially attentive and jovial. Really fun girl who likes to chat, but not in that "ok, go away, I'm here to eat...but not with you" kind of way.Chicken Sumac: Yum. Large portion of thin cut chicken breast with lemon and garlic flavors. Amazing tomatoes and onions on top...and I seriously don't know what they do to them, but they're fall apart tender, sweet, and unlike any way you've ever had an onion or tomato.Tabooli: Full of fresh herbs and lemon, tasty, but I prefer a lesser herb to bulgar wheat ratio.Hummus: Creamy and lovely.Falafel: I've never had falafel before so I don't have anything to compare this to, but I wasn't a fan. Reminds me of Long John Silver's hush puppies, but Middle Eastern? haha, I dunno.Would definitely visit Cafe Morocco again for their great service and tasty offerings.

If I don't get some help, my stressful life will wear away my molars! I was very nervous for my consultation appointment. I couldn't imagine that anything could be done for someone at my age. Even though this practice was quite busy, I was greeted by friendly (and calming) staff members. The office was decorated in a colorful tropical theme meant for children, but there were clients present of all ages. I received a very thorough exam that included full mouth with skull radiographs. Multiple angles of the jaw, that I didn't know I had. 2 different technicians prepared me for the doctor to ask questions, perform an exam and give all the options available. Braces at my age? Who'd a thunk! Dr. Oshetski was the best! Fun, friendly, AND nice to look at! He was very informative and knowledgeable about my concerns. He made me feel quite comfortable to think about my alternatives and to make a decision that I thought would be in my best interest. They had several ways to help people out financially if dental insurance is not available or qualified. Orthodontics is not cheap, but I've seen what's involved and it may be well worth a nice smile! My sister, brother-in-law, and my wonderful nephew have all been patients here. If you're thinking about corrective or cosmetic dental work, you've got to visit Dr. Oshetski! The consultation is free!

Plates2Go is a perfect addition to the neighborhood. Healthy salads and tasty sandwiches are on the menu, you can put your order in online, and they have a few tables inside if you want to eat and relax. The place is nothing fancy, just good food you can feel good about eating.

Who am I kidding, it's not like I ever go out on a Saturday anyway, might as well get up early and see what the old Sunday Market has to offer with more regularity and be a better citizen!I was there at 8 am sharp and the market was already fully in motion and crowded with the diverse, produce-seeking Sacramentans that make our unfriendly city so great. I got some GREAT parking where I could just take the produce to my car and continue shopping. But I think I accidentally parked in the farmers-only parking area, however, as by the time I was ready to bounce, my car was trapped by a bunch of vehicles and pick-ups that looked like they'd been in a dust storm for about a week.Some guy gave me a disapproving look and told me that I'd never get my car out of that spot and kinda sneered at me like I was some teenager. Clearly he did not know who he was dealing with, as I take that kind of communication as a challenge! Challenge accepted! After a 12-point turn and a friendly wave to Donny Downer, I was right on my way to the rest of my mundane Sunday. Most remarkable finds:Fresh black-eyed peas, from multiple sources! This is my most favorite bounty from the Farmers Markets recently, as they are such a challenge to cook with!Fresh cranberry beans (hooray for Zoey!) Fresh English peasSome beautiful carrots, with the greens still attached (which add a great flavor dimension to my almost-famous greens and beans)Hella cheese curds from Springhill Farms (I'm addicted)OkraOnions The prices are ... Eh, OK. The Farmers that are always here, the ones I recognize, are wonderfully helpful, but there were still a number of people peddling produce that couldn't even tell me what an item was, and didn't even try to find an answer for me, even with cash in my hand, ready to spend. Hello? Farmer employees need training too! Knowing what one is selling is the minimum expectation from anyone working at a farmer's market (or anywhere, right?) It's important to give a shit about what you do. I don't necessarily expect a vegetable orientation at a large-volume market like the Sunday one, but a short intro or a descriptive post-it will do! Honestly, this sort of crap that people don't think is that important has a lot to do with the widespread economic problem in this country, there is just no solid work ethic among workers. I'll tell you one thing, I have worked A LOT of seriously shitty jobs. But even at my most-broke moments, I would not sell something that I couldn't name. Why? Because I don't want to look like an idiot! That aside, the experience wasn't a loss. Admittedly, this is THE BEST time of the year for produce for me, I love what's in season right now (in mid-August.) But I can't pretend that the lack of knowledge among SOME of the sellers' staff doesn't put a downer on my Sunday Market experience. So I can't give this market 5 stars because there are other markets in Sacramento where there is more passion and where the dialogue surpasses petty consumption. I think Farmers Markets provide an essential education about what's going on in the world our food comes from (that we are so far-removed from living on or near the grid.) You are what you eat, you know. Other Sacramento Markets offer that with the same produce and a less-rushed vibe, which, in my opinion, is as good as it gets when it comes to shopping produce.But don't get me wrong. This market does offer a selection that is hard to beat. If one of these farmers starts selling escarole I might come around to a five star rating. Why isn't there any escarole at our farmers markets? Can someone clue me in? I live on escarole, dude. What gives? I'm a fan despite a conspicuous lack of escarole and the confused looks I get from the people taking my hard-earned dollar bills when I ask for it. This is California, is it not? youtube.com/watch?v=KBMx
<review# 1852,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2013,11/29/2013,642,604,24,30,30>My boyfriend and I were driving past the previously closed Marie Callendars restaurant several weeks ago and had noticed that a new restaurant was now under construction.  Seeing that the doors were open, we couldn't help but stop by and appease our curiosity.  As we walked up to the front entrance to take a peek, the owners were there and actually greeted us!  They were very receptive and friendly, and explained what kind of food and features they were going to have and gave us colorful to-go menus, so we could get an advance idea at what they offered with the prices.  The place was very nice and open inside with modern décor.  I couldn't wait to return and try them out!  The first thing we noticed on the menu was that the food is on the higher price range, so we decided to avoid the grand opening crowds and waited a little while to get a more personalized experience by arriving later on a Monday afternoon for the lunch special prices: (11:00 am - 3:30 pm).  There were several patrons eating by the time we were seated, but there are plenty of tables available to accommodate a large crowd.  We asked to be seated at the Hibachi grill, already prepared in advance as to what we were going to order.  I started out with a "Peachy Keen-Jini" specialty cocktail which was $7.00.  It had a nice fruity taste with a potent amount of alcohol in which I really enjoyed the flavor combination along with that relaxation effect.  Joe had a glass of Japanese iced green tea.  Next, I had the Hibachi Shrimp for $10.95 that included fried rice, vegetables and onion soup.  My boyfriend got the Filet Mignon for $12.95 which also included his choice of a bowl of white rice and a salad instead of getting soup.  We also wanted to try the Tempura Asparagus roll and ate it as an appetizer for $6.50.  Our waitress Stephanie was very nice and on the ball, giving us VIP service from making my cocktail, to serving our food, to checking on us several times throughout the meal.  Then, there was our funny and entertaining Hibachi chef.  He gave us a cooking show complete with juggling of utensils and pans.  However he was too fast for me to capture the highlights on camera.  It was nice to be able to give our food preferences to the chef, since I like my shrimp well done, and Joe K. likes his beef rare, besides having to make sure his food is free of salt due to his heart condition.  After our whole lunch experience was over, I couldn't help but rave to my boyfriend at how much I loved everything about this place!  The service and staff were wonderful, the food was excellent, and the atmosphere of the restaurant is very up scale and impressive.  I was disappointed to read that several other reviewers gave this restaurant poor ratings and would not come back.  I hope they read this and try again.  The Kobe Steak & Hibachi Grill & Bar is really worth giving it another try.  I definitely want to return and help keep them in business!
<review# 1853,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2013,11/28/2013,280,194,7,10,10>After spending quite literally over a hundred dollars on cookies here, in the past, I couldn't pass up an offer for a GroupOn to get more of my cookie fix. You get 14 cookies for fifty cents with your $10 GroupOn. That's a really good deal. Everyday, except Sunday, there is a great in a form of a special for you. The service is average. You just go in and order your cookies and if you have a GroupOn, they recommend you call ahead 24 hours in advance to get it ready for you. I really like the cookies as they are large, moist and delicious. I love the S'mores, Caramello, Chocolate mint, and well mostly all of them. I miss the pumpkin brownies, but that's a seasonal item. They do have specialty trays you can buy for gifting, as I have done before. I'm glad to say, I'll be a long time customer.
<review# 1854,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2013,11/27/2013,523,171,7,13,7>I've heard nothing but awesome things about this place! Considering I am a Roseville High grad, and this cafe is owned by 4 of it's graduates I had to come support them.A friend and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon, and this place was busy! All different age groups were here for a great meal.I recently had hip surgery, and am currently using a walker to help me get around. We were immediately greeted at the door and told that they were bussing a booth for us since it would be more comfortable. We had a minimal wait of 3 minutes and were walked to a nice booth. The host even offered to store my walker at the side door and to let him know when I was done so he could bring it back. HELLO! I love good customer service!!Our waitress was friendly, and prompt, and the iced green teas we ordered arrived quickly. Let me tell you, these were good green teas too! They weren't watered down at all.My friend ordered the mandarin salad, which we were intrigued by since the menu description mentioned a Chochula vinaigrette? MUST TRY! She also ordered the french dip with caramelized onions, and I ordered the hamburger with fries. I have to say when her order came I was quite jealous! That sandwich looked amazeballs. She loved it. Her salad looked beautiful, and was topped with fresh strawberries. I had to taste it. The dressing wasn't as spicy as we had hoped, but still had a small kick to it.My burger was cooked perfectly medium, and the focaccia bun made the burger. So buttery and crisp! The fries felt like they were cooked in some diner, nicely crunchy on the outside, and warm and soft on the inside. The burger was so big I could only eat half! The fries were plentiful too.We'll both definitely be back here, as we heard rave reviews about their breakfasts, and of course to support good ole RHS Tiger alumni!
<review# 1855,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/5/2013,11/26/2013,420,355,11,15,13>Wow, this place is quite the experience.  We got there about 15 minutes before they opened and there was already a Line of about 30.We got seated no problem and lots of sushi was waiting for the masses.The way it works is you help yourself to the prepared rolls at either end of the sushi bar and/or place your order for specialty items with one of the workers behind the bar.  Lunch is $14.95 Wednesday - Monday and dinner $18.95.  I believe it is $1 less all other days...I went prepared after studying Yelp reviews of what others order and I was glad I did cause those items were better than the plates sitting out.  If you want wasabi you have to ask for it because there is none to be found to help yourself.My favorite dish was the spicy seared salmon and the large sashimi which included salmon, yellow tail, red tuna, octopus, red snapper and one other fish similar looking to yellow tail.  Huge pieces and fresh!The service our group of five received was superb. We had dishes cleared regularly and drinks filled too. The great service made me not mind the crowdedness of the place.My only complaint is that the soft served ice cream machine was out of order and the sign looked like it has been for a while...This is def not the best sushi I have had but it is the best buffet sushi I have had! Will make the trip out to EG just to eat here again.
<review# 1856,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2013,11/25/2013,283,229,5,12,11>This is the nicest bowling alley I have ever seen! I went there with my family for my mothers birthday outing. We had a groupon. They got to us very quickly considering it was a Saturday and packed. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Our lane had a table next to it, so we were all able to sit. For two hours we played four games easily. The machine keeps score for you! We received a pitcher of soda and a pizza with the coupon. Even without the coupon the pitcher is affordable and comes with 1 free refill. My family said the pizza was super good as well. The arcade has a variety of games. I loaded $20 on the card and was able to play for over an hour. The tickets prizes have a great variety. We traded in for a hot potato pool game. This is a great location with a huge parking lot. It was easy to find and I will definitely be back.
<review# 1857,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2013,11/24/2013,335,135,9,11,11>Ricks saved me today. I needed to get a carrot cake last min (I never plan ahead!) and would you believe it but grocery stores don't make carrot cakes! Blasphemy!!!So, I called Ricks around 5 and inquired about my orange yummy elusive friend. The gal who answered said she only had one full one left! So I asked hesitantly, "Does this mean you can't sell it to me?".  She says she didn't think so. But I hear her ask another gal and she said, "Of course she can have it!"  Yeah buddy!So I come pick it up. I was nice and waited in the super long line although I did think about skipping up just to see what would happen but no time for pushing the envelope today. Need to focus. I buy the cake. Leave a nice little tippy tip and the gal even brings it out and sits it in the passenger seat for me. So freaking awesome. This is customer service. On a side note. It was delicious. Whoever said before it wasn't good .. The carrot cake ... You are nuts! Like legit crazy bc that thing was delicious. I've had some of their other treats and it's worth it! Everything. Such a cute place and I cannot wait to visit them more and more. Maybe ill go tomorrow!!! Who knows. I'm so happy with them I might have to tell the owner or manager!! Thank you Rick's and the ladies who worked last night (Sat night the 17th!!!) you are all awesome.
<review# 1858,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2013,11/23/2013,305,464,8,7,8>I am a fan of the curd, and I don't trust people who aren't (lactose intolerant or not, take a damn lactase pill and indulge). This spot is a must-try for the cheese connoisseur, and those wishing to become one.I plan on getting fat n' happy while I make my way down the list of their tempting grilled cheese sandwiches (about 5 to choose from), and the Mac N' Cheese dishes (one with and one without, hog).On days I'm feeling a little too fat, I'll opt for one of the many enticing cheese boards. Cause ya know, accompaniments are of the fruit and veggie sort (olives, fruits, cornichons, etc.). And as I'm tea-totaling, I was thrilled that they offer some damn good soda options, one of which is now my new fav (Bundaberg - lemon/lime n' bitters). Anyone know where I can buy this brand locally, help a gal out!They have a nice selection of wine and beer. Oldman indulged me on this venture to whet my appetite and curiosity. He's a meat n' potatoes kind of guy and, therefore, a Budweiser fan. So the nice bartender gave him a taste of a beer from a brewery straight outta Rancho Cordova. He seemed to enjoy (but, I don't think he's ever met a beer he didn't like).He even inhaled half of the grilled cheese sandwich we shared, and got a little stabby when I tried to mack on the last bite of his half! I now know there's a secret food snob in him somewhere. We shared the Camembert, Comte and Crimini sandwich. It was delicious. I really liked that the camembert was warmed just right (not melted), it came with a side of lightly-dressed mixed greens (Oldman ate that too). I was already planning my next meal, while still snarfing on that crimini sand... just hoping they still have the grilled cheese with shitake mushrooms on their menu. If not, I'll just go straight for the dessert made with Brillat-Savarin and wash it down with that lovely bitter Bundaberg.
<review# 1859,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/1/2007,6/8/2008,260,392,2,7,6>This colorful little food stand never fails to capture my attention when driving by on a hot Sacramento summer afternoon.  The orange trailer appears like the mirage of an oasis, offering cool relief under its swirling blankets of water droplet mist.Although I never tried their Orange Freeze on a hot summer day, I have managed to sample their hot dogs and sandwiches during some unseasonably beautiful November weather.  The outdoor seating is of huge appeal on days too nice to spend entirely indoors.  I made my way down here while attending a Biophotonics symposium held at the Oak Park Research Building just a block or so away.Hot dogs are decent but a bit skimpy.  I'd order two next time to fill the void.  They sling a pretty tasty Pastrami Reuben, though.  I did try the Orange Freeze since it came with a combo meal, but I'm sure it won't completely hit the spot until Hellfire reigns down from the sky, as it is wont to do on certain overbearing triple-digit Sacramento summer days.
<review# 1860,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2008,6/7/2008,43,15,8,12,12>On the evening of Tuesday, June 3rd, my buddy Stephanie and I made our way over to Randall Selland's newest culinary venture: Ella Dining Room and Bar. After depositing my car with the able-bodied valets, Stephanie and I made our way into the dining room at Ella and were instantly impressed by the dcor. Immediately in front of you is a cold bar, chock-full of ice which is chilling the day's selection of Oysters, marinated olives, and ceviche. On the ceiling and some of the walls are rustic, multi-colored wooden shutters. Very warm.We began our evening by ordering a Cucumber Martini and an Elderflower Gimlet - both were smooth and oh-so-enjoyable! This was paired with the olive oil, citrus, garlic and rosemary marinated olives. They were EXCELLENT!Happily, the restaurant was booked (strange for a Tuesday) and when our server inquired as to whether we had any time constraints, we were happy to tell him "no. We'd love to just take our time!" After enjoying our olives, we ordered two small plates to share (actually, we shared everything the entire evening) as well as a yummy bottle of Chenin Blanc from Mulderbosch Winery in South Africa. The first small plate we received was the Pan-Seared Diver Scallops with Mushrooms and Coconut Broth. There were two scallops on the plate and they were HUGE. Cooked to perfection with a nice caramel-colored sear, the scallops were cut-with-a-fork and melt-in-your-mouth amazing... And the broth? We wanted to lick the bowl. The second small plate we tried was a fabulous serving of Gnocchi with Broccolini, Parma Prosciutto, Organic Cream and Shaved Parmesan. Oh. My. God. The gnocchi were perfectly light and fluffy little clouds of love and the sauce? Wow. I want to cry just thinking about it...After these two small plates, we continued perusing our way through the menu and ordered a vegetable dish: Roasted Baby Beets with Pistachio, Watercress and Olio Nuevo Olive Oil. The beets were sweet and perfectly roasted. The pistachios and watercress, although not plentiful, provided a wonderful contrast in texture and this dish was also heavenly.Two entres were then shared by Stephanie and I: Raviolis of Mushrooms and Fresh Goat Cheese with Leeks and Black Truffle Butter and Pan Roasted Halibut with Giant Rock Shrimp, Dill and English Pea Tortellini. For the first entre, four giant, triangular-shaped raviolis adorned the plate with a naughtily-delicious black truffle butter and topped with a few dollops of goat cheese. The pasta was cooked to a perfect (yep, there's that word again) al dente and the mushroom filling was definitely enhanced by the flavor of the truffle butter. The halibut, like the scallops enjoyed at the beginning of the evening, was seared to a beautiful caramel color and the fish itself, even without the buttery dill sauce on the plate, could have been described as buttery. The sear provided an excellent crunch, the rock shrimp were tender and delicious and the filling of the English pea tortellini was a vibrant green that made you think of peas fresh-picked from the garden. All-in-all, each plate that was placed in front of us was...heavenly.Stephanie and I closed the evening by sharing a glass of Michele Chiarlo Nivole Moscato d'Asti from Piedmont, Italy as well as the Milk Chocolate Peanut Butter Bombe. And yes, you saw this pun coming, the Bombe really was........wait for it.........the bomb. We were very impressed with this restaurant and look forward to more trips back.  From the decor to the excellent service to the remarkable food, everything was wonderful and perfect. Even the ladies' room...
<review# 1861,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2008,6/6/2008,40,133,8,9,10>5 Stars.  For SURE.We went to Ink last night for dinner, after being unable to agree on a restaurant (why my husband continues to think Chipotle suffices as a restaurant is beyond me).  I was a little wary since I haven't been to Ink in about 3 years, and was less than impressed with their food last time.Food?  AMAZING.  My pulled pork sandwich had a superb Guinness sauce, and my fries were perfectly crisp.  Great portions, too, enough to give me one more layer of the backfat I love so much.  My husband's meatloaf sandwich was extremely good, down to the crispy parmesan bread.  My rum and coke was STRONG.  The bartender heartily greeted us when we came in, and our server was perfect:  didn't invade our table too much, but was always there when we needed him.Great atmosphere, awesome food, service is perfection.  Ink is my new hangout.
<review# 1862,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2008,6/5/2008,287,292,5,6,7>After hearing about this place for years from Jessica L. I finally had the chance to go this weekend. The Y2K Roll is delicious and HUGE. Worth every penny of the $14 it costs. It is about 2-3 rolls in one. Tempura shrimp, spicy tuna, avocado, and a whole bunch of other stuff. Absolute heaven! The staff here is fantastic. They were eager to find the answers to my hundred ingredient questions regarding my allergies. I could not eat the A-town roll (one of their most popular) but I didn't care because I am not a huge spicy fan anyways. The waitress made jokes and the sushi chefs seemed to be having fun with the people at the bar. I will definitely be visiting Osaka again next time I'm in the area. ps- Apparently this place gets crowded so come early during 'rush hour'.

<review# 1864,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2008,6/3/2008,9,33,6,7,6>This review is based solely on two glasses of California wine, two bowls of New England clam chowder and two fancy Shirley Temples - one in a tall glass and one dispersed liberally on the table, window and floor of this spanking new restaurant.The ex, the kidlet and I have been biking by this site for years on the bike trail, watching with anticipation as the ugly construction site gradually made a metamorphosis into an elegant swan of a hotel impressively situated on the bank of the Sacramento River.  Like nosy neighbors, we wanted to check it out.It's a beautiful location with sweeping river views and the owners don't seem to have spared any expense on the Mediterranean-style hotel with its lavishly terraced grand promenade/patio.  The restaurant itself is on the ground floor of one half of the hotel. The walk back to the restaurant from the parking lot is long, but who cares with the gorgeous river, hotel, and marina across the water to look at? We meandered past the outdoor patio which had three, cozy glassed-in firepits blazing away and into the packed restaurant.  Scott's is going to be a superb river hangout in the summer.All we wanted was a glass of wine and a kid's drink, but the lounge area was already full, so we grabbed a table between the lounge and main dining room. I have to say, I found the dining room artwork odd - one whole white wall was covered with white extrusions of what? Plaster? Representing I couldn't tell what - maybe nothing. We weren't close enough to get a good look, but I didn't care for it much. But the staff was plentiful, welcoming and friendly. Did I mention that the whole place is brand new? The exceedingly pleasant waitress had no problems with two glasses of local wine and a kid's drink even though it was crowded dinner time. Great, she said, when we decided on chowder too. The chowder was - good. I'm a big chowda hound from back east and have had the best (Little place in Fanueil Hall Marketplace in Boston, anad Legal Seafoods is top notch too). Scott's chowder is good - doesn't taste floury, it's cream-based and smooth, with chunks of real clam (not the beige elastic kind you get in some chowders). I would have preferred a more flavorful, oceany broth, maybe a little more clam juice in the mix, but it was still good.They delivered the big bowls and a small cup for my daughter and pow - kidlet knocked over her tall Shirley Temple glass dead on  - with sticky sweet liquid spewing across the NEW glass-topped table, spattering all over the beautiful NEW picture window, and running down the spanking NEW wall and over into the clean NEW carpet. Scotts' service is exceptional. A small army of wait people had the mess quietly cleaned up in less than 60 seconds. A new drink was whisked to my child (although with only 1 cherry this time, not 3) and we weren't charged for it. After paying the bill and exiting through the luxe front entrance I was still mortified and red-faced, but the ex took it in stride."You've blessed the new restaurant," he said to our daughter.
<review# 1865,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2008,6/1/2008,114,76,,16,13>Located on the southwest corner of Stockton and Broadway, in the little strip mall just behind Subway, you'll find a very welcomed addition to the neighborhood in the form of Boon Boon Cafe. It's not fancy, but it is a pleasant little place, with indoor seating for about 45, and an outdoor patio I'd bet will become very popular this summer.I stumbled upon this little gem last Friday after my hairdresser raved about it to me and passed along one of the take away menus. Hmmmm...."owned and operated by people who love quality food, but don't beleive it should be forced into catagories such as Thai, Japanese, American or Italian"........the food selection looked so interesting, and was not far from my home, so I decided to take two friends there for dinner later that evening.We were met with a big smile by Linda, one of the owners. She and her mother, Thai born "Mama Pranee" opened the restaurant May 1st and are proud to serve what they refer to as family delicacies and recipes they've picked up while traveling throughout the world. All items are made from scratch with the freshest ingredients. It seems Mama Pranee has worked in some impressive local Thai restaurants, so there's no shortage of cooking experience.We ordered the Crispy Shrimp Rolls ($6.95 for 6 pieces). They came with a very unique, light and  delicious sweet and sour sauce.  We followed with an order of Som Tum (green papaya salad - $7.95) which has a really nice kick of fresh garlic, chili and lime sauce scattered over the grated green papaya and deeply flavored tomatos. We also ordered the Chicken yellow curry ($7.95) which was rich, and loaded with chunks of fresh veggies as well as plenty of chicken, and followed with the Spicy Drunken Noodle Chicken (my personal favorite! and only $7.95) Those drunken noodles...well, they get their very own paragraph they're just that delicious. Hand made by Mama, the noodles are wide, juicy and almost desert-like. They come glazed in a slightly sweet and garlicky, but somewhat spicy brown sauce which compliments all of the fresh veggies and generous inclusion of fresh Thai basil. I loved them so much I went back tonight under the guise of getting a menu and some background on the new owners for this very revue.We washed it all down with some awesomely refreshing Japanese Milk Tea which reminded me of a much lighter, and less sweet version of Thai iced tea.  Damages for a dinner for three? $33.00 plus tip! And these were really generous portions - in fact, we took a nice sized to go container with us. I would have ordered the fresh Mango with sweet sticky rice, but we were just too stuffed!The menu also includes items such as Chicken Samosas, Sweet Peanut Salad, Poached Salmon, Southern Great Steak (A HUGE rib eye) 8 Hours Roasted Pork, Super Crab Fried Rice, Chicken Teriaki, Korean Bar-B-Que, and Mixed Vegtab;e Tofu. Prices range from $2.95 to $15.95, with 90% of the menu falling into the $7.95 price range.The only reason I didn't give Boon Boon 5 starts is due to parking being a tiny bit tricky and the fact that pan handlers are a bit of an issue when entering or exiting. Other than that, the restaurant is very clean, the staff very friendly and truly interested in making you happy, while also earnestly requesting feedback on how they can continue to improve. If you get an opportunity, please drop by and try this place out, I don't think you'll be disappointed - and we really should support new business' that are doing all they can to improve Stockton Blvd.
<review# 1866,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/19/2008,5/30/2008,28,47,13,8,7>I really wanted to like Tuli. Like the best ever. But, it just wasn't happening for me. I went with friends last Friday night and to my surprise we were able to get seated immediately on the patio (which wasn't unbearbly hot given the circumstances). So we started off well. Ordered a bottle of pinot grigio which was supposed to have been chilled already, but wasn't. They did compensate by pouring us each a glass while we waited for the wine to chill. Dismissable slip up, but still odd to not have all whites on chill given the warm weather. I don't like how the server got all deep and asked me, "Do you know about dining here and how our small plates work?" As if I was some sort of retard trying to understand string theory. It is food, you eat it. Off a plate, a small plate. WoooWhen you try really hard to emulate a certain style and you take it too seriously you f*ck it up. ...Thats what I think is going on with Tuli. They're too serious about the food. Lighten up. Start with not overcooking my quail. Disappointed.
<review# 1867,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2008,5/29/2008,27,17,,9,7>One cannot judge a restaurant on food tastiness alone. To properly judge a restaurant, one must also take into account value in relation to quality. It is a rare place that nails both high quality and high value and when this holy grail is reached, 5 yelps is most deserving.Mati's Indian Express has reached this lofty distinction. Its a nondescript sort of place with zero ambiance provided by the Natomas strip-mall location and meager appointments. Furthermore, the food is mostly not-cooked to order, instead displayed in a wide bar-type food warmer behind expansive glass. Food is served on the same plastic tray/bowls regardless if its "for here" or "to go". So what. The food rocks plus they'll dump a ton of it in your plastic bowl.I'll recommend everything I ate there. The rice was aromatic and perfectly cooked hinting of flowers; as well prepared basmati rice should. The lamb curry is a ground lamb with a delicious brown curry sauce - spicy enough to break a bead on my forehead. The chicken tiki masala and butter chicken was ridiculously good. Chunks of moist chicken (all white meat I believe) drowning in their respective sauces.For our vegetable choices, my dinner companion and I opted for the cauliflower/potatoes dish and garbanzo beans Chana Masala. Not being particularly fond of veggies, I ate them nevertheless. Samosa were paired with mango chutney (good) and their Tamarind Chutney (GREAT).Rounding out the meal was the requisite naan bread (garlic naan - go for this option) to sop up the delicious sauce. My beverage choice was their mango lassi which I enjoyed tremendously and helped to assuage the meal's heat.The only mis-step in my opinion was the kheer. I'm no kheer expert but I would've enjoyed a bit more sweetness.The above was 2 "meals" as defined by Mati. However, this easily stretches out to 4 meals even for this particularly large eater.Mati's -- delicious and tremendously high value -- I deem you the best Indian restaurant in Sacramento.
<review# 1868,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/18/2008,5/28/2008,241,184,5,5,5>Interestingly enough, going through people's reviews, no one ever wrote about what happens to pasta once dinner time is over and it becomes a club.  In fact, i don't think i ever went there during their normal business hours, so i can comment on the food or the wait staff.  I can tell you about how freakin crazy it was with all the people trying to pack into the dance floor.  When i was in Davis, this place had opened not too long ago and at that time there was still room on the dance floor to actually dance and there wasn't a huge line to get in, nor was there a cover.  Later on was when it started to become more like cantina.  Some of my best memories were there.  In fact one of my last college nights out was at pasta with all my friends and we danced and drank like maniacs.  Drinks were relatively good, although the lines were massive at the bar.  The music was okay and i believe you could actually request music and the DJ would play it.  The crowd was pretty awesome as well.  All in all it was pretty okay.  Nothing to be super excited about.  I haven't been back to Davis in a while, but i hope they didn't stop their clubbing nights.
<review# 1869,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2008,4/18/2008,1168,790,3,9,5>Outstanding burger & sandwich joint, open from 7 am (breakfast) to 8 pm (lunch/dinner).I had the "Cafe Burger," ($4.99) which comes with fries.  The fries are seasoned with a very light dusting of salt & other seasonings. The burger needed to be cut in half with a knife, because its really two burgers and my wife doesn't like to see me eating this huge sandwich all at once.  The patty is 1/3 pound and was grilled to perfection.  I asked for Medium Rare to Medium (pink in the middle) and it was exactly as ordered.Wifey had the Grilled Ahi sandwich ($7.99) She drank water, I had a soda, the entire bill was around $17 including tax & tip.About the same price as two burgers with fries & one drink at Squeeze Inn.  I didn't find the place cramped at all, this place has beautiful tile floors and a granite style countertop that surrounds the bay window that overlooks the car port.  Bathroom was super clean!Their web site gives a little background about the Husband-and-Wife owner-operators:"Chef Jose Silva has over 20 years experience in the food industry. He found his passion for food at the young age of 13 when he helped his mother and father create delicious meals at their family restaurant. In his adult years, Jose has made a career of managing major restaurant chains and training the next generation of chefs. Jose's dream was to one day open a restaurant of his own. This dream has now come to fruition.Laura Silva believes in the marriage between fine foods with reasonable prices. Her specialty is catering from "everyday to gourmet." With seven years experience in the food industry, Laura will make all of your special events memorable."I'll second that.....I just nominated them for "Best Burger Joint" in the KCRA Channel 3 A-List poll for 2008, and I hope some other Yelpers will join me in voting for Jose & Laura!!!

<review# 1871,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2008,4/16/2008,636,38,2,9,9>I have had so many amazing experiences at this bar. I've seen shows that I will smile to recall for the rest of my life. But it was when I was in a band that I really came to appreciate Old I. They gave us a chance when nobody knew who we were. If we were willing to work hard and promote ourselves they noticed and rewarded us. The sound guys were always great. WE GOT PAID! We were totally wiling and eager to play anywhere, any time and didn't expect to get paid. It still pissed me off though if someone would offer money and then not come through (Press Club) but Old I always delivered. They told us the deal up front and they stuck to it. And if we were too amped from playing and left without our little envelope of money you could bet it would be waiting for us behind the bar the next day. I love Sacramento and Old I is one of the reasons why. Looking forward to many more great shows.

<review# 1874,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/17/2008,4/12/2008,301,846,5,4,7>The dense crowd wouldn't have bothered me so much if it didn't keep pushing me into the danger zone of the dartboard. Drunks + metal darts + my soft body = Not Good. Maybe if I bribed the guy throwing the darts, he could clear the crowd a bit so I could get a drink...Given the heavy crowd, the 2 bartenders were doing a great job of serving up drinks and making change quickly. The Scottish decorations meshed well with the dark wood, creating a comfortable feel. Nothing outstanding, but a solid bar for a pint.Trivia: In Scottish, "lair" refers to a burial-plot in a graveyard. Maybe the restaurant name indicates that you'll go to that plot a happy person if you first have a night in the pub... :)Trivia 2: No, you're not hallucinating. My original write-up was mistakenly about a different business I was at that night. What can I say; I was having a great time.
<review# 1875,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/8/2008,4/11/2008,28,36,1,11,10>I have been both a customer and a previous employee at the Beat, so I've heard every perspective on variety, availability, pricing, business practices, and integrity as an independent music store. Since I have a fairly longstanding history here, I would like to contribute a few key points.1) Amoeba is obviously crowned king of that field anywhere from here to the bay area, but the Beat does have something to offer if you have some time and patience to search for what you want. It's especially a great place for vinyl hunters to browse. When I make my quarterly trip to Amoeba, I'm prepared to spend at least five hours rifling through their store. Even then, it can take mutiple visits to check off items on my wish list. The search is part of my enjoyment, and I make great finds that most people probably overlook. You may be lucky and find the one specific item you think of on any given day, but I have found that's usually not the case; a lot of it has to do with "being in the right place at the right time". If your parameters are too narrow, you're going to be frequently disappointed (...and that applies to a lot of things). I suggest keeping a broader list and working through it gradually.2) The Beat started off as a tiny store on the outskirts of midtown and gradually worked its way into a bigger, more centrally located space. With ever-increasing commercial rental prices, their overhead costs have skyrocketed. Do you have any idea what the cost per square foot is for any location on J Street? Quite a few people criticize the store for "selling out" by carrying mainstream music, but for any one person who wants to buy indie/punk/ eclectic genres, there are five people who want to buy bubblegum/commercial/top-40 music. So do the math...how else would one generate the needed revenue? I don't care for that filler any more than you do, but it's the owner's perogative to carry more of what sells in volume. They haven't completely abandoned independent music, it's just being heavily supplemented to keep the business going. 3) The pricing is high on new CDs, but I generally don't spend $18.79 on a new CD anyway. We all have recourse to find it used or buy it online. With the options available, try working around getting gouged and be more resourceful.4) Promos definitely shouldn't be priced for sale, and that's a whole other issue. It is not an advisable business practice, and a lot of people miss out on potential new material to sample. :-(5) I do have to contest generalized assertions made by previous posts that the staff are musically illiterate and indifferent."The Beat is terribly overpriced, understocked and staffed by people who really don't give a damn."or "don't blame the hipsters they hire, tho. they just want to work in a record store. just don't ask them anything about things like, oh i don't know, music."(**Oh, by the way, I could probably dance circles around you in some across-the-board music trivia**)Like any other retail store with relatively high turnover rates, the service you get varies greatly on who happens to help you (and how you treat them). The best of the best generally don't work for $7.00-$9.00 an hour to be at your disposal (and hello, don't ask an 18 year-old girl at the counter about music produced the same year she was born). There are a handful of proficient, well-versed people who would surprise you if given the opportunity. Try asking for the person best suited to your needs.The ideal super-cool music store with picture perfect rarities, a life-time staff of dedicated music experts & rock bottom prices doesn't exist anymore. Amoeba's about the closest you're gonna get to that. But whether the coveted obscurities are on vinyl, CD, or digital format I've learned to work around obstacles and do some legwork for the things I really want. Of course there's room for improvement at the Beat, but you could do a whole lot worse. I for one hope it manages to stick around.
<review# 1876,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/26/2007,4/10/2008,464,293,7,8,11>Average Sunday Morning, 2003. We are trying to think of somewhere to go for breakfast. We are all a little hung over. We are all a little poor. We run through the laundry list of usuals. "Cafe Bernardo?" someone utters. No, too expensive. Too bright. Too yuppy. "Cornerstone?" another friend suggests. "No way. I saw a rat there one time," Ray, my curmedgeon complainer friend declares.The indecision is getting stupid. I am getting angry and hungry. My breath is boozy and my tummy is trying to decide whether to eat or spew. I flip through the seldom used Entertainment Book my grandma gave me, and I see The Capitol Casino on 16th St. near Downtown Ford. No one had ever been there.And so we went, and it has been our regular spot for the last 4.5 years. It is fast, clean, cheap, spacious, unpretencious and cool. The food is average breakfast fare - nothing spectacular. But the prices are damn good! The service is great! Sit with Veda if you can - she is a totally old school good time.
<review# 1877,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2008,4/8/2008,57,117,6,8,4>This rating is based entirely on Heather's Sunday Bloody Marys.  I have been here on several occasions and found the food to be overpriced, yet tacky and cheap.  I happened upon here one day with a killer hangover and Oh Mylanta!  That girl can sure make a good bloody mary.  If you ever have a Sunday to go and drink... GO.If you must eat, the happy hour tacos are more than decent
<review# 1878,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/18/2007,4/5/2008,40,38,16,13,11>Damn, my feet hurt.  Working in a middle school office is not for those who like to wear heels - especially when the custodian is MIA and the lockers are jammed, and your TA has the flu and can't get your attendance and you have to go to every single classroom to pick it up yourself and the teachers don't have it ready and you have to stand there tapping your toe.I really don't want to cook tonight, and I don't want to drive far.   Guess we're going out again.  But, where to eat?"Sandwich," yells the kid!  "Meat!"  yells the husband!  Close, says the mom, so that means it's Plaza Hof Brau.  Like all wives and mothers, I'm self-sacrificing.  I know I'm giving up table service to give my men some meat, but a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do (to get out of cooking,) so off we go.As I approach the entrance, I say a silent hello to the empty Tower Records store, where Metallica once played and before that, bouffant-haired teenagers swooned over Elvis Records.Those bouffant-haired teenagers are now elderly people ahead of me in line inside the Hof Brau.  I wait, staring alternately at the glowing stained glass windows near the door and the glowing meat behind the counter.  Carvers in white coats and tall toques stand behind the glass case, swiftly dissecting a turkey or side of beef with their sharp knives as people shout their order.  The line inches towards the front, leaving plenty of time to examine the menu posted above the carvers.A french dip sounds good tonight.  My husband asks for an open faced hot turkey sandwich, and child gets a turkey sandwich on a roll.  The way it works is:  you ask your carver for your food, he carves it for you deftly and places it on your tray.  You slide the tray to the next station, where you get your side dishes.  Husband and I both get a green salad with ranch dressing (real hidden valley ranch made from a package, not a bottle) and son gets canned peaches. Really.  Canned peaches.  You can even get cottage cheese with them.  I love mid-century.Everything comes on a melamine tray and the bowls are cute little plastic things that make a satisfying sound as they get dropped on your tray - just like you used to get in coffee shops in the 60s.  Next stop:  pickles.  They have a big bowl full of sliced pickles that - even if they are Clausen - taste better because they are free and you put them in those cute white paper bowls and can have as many as you want.It wouldn't be cafeteria style if you didn't get to slide your tray past a case of pies and cakes.  We looked, we didn't touch.  (We touched when we slid by the beer case.)We paid, we sat...ahhh....relief!  I sip my beer, slathered my french dip with the horseradish out on the table, and dig in to the perfect au jou.  Remembering I will review this for fellow Yelpers, I say, "Honey, can I have a taste of yours?"  The open-faced turkey sandwich is exactly the way it's supposed to be:  white bread, mashed potatoes, turkey all covered with gravy and just a tablespoon of cranberry.  So good!!  So very 60s!  No wonder the bouffants like it.Okay, my feet feel better and the meat has entered my bloodstream.  I can make it home to sleep, and start the next day.  Bye-bye, Tower.
<review# 1879,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2013,12/13/2013,591,132,8,9,7>This is the place for a fine delicious breakfast! After our Breast Cancer walk at the Capitol we decided to find some brunch and came across this place on Yelp. I had a large appetite and the pictures from their Yelp page uploaded by other fellow foodie Yelpers did this place justice. Also another friend had suggested the place as well so therefore our decision was made. There's a little bit of parking on the side of the restaurant. I actually lucked out and found one spot open to park! On a Sunday morning/afternoon it can get quite busy. We arrived at 11am and got seated for a table of five within 25minutes. While waiting I noticed a few things, they take check or cash only and you don't withdraw money from the ATM but rather from The bATMan. I see what you did there.Eventually seated by the corner window where you can see the vines crawling up the exterior side of the window, we were served water into small cups from a glass bottle pitcher. Fancy. The water was a little warm so instead of opting for just water with my meal I decided to get the Arnold Palmer. ARNOLD PALMER ALERT! For my meal, I had to go with Roast Beef Hash with eggs sunny side up. Best breakfast I ever had. Eggs were perfect the I like them. A slice of bread was thicker than any breakfast I've ever had. The hash browns were made unlike any way I've ever seen. It's definitely not frozen boxed hash brown. And then finally topped with a favorable amount of roast beef with a side of horse radish. Everything was magnificent, so many fresh flavors into this dish. My friend who recommended the place had the avocado omelet. That looked amazing as well. I will most definitely get back here to try their pancakes and French toast!
<review# 1880,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/16/2013,12/12/2013,83,90,8,12,9>Oh pho, how I've missed you!This place is hella good, simple menu that's reasonably priced and all vegetarian. I haven't tried their other dishes as I only go here when I'm craving some yummy pho but my friend has and said her dish was really good too. It comes with so much, I'm always stuffed! It's also very close to 'my hood' so I can get all my stuff done while in the area instead of like Noble Vegetarian being in the middle of no where. (Don't get me wrong, I love Noble Veg.!) Beautiful interior, very nice, relaxing and clean. The service is lacking though, only down side of this place. The girl does not even feign sincerity and always looks and acts angry. The thing I hate most is my water is NEVER refilled dude. Like I'm literally sucking on the remaining ice because I'm so freakin' thirsty. And the girl avoids contact so it's hard to ask for more but damn it's kinda obvious and it's not busy. I am always stuck training people at all of the restaurants I work at and their first job is refill water so my expectation is not unreasonable, especially when there's two spicy sauces on the table. I see the owner lady going around saying hi to people, she seems very nice.Noble Veg is still my favorite but overall really good vegetarian food at a really good price. Free wifi and $15 minimum for credit cards. Check it out!
<review# 1881,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2013,12/11/2013,667,245,6,11,9>Such a beautiful setting for the restaurant. The patio overlooks the river so it has an amazing, breath taking view! I came here for HH a few years ago and I finally got to try their dinner yesterday. We had a large group of around 25 people but the service was great! We were able to put in our order fairly quick and our food came out pretty fast as well.I had the caesar salad with an added side of ahi. There was nothing special about the salad and the ahi I thought was sliced too thin. My fiance had the Scott's Burger which was pretty amazing. The patty was cooked medium as he asked and the burger was so juicy! You are able to choose what cheese you want with the burger as well. I ended up stealing a bunch of his fries which were surprisingly delicious! It was my friends birthday so they were able to offer him a complimentary dessert and had a candle for him to blow out! It was a nice way to end our dinner. I definitely want to come back to enjoy their HH menu and have dinner out on the patio sometime soon!
<review# 1882,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2013,12/10/2013,1353,176,17,25,18>Dude. The Golden Drumsticks appetizer. This might sound weird, but they *tear* like chicken meat. Soooo odd in my mouth, delicious, borderline creepy? For a vegan, that is. No shame here: that ish was HELLA good. I will order many, many more next time.    * Crispy Rolls (appetizer) - pretty good!    * Thai Iced Tea - w/ soy milk. Hooooly god. It's been so long, old friend!!   * Kung Pao Spicy (entree) - this was REALLY good. The "meat" was flavorful, with peanuts, celery, onion, carrots, and spiciness. I'm get this again.   * Sweet & Sour Nugget (entree) - this was good. Not amazing, but good. It was crazy having the S&S dish... it's been a while!    * Orange Nugget (entree) - meh. 2.5/5. Kinda bland, and I observed that the bigger the faux meat nuggets, the more "fluffy" textured and less meat like. These were pretty big. The Kung Pao Spicy had littler pieces, and therefore a little chewier. Random observation.Now, I automatically give any vegan establishment a ton of slack. (*shut up and take my money!*) BUT... here's what prevents me from given it a 5 star review: the heat. We went on a Sunday at 6pm; joint had been open since 5pm. We were the only ones in the restaurant, and our (very nice) server told us they had "just" turned the air conditioner on. It was 108º outside. Total bummer, actually: I would have asked about dessert, but by the time we got our entrees I was POURING sweat. NOT CUTE. We had to pack it all up and get the eff outta there.No bother: I will be back. And I will get all that is recommended to me. (I went rogue. I should have gone with recs). And I will eat and eat and eat.VERDICT: GO! GO GO GO. Try vegan deliciousness! It's delicious to start, but it tastes even better when it's cruelty free. =)
<review# 1883,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2013,12/9/2013,266,332,18,23,26>I came here for the first time on a Saturday afternoon and I'm glad we went. I will say that you should get here early because the pickings get slim, the closer it gets to closing time. Just as the previous reviews mention, the fish here is really fresh and the service is fantastic! The fishmongers here are really helpful and will answer any question you may have. The also ask you questions on how you're going to prepare the fish and give you suggestions! On this occasion, I bought two pounds of Ahi Tuna, my fishmonger made sure to clean away any blood and sliced it for me at no charge. Cool! Btw, they have a wide variety of condiments available for purchase. From different salad dressings, soy sauces, ponzu, yuzu, ginger, variety of different colored tobiko, etc.....This is a one stop shop for those of you who are either novice or expert sushi makers. Don't like the sushi roll you had at a sushi joint? Stop complaining, come here and make your own!
<review# 1884,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2013,12/8/2013,1134,510,18,25,21>We had the AYCE rib tips ($15) last night.  Let me just say to all the haters out there...it was dee-muthafuckin-licious!!!!!  I had no problems polishing off those tender, smoked meaty pork pieces and got a second serving.  It is all you can eat, so no apologies for gluttony here.  I got both the mild and spicy BBQ sauces on the side.  The spicy is too much heat for me (but I'm a weenie) and the mild was perfect.  There were even yummy onion bits at the bottom of the cup. More yummy sauce please!   My 2 sides were green beans and greens.  That was my idea for keeping the meal somewhat healthy. The greens were tender, had a little kick, and seasoned right.  But I actually enjoyed the green beans more which had a hint of sweetness and cooked perfectly.  There's a whole list of sides to choose from, which are all good in my opinion (I've tried almost all of them).  I just wish they offered black eyed peas and yams.  The cornbread muffin is light and crumbly.  Great over the collard/mustard greens (if you like to eat it that way).The entire staff work their butts off to provide attentive, prompt, friendly, and efficient service.  Apparently, we had just missed the usual dinner rush when we arrived before 7:30, so service was extra fast.  Yay for my stomach!  I came, ate all I could eat and even had leftovers to take home.  Sandra Dee's does BBQ right!
<review# 1885,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2013,12/7/2013,165,218,14,15,16>Is this anchovy dressing or Cesar Dressing!?!?!?!!!That's typically my question as I take the first bite of any Cesar salad I have ordered at that day's restaurant of choice for oh, like ever and then spitting it back out onto the plate and returning it to the kitchen however on this days order my first bite of my Crispy Chicken Cesar Salad left me saying: Sweet Baby Jesus!!!! This is amazing!!!!  There's a very delicate balance in the anchovy ingredient of any good Cesar that most miss the mark on and kill what could be an amazing dressing overpowering it with fishy flavor... Noodles & Co. nailed that balance though and now I'm hooked.....Little did I know when we came here to enjoy a complimentary meal for Yelp's Appreciate day compliments of Noodles & Company that they would offer such a diverse selection of eats including my new favorite meal their crispy chicken Cesar salad and did I mention the absolutely BEST I've ever eaten to date Creamy Tomato & Basil Bisque???? These two items here were my Poison of the day and more than filled me up and satisfied my hunger and taste buds.... Had I had been at home I would have licked the empty salad plate as the dressing was just that good including the shaved strands of aged Parmesan cheese that enhanced its flavor... Creamy Tomato Basil Bisque was off the charts fresh, served hot and unbelievably satisfying.... Since bisque is such a hearty and rich soup a little bit goes along way and once again I found myself wanting to hold the bowl up to my mouth at an attempt to get every last bit of it out of the cup; however I didn't, but I did scrape it completely empty with my soup spoon leaving both the salad plate and the soup bowl devoid of not one remnant that anything ever existed on them and this is a very rare occurrence for me so when it happens I'm left rather speechless yet pride filled........ The romaine lettuce was fresh, crispy and plentiful as was the chicken breast that was cooked perfectly... HOME MADE CROUTONS with REAL BUTTER! How could I nearly forget to mention them.... I've never had croutons that were made so rich, creamy, crispy and buttery and the bread they used to make the homemade buttery croutons although I cannot precisely confirm this but I suspect it was ciabatta and way out of this world on so many levels... LOVED the selection of freshly brewed and self-serve teas readily available as well as plentiful on tap; my favorite is the Passion Fruit Black tea which I sweetened with sweet n low would love to see Splenda as an option as its my preferred and its a healthier alternative to the others but LOVED that tea and had more than one glass.... Actually, I would eat more soups and salads when dining out IF more places had hearty soups and salads such as I experienced here on this visit to Noodles & Co. as although the portions didn't appear to be all that large I came away perfectly sated happy and ready for a little nappy poo which followed shortly there after..... Life is good and we'll be back as I've just found my new connection for the best bisque soup, Cesar dressing and devourable chicken salad .... Lastly, Rebecca was the one who took my call initially to schedule our meal and it was also her who so warmly received us at the counter on the day of arrival. From start to finish she was beyond friendly, helpful and sincerely gracious and we needed to reschedule our initial meal there just once and she was a real champ with the request quickly finding another spot for us...... Damn if I'm not a sucker for amazing customer service and she's got it in spades..... In a nutshell: All the food I ate was fresh fresh fresh and prepared fresh as well and the time it took from ordering to being served was minimal as well.....  I'm in!
<review# 1886,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,12/6/2013,102,307,7,17,10>Okay, no one likes to break down or have their car in the shop, but if you can find a place that makes it as painless as possible, then DRJ would be the place. My husband and I have gone through some financial challenges the last three years and have one decent car and one beater, which is my old pre-marriage VW Jetta. We expected to have traded in that car years ago, but life is what happens when you are making other plans, as we all know. Since I transport the kids most of the time, I get the better of the two cars and my husband deals with the beater. On his way to work the car started overheating so he pulled into a Jiffy Lube and asked them to take a look and they said it had some leaks. He was close to his work downtown when this happened and our usual shops are out off of Sunrise. He called me and asked my opinion of where to take it, so I Yelped the shops nearby and DRJ came up with near perfect reviews...and bonus, they specialize in European cars! He called them and they said they could get him in right away and suggested that he tow the car over. They took a look and sure enough a part had cracked and all the surrounding hoses needed to be replaced. They had to keep the car overnight because one of the parts had to be ordered, but it was done before close of business the next day.When we pulled up to pick the car up we realized that our front bumper looked better than it had before. There is something about a year range of Jettas where the bumpers pull off really easily. I can't tell you how many times we have had to pay the dealership $300 for a new bumper over the years. We had just fixed it about six months or so ago and then my father-in-law drove it during his visit in June and pulled the bumper off again. After having to pay for brakes and tires on both of our cars there was no money left for cosmetic fixes. So when we pulled up and saw the bumper no longer hanging we were shocked. We went in and talked to Les about the cooling system repairs and he was very friendly, straightforward and easy to understand. We paid and he explained the two year warranty and that we can also come any time to get fluids topped off for free. We mentioned the bumper and he said that they see that problem a lot and the mechanic probably just snapped it back on! They didn't charge us a cent for that. I was in shock, they were super nice, the shop was clean, they were as fast as could be expected AND fixed our wonky bumper. Can't ask for more than that!

College peers, best friends, coworkers, & S2This place opens til 2am! Pretty darn good for Davis. It's right in downtown and you can't miss it! The place is super convienent for those late night cravings and for DRUNCHIES of course. Everything you get here will be pretty damn bomb. My favorite dish here is obviously padseeyew, but my ALL TIME FAVE has to be pagrawpow! It's a dish with a meat of your choice, basil, bell peppers, and onions smothered in juicy yummy sauce. YUM. Okay. I LOVE chicken and beef, BUT YOU HAVE TO TRY TOFU. Like i get it..tofu? foreal? But i'm not kidding. The tofu is deep fried and when it's soaked in that bomb sauce, it's just freakin BOMB. I can't explain it. But when you mix some of the rice with the sauce and place a tofu on it, put a jalapeño and some chili sauce...OMG that stuff is ON POINT!!Aside from the food, they have a pretty good selection of asian hard A. A-hem they got SOJU. Davis don't have no soju so my friends and I always order soju and some guava juice. BEST chase ever. The place has a shitton of college students, drunk or sober, but this place is always packed with good positive energy. Thai canteen you will always have a place in my heart. TOO many memories. SIGH imma miss youuuu when i graduate. Until then, see you soonsies

<review# 1890,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/21/2008,11/3/2008,5,110,4,4,4>To me, There are 2 zocalos.  The first one I like. This first Zocalo is he one I go to on a weekend afternoon.  It's not too crowded. I have a nice seat out on the patio. The service is good. I enjoy the food. I have a Stella Artois on tap. I enjoy my leisurely afternoon meal and think to myself, "I need to come here more often.The second Zocalo is a little different. I get invited to go her for dinner on a Friday night. We have to wait forever for a table. No big deal, I'll just wait at the bar. Too bad the bar is so packed with douche bags, I have to wave a freakin 20 in the air to get served. Or I ask my wife to lower her neckline a little and then we get served. There is no place to set my beer so we just stand in the middle of the room and stare at idiots with their work ties loosened and drink until they almost fall over. Then they go get in there car and drive home.  Once we are seated we are crammed into a table and have to listen to everyones conversations echo through the cavernous place. The service is slow and the food usually come out cold.  I don't like the 2nd.  Plan your visit to receive the desired atmosphere
<review# 1891,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2008,11/1/2008,75,26,9,5,6>I hate going to the Post Office because that is where stupid people tend to congregate...possibly to find more ways to irritate people.  Stupid people frustrate me and they make me very impatient when I am standing in the long and painfully slow line.  Here's my assumption on how long you can expect to wait in line at the Post Office:Line = 3.5 Stupid + 2.5 Mail + 5.5 HolidayWhere,Line = minutes waiting in line at the Post Office Stupid = the number of stupid people in lineMail = the number of packages or letters for each stupid person in lineHoliday = dummy variable if it is during a holiday weekWell thank goodness for the self-service kiosk at the Post Office where you can mail your letters and packages in just a few minutes.  The kiosk is equipped with all of your needs, such as a weight scale and a touch screen computer.  Just input the zip code of the place you wish to mail your letter/package to on the touch screen and click on what the delivery type (First-Class, Priority, etc).   In addition, it offers other services such as delivery confirmation.  Afterwards, it prints out a self-adhesive stamp.  Then you can drop off the mail in the slot next to the kiosk.  It is as easy as 1-2-3.  However, this self-service kiosk does not provide services for overseas mailing.  Also, you can only use debit card/credit card as payment and there is a $1minimum.  But that's okay.  Just purchase a few 41-cent stamps to reach that $1 minimum.  It sure saves a lot of time from being stuck in that awful long line and after you're done, you can wave bye-bye to all of the people still waiting in line.  HA!Sorry, I had a rough day....hence my rant on stupid people and this review.

<review# 1893,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2008,10/30/2008,78,78,8,6,5>Oh, sweet, sweet Addis Ababa.This is the kind of restaurant my crazy mother likes. It's really obvious that most of what your are paying is going straight into the food. Not a waitstaff, not the decor, nothing but the food. And it's that good. Seriously.As most of the food has been covered by the other reviews, I will cover the dish that I get every time: kitfo. Kitfo is pretty simple. You mince up raw beef, add spices, a ton of pepper, and some hot butter and mix it up and serve it with some injera (Ethiopian bread). One day, I brought this over to the future sister in law's house. Tasting notes:Me- Mmm. Oh yeah. I feel like a crazed carnivore.Girlfriend- Oh my god that's hot. Oh... ok. Wow. Burning. Hot. [gasping]. Oh my. Give me another piece.Future Sister-in-law: YEOUCH!!! I think I'm hallucinating. Is that a Power Ranger standing outside? I can't feel my mouth. Give me another bite.Futute Brother-in-law: That looks like nuclear waste. I'm not eating it. (more for me, thanks dude)
<review# 1894,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2008,10/29/2008,636,38,,6,5>I was most excited to hear that Green Boheme would be bringing raw food to Sacramento. I had my first opportunity to sample a few goodies from their take-out only kitchen last night. We ordered our food by e-mail. We were supposed to order a day early but I'd neglected to do so. I dropped them a note and they welcomed me to go ahead and order. I appreciate their accommodating me. I ordered their wellness burger with onion rings and my wife had the portobello steak with mock mashed potatoes. For desert we had an order of pumpkin pie. The entrees were both delicious. A good blend of textures and flavors. The "onion rings" were a nice chewy and somewhat sweet cross between a cracker and a fruit roll up. Trust me, its better than it sounds.The burger itself, sitting on crisp romain leaves was more substantial and less of a pate than burgers I've had from other raw kitchens. The Portobello steak was a large portobello mushroom marinated and sliced. The mock patatoes were tasty and had a great mouse like texture. I was tempted to mix in some raw corn kernels, as that is how I like my actual potatoes.The pumpkin pie was the star of the show. Spicy and sweet with a cookie like crust and a cashew cream drizzled over it. Yum. I see only two areas for improvement:As with most raw establishments the quantities are a bit slight. I prepare this kind of food myself and with all the time restraints of soaking, blending and dehydrating plus the richness of the food I understand. I just think the plate could be filled out a bit more without it increasing the costs or time involved too much. Why not two marinated mushrooms on the plate? And there are lots of good raw items that are nice additions without much preparation needed; tomato slices, carrot sticks. avocado, etc. To be fair though, I did not get up from the table hungry and it's great to have a rich flavorful meal and not feel at all groggy or heavy.The other improvement I'd like to see, and again I can understand the difficulty here, is the amount of waste from to-go containers. I don't think its too far of a stretch to assume that most raw food fans are likely to be concerned about reducing waste. I'd love to be able to show up with my own lunch pail and have the containers filled with my orders, but I'm not sure how the health department would view this. In addition to dinner I ordered their banana granola and we've been munching on it like it's candy. I also tried their "ice cream" and while it was quite flavorful I think I'm going to enjoy it more as a smoothie base than anything else. I was pleased with Green Boheme's creativity and I'd rank their food up their with Cafe Gratitude as some of the best raw cuisine I've tried.

I like danger.I like the thrill of a raft moving quickly through the water over rapids and deadly rocksThis has none of that.  This is my 2nd consecutive year coming here to rent a raft and slowly float down the American River.  Rentals aren't too bad.  It's about 20$ per person depending on the raft size you get.  With it comes oars and life jackets for every passenger.  Anything else you want to have with you is all on you.  What did I bring onto the raft with me?  ~2 coolers~ice~4 12 packs of beer~6 gatorade bottles of jungle juice~6 sandwiches~1 bag of chips~1 box of cookies~sunscreen~sunglasses~water guns~a big smileYou would think that the trip consists of laying in the sun, intriguing conversation, and beer.  Basically, an awesomely relaxing time.   For the most part it can be.  However, when you have too much alcohol and restless people, you get:- spilt beer everywhere- men erotically rubbing sunscreen all over each other's body- people falling all over the raft and out of the raft- water fights with every raft that you come in contact with- eating soggy river soaked food- people straddling other's faces- non stop laughing- bathing suits breaking- lost items in the water including expensive sunglasses and flip flopsYou may also wonder how we relieve ourselves with all the alcohol we're consuming.  Well, the bathroom is literally surrounding you.  No need to wait in long lines or search for a restroom, just jump right off, hang onto the raft and let 'er rip.  Getting back into the raft is the only difficult part about this process.In the end, it's not too costly and you can guarantee hours of good fun in the sun, assuming you are with the right people.
<review# 1896,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2008,10/27/2008,464,293,13,19,16>I am always amazed by people who complain about the hard economic times and how difficult it is to stretch a dollar nowadays. For us po' folks, it has always been hard - but you can still live well on the cheap if you know how. Growing up broke with a single mother, I learned from a wise woman all the tips and tricks of milking the last penny out of your hard earned dollar - especially when it comes to grocery shopping. For example, most standard grocery stores (Safeway, Raley's, Albertson's, Lucky's) operate on a Promotional basis, rather than an "Everyday Low Prices" model. Every week, they come out with sale items - oftentimes the sale items are priced far lower than what you would find at an "Everyday Low Prices" store like Winco or SaveMax. I know once a month that Safeway will have chicken breasts on sale for .99/pound, for example, and that is a far lower price then you will find anywhere else. I cannot imagine that Safeway sees a profit on that item - the level of discounting is huge - I think these same breasts are usually 5.99/pound if not on sale.Despite the sale items being unprofitable, this pricing strategy works because once at the store, you inevitably buy stuff that is not on sale. The trick is, to ONLY buy stuff that is on sale at Safeway, and buy the rest of your necessities at a cheaper store.Enter Grocery Outlet - which is the cheapest place to buy food - hands down. Cheaper then either normal grocery stores OR "Everyday Low Prices" stores. You can find some good stuff, but keep in mind that oftentimes there is a reason why the food was sent to the outlet. You shouldn't be scared - most times the reason is because there is a superficial flaw - the can is dented or the box is marred - but every once and awhile there will be a problem with the food itself. I bought some Campbell's Lentil Soup there one time, and as soon as I tasted it I thought "Man - this is really, really salty." So, I looked on the nutrition information and there was 422% of your daily value of sodium in that one little can! There must have been a salt accident at the plant or something...When I was a kid, my sister and I LOVED this place - we called it Canned Foods and my mom would take us "Big Shopping" there. She basically let us get anything we wanted!!! For po' folks, that is huge! So, for any poor individual or family, my advice is to take that paycheck and go to Grocery Outlet for your "Big Shopping" - get everything you can from there (watch out for crazy soup though). Then, go to DD's Discounts (see my other review) and watch that money pile up!I go crazy for savings!!!!
<review# 1897,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2008,10/26/2008,9,33,7,8,8>This is the place to go if you're a hot salsa dancer. Unfortunately I am not one of them yet, so I resort to wearing sundresses with a little cleavage and then I get to asked to dance even though I don't have all the moves. Thank god for male human nature is all I can say, or my dancing would never improve.Club 21 has a great wooden dance floor, many say that it's the best in town. Chairs, tables and benches line the sides but there are vast areas of open space in the middle for you and your partner to get funky. At one end is a u-shaped bar, manned (and I do mean manned) by the tall, good-looking and impressively-biceped Rick who is efficiency itself. He never loses his smile or his cool, even with the crush of sweaty dancers who crowd round him. They have different types of music on different nights, all I know about is the salsa dancing on Fridays which is pretty hot. Club 21 attracts people who are serious about dancing and some of them are astonishingly good. It doesn't start cooking until about 11 pm, but there's usually a beginners lesson sometime around 9 or 9:30. Depending on your luck there might be a live band, and then the cover charge might go up, but usually the music is provided by a DJ/VJ who commands the floor from a little raised control booth kind of like a pulpit.  Two large video screens at either of the room pulse out the videos of the music playing, often with close ups of impossibly gorgeous island women shaking their just barely satin-covered booties into your face. Club21 is tucked behind Cervantes Restaurant, separated only by a row of floor-to-ceiling windows. I'm sure people eat there all the time, although I've never witnessed that. When the dancing is going on, hardly anyone is in there, except maybe to talk, because it's LOUD inside where the dancing is.So many fine dancers go here that it can be daunting, but it's a friendly crowd, all ages and no one gets too terribly drunk as it's hard to DWI - dance while intoxicated. Unless of course, you're showing some cleavage, and then almost all is forgiven.
<review# 1898,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2008,10/25/2008,21,10,4,3,4>If frozen yogurt joints were U.S. Presidents, Yogurtagogo would be Baberaham Lincoln. I've only known Gogo for a few months now, but I've already shunned my other loves, Big Spoon and Mochii included, to become a fro-yo monogamist. Here's the thing. Big Spoon rocks because of the self-serve factor, and Mochii gained popularity with its fresh fruit offerings. So, duh, of course someone was smart enough to come along and combine the best of both worlds under one roof, located in the heart of midtown. Here's another thing. I'm just going to serve it up without any sugar-coating. Be prepared to put down some cash here. I decided I probably spend as much on monthly yogurt as I do on my cell phone bill. The containers come in one size only: mamba jamba. And because 'gogo assumes the guise of "healthy," it's easy to get a bunch of yogurt, then cover it all up with blueberries, bananas and granola and believe you're doing yourself a favor. My purchases tend to weigh in at an average of 6 dollars, but they're so worth it, especially if you opt for yogurt instead of dinner.The plain, tangy flavor is the best, although I love a few ribbons of the raspberry pomegranate mixed in, topped with chocolate chips, kiwis and raspberries (my friend introduced me to that recipe. It's a winner). Occasionally I'll get a little "crazy" and get chocolate yogurt with strawberries, bananas and peanut butter cups, and the seasonal white chocolate macadamia nut flavor was like sugary buttah, a stand-alone, although it's off the rotation now.In addition to the delicious concoctions available at Gogo, it's also become quite the see-and-be-scene locale. The covered patio out front overlooks L and 19th streets, otherwise known as the intersection of emaciated Jesus body doubles and Juicy-clad loft-dwellers carrying designer dogs.The only thing I don't love about this place is the God-awful chandelier they just installed. It gives new meaning to the phrase "blinded by the light." Who picked that thing out? Their yogurt privileges should be revoked.

The variety is pretty nice, and I appreciate the non-crepe foods and the drink selections they have. While filling, and worth the overall expense, nothing here has yet to really stand out.  But I'll be back again sometime soon, so there's still something to this place.Really, the real gripes against the place?  No credit cards.  I know, it's really hypocritical to be ok the nearby Old Soul place not taking cards...but these people will take a personal check and not cards?  Yeah, it's a pain and a real screw for businesses on those damn machines, but still it's basically a necessity for places.  I swear that if I stop coming here it'll probably be because I don't have $30 cash on me for a good meal for my girl and myself.So whatever, I've managed to drag on this review for a while when it could have been summed up in four words, it's a crepe place.  If you want a crepe, head on in (and bring cash!), but if you want to find a real fantastic breakfast spot this place isn't on the top of my list.

It may not have much by way of ambiance, but I agree with the other yelpers: This is some dang good BBQ. I ordered the chopped pork sandwich with a side salad and vinaigrette dressing as well as potato salad. The salad was nice and the potato salad was ok. My sandwich, however, was to die for. I had the mild sauce and it was just perfect in my book. My boyfriend had the tri-tip sandwich, which he said was really good, and the french fries, which he said were better than he expected. There was just one or two guys running the place from what I could see.  They were very friendly, personable and attentive. I would love to come back again - hope it does well! It's the best BBQ I've had so far in Sacramento!
<review# 1906,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/1/2009,12/18/2009,128,264,6,9,4>The last place I expect to hear, "Friends in Low Places" is at a Chinese restaurant...but this is Elk Grove. I was a little surprised to see the lounge at the end of the restaurant with a kind of loud group playing songs from the Who and Crosby, Steels, Nash & Young but it made for an interesting visit.The food was average-good. We ordered a typical family style dinner with egg flower soup (decent), foil wrapped chicken (yummy), pork fried rice (good), chicken chow mein (good flavor) and lemon chicken (average). We added some pot stickers and they were larger than many other places and average tasting. The sauce that came with them was quite flavorful.What was above average here was our service. From the time we walked in to the time we left we were treated excellently. The prices were all fairly decent as well.
<review# 1907,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2009,12/17/2009,87,159,,8,6>I think I have found my favorite hole-in-the-wall sushi joint... and I've been to a lot of Japanese and sushi restaurants in Sacramento. (Check out my reviews!)This place is great for rolls. I have been here on four separate occasions so far and each time the rolls have been great. The rolls I have tried are the Orange Blossom (my personal favorite), the Fulton, the Fair Oaks, and every Dragon roll they have to offer. Another plus about this place is on Thursdays they serve LARGE HOT SAKE FOR ONLY 99 CENTS!!! It's unlimited too!!! I also ordered a bento box with the typical chicken katsu and tempura which were both good, but what's different about Crazy Sushi is that there bento boxes are big. Very generous portions! I definitely plan on becoming a regular here.
<review# 1908,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/30/2009,12/15/2009,51,68,13,3,10>I always leave this place not knowing shit about shit.  This tells me a few things about Fox & Goose: I stayed for more than "just the one", I never had to re-think how much I was spending, and I more than likely had a great time.Now, Ive never had the food, although Ive heard great things, extraordinary things actually; but goddamn if a pint of Guinness with a little shamrock on top at the Fox & Goose isn't one of the top 10 ways to start your night in Sacramento.
<review# 1909,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2010,1/7/2011,287,110,25,21,30>Some women like to spend their extra money on designer jeans, shoes, or purses; I, however, will continue to buy my shit from Street Vendors and Target if it means being able to eat at a place like The Kitchen every once in a while.  Yes, the food is as terrific as everyone says. For me, though, what makes this place truly "magical" (a description I'm stealing from our fabulous dining neighbors) is all the love I felt from the chef, staff, and management. One might assume that a place like this would be bordering pretentious, but that is sooooo not the case.  First off, we were greeted with welcoming smilles from the moment we approached the door.  Secondly, the Chef and Manager were super down to earth and even came over to crack jokes and answer my husband's crazy drunken questions.As for the food, well, it wasn't just food. It was an artistic explosion. Okay, maybe that was a bit dramatic (I get the drama from my mama), but I just don't know how else to explain it.  The presentation was art, the plating was art, and the flavors coming together in my mouth was art.  It was a beautiful thing.And just when I thought it couldn't get any better, those creative culinary bastards hit me with a custom blend tea service at the end! I'm all in, people. All in.
<review# 1910,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2010,1/6/2011,100,90,9,11,10>I roped my sister into picking me up from the airport, and in exchange, she really wanted to have all you can eat sushi. At 11 in the morning. After a turbulent flight during which I was sandwiched between two farty men. I wanted sleep and donuts. But okay. $13 for lunch gets you all the  rolls, nigiri, sides like miso and edamame and tempura, and dessert that you want. You can have sashimi for an additional $3. The nice thing about this place is that since they bring out each thing you order individually, you can gorge yourself without the yuck factor of your food sitting out in the open while strangers hover over it. The sushi was really good, and extremely high quality, especially since it was of the endless variety. Each roll is four pieces, and there were some pretty decent choices, though as others have mentioned, many of them were made with shrimp. If you spring for the $20 dinner, you can order off both sides of the menu, which gives you considerably more variety. The waitress was kind of pushy, but in a helpful way. She kept insisting that we try the dessert. Woman after my own heart. One downside is that they do charge you for what you don't finish, which of course didn't end up being an issue. It kind of puts the fear of God into you when ordering additional rolls, however. But we stuff ourselves and waste too much as a society anyway.P.S. I got donuts! Azukar has them, and they make 'em themselves. They taste a little like refrigerated biscuit dough, but they were sugary enough that it didn't realllly matter. They also had fried bananas, which I highly recommend.
<review# 1911,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/15/2010,1/5/2011,518,148,5,12,6>3.5 stars. Very cute, quaint little bistro. Right off Auburn-Folsom Rd in Granite Bay...blink and you miss it!Went with a friend recently and tried to sample as many dishes as possible with only our appetites as our limit. Here's what we had...Butternut Squash Soup with Pickled Ginger - Beautiful presentation. Delightful flavor. A little top heavy with the green onions. LARGE portion. 'Reminded' our server I only ordered a cup. "This IS a cup madame, " recited with his best French accent. Wow. Could have been my whole meal right there. It's about quality though, not quantity. $6.95French Onion Soup - Pleasant. Not overly salty as some are. $6.95Chicken Pot Pie - Beautiful presentation. Again, a little top heavy with the green onions and maybe a little cheesy, but overall had good flavor and consistency. Topped with a light, crispy crust, this is a great comfort food. $15.95Beef Panini with Brie Cheese and Carmelized Onions - This was the deal breaker and the dish with the most potential. Panini bread fell apart. Black Angus beef looked and tasted like deli meat. Way too heavy with the Dijon. SO bummed! $12.95Side Salad - Simple mixed greens with a Dijon Mustard Vinaigrette. Decent. Nothing to write home about.  Included with the panini.Tables and settings give you that 'ooh la la'  French feel. Service was good. Chef Christophe was personally making every dish and you can tell his little bistro is a labor of love. I know I'll be back!Pros:Portions are large .Service is good.Food is pretty good with just a hiccup here and there.Parking is easy.Cons:Struck out with the panini but will try it again.At 2:00 pm, they lock up the shop! If you're still eating, you feel pressured to hurry up and get out of there.Green onions are abundant....maybe for some that's a 'pro'.A little pricey. Lunch for two was 50 bucks.

Now Midtown Barfly.] **_______________________________________________Wow.  CLUB 21.  WOW!  What spectacular range!  What incredible peeps come here!  What a swanky bar!  And RICK, the Bar Manager?  My BUDDY!THE SIT-REP  (Situation Report)I love Club 21 because it is a top-notch mid-size venue (capacity 250-300 peeps) and Sacramento is better for having it.  There are MANY events that take place here and go on at this venue of which I am not an expert, so I am restricting my comments solely to the (1)  Weekly Tuesday Night "SWING 21" Nights; and, (2) The Monthly Gothic-Industrial-EBM event "REVERENCE" hosted by and put on by DONAVAN and JASMIN and their DJ crews.THE SET-UPSWING 21.  JOHNNY and his swing-dance team of instructors are the best in Sacramento, if not Northern California.  TINA, HEATHER, BOB, MICHAEL, etc., have all been outstanding instructors in some of the most popular Swing-Dance venues across town.  I started taking lessons from JOHNNY and TINA and MICHAEL "back in the day" when they instructed at the old "815 L Street" Club (now closed).  They also continue to instruct at other local venues, including the "BALLROOM OF SACRAMENTO" (but that is another review).  The Tuesday night crowd is one of the friendliest and most helpful when it comes to learning the basics of East Coast Swing, the Lindy Hop, the Shag, the Carolina Stomp, the Charleston, etc. etc.  What is so cool about swing-dancing is that you can learn the basics of everything you need to know in 1 HR, really!REVERENCE.  This crew of Darkwave 80s, EBM, Gothic-Industrial DJs are some of the most fun you will find anywhere in a hap'nin dance club!  Regular DJ hosts DONAVON and JASMIN put on am impressive monthly dance gig that always has an eclectic crowd and brings in so many fun people to dance with (and sometimes gawk at with mile-high mohawks, and Siouxsie and Robert Smith make-up styles).  And the rotating door of spectacular GUEST DJs is no less impressive!  One of the best DJs ever is visiting DJ SKARKROW from San Jose.  I've become wonderful friends with him and his lovely girlfriend JULIE.  When they are up at bat, the music takes an inter-dimensional turn into aural-realms that I've never heard of before but love.  It's awesome to hear wonderful music selections from the Netherlands, Germany, England, Austria, Mexico, Japan, etc. that never get played in any mainstream club.THE LOWDOWNRICK!  He is the heart and center of CLUB 21.  No matter what night you are enjoying, he is the HOST with MOST with his delicious fancy drinks and free live advice.  I love this guy.  And you will love these events!
<review# 1913,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/5/2010,1/3/2011,92,271,6,5,6>I really look forward to making this place a favorite in the Natomas area. The restaurant itself is divided into 3 parts: A sushi bar, teppan yaki, and a nice sit down type of dining.     The Teppan Yaki is hibachi style dining similar to Beni Hanas. The chefs were a blast and doing well to keep their audiences entertained. The sushi bar... is a sushi bar, and the sit down restaurant is elegant and simplistic at the same time.      The food was delicious, a good value, and over all a pleasant dining experience. The only thing I felt needed work on was the presentation of the actual rolls. The Tokyo boat box actually came in a boat, and the Tokyo Box.... a box. The salmon sashimi was huge and delicious(that's what she said), and the medium rare New York steak was om nom nom. .....I would like to go into more detail, but I have left overs to consume!Ciao!
<review# 1914,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2010,1/2/2011,464,293,8,16,11>In all my years, I have probably driven by Café Vinoteca thousands of times. Cornered on the busy (and according to AAA, one of the country's most dangerous) Watt and Fair Oaks intersection, this tucked away little Italian joint is easy to miss in the hustle-bustle of a commute. My mom and her boyfriend recently discovered Vinoteca, and have been consistently raving about how great it is. So, for my mommy's birthday on Wednesday, we decided to dine here. We had a total of 7 people with our party, and were treated great.The restaurant is small and quaint, with a more upscale, modern feel than my other favorite Sacramento Italian joint (Roma's). In a town that lacks good Italian, Café Vinoteca did it all for me. We started out with 3 appetizers: eggplant parmagania, a ham and mozzarella pizzetta and a Antipasto plate. The antipasto plate was by far the best: roasted garlic, housemade crustinis, some brie cheese, a nice meaty salami and some prosciutto. The other two appetizers were also fantastic (one of our dining companions said he oftentimes gets the eggplant app as a meal). Between the apps and the amazing oil and vinegar dip with fresh bread, I was both mildly full and extremely excited for my main course.The whole menu looked great and I had a really difficult time choosing what to order. I am on a diet (story of my life), so I didn't want to go crazy. I ended up opting for the grilled salmon with sautéed spinach and quinoa. Normally, the dish comes with a dill cream sauce, but I opted out of that for the sake of my ass and thighs. What fat I missed out on by avoiding the sauce, the chefs made up for in the quinoa. It was super buttery. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but they probably could have used about half the butter. My meal was pretty good. Granted, I ordered lite, so I missed out on the really good stuff. Luckily, my mates did not order as lite, so I got to sample. The gorgonzola gnochii with a New York Strip and walnuts had been the dish that caught my eye on the menu initially, so I was glad my mom's boyfriend ordered it. The bite I tried was SOOOO good. Next time I may just throw caution to the wind, or preface my meal with a really hardcore workout, because this dish was the shit! I also tried the chicken cannelloni, which were great. The pasta is all housemade, and with the cannelloni you could totally tell. My mom ordered the bouillabaisse and it was a seafood lovers dream. I also sampled the seafood linguini and the spaghetti with Bolognese. For dessert, we shared the award-winning banana cream pie (OMG), the Strawberry rhubarb pie, and the tiramisu.All in all, a great neighborhood spot with a lot of charm and flavor. Oh, and Mimi the food server is totally sweet and attentive; sit with her if you can.
<review# 1915,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/4/2010,1/1/2011,249,49,6,6,8>Capitol Garage has captured my heart by incorporating one of my favorite Mexican dishes into its brunch time repertoire: the tamale.The delicious block of soft masa and shredded pork is wrapped lovingly with fluffy egg, then topped with avocado, tomatillo salsa, cheese, crispy tortilla strips, cilantro and a jalapeno Hollandaise. This, my friends, is the Tamale Omelet.         MMM! Have MERcy.  At first I kinda' chuckled at the thought of a tamale wrapped in egg.  I mean, really... when you think about it, how crazy creative is that?  Like, what, did they run out of things to wrap in egg?  Oh, but trust me, this thing is good.  (Don't forget to ask for Tapatio!)There have been many additions to the brunch menu which I'm pretty curious to try.  One thing that hasn't changed, however, is the wait time to get your food.  It's still kinda' long... but that can be easily assuaged by an order of unlimited mimosas.  I wouldn't cry about the wait unless I had maybe 8 or so of these bad boys. I'm kidding.
<review# 1916,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2010,12/31/2010,574,469,10,9,12>When Sarah S. says, "No, it's not star inflation. It's the real deal," you take your doubts and throw them in the trash can. I mean, it's SARAH! I feel like I need to re-rate every restaurant I've ever rated. Nothing compares!As if I needed more recommendations, I scroll down further. My best friend (and food snob extraordinaire,) Elizabeth R., stated about her Mulvaney's experience "I found myself trying not to cry." And let's not forget Ally D. likening Mulvaney's to a "mouth brothel." Ah yes. THIS is what this birthday NEEDS!I can't agree with them more. And like Anthony W., I'll be looking for a reason to go back. "Honey, it's our siding's one year anniversary! It still hasn't been painted! Let's paint it or go to Mulvaney's!"We stayed home all day yesterday for my birthday. I got kind of mopey around 4:30. I mean, does everything HAVE to go to shit when you have a baby, or what? She's the light of my life but what a little killjoy she can be! So at some point I told my husband that I've always wanted to try Mulvaney's. He made a reservation and off we went.  The hosted greeted us warmly and gave us an out-of-the-way table, as I requested since we had to bring Little Miss Unpredictable. She sat us right in a corner by the noisy kitchen. Perfect! She should be able to shut-up for most of our dinner, right?Zoey immediately goes into brat mode, for some unknown reason. But Mulvaney's had the perfect thing for that: Double Jamey on the rocks with a splash of cran. I don't think that I've had a better tasting double Jameson on the rocks with a splash of cran IN MY LIFE. It could of been the situation, but I imagine that that first drink is comparable with the feeling one gets the first time they take heroin intravenously. I had two. The second one wasn't nearly as wonderful as the first. I think that's because the bartender had a little too much faith in my drinking ability when I ordered the second one less than 10 minutes after the first. That second one slowed Mom WAY down. But that's OK, I had a good strong buzz until my head met my pillow at 9pm. I can't remember the last time THAT's happened on my birthday!The menus had my name on them! "Happy Birthday, Johnna!" I almost cried over that. I felt so special; Mulvaney's made me my own menu.We had the pulled mozz to start with heirloom tomatoes on our server's suggestion. Her adjective was SPECIAL. I've never had a better tasting tomato, period. Even Zoey loved them and cried when the waitress took the plate. They were DELICIOUS, over a warm balsamic reduction.We split the swiss chard ravs next. These were more than bit salty but the flavor EXPLOSIVE. The swiss chard, with healthy slices of Pecorino and large chunks of cured pork. Ughhh... SO FUCKING GOOD, but someone that's sensitive to sodium might want to stay away. But as you may know, salt is my favorite food group so no foul.Our main courses were no less SPECTACULAR. My honey had the ribeye and I had the salmon. My man's ribeye was huge, and served under a healthy pile of thick salsa verde. I watched for him to take offense to the salsa but he seemed to enjoy it, with some perfectly crispy-fried Yukon Gold potatoes and some sort of green beans. Very little of his plate survived the ordeal. My salmon was served with a beet relish, mashers (with horseradish?) and spinach with sliced garlic. The meal was melt-in-your-mouth ecstasy even with Zoey losing it 2 feet away. She loved those mashed potatoes so much we had to order her some of her own. Even with horseradish Zoey howled for more: "Uh!? UHHHH???!" She's more than a little like her Mama, I have to say.Lastly, we had the ding dong (but a la mode with the homemade ice cream, please!) that many others mention in their reviews... The presentation was gorgeous, picture is coming soon, but the cake seemed a little stale. I was about 3 sheets to the wind at that point, so I really could have cared less about stale cake. Although Zoey seemed determined to ruin my dinner, she was unable to thanks to some serious culinary know-how and great service by Jana.Speaking of children, they seem to be very welcome here. Every one of Mulvaney's staff came to see Zoey with a warm smile, it seemed! So my feeling is that children are welcome. However, for your OWN experience, you might want to leave an unpredictable baby with a close friend.  I probably would have been less annoyed with Zoey had the hostess not sat this young couple RIGHT next to us with every other table available in the restaurant. That couple HAD to have hated us. Zoey was in full-tilt BRAT mode.All this said-and my husband agrees-Mulvaney's is a TRUE 5-star dining experience. I can't remember the last time we've agreed on such a high rating. It's a must-try if you're in Sacramento. Period.

I went around 2pm and they still had plenty of pastries to choose from.  It's a open bakery so you can see the baker making more pastries in the background. Mmmmm the fresh scent of baked goods! Yum!The woman and gentleman helping me were super sweet and friendly.  I picked up one Kobe Cream and an An Pan.  Unfortunately, my bf got to the Kobe Cream before I could.  He left me An Pan.  It was DELICIOUS! It had a red bean filling and fluffy bread.  Each was around $2. I'll definitely be back for more!
<review# 1918,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/5/2010,12/28/2010,63,109,4,8,4>I finally made it out here for the first time today and have to say that I had a great time. First off, the smell of the spices hits your nose even from the outside of the restaurant and it smells great. Reminded me of Indian food. Staff was very friendly and attentive and when I asked for the waitress to explain what the dishes were on the buffet, she did so with enthusiasm.The inside was smaller than I expected but who cares as long as the food is great. There is art on the walls and I loved the study guide for the Ethiopian alphabet on the table. Pretty cool! As for the food, I enjoyed the lentils and beans on the buffet. Beans mixed in with the rice was delicious. And it wasn't that spicy for my taste either, just made my nose run a little at the beginning. The company I was with ordered from the menu and their food came out fast.I'll be back to brush up on my Ethiopian alphabet skills while enjoying some enjiira.
<review# 1919,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2013,8/1/2013,165,218,11,17,12>Well..... It finally happened..... One of our four beloved hairy beast pups needed to be seen as he hasn't been feelin like his usual spunky energetic self and being a newbie to Sac we had yet to establish a vet; until today that is......First I launched the ever faithful Yelp app in the ol' iPhone n the first one that popped up was El Camino Veterinary Hospital just a mile or so from the Casa....I noted that they also had a coupon for $10 off the first office visit IF you "checked-in" using the Yelp app. Right on! I thought to myself as veterinary care can n often times is extremely over priced and any savings I can get is very much appreciated.However I called them as they r listed as 24hr and spoke with a woman who told me that although they were open they had no regular clinic appointments available but I could walk in n be seen on an emergency basis however the office visit would jump from $4? To $99 just to start.Wow! No thank you is what I told her and then she did the unthinkable: She understood & gave me the name, phone number & name of Mercy Pet Hospital. I'm still in shock over that compassionate and honorable move by her and thanks to her we have just found our new Veterinary Hospital: Mercy Vet :) Located right off of the I-80 East freeway as we headed out from home and would soon arrive rather quickly no doubt; an added bonus.Smack dab on their front glass door is the biG red and bold Yelp sticker that reads: People Love Us on Yelp. Immediately I felt a little bit more relaxed as to date its the Yelp reviews from customers just like me and maybe even you, that are my GPS when navigating uncharted territory. Welcomed immediately and registered my baby and although the waiting room was filling up fast I would learn that they staff NOT ONE BUT TWO docs on Sundays. Flipping fantastic as my lil guy isn't dying but he needs diagnosing and we want to go home and enjoy the remainder of our Sunday with whatever stuff we need to get him back to his usual playful self.  We were seen within about 20 minutes of our arrival and I was also pleased with this.Their prices are the lowest I have EVER seen. I have 4 dogs and 4 cats so I am an official Ghandi in the real world of pet bills and have been over charged and hosed for decades only I have. The office visit here is $28 bucks. No I didn't make a type-o; you read it right: $28 for the office visit. We scored and got Dr. Smith whose bedside manner was down to earth and kind;  not egocentric nor condesending as I so often experience in this type of situation, to both to us and my under the weather baby. The physical examinations she did on my Poopie (yes that's his name) was unbelievably thorough from nose to tail and everything in between. Poopie was so relaxed with her that he even began to doze off as she examined him. THATS huge for us as Poop is a Chihuahua and well.... we'll leave it at that. The diagnostics we needed to do as well as discharge meds were all SUPER SUPER low cost and affordable. A FIRST for this multiple gate keeper of the beloved furry beasts that inhabit my life, heart & home. I'm sold. Only I am... Now to make an appointment in the upcoming weeks for my geriatric pup Sis whose due for a check up. I couldn't recommend this vet clinic more and will be posting updates as well as each of my pack receive treatment there. ;)Final Grade: A+~ The End ;)`

<review# 1921,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2013,7/30/2013,591,132,8,20,12>The sushi here is quality. All sushi rolls are fifty percent off. The size of the rolls are very above average. I was full off of two rolls. I ordered the King Roll and the Sumo Sushi Roll without the cream cheese. Everything here was delicious. The King roll was especially delicious because it had four different fishes on top along with three different color tobiko and drizzled with their special sauce. This roll gets an A++ from me for freshness, sauciness (if that could be use in this description), and presentation. Both these rolls are decently priced. I also got try some of my friends rolls and neither one of them were bad. The rice was perfectly cooked and the fish was as fresh it could get. First time here it was not a let down. The service was slow. There were about five or four other parties in the restaurant. I can't imagine how much slower the service would have been if two other sections of the restaurant was filled up. I don't think the waiter was inexperience so much as it appears there was only one sushi chef behind the sushi bar. My friend and I waited about a good twenty five minutes for our sushi rolls after we had ordered. If its going to be consistently slow like this they should give us some edamame to chow on or a complimentary salad to pass the time while we stare at the colorful lit up decor that makes this place look like a nightclub. Also hungry people can get very grouchy and can get very impatient. I know because I tend to be one of them.I will waive the slow service and give this place a four star just because this place has only recently opened. I'm sure the service will improve as it goes. The reason for a four star is that the sushi rolls I ordered made a big impression on me. Neither one disappointed. So therefore I'm a fan and I'll for sure come back with more people and knock out the Sushi Boat. or maybe all to myself? Challenge???
<review# 1922,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2013,7/29/2013,202,243,18,19,18>I realize this may sound like hyperbole, but, honestly, this is probably the best 'ethnic' food restaurant I've tried. We popped in for lunch one Friday and were instantly greeted with island beats and sea foam & sunshine yellow environs. The sole waiter (owner?) was a true gentleman in every sense of the word. He was great! Very friendly and offered great explanations and excellent tips for the menu. My husband got the oxtail stew ("our most popular dish") and I got the curried goat (just because, c'mon curried goat!!). They also offer a whole fridge of Jamaican/Caribbean drinks. I got Ting - grapefruit fizziness and he got Champagne Cola (very bubbly). To start, they automatically bring out piping hot rolls and ice cold pats of butter. Then they bring out your salad (all entrees come with salad) - and it was actually served on a cold plate! I just loved the attention to detail at this place. They've truly thought your meal, your experience out - they are going to treat you so well. And speaking of treating you well --- the entrees were outrageously (like lip smacking-, no, table smacking-, hell, smack whatever you need- ) good. The oxtail stew is a thing of beauty. Soooooo delicious. The meat just falls off the bone and the flavors are comforting, yet surprising. My dish - the curried goat, was also awesome. Goat has such a neat flavor and I loved the potatoes that came with it. The curry wasn't spicy-hot, just pure flavor. I'll definitely order it again (though I'm getting the oxtail on my next visit - that stuff was amazing). And I know, I know, we were full; we should have stopped there, but we were having such a good time at this point, so we ordered dessert too. We got the slice of sweet potato pie to share - and it was huge! and delicious! and served with real whipped cream!! God, this place impressed me so much. This is not a light lunch, but since they serve the same menu for lunch or dinner, come for any meal and fall in love with the place and their awesome awesome awesome island cuisine.
<review# 1923,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2013,7/28/2013,222,224,6,11,10>Fries, fries, and more fries!While wandering around Old Sacramento, we came across this place after spending time at the Railroad Museum.  Interesting concept, serving fries according to different styles from around the globe, as well as other fried foods like corn dogs and chicken nuggets. We decided to try poutine (Canada), came out to about $6 and some change.  They use shredded mozzarella cheese instead of cheese curds, which is what you'd find in our neighboring country up North.  The fries were tasty, the gravy was a little on the salty side, but all in all, it was delish.Nice little place to get the ever-so-popular side item.  The owners are very polite and friendly too, always greeted people with a smile.
<review# 1924,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/21/2013,7/27/2013,202,116,9,11,10>As excited as I was when this downtown lunch spot opened, I had passed this place by after reading mixed reviews. Then after reading a good review in the paper, I knew it was time to try it for myself.1ST VISITI wandered in today and was greeted by a very friendly hostess who seemed happy to have me as a potential customer. They have plenty of sandwiches to choose from, but I eyed the buffet. The $9.99 (or $7.99 for cold only) buffet is offered to go, so I gave it a shot! They gave me separate containers for cold and hot selections.The cold section appeared very fresh, and featured spinach, black beans, tofu, strawberries, several dressings, and other stuff that equated to a unique salad experience!The hot section featured two vegetarian dishes, both of which were excellent, as well as seasoned rice. My favorite was the red peppers stuffed with breadcrumbs and cheese. The vegetable casserole was savory and filling. They also offered a hearty chicken option.The food isn't what I would expect from a standard "Mediterranean" restaurant, as this certainly wasn't a boring hummus and falafel situation. Per Trio's website, it's Mediterranean inspired, with recipes from France, Italy and Turkey, and ingredients drawn from local, organic farms. VERDICTAll I know is that it tasted like home cooking! You can tell there's a creative chef behind the menu. So I was happy with everything and have no complaints. If you're looking for something different, Trio is worth checking out.
<review# 1925,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/16/2013,7/26/2013,387,268,13,21,17>Hands down, the BEST Vietnamese restaurant in the Elk Grove Area.  Elk Grove is full of chain restaurants but has now been filling up with various Pho restaurants.  You will get no complaints from me, I love the Vietnamese style of cooking and all the fresh ingredients.  But Pho Le stands out and is number one! This small location, is nestled right next to 24 hour fitness on the corner of Center Parkway and Bruceville Road. It is small in size but they work very hard to Greet, Seat and Feed everyone!  I have been going to this restaurant since their Grand Opening a few years ago now, and service has remain stellar and great!The Pho is a flavorful broth that warms my belly with delight and they do not shy on the meat portions! The Bun Rieu is spicy goodness that one cannot pass up, unless you have shellfish allergies like my hubby (Yes, I always feel bad for him, he is missing out)! The Bun Thit Nuong is a humongous bowl of rice vermicelli noodles and charbroiled pork tossed with lettuce, cucumbers, cilantro, peanuts and nuoc cham sauce!  And all for under $8!  I'm sold! Bring on the noodles!During the times of this new Noodle battle: Ramen vs. Pho. . . I am completely and without a doubt on Team PHO LE!!!

What does this even mean? It means that it allows me to do my Van Dam splits without ripping. I know that doesn't sound right but it is what it is. Anyhow I'm diverging from my review please excuse me for doing that, sometimes I have to educate the retards about leotards haha that was poetic. Let me just say that lulu lemon is not just for women though most of their clientele are of the vaginal persuasion. Needless to say they have a mens line also that was made for me and my body type SEXSA!Are they expensive sure, but you dont equip a ferrari with cloth seats hell to the no. I promise you once you put on one article of clothing you'll be hooked. This is the same reason I shave my legs cause hair should not grow on steel. I will promptly be spending all my money here come pay day.
<review# 1927,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2013,7/24/2013,702,960,19,28,24>The name "Cafe Connection" doesn't let in on the wonderful cuisine that is served up here. Located across from the Capitol along the same row of shops as See's Candies, seating is plentiful and comfy and the first thing you'll notice is the smell of Carribean cooking. They do have traditional sandwich fare, but why settle for a boring sandwich when you can get jerk chicken with beans & rice, jerk burgers, curry chicken and the like? I got their daily lunch special -- it's not written up on the sandwich menu. Look for the small whiteboard. With a drink, it came to $8.14 with tax. I got the jerk chicken plate: spicy tender chicken over beans and rice with a side salad. Wow. My friend got the jerk burger. And that first bite is hot! Spicy hot! But then your mouth succumbs to the heat and all you want to do is eat more. Service is genuine and friendly. The owner passed out samples of their banana fritters - three for $4.50. If I hadn't gained weight and am trying to whittle down my bondakadonk butt, I would have inhaled a plate of these. Free WiFi, which is a bonus. Ask for the password, you'll crack up when you hear it!

<review# 1929,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/22/2013,2/11/2014,640,434,6,15,10>So I got a Groupon for this place for 3 months of unlimited classes.  It has now been a week and I have been here everyday taking the Boxing Class with Gilbert.  He is awesome! My friend and I were lucky on Monday, our first day, we had him to ourselves and we got some one on one time with him so that was really nice considering this is all new to us. He showed us how to properly wrap our hands and after putting us through the wringer with jogging, pushups, lunges and crunches, he worked with us on our stance and some basic beginning boxing combinations. Let me tell you the next day I was really feeling it, in places I never knew existed! But by the end of the week it didn't hurt as bad and I could tell I was stronger.  My friend has been to the Boot Camp class with Paulie and I will be trying that out as soon as I know it wont kill me! LOL Really looking forward to the kickboxing classes too, but for now my goal is to be here every morning for boxing class and let Gilbert get me in shape.  This place is NOT intimidating and everyone is welcome at all fitness levels. I was coming off the couch basically and after only one week I can really tell a difference, and the best part is you are learning a new skill at the same time. They make it fun and useful and at the same time they are kicking your butt and getting you in shape. Gilbert teaches several kids classes as well, if you have youngins they will be in good hands.....maybe thats why he has such patience with this old gal :)  You really should come check these guys out.

I came here and got the ceramic tint for my new car and I must say they do and awesome job finishing you off. I mean finishing it off. fak, you know what I mean.Anyhow the neighborhood is slightly sketchy but the shop and service got me cabbage patching and booty twerking my way out the door with a smile from ear to ear. The guys here know what they are doing especially if you are a picky person. Plus they guarantee you shiz for life. At the time that I got my tint I think I payed 300 and some change for the ceramic tint in the back 3 windows and blue uv tint for the front two windows. However you dont have to go urethra franklin like I did. I think their standard tint is like a 150 bucks which is also as good.I will be coming here over and over again.haha you know what I mean. get your mind out of the gutter.
<review# 1931,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2013,2/9/2014,25,127,5,19,9>What can I say about The Kitchen that hasn't been said before? I write here for posterity.We came in early September, at the beginning of their September offering. Amazing food. We got the best seats in the house -- at the very end of the counter/presentation seating. This meant we were almost always served last, but we got to watch half of the food prepared. It was so amazing -- like being in the front row of a cooking show without all the drama. I asked for presentation seating -- but I don't know if there's a special way to ask for it, because the first person I asked when I called back to make sure I got it didn't know what I was talking about. But no matter how you ask, there's no other way to do it. At least, not if there's just two of you. Service is impeccable and attentive. Staff all make a point of talking to you -- even the executive chef, John Griffiths. We also splurged on a wine flight. They will split it for you, but the pours, even splitting it, were very generous. My spouse didn't realize the sake in the intermission wasn't included, but I said that was perfectly all right -- we both enjoyed that extra bit. How often are we going to be able to afford to come? One night of decadence, almost no holds barred. I made a point of eating everything put in front of me, even the things I wasn't sure about. I've always mocked foam on cooking shows, but the foam used in our first course? Amazing. Added a beautiful flavor to the dish. For the naysayers: Portions are small, but that's the point. How are you going to eat that many courses with big portions?  You absolutely can ask for more, but we decided not to. I was tempted by asking for seconds on the dessert, a chocolate cannelloni concoction. This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us, or at least we'll save it for another special occasion many years from now. I'll just savor the memory and the feeling of delicious decadence I felt through the entire thing and honestly, for days after.
<review# 1932,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2013,2/8/2014,257,251,7,13,11>This review is LONG overdue.  Basically you should go here for so many reasons.  I'll give you 5 to start:1.  House-made Pork Rinds (the chili lime sauce was so good my bf asked if they could make him a drink with it.  And they did.)2.  Bone Marrow (no longer on the menu, seasonal perhaps? My first marrow- she was sumptuous and wonderfully fatty , mmm yeah baby.)3.  Fried Green Tomatoes (also a first for me, so good!  Flavorful, hot, and the coating was barely there but crunchy. )4.  Whiskey Cured Salmon Lox  (simply delicious. Come on, it's whiskey cured!)5.  $2 Olympia.  (Don't hate, appreciate!)I had a cocktail, I want to say it was a White Linen, and it was goddamn good.  No clue what they ended up putting in my bf's special request cocktail but he loved it.I like you Shady Lady.  I like you A LOT.
<review# 1933,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/24/2013,2/7/2014,263,136,14,14,11>Wear stretchy pants!  I am so happy that OZ opened in Elk Grove.  During the soft opening, reservations are only accepted.  I had a reservation on a Tuesday night at 6PM.  They sat us right away.  The restaurant is very open and spacious.  There are TVs everywhere.  At this location, there are more meat options for the AYCE.  It also includes three different appetizers; pot stickers, fries, and sweet hot chili wings.  Weekdays AYCE is $19.99 for adults and for weekends it is $20.99/person.On back of their AYCE menu were a long list of rules.  I felt very restricted when I was reading them.  I don't like rules.  One of the rules was, "you can only have 4 items at at time at your table."  They were very strict about this.  This also includes the appetizer.  So, we made sure to finish all our wings and put all the meat on the grill before asking for more.  I guess this ensures there isn't excessive waste which will result in a $5 charge, by the way. Our server, was just okay.  You can tell which servers were new and which servers were from the other location.  Of course the servers from the other location were more attentive and faster.  We had to ask our server multiple times for the same thing.  Also, it gets very loud in here.  I had to scream what I wanted to my server in order for her to hear me.Overall, this is the perfect place to stuff your face and be put in a food coma!
<review# 1934,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/11/2013,2/6/2014,202,243,8,17,14>Really, they deserve a 3.5, but rounding error in their favor since they are new. It's a cute, cramped space that serves as restaurant, cheese/cured meat store and tiny grocery. We went in for lunch one Friday. They had an overabundance of employees on-hand and their lunch menu was cheerfully written on a large chalk board above the counter. We each got a different grilled cheese sandwich which came with a small green salad. The food was delicious, but I kind of wanted an employee to talk up the included cheese, since I'm no gourmand when it comes to curds. Also, the lunch items were all pretty pricey. Not a lot of range in the foods' price points. Expect a sandwich to cost you approx. $12 or so. I think they need to better figure out their seating. They only have 2, maybe 3 large tables. It just seems like a lot of unused space since every group I saw come in (ours included) was 2 people. One group had to turn around too, since there was no empty table (and there were only 2 groups seated!). That's a problem. Maybe it'll be solved once the weather gets nicer, since they have some outside seating prepped to go. So there are some issues, but the bottom line is still positive. The food was very very good here. The salad that comes with the sandwiches was, in particular, outstanding. I loved its slices of radishes and light dressing. I'll come again.
<review# 1935,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2013,2/5/2014,202,116,7,17,12>I always felt like Enotria was an underdog with fancy concept and makeover, but weak execution. But I recently returned after a year absence to find a new chef, new concept, and transformed experience. Bottom line: Enotira is an underdog no more!Although items are available a la carte, they now strongly recommend the 5 or 7 course tasting menu. I would too. The food is now a step above - very fancy $$$$ status food. The experience is now akin to eating at the Kitchen, but better and without all the hoopla. Better because the dishes were actually tastier and more interesting, with slightly bigger portions, and I didn't have to wait 20-30 minutes between courses, as the service was prompt.The chef is a stickler, and doesn't like (or always allow) substitutions. But the upside is that he takes a lot of pride in the food and wants it to be executed well. Everything was presented elegantly, albeit on unnecessarily large plates. More importantly, each dish was complex, with a number of different textures and flavors that always worked well together. They served three, what I would call bread courses, during the meal, with the best being the salted pretzel bread.Everything, including the housemade gnocchi with black truffle sauce, scallop main course, and panna cotta was excellent. I paid extra and doubled up the scallop, which I would recommend. After the first few courses, we knew that everything we ate there was going to be great, and it's such a nice change to be able to have confidence in the chef, rather than having a hit and miss experience.They pride themselves on wine and had 1/2 off bottle specials when we went. Oddly though, I asked the sommelier for a modestly priced red wine that was well-balanced and easy to drink, and he recommended only one - a $110 Merlot/cab blend that he went on about. $110 isn't exactly modestly priced! There were plenty that were much more reasonable, so I'm not sure why he wouldn't at least recommend one in a lower price range. Still, it was a very enjoyable, albeit pricy, experience. Enotria is no longer a substitute for Ella or Mulvaney's, it's upgraded to one of Sac's best (and few) fine dining spots. And with the new chef in action, I'll be back here before I will be to the Kitchen!4.5 stars![Update: returned and again it was excellent. Slightly longer wait time for courses, but we cleaned our plates on every course. I posted pictures of each course, which they described in great detail but which I will not try to relay][Update 2: CLOSED DOWN! I hope Sac doesn't lose the chef to a bigger city]
<review# 1936,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2013,2/4/2014,466,199,17,23,19>Oh god the seafood nachos make me do the happy dance in my chair. Unlike most traditional nachos, each wonton "chip" is already set up with the toppings, so no hunting around in a pile of toppings for that one perfect bite.I loved the "6-Item" roll. Strange, since I usually avoid rolls with tempura shrimp inside, as it's sometimes fried ahead of time and sits around getting mushy. I didn't have that problem with the 6-Item and I was very happy that the tempura and sauces didn't overpower the snow crab.  The "Daniel, My Brother" roll had a light, almost thai salad roll sort of flavor with a bit of sriracha on top. The menu warns that it's spicy, but if you're a sriracha guzzler like me, it's closer to the mild/medium side of the spectrum.If you're big on big rolls, go for the Mt. Fuji and watch other customers' heads turn when the server brings this bad boy to the table.
<review# 1937,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2013,2/3/2014,58,202,8,15,9>When I watch K-Dramas and the characters are slurping up Korean Ramen complete with kimchee my mouth waters and I crave ramen for weeks! Usually I go to Asian market and get some of the extra spicy Korean brand ramen to try and help my cravings. BUT now there is Ramen and Rice, and it's only a few miles away from where I live! I can satisfy my cravings any time now :)Luckily we didn't have to wait for a table, we did have to wait a a while for our food. But since I'm a yelper I already knew that would be the case. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen and added kimchee, my husband got this seafood curry ramen that had 4 chili peppers next to the name. The waitress warned him it would be hot, he told her that was OK, that he liked hot. While waiting the table next to us got their soups, all of them had ordered what my husband ordered, and they were all older Korean men. The longer they ate the soup the more they sweat and blew their nose, they were speaking Korean so we didn't know what they were saying, but you could tell they were talking about how damn hot the soup was. LOL My husband finally looked at me and said, "I'm scared about the soup now, if they can barely handle it how am I?" hahahahahaha My husband is white and he likes spicy, but since I've introduced him to Asian foods he realizes that there are much more spicy things out there. Food arrives, mine is delish!!!! I love how smooth the broth is and how perfectly the kimchee pairs with it all. I would have liked mine to be a little more spicy, but still very good and you can tell it's made fresh. (No MSG ridden packet seasoning here) My husband LOVED his! Even though it was so spicy and he was sweatin' he didn't want to give up. He said the price was well worth it, for $9 there were over 10 muscles and many whole shrimps in the soup. So we will definitely be back! Only warning, the place only seats about 20 people, so either come early, or be prepared to wait!
<review# 1938,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/5/2013,2/2/2014,70,200,10,14,11>A few months ago, when my dog was long overdue for his annual shots and me not wanting to have to make an appointment and have to wait a week or two for him to get those shots, my friend recommended I take him to Mercy Pet Hospital because you can just walk in without making an appointment and get those services done at a relatively affordable cost. Once I got there, there were a few dogs ahead of us, and since it was my dogs first time here, I had to fill out some paperwork, which didn't take too long. However, the wait to go see the vet was about 45 mins, but they have a lot of seating in the waiting area for you and your pet to sit. But since my dog is super nosy and just likes to sniff and poke his nose at everything, I had to wait outside in the heat. Jerk! When it was finally time for us to go in and see the vet, we were taken into the room where they asked the standard questions they ask before they gave him the shots (i.e. does he have allergies, etc). The vet and the assistant was very nice and patient with my dog, who can be a handful sometimes. When they were trying to give him the bordetella vaccine, he was not having it and kept wiggling around. It took the both of them to finally get that shot in. I'm glad and grateful they were so careful and nice to him even though he was being so difficult, but I guess it's a part of their job and I'm sure they've dealt with just about everything.Thankfully, my crazy beast is healthy and fine, but if anything were to ever happen (knock on wood), I would definitely bring my dog back to Mercy!

On a fabulous drunken night, my friend and I were half a block from this place and my yelp radar screamed WEINER WORKS!! I ordered a chili cheese dog (no onions) and a small order of chili cheese fries. My dude friend ordered the largest hot dog (some odd feet of beef) as a chili dog and some chili fries as well. We ordered to-go, and took our drunken purchases back to the apartment to retreat to our amazing, fat, drunken stupor. We sat in an almost silent haze...spellbound in what we expected to be the most amazing, sinful delight of our drunken life....yet...we took our bites and thought....this is...okay.The hot dog similar to what you could get at a grocery store. No special snap to the bite...no amazing taste...just okay.The chili was good, yet the amount of chili to the amount of fries was scarce...i found myself squirting ketchup on many leftover fries due to the lack of chili. LAME! Their largest hot dog, is just two regular sized hot dog shoved into a large bun... super lame!I guess my expectations ruined the excitment of this place. Although I would never say this place is bad, I wouldn't say this place is the best...just okay. Sorry weiner works, add more chili to your fries, and maybe get a better quality dog...then I will be impressed. Until then...three stars shall do it justice.
<review# 1940,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2013,4/21/2014,570,275,7,12,11>I really like this spot. It's kind of like a hidden secret, tucked away at the end of a small shopping center. It sits there, quietly awaiting for people to come discover it.It truly is a small shop. Only two pedi chairs, with a few mani tables. If you show up, and a pedi chair isn't free, they'll bring the pedi to you! I've never seen someone set up shop that fast and make a pedi chair out of what seemed like nothing. A small touch to go above and beyond to please me and my friend.The women here were kind, did a great job, and give great foot massages!The price was incredible! $16 for a 1/2hr pedi (but really, it was a little over the 1/2 hour since they're cool like that). The price for a pedi maxs out at $25-$30. They're cheaper than most places and they're just as good. I'd gladly go out of my way to go back here if it means almost half the cost and quaint shop with great staff.Thanks for my pedi! It's still looking good almost 2 weeks later!
<review# 1941,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/21/2013,4/20/2014,210,713,7,14,12>It took me a while to find parking. In one of the residential streets, you can't park there unless you have a permit. The food came out fast. Service was ok. A hiccup was when we asked for the menu again after we were done eating, so that I could order dessert. The waitress didn't come back to take my order though. The restaurant wasn't busy. I had to turn around and try to make eye contact with her. Calamari- Fried calamari steak strips served with wedges of lemon and ranch dressing.They were crispy and thick.Bohemian Potato Pancakes- Two crispy discs of lightly seasoned potato pancake stacked Napoleon-style with smoked salmon, capers, scallions, and sour cream.I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered this appetizer as my entrée. I liked it, even though I wished there was more smoked salmon. I can never have too much of that.Tiramisu- Layers of lady finger cookies drenched in coffee and liquor alternated with layers of mascarpone cream cheese.The plate was drizzled with strawberry puree which added a hint of sweetness/tartness. The cake was light. It was a tasty way to end the meal.It was an enjoyable meal. I liked everything I ate here. Smoked salmon pizza next time!
<review# 1942,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2013,4/19/2014,357,62,5,17,11>What an outstanding experience!  If you are looking for a romantic night out, or fantastic food in Folsom, look no further...  but, make a reservation, and bring cash because they fill up (only 9 tables, and no space for groups larger than 4 people) and do not take credit cards (but, there is an ATM right outside).The food at Chez Daniel is a great value for a gourmet meal, where you will get soup, salad, entree, and dessert for $27-$30.We went this time to celebrate our daughter's birthday, because she prefers a great meal to a gimmicky song and dance.Food: Escargot to start, which was an additional $10, but well worth it.  They were fresh, and very smooth.I was lucky, and got the french onion soup, which was extremely rich and a little spicy.  Of course, chaff Daniel is known for his soups.  The little one had the vegetable soup which was made from asparagus, broccoli, and potatoes.  She enjoyed it so much, she exclaimed "This soup is so good, you have to eat it really slow!"For the main course, I had Rack of Lamb, and with the spice crust, mustard sauce, and perfect doneness, it was undoubtedly the best I have ever had.  My daughter had the duck with currant sauce and it too was outstanding.  The duck was sliced and each piece finished with a perfect crispiness yet cooked to perfection in the middle as well.  My wife had prawns and scallops, which had a lobster cream sauce which was also perfect.  What a great night.Service -Perfect as usual.  The restaurant is a 2 man operation, where the host/waiter knows every dish ingredients, and is happy to make recommendations.  We watched as he took care of another table of extremely pretentious people, and kept a smile while serving them... Talk about high maintenance.   The chef came out to our table 4 times throughout the meal to make sure my daughter was enjoying her food, and to bring a special dessert.  It was very fun!  I cannot say enough good things.Ambiance - Tiny little place with only 9 tables.  The lighting is low, tables perfectly set, and fun French cafe music playing on the speakers.  It is a quiet place, and just perfect for a romantic date.Value - Are you kidding?  A full 4 course gourmet meal for $30?! Wow.I love everything about Chez Daniel.  Outstanding!

<review# 1944,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/26/2013,4/17/2014,283,229,8,14,8>Chaos! That's the only word I can think of when describing this gym.  I usually go to the Foothills location, but this location had a basic step class that I wanted to check out.  This gym is so full of people that even though they had a huge parking lot I had trouble finding parking.  I walked into the gym and was greeted cheerfully by the front counter attendant.  She insisted I needed to take a picture even though I told her repeatedly not today. Then I asked where the bathroom and classroom were.  She gave me great directions to both (this place is huge). The bathroom is very warm. There are plenty of stalls though.  When I headed up the stairs to the classroom it was a challenge.  There were a ton of very rude people coming down and would not let me through.  Finally I get to the classroom and sit to the side until the class that is in there finishes.  They have an amazing view from the windows. The whole time I just got this feeling from the people (facial expressions and behaviors) that everyone is in a bad mood.  It was a horrible energy. I went into the class and it was generally a good class.  I got a great workout and the instructor even included an ab section on the end.  I would go to this location for classes (their class schedule is just much fuller then the Roseville location) and that's about it.  It reminded me of being in Disneyland on a weekend in the middle of summer.  Huge crowds of pushy people.  Not a fan of this location, but it's ok.
<review# 1945,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/25/2013,4/16/2014,1934,564,20,28,24>Kelly's Car Wash has become somewhat of a staple in express car washes around the Stockton area, so I was happy to see the sign that they were building a new one out in the Trinity Parkway area of Stockton.  I love the whole concept of Kelly's...fast and on the cheaper side, and you do the vacuuming yourself with the purchase of a car wash. This one is the same concept...they upped the number of vacuums available and there has to be a good 30 or maybe even more available.  They just opened a few days ago and they are running a dollar car wash special, but the other day the line for that went down the street. When the special goes away there always seems to be a coupon code in the Pennysaver and good Yelpers always seem to post the code as a tip, so be on the lookout for that.  It usually gets you a "works" wash and dry for 10 bucks.  The only issue I have is the lack of water used during the rinse process, sometimes I end up with blue foam in the cracks of my car after my wash....I know it sounds silly but if I pay 10 bucks to get my car washed the least you can do is spray it off good enough to get all the soap and wax off....But besides that one little thing, Kelly's is a great spot to wash your car...I would recommend them to a friend.:0)
<review# 1946,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/23/2013,4/15/2014,283,313,7,17,13>My coworkers and I decided to try out this new restaurant after hearing that it was opened. Came here for dinner on Tuesday after a long day's work. We arranged several carpools so we can reduce some carbon footprints and eliminate some people having to park in downtown. Which turns out wasn't a problem at all. Parking:This restaurant is surrounded by parking garages that has free validations for up to two hours as well as street parking. Street parking is free after 6PM anyways. The closest is Amtrak but not too far is Old Sac and Downtown Plaza (which you can go shopping too! Free validation at Macy's without purchase). The restaurant is sort of enclosed in the plaza next to some apartments and school. It's not too hard to find, definitely worth it.Atmosphere:The atmosphere is relaxing. The place is nicely decorated and some decor pieces are actually from Thailand (how neat!). The owner is super nice and friendly- making the experience that much better.My party of 12 came in waves of each carpool. Haha eventually, due to rainy weather, everyone made it there safely and hungrily. Which the owner didn't mind accommodating us at all.Food:Fishcake- Bf just loveddddd it. He said he could eat five orders of that by himself haha. It was delicious! The sauce was too spicy for me though.Satay chicken- Grilled marinated chicken skewers with peanut sauce. yummmPotstickers- It was more of dumplings.Pad Se Ew- We pretty much did a family style but we each ordered our dish of choice. This was mine. I loved it, so did everyone at the table. It was flavorful, sweet but not overwhelmingly, and just perfect.Larb- Coworker ordered this, never had this before. It was a salad dish but with pork. It was a tad spicy, but good nonetheless.Green curry- It went well with the rice. It's not a thick curry that I'm used to but that's alright because I think it made it that much better. It had bamboo shoots, green bell peppers, etc. My coworker ordered it medium, I would personally go mild. Not a baby when it comes to spicy food, but I can't handle too much heat.Thai chow mein- it was a wet (meaning, there's sauce) chow mein with thinner noodles than the Pad Se Ew. I like that one too.Mango sticky rice- I was soooo full that I can't eat anymore. I realllly wanted to eat it though. I will definitely be back to get this. My party really enjoyed this dessert to top it off their satisfying meal.My coworkers and I had a great time. The food was authentic. The place was nice. The owner/workers were so friendly. Even though the weather was rainy and cold, it made the day so much better. We will be coming back, already planning the next get together :)
<review# 1947,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2013,4/14/2014,124,64,11,20,15>5/5 stars! I love this place. Today was my first time trying Tea Culture. I live about 5 minutes away and this just became the closest tea/boba place. So stoked! Anyways.. On to the review.I came and and was greeted instantly. How their menu works is you start by picking the type of base you wanted and the size. A regular is $3.50 and a large is $4.25. You can pick between fruit tea, milk tea, or smoothies. Then you pick your tea base: black, green, or oolong. Next, you pick the flavors you would like to add into your tea. There's mango, lychee, honey, kiwi, green apple and much more. Then you pick the sweetness you desire. 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, or none. Keep in mind 100 and 75 are extremely sweet so id recommend 50 percent and lower ( i usually get 25%) ! Lastly, you pick your toppings! You get 3 toppings to choose from a variety if about 10 toppings ranging from flavored pudding, boba, jellys and more! What I love about this place is that I can creat my own drink, my own sweetness. And their consistency! They actually use measuring cups and look off of a blue print unlike other boba places that just do it by just eyeing it. For my drink I ordered a fruit tea. I picked green tea as my base and I added honey. I had my sweetness at 25% and I added grass jelly and mango pudding and boy was it AMAZING. I loved it. I actually came back for seconds the same day! I have asked my friends about how they felt about this place and I received mixed reviews. Turns out all my friends that have gotten the milk tea, they didn't like at all. So for those who are reading this and loves milk tea, I can't guarantee that you'll love this place. But if you try the drink I got, you'll love it! This is definitely going to be my go to place when I'm in need of some tea to satisfy my cravings. Thank you Tea Culture for opening up right by my house!!! Til next time :)
<review# 1948,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2013,4/13/2014,245,202,7,14,10>My bf and I stopped by for lunch on Sunday...  We walked in and was greeted and seated right away.  It's not a big cafe but very clean.  There were about 5-6 4-top tables.  Not ideal for a big group.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  We went to a wedding the night before and did a lot of drinking.  Pho was on my mind (best cure 4 hangover).  We ordered #4 pho (combo), spring rolls, banh mi sandwiches, and thai tea boba drinks.  Don't judge...  We took the sandwiches to go lol.  Pho was so yummy and flavorful.  I loved their broth.  It tasted clean and not oily.  We were both surprised when our server brought out the spring rolls.  Most places will give you 2 rolls cut in half.  This place gives you 3 rolls and they're HUGE.  We didn't finish the spring rolls.  Their thai tea boba drinks was pretty good too.  The boba was cooked perfectly.  We took our sandwiches to go and ate them later on that day.  I must say it's definitely the best banh mi I've ever had.  The meat was so flavorful and crispy.  The bread was soft but I heated up in the oven (broil) so it got crispy on the outside and it tasted ah-mazing!

My mouth is watering at this very moment...As many have mentioned it can get very busy and the lines are long during lunch hour but it moves quickly and you'll have your food in no time. The prime hour to beat the crowd is 2pm, which you'll always catch me on my days off happily grubbin' on my roast beef sandwich and a side of mash! Parking will cost you but well worth the food!!!

Decided to try something different and check out the Moon River Inn located on the outskirts of Sacramento. It's a short drive from our house to the doorway to the Delta. Freeport! They have a huge bar area. Lots of TV's to watch the NBA playoff game. Good mix of patrons, too. The bartendendress was brash and bold. Easy to make wise cracks with. Hilarious. Excellent selection of beer. Newcastle to Fat Tire on tap. My wife was hungry so she had a $2 taco. The jukey was jumping. The game was over and so we decided to order food from The Freeport Grill next door and bring it over to The Moon River Inn. The bartender called it in for us. The karaoke kicked off at 9 o clock. I sang one crowd pleaser and left them wanting more as we made our exit from the Moon River Inn....Moon River, wider than a mile,I'm crossing you in style some day.Oh, dream maker, you heart breaker, Wherever you're going I'm going your way. Two drifters off to see the world. There's such a lot of world to see. We're after the same rainbow's end -- Waiting 'round the bend, My huckleberry friend, Moon River and me.
<review# 1951,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2009,5/16/2009,443,552,7,10,9>O-M-G. Bikram is a whole other workout! A good one of course, and I'm hooked! As icky as it may be to have all that sweat literally dripping off every inch of your body, it feels very good because for me, a good workout entails sweating.I first heard about this type of yoga, where you're constantly sweating from the heated, sauna-like room, from a previous roommate who went routinely.  At that time I didn't think anything of it because I was on a one-minded track for running outdoors and going to the gym. Plus, yoga never crossed my mind because I didn't think I was flexible enough.  However, after running my first marathon two years ago and a few half marathons since, my joints and muscles started to tense up a lot. I felt the kinks and knots, started getting shin splits. That's when I decided to look into the regular type of yoga and went to a few classes at the gym.  I enjoyed it a lot because not only did it help me soothe out the aches and sores, but it was also emotionally calming and mentally relaxing. However, after attending several yoga classes, I decided I needed a challenge and wanted variety to spice up my workout routine. That's when I began researching Bikram Yoga. I was a little turned off with the fees, but talked myself into it because after all, it is for the betterment of my health.  I stopped by Yoga Loka this past Saturday, a small studio, sort of hidden in an alley way, to get the pricing list, and the following day I came prepared- mat, towel, and water in hand. I was stoked about the intro special that I paid- 10 consecutive days for $15, and I'm going to make sure I put those 10 days to use!  The instructor for that Saturday morning was great...she seemed stern at first and I felt a little intimidated by her, but I think it's because she really wants you to push yourself to your limit.  I was actually surprised at how far I was able to go.There were a few first-timers that morning and she paid more attention to us.  A few people had to leave in the middle of the class and the instructor was perfectly ok with that. I have to be honest, I almost thought I couldn't last in the 90-minute sweltering heat, but I finished strong.  I also think going to the regular yoga classes before really helped me to survive Bikram.  You can tell those who come regularly by their flexibility, and I only envied and wished I was able to do what they can.This little to no impact workout will definitely serve my joints well. I can't wait until I become more flexible. From what I've read, Bikram does wonders for the body, especially if you've had previous injuries. Gentlemen out there, yoga isn't just for females only.  Even if you're new to yoga, it's something you go at your own pace and there's no competition.  Don't be intimidated or scared! The practice is so beneficial that I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone!
<review# 1952,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2008,5/15/2009,14,123,10,15,10>I recently had a massage with Zach and it was simply amazing. Seeing as I love getting massages I have not ever have a bad one, but my experience with Zach was unique to any other I have ever had. Every aspect of my time was perfect and it accumulated into truly relaxing and wonderful experience.The first thing you'll notice when you walk into the room is how peaceful it is. He has really gone out of his way to make the room warm and inviting thus creating a space where you feel safe and relaxed. As you take everything in you'll notice his extreme focus on detail. He has really thought about things from the customer's stand point and provides anything you could think of. When I first got there I had been rushing and of course was hot, sweaty and thirsty. Almost immediately after I sat down and took a breath he offered me water and told me to just relax and calm down. After just a few minutes talking with him I already felt great...and I hadn't even had the massage yet!Now for the actual massage...  Zach is very communicative with you to make sure he focuses on the areas you want or the areas you are having trouble with. Also, if you don't want something done just say the word. I personally hate my feet being touched so he steered clear and I was extremely happy. I've had massage therapists before that get so stuck into their routine that they forget to specialize their work for each individual client.Towards the end of the massage when I was on my back Zach brought out a rolly pillow thing to go under my neck and a warm, soft cloth thing to cover my eyes. This was my favorite part! The warmth and the pressure just made me melt. How I felt then is how I want to fall asleep every night. Simply amazing.And finally, Zach uses aromatherapy which is just one more detail that adds to your overall experience. My sinuses were seriously totally cleared up by the time I left and I didn't even know they were stuffed to begin with. But of course, as with everything, aromatherapy is totally optional. Summary: Yes, this is a lengthy review. It could be lengthier. I just had to make sure to share how simply wonderful Zach is as a massage therapist. It's so rare to find someone that is doing a job that you can see is their true calling. He's professional, kind and warm. If you schedule a massage with him you are in for a serious treat.
<review# 1953,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2009,5/14/2009,6,40,1,6,5>My boyfriend made reservations here for Valentine's day.  They had a special Valentine's day menu, so I'm not sure about their normal day to day menu/food options, but...I thought the food was fabulous!  I ordered the lobster ravioli and was blown away by the citrus cream sauce it came with.  I wish I had the recipe so I could make that all the time!  My boyfriend ordered the fillet mignon, and while I enjoyed the bites with bacon, he thought the bacon was too much.  We started with the champagne honey fries and wow! I knew honey on fries was good (I used to dip my french fries in the honey or sweet and sour sauces at McD's) but with the champagne and spices they had it was something else.  And for dessert, we skipped on the special Valentine's dessert of something super chocolatey and got the mango bread pudding instead, and I'm so glad we did.The service was great.  Our waitress was super sweet and upbeat (even though she had to work on a holiday) and was extremely personable and friendly.  I just wanted to pinch her cheeks and shrink her down and keep her in my pocket.  Her knowledge of the wines they served really helped out when we were picking which ones we'd like with dinner.I have a feeling I'll find a reason to go back, if only to see that waitress again, though I would like to try some dishes from their daily menu.
<review# 1954,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/17/2008,5/13/2009,46,95,5,6,6>Maybe I was starving or maybe this was one of the best burgers I have ever had! My mom, sis and I decided to come here after shopping around at the galleria and making our way over to the fountains. The wait was about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad. Once seated our drink order was taken and the hostess recommended the sweet potatoe fries. Which we definitely were all in on ordering! I'm a big fan of the way things are done around this joint. The interactive menu, where you get to decide just how you want your burger prepared is way fun! There are tons of options even the picky will be pleased. I went for the beef patty, 1/3 lb, on a honey wheat bun with the jalapeno jack cheese. Then added on some red onions, tomatoes, and sprouts and finished it off with the roasted garlic aioli. It was awesome! The burger was juicy and cooked the way i wanted it. The cheese was really tasty and the fresh veggies were the right touch to make the burger one to remember! Not to forget the awesome sweet potato fries!!! They were really great. Slightly sweet and a tad salty. YUM! You only need one order between 3 people too, plenty to go around. I will definitely be back for more. Oh and the prices aren't too bad either!
<review# 1955,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/18/2008,5/12/2009,9,27,2,4,2>We went because the place is about  mile from my friend's place and we decided long ago that we definitely had to try a place that would put wonderful in its name. Really, we were simply expecting bad Chinese food that was cheap and chalk it up to adventure. We were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food! As expected, the prices were pretty cheap but the portions were a reasonable size and the food was not too greasy or gooey. We both enjoyed the hot tea which was cheap Chinese place standard black tea, and our dinner included hot & sour soup that was just the right combination of both. She ordered the sweet and sour pork. It came out with big pieces of pork and crunchy carrot, bell pepper and onion pieces. It had just enough sauce and was appropriately sweet. My cashew chicken had plenty of  pieces of good chicken, lots of vegetables and lots of cashews. It's funny that I just read about the crappy service. One of the highlights of our night was the service. It was attentive and one of the employees (who had obviously worked there awhile) was walking around and helping any table that needed it by filling water, taking orders and giving each table their own share of heckling. She was hilarious! So, I am going to give this place three stars for good food, fun and attentive service and really good value. Definitely stop by if you're in the 'hood.
<review# 1956,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2008,5/11/2009,7,43,5,7,5>This is the best Italian restaurant in Sacramento that I have been to. I am Italian, and I have to say that good Italian food is hard to find. We usually travel to Napa to have great Italian. I have been to Biba's 4 times and each time has been delicious. The appetizers are single portions and not meant to be shared, but they will if you ask. The second, or pasta, course shouldn't be missed. My dad and I will usually order the gnocchi. The style of the sauce that accompanies the gnocchi is seasonal. However, they always offer a Gorgonzola cream sauce. This doesn't show on the menu, so you have to ask for it. The sauce is to die for and the gnocchi melts in your mouth. Every time I split an order, I wish I had the whole thing. Then I remember that I have 2 more courses coming. The meat dishes are also seasonal, but everything I've tried has always been good. I'm not a huge dessert fan, I usually just take a bite off of whatever someone else orders, but once they had a tart cherry torte with vanilla bean gilato. OMG! It was years ago and I still think about this dessert today.
<review# 1957,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2008,5/10/2009,4,35,2,3,3>Hands down the best deli in Roseville area.  Sandwiches are HUGE and extremely tasty.  I can only ever order the small size and it STUFFs me.  Who on earth can eat the large size sandwiches at Stanaway's??  Maybe Lance Armstrong or some 350lb lineman.Family owned as you know if you've read the other postings.  Very friendly.  The only knock on them is that there is usually just the husband making the sandwiches.  He takes his sandwich building VERY seriously...he's like an artist that way...but he is the ONLY one making the sandwiches.  So if you want to get in and out quickly for lunch....call in advance.  When I don't call in advance, I often have to go next door to Border's books for 10 minutes while they make my sandwich.Still, I can't knock a star off of them for that because regardless of the sometimes long wait...I'm jonesing for another sandwich within 24 hours!!  Boar's Head meats are THE BEST. And the cheeses used are 100x better than anywhere else.  If I'm paying $8.00 for a sandwich it better friggin blow me away.  Well, Stanaway's sandwiches do!

I was expecting a repeat of what was there prior.. another overpriced, over inflated, bro magnet.  Of course, being in Roseville, you will still encounter some of that (it's unavoidable but I just consider it good people watching) but the atmosphere, service and food at Zocalo are nothing like what was there before. First of all, I immediately loved the renovations. The previous restaurant was dark and closed off, while Zocalo is bright and spacious. They still have the same great patio (just without as many of the drunkies causing a scene) and the vibe out there is so relaxing. We enjoy grabbing a quick drink at the bar inside before heading out to the patio for dinner - best of both worlds!I had never been to the Zocalo downtown so I wasn't sure what to expect but I was really surprised with the menu. So much to choose from and the prices were reasonable. I have now had dinner there a few times and have been very satisfied with my food and the service each time. They also have a  good selection of drinks including margaritas, mojitos, palomas and my personal favorite, Caipirinhas. It's rare to find a place that has such a fun atmosphere while also having great service and delicious food. I highly recommend checking out Zocalo if you are in the area.During Yelps Farm to Handle event Zocalo was there serving street tacos (so good) and passing out free appetizer coupons. Sounds like a good excuse to make a stop in soon... not that I need one.

The design of the restaurant was sleek and clean with a little asian flare.   As we walked in we were first greeted by a friendly staff and the owner.  The waitress was happy to answer any questions especially since it was our first time.  We tried the Bi Bim Bap and Kim Chee fried rice.  Both of these were delicious.  The Bi Bim Bap was served in the stone bown which makes the texture of the dish awesome.  Some dishes come with the variety of kim chee, black beans, bean sprouts, etc...  I think they serve more of this at dinner and not lunch but the waitress let me try as many of them as I wanted.  I really want to go back and also try the tofu soup and also the Japanese food.  The owner said they have $5.00 Korean beer and he is thinking of doing a happy hour food menu.  The price is pretty reasonable even without happy hour specials.  I can't wait to go back!!!   Note:  Delivery service for minimum of $30.00.
<review# 1962,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/6/2013,1/29/2014,899,839,8,12,8>Assuming you visit during happy hour, this place can turn out to be ridiculously affordable. Food: Sapporo serves up sushi, drinks, and random fried snacks. Most of their sushi follows the more American or Koreanized style, emphasizing rolls doused in fattening sauces rather than nigiri sushi. I came here with some colleagues during happy hour for an event. I initially thought that this place was going to break the bank, but wasn't sure as we didn't foot the bill. Thankfully, the prices during happy hour are reasonable. I was able to fight off several greedy hands and sample a number of rolls (yelp.com/biz_photos/sapp, yelp.com/biz_photos/sapp), all of which featured fresh fish and lip smacking sauces. If fish isn't your thing, they also have numerous sides including edamame and gyoza (yelp.com/biz_photos/sapp). Interestingly, they also offer less traditional items including  potato, sweet potato, and yam fries (yelp.com/biz_photos/sapp) and lettuce wraps (yelp.com/biz_photos/sapp). Pretty sure the lettuce wraps are a Chinese thing... but they were ok so I'm just going to forget that that happened. During happy hour, the drink selection is pretty limited, but you can get all the standard beer and wine you care to drink. Atmosphere: While it's not wallet-busting if you visit at happy hour, it still looks expensive. Some of the tables in the front are made of felled trees, giving it a little extra character. It seems as if a lot of people from the state capitol hang out here after work. Service: They'll take your order lickety split and cart out the sushi before you can blink. Synopsis: The sushi isn't the best quality, but it's still tasty and well worth the happy hour price.
<review# 1963,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/15/2013,1/28/2014,161,382,11,17,9>The basics: It's like a giant version of the cell phone accessory booths that you find in every single mall in America.What works: If you are looking for a case for your Nokia flip phone from 1993 then you can probably find it here. They have just about any kind of phone case, cord, or screen protector you can imagine. You can also send things FedEx from here and they sell plenty of items to help you package your goods.What to improve: English as a second language makes it a little annoying when trying to communicate anything. I had some little old woman following me around like I was going to steal the $3.95 packing box I was carrying around with me.The short version: If you're after a simple phone accessory or need to ship something this is your place. Otherwise I cannot see any other single reason to drop in.
<review# 1964,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2013,1/27/2014,184,59,11,17,15>YASSS! I can officially review this place post cronut purchase. As a recent elite/yelper, I often try and keep up in the conversations in Talk to see what's new. lo and bebold, I stumbled on a conversation about Cronuts (or doissants as this place calls them). Never heard of them before this but apparently they're pretty big back east. In any case, my experience with Sweet Dozen has been nothing short of super. The first time I tried to venture for a cronut I almost missed the spot because its located in an unsuspecting shopping mall. I eventually found it and walked in to a super busy, bright yellow donut shop..it almost feels like a baby room inside (so warm! Lol) I'm pretty sure it's a mom and pop place with their daughter who handles the front of the house operations -- very sweet lady. Unfortunately on my first visit I went too late (10am) and the owners were all sold out of the infamous Cronut. Apparently it is advised to call your cronut order in 24 hours in advance so they can prep for you. Live and learn. I ordered a croissant (which was absolute heaven) and a cup of joe and went on my merry way.My second visit (today) I was prepared. I called the donut shop as soon as I got to work on Friday to pick the Cronuts up on Saturday by 8 am. I was greeted by the front of the house lady with a big smile and the box ready for me. When I got home and took a bite into the sweet, slightly crunchy goodness I almost wanted to fall over. They were that good. They really are like a croissant with the sweetness of a donut.All in all I spent $36 dollars for a dozen Cronuts. One might think that's steep (3 dollars a cronut) but they are well worth it. I am not a fan of sweets and I love these. Well done Sweet Dozen! I'll be back!

This place is the stuff of legends, the place to take your clients and coworkers for a nice lunch. An institution in fine dinning before there was such a thing in Sacramento. And maybe, just maybe if it were 1998 I would have been impressed. But alas, it's 2013 and the Waterboy underwhelmed. First I called to get a reservation at 7:30 a week in advance. They could only fit me in at 7:45. So imagine my surprise when we arrive at 7:42 and see not one, not two, but over ten tables wide open and ready for patrons. I think they could have squeezed me in. The place felt like I was walking onto the set of the Golden Girls and I expected Blanch and Dorthy to step inside any minute. The mock wicker chairs and random small tress need to go. The place would be so much more welcoming without it. I was pretty hungry and wanted to get an appetizer but they all looked so bad I had to pass. Seriously deviled eggs? Cheese served with cranberry walnut bread. I think they could do better. My husband got the crostone and he enjoyed it. The broth was good but the shrimp was undercooked. He also had the rib eye and really liked it, one of the best he has had. I had the chicken cooked under a brick and it was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy and not even slightly dry. But over twenty dollars for one chicken breast seemed steep no matter how good it was. We ordered dessert and both were disappointing. My husband had the pecan tart and it was just a pastry shell filled with raw pecans covered in cream. My flour-less chocolate cake tasted like regular cake and was flavorless. However, the drinks were outstanding. The wine list is long and the sauvignon blanc paired perfectly with my chicken. The dark and stormy was spot on and the dessert cocktail was the perfect end to the evening. The food is good but there are too many amazing restaurants in Sacramento to make me want to come back. This is definitely a place for the older crowd who savors the good old days.
<review# 1966,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2013,1/25/2014,989,460,10,18,12>I've been here a couple of times already (everything we ordered came out very good) but my most recent visit just earned this place a full five-star rating.We stopped by for lunch the other day. After entering the door, we were seated promptly, which is always appreciated. Taking a few moments, we ordered the spicy basil chicken and green beans, drunken noodles with real crab meat, ginger tilapia and white rice. Oh, and definitely have to order the Thai iced tea.The portions for this place is plentiful and the prices are very inexpensive. Each item was tasty in its own way. I've tried so many different dishes here and it's nice to know that no matter what you decide to order, it'll be good.As we were finishing up, we had quite a bit of leftovers for two people. The to-go boxes were dropped off and we started packing away the food. Our waiter returned and saw how much rice we had left, which was just enough for one person. He asked if we would like more, but we insisted that we were fine. To go above and beyond our expectations, he flashed us a smile and walked away only to return with enough rice for two people. I go out to eat a lot and it's not often that I see someone genuinely take care of their customers like that. I mean, at a nice restaurant, it's expected but at a casual place like this, I shouldn't have underestimated it.Hands down, the best Thai restaurant in the area.
<review# 1967,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/7/2013,1/24/2014,343,568,13,19,15>Who doesn't love BBQ?Either you're not American or you're an annoying vegetarian, and I don't want to be your friend.(Sorry, that was an overreaction...I'll still be your friend, I just won't invite you to BBQ).Back Forty is a solid option with a cute back story (yes, I'm one of those dorks who reads the backs of menus).  Everything I've tried is good.  The hot links are very spicy, the ribs are tender, the brisket is flavorful, the chili is yummy, and the corn bread with honey butter is 23 skidoo (I'm running out of adjectives here!).  Sometimes they offer specials, like mac and cheese...it was one of the best macs I've had in a while!  I tend to like the sweeter BBQ, which isn't the style here.  So if you prefer baked beans and cornbread that WON'T give you cavities, you'll like it here.  Also, request the spicy BBQ sauce, which is less sweet than the regular (which is ALMOST sweet enough for me).  But if you like brown-sugary-molasses-laden BBQ, skip the beans and go for a different side.  The service is friendly, the food is good, and the prices are fair.

The salad was the largest portion while the rest were in small saucers.  If you ran out of a side dish, you could order more, as much as you wanted.  No rice, but you can order it.  My brother recommended against it because it would just fill you up quickly!Some of the items we orders from the AYCE BBQ: marinated galbi, bul-go-gi, garlic chicken, shrimp, sam gyup sal (pork belly), chili wings, and pot stickers.Everything was DELICIOUS!  You are left to cook the meats yourself to your liking.  Alice ended up taking her break and Gregory, who was dressed as Waldo, took over as our waiter.  Definitely pace yourself and if you order chicken, make sure it's cooked all the way before you eat (don't want salmonella!).Aside from the seating hostess, Alice and Greg were AWESOME.  Courteous, not overbearing, and always made sure we had our drinks filled and enough food. :)Great place to come with a group and enjoy the game :)CLIFFS:-My brother knows his food spots-Great service-DELICIOUS food-AYCE BBQ (all you can eat)-4 items at a time, 2 hour time limit on food (not table time)
<review# 1969,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/30/2010,7/14/2010,303,88,5,8,5>Last weekend I had held off on eating for long enough to think I could eat an entire side of cow.  Where is there a place to get myself a side of cow  in Sacramento, I thought?Finally I remembered the place my dad used to take me when I was a kid, Sam's.  To use a cliche, in these tough economic times, I find myself going back to the places that remind me of a kinder, gentler time. A time when credit cards and SUV's were more accessible, gas was cheaper, and meat and potatoes was considered a healthy diet.We sat on the raised platform that is behind a brass rail.  I do not recommend sitting here because everybody lines up there to order food. At first I thought the guys were checking me out. But they were just eyeballing my food.I ordered a french dip sandwich and my mother, Carla C. (yelp.com/user_details?us), ordered the corned beef brisket Rueben.  The meat on the French Dip tasted good. However, the au jus was pretty flavorless.  Boo!  My mom's Rueben was also "standard, bland, American style."  We both used horseradish and she added mustard.If I go again, I will bring A-1 sauce!The bathrooms were definitely fabulous! I give them 5 rolls.
<review# 1970,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2010,7/13/2010,518,148,6,12,11>LOVE Biba! The food is fab. The service is extraordinary. The ambiance is old school. Got to come here again last week for Dine Downtown Week and had a dining experience that would be hard to beat. First, kudos for providing black linen napkins to us ladies wearing black. It keeps the white lint from sticking to our ensemble and is the sign of a restaurant that cares about their patrons. Details like this are what keeps Biba at the top of the dining scene. Ok, I admit. The clientele may be a little older although I was happy to see lots of young groups taking advantage of the prix fixe menu. Old to me is 80; young is 20ish. Food was spectacular. Let me enlighten you.... Polpette di Granchio e Cappe Sante. Crab, prawn and seafood cakes. Light, crispy, large, delightful. Gnocchi di Ricotta con Gorgonzola. Housemade ricotta gnocchi with sweet gorgonzola sauce. Gnocchi are little pillows of love and these did not disappoint! A perfect sized portion to leave room for lots more to come. My fave course! Spaghetti alla Puttanesca. Spaghetti with tomatoes, garlic, capers, olives and hot pepper flakes. Not too spicy. Not a fan of olives, but picked around them and loved every bite. Filetto di Manzo con Pancette Affumicata. Grilled Filet Mignon wrapped in smoked Italian bacon. Beef with bacon? Are you kidding me? Awesome! I could feel my arteries clogging up, but at least I will die with a smile on my face. Branzino in Padella con Burro, Capperi e Limone. Sauteed Sea Bass with a wine, butter, caper and lemon sauce. Superb. Perfectly cooked. Every bite a mouth-watering delight. Apple Crostata for dessert. A perfect ending to a perfect meal. Courses were perfectly spaced out so as not to hurry you yet give you enough time to linger and converse with your compadres. If our server thought he might be interrupting a conversation, he hung back until we were finished talking. Actually, we're big talkers so he probably just jumped in when he saw a rare break in the conversation. For drinks, I had the House Pinot Grigio and Hubby had a cocktail,...or two. So for the special menu at $30 per person, the dessert which was not included in the prix fixe menu and drinks, dinner came to about $100. Not bad. Pros: Are you kidding me? The food! Service is impeccable. Black linen napkins rock! Good value. Cons: Decor is old school (outdated) and could use a little refreshing. Not a fan of the eye-height stick-on mirrors that encircle the room. Can get loud in there.
<review# 1971,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2010,7/12/2010,187,255,5,7,7>Love, love, love this theater!!!! I got to check this place out this past weekend when I came with my co-worker/friend to see Little House on the Prairie The Musical (which was fantastic!). The theater itself is really nice, it was really spacious and the staff was very friendly and quite helpful.  The will call box office was friendly and efficient as well.  We had decided to get the cheapest seats possible for the matinee and our seats were all the way in the back.  And when I mean in the back, I mean, last row, and the only thing behind us was the cement wall.  :)  Although the seats were not horrible and we could see the show just fine and the orchestra pit as well, I agree with Stephanie N's review, for a show, it would probably be better to sit closer so you can see the faces of the actors and actresses.  Overall the theater was a wonderful place to see a show, bathrooms clean, a fast moving snack bar, and alcohol line.  I am definitely going back! :)
<review# 1972,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/25/2010,7/11/2010,53,209,1,12,8>Although it is not the primary focus of this review, I have to say I am totally amazed/bewildered/skeptical of several negative reviews appearing below.  Let me put this simply: I have eaten at Hawks at least 25 times (a conservative estimate), and NEVER have I had anything resembling sub-par food,  I certainly acknowledge that no restaurant is perfect, but I know of no other restaurant in the area which prides itself more on delivery of consistent, precisely executed cuisine.  Period.    Okay, here's what really motivated me to write this time.  We had the pleasure of attending their winemaker dinner featuring Peay Vineyards, the excellent Sonoma Coast producer of expressive cool-climate wines.  Now, all too often (at restaurants in general, not at Hawks) such wine dinners can seem a thrown-together affair, with a fine selection of wines and a nice menu, but little thought given to the matching of the two, as if winery and chef devised them in separate vacuums.  This affair, however, was a beautiful case study in wine and food pairing, exhibiting restraint, thoughtfulness, and care in both the creation and delivery of the menu.  The amuse bouche for the evening was a plate of gougeres, those impossibly light puffs of buttery, cheesy air, paired with a crisp, bracing rosé of Pinot Noir.  Kudos to the Peay family for making a true rosé (bottled under their Cep label), from grapes grown for that purpose, and not just junking off the saignée juice from their red wines like most domestic rosé producers do.  A fun, light start to the evening's festivities.  Next came a lovely, light composed salad of Spring vegetables which embodied the seasonal approach and deft touch of the kitchen, matched with a Roussanne/Marsanne cuvee.  This led nicely into a showstopper of a course, Nantucket scallops with Swiss chard and lime pickle.  The scallops were just barley cooked via a brief bath in beurre monté, showcasing their natural fresh, sweet character, while the buttery, soft chard held an intriguing nuance of the citrus.  Peay's 2007 Chardonnay was spectacular, but those scallops are still on my mind.  Next we got into what some might consider dangerous territory: matching several red wines with fish.  Two separate vintages of Peay's estate Pinot Noir (2004, 2006) were paired with a red wine-poached halibut in beurre rouge, and this one threaded the needle like a Steve Nash bounce pass.  The halibut, notoriously difficult to cook properly owing to its leanness, was spot-on, with a textural richness and subtle flavor which meshed seamlessly with the surprisingly subtle red wine reduction.  The wines were each magnificent, by the way, the meditatively good 2004 showing loads of sous bois, earth, and dark cherry, while the 2006 took a more vibrant berry tone.    Finally, a "surf and turf" that finished the wine pairings in style: a seared piece of ahi tuna alongside a piece of Hawks inimitable braised short rib, paired with Peay's 2007 La Bruma Syrah.  In this case, the relative youth of the wine served to cut the richness of the beef while its mineral characteristics played well with the fresh, oceanic notes of the meaty tuna.  A tasty strawberry shortcake with marvelous local strawberries rounded out the evening; a bit of our leftover rosé made for a surprisingly great pairing with this!  Special mention is due to the management and service staff, who provided astonishingly attentive, thoughtful, and and choreographed service throughout the meal...no small feat considering that many other diners in the packed dining room were ordering from the regular menu as well!  In summary, I cannot say enough about what this meal signifies in terms of the maturity and precision of the cuisine turned out by Hawks' chefs.  The seafood-centric theme of the meal was inventive and magnificently implemented, lending a narrative flow to the entire menu which gave a satisfyingly cohesion to the dining experience.  The adventurous wine pairings heightened the excitement all the more.  As I alluded to earlier, meals like this epitomize the creativity, passion, and hard work which Hawks puts into their craft on a regular basis.

There is one server there that reminds me of a woman who aspired to be on Broadway but failed miserably and now hates her life for serving coffee to senior citizens and 20-somethings that are constantly burping up their vodka tonics from the night before. It's not that she's rude, she's just insane. She reminds me of Liza Minnelli. I can tell everyday she's suppressing the idea of breaking out into a song-and-dance routine on the Waffle Square kitchen counter. "Waffle Square, Waffle Square, where oh where did the batter go? No one knows! No one knows!" Box-step, Box-step, sashay, sashay. Twirl and freeze - jazz hands.Anyway, about  the food. I ordered a waffle. It's called Waffle Square...should probably get the waffle right? Decided to go with the banana nut Waffle with whipped cream. It was good. No complaints. Nothing fancy or gourmet about this place. It tastes just like you'd expect it too. I think I ordered the sausage links too and of course, standard. Decent prices. Therefore, 4 stars, "Yay! I'm a fan."

There was this gravy on top of the omlet that was so good...  The bottomless mimosas was $9, which I think is more than other places around Sac, but the server was prompt and never let me see the bottom of that glass, so I was happy. Also, she gave me a wink and a smile when she came to take the order and I immediately blurted out: "Bottomless mimoas please!" ... Thanks for not judging!

They got the shredded hash browns too. There are a couple of really cool retro booths you can sit in, too. They're like little wood caves. I guess it's the First Class section. We sat in front of the gigantic window. Afterwards, we explored the airport area. You can watch the planes outside the restaurant through the fence. Lots of old Sacramento photo memories inside the airport. Freeport Boulevard. Would Love to take little Freddy up up up and away someday.
<review# 1980,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/29/2010,7/1/2011,826,495,7,8,13>I've been a member of various gyms for over 25 years, and what really annoys me is when people decide that they are not going to a gym because its a meat market. Really? What did you think it was, the library?The whole point of going to a gym is to get your body into shape and if the people at a particular gym look good, then it means they are working hard and seeing results.That's why I like this 24 Hour Fitness. Just walking in you can tell that people are serious about their fitness. The members look good and are serious about their workouts.The gym has an excellent selection of cardio machines, resistance training machines and free weights. There is also a great choice of cardio fitness classes, a full basketball court with some serious looking games taking place, indoor pool, hot tub, steam room and sauna.Even after work, always the busiest time in any gym, machines are readily available and you can keep your workout going.I'd also say that the sales people are interested in you and now that gyms have moved away from yearly contracts, you can feel good about joining with a month to month membership. And with a regular price of $35 per month and many corporate discounts available, its definitely affordable.24 Hour Fitness also gives you a free session with a personal trainer who can help you plan your goals and get you on the right track. If you decide you want more personal attention, trainers are available.The other reason people feel uncomfortable joining a gym is that they think all the fit people are laughing at them. But the important thing to remember is that everyone started somewhere and this isn't high school. Gym members respect effort and progress. So if you've been putting off joining a gym because you're embarrassed by your body, get in there and start doing something. You'll probably be surprised at how much encouragement you get from the other members.

I purchased a "head sock" (not sure what the proper name for it is) for a dollar and Miki brings out this Afro that was bigger than a basket ball and tells me that I could make it bigger with a pic. Oh shit! Bigger?!? hahaha! I put it on and when I looked at her and then the mirror we both nearly fell to the ground, we laughed so hard. The change caught us both by surprise and it took a while for us to get it together and we realized once our eyes adjusted to the magnitude of this Afro, that it actually looked slammin'. Now I was not so sure about the puffs because the Afro was great! I had her show me the puffs again and that was it, I was taking them as I had to ask her for them because they were not on display and I thought they would be pretty cool to wear and hopefully unique. I told Miki I was going to a 70's party and she then led me to some earrings that were as big as the puffs so I bought them. She hooked me up! She was super sweet, super funny, and super helpful. It's too bad I don't wear wigs more often because I loved the place. The guy at the register was getting a kick out of us too and every so often I'd catch him laughing. I noticed they had a lot of stuff you could use for costumes... weird contact lenses, hair pieces, jewelry, etc. Now I have to figure out where else I'm going to rock the puffs.
<review# 1982,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2011,6/29/2011,129,310,15,8,10>Holy Jebus, this place was delightful.  I was iffy about my boyfriend's instructions to "just push my way through the hallway to get to the bar", but it worked.  I settled atop a cushiony barstool next to an older lady plowing her way through a rather large fish entree.My boyfriend pointed out that one of the bartenders sounded like Robert Downey, Jr.  Agreed.  When he began insisting he looked like it too, I politely asked him to stop drinking.Calamari and Clam Chowder were ordered and subsequently devoured.  Best Clam Chowder in Sacramento?  Perhaps.  We split an embarrasingly large platter of BBQ chicken, ribs and links, and then I took a bite of the BEST THING EVER.  At least here.  And that would be the cornbread.Cornbread everywhere else:  YAWN.  Cornbread at Jamie's:  "^&#* YEAH!"It's buttery.  It's spicy.  It's full of cheese.  It's just perfection.  I ordered an additional side of it and wasn't charged.  Dude!  You're the best, Robert Downey, Jr.!We may have to come back soon, despite our recent bad luck with trying new establishments and being disappointed the second time around (Pine Cove Tavern, Sandra Dee's, etc.).  I'm a gambling woman, though...we'll see what happens.
<review# 1983,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2011,6/28/2011,372,323,7,16,15>First off, I have to say that anyone that knows me, should know that sandwiches are usually the last thing I order for lunch. I'm just not a big fan of sandwiches in particular unless its a cheap, simple Subway or homemade.After having lunch at Baguettes, I have become a sandwich lover all over again!!We had a little trouble finding the location, its sort of tucked away into this little old-fashioned plaza. On one side of the street are houses and the other side is a Liquor store and Sewing Center, Baguettes is in between those two. Parking was kind of weird, beware of the light pillars!!!We were walking in and we noticed how busy it was. About all the bar seats were taken, and the two tables were also occupied. See what I mean by small? Probably seats no more than 16 people at a time. There was also two people in line and others waiting for their food. There was an older (filipino?) lady in the back kitchen chatting with customers and smiling as she brought out more desserts, I'm pretty sure that's Rhodora of Desserts by Rhodora, which shares this small place with the deli. Then there was a younger looking guy (cashier/server) and one girl making all the sandwiches. She looked a bit overwhelmed with all the orders but she still took her time to make each order with delicacy as she intricately placed brie on top of sandwiches and carefully drizzled dressing. It was a nice touch, although you have to remember to plan ahead since the wait might be a while.We got the Curry Chicken Salad and Roasted Turkey Panini (with brie, pesto, tomato, arugula, and walnut dressing). The Roasted Turkey was definitely the star of our lunch. It came out hot and smelling so delicious. I took the first bite without any hesitation... it was the perfect balance of meaty, tender turkey and warm brie. There was a hint of salty and maybe that's what made it even better. The bread was also delicious. The curry chicken was also freakin fantastic. It wasn't as good as the other but still very pleasing. The sourdough baguette was perfect with the chicken. I like that they use loads of arugula to make everything even better.All sandwiches come with a seasonal side of the day. Our's was a light potato salad that complimented our food well. It was a nice big portion too.I really like the interior of the whole deli. Even with the whole "cramped" atmosphere of two businesses sharing one small space, it's very quaint and humble. I liked the floor-to-ceiling windows all around the deli. I suggest that they add some outdoor seating to their already existing patio. It'd be a great addition and people would love to eat outside.I can't wait to come back here for lunch!!! Oh yeah, they're only open Mon-Fri from 10-4pm! So lunch only! I want to eventually be able to say that, I've had every sandwich on their menu.
<review# 1984,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2011,6/27/2011,211,129,8,8,9>This 5 star review is for the  YELP team who came out and walked RAIN OR SHINE! ;) and rain it did....This is my first team event and under bad weather conditions, the Yelp crew still managed to show me a good time! I guess its all in the company you keep =). It was fun mingling with the other yelpers before, during and after the walk.Before the walk: Which took awhile to get started, so during this time we ate and drank! (non alcoholic of course!) They had  burritos, bagels, pastries AND..... wait for it.....CHICK FIL-A NUGGETS! yummm... They had bottles of sodas, Starbucks coffee, Sunny Delight mini bottles, and apple juice! I would have walked the 5 k around this breakfast bar if I could!During the walk: While we got rained on and dodged horses sh*t (It was MADDNESS!) My thighs started to feel the burn, I must be really out of shape. I heard a few cars honking their horns in support of the walk and  the cheerleaders egging us on. Gave me a teeny bit of motivation to keep on keepin' on!After the walk: Where we huddled and got our AWESOME t-shirts! I was wearing my Red Elite Watch and at the end of the walk I didn't see it on my wrist anymore! I had to go back and find it because it's one of a kind and luckily I found it and counted my blessings it wasn't stepped on or was in horses feces.I loved that Alex didn't stop walking when the majority of the crowd did. We followed through and I felt accomplished at the end of it!I'm looking forward to next years walk with the Yelp Team!
<review# 1985,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2011,6/26/2011,523,171,12,10,13>Ahhhh, I was finally a virgin again in my life. Last night I popped my Yelp Elite event cherry.Dressed as a cat from "Cats" (duh I'm a cat lady)... my friend and I arrived to very warm welcomes from all the Yelpers and the staff.Can I just say something about the staff here? They are crazy nice and totally went out of their way to make sure we were happy. Even at one point, seeing we were low on our beer and wines, and came to US to give us new ones!!It was quite hot in there, not sure if it was because of the amount of people or what, but it was for sure toasty!I have had friends eat here, and even reviewed this place on Yelp. They were all sooooo right. The pizza was fantastic!!! Even the usual boring pepperoni pizza was delicious! Everything in the salad bar was uber fresh, and crispy and they had like a gazillion different toppings for your salad too.I am a sucker for hot wings, and these were pretty damn tasty, and they had tons of finger lickin good sauce on them.As a fundraiser for MADD I was quite amused that one of the Yelp trinkets was a keychain bottle opener (don't mind if I add that to my collection of other ones).I loved all the little freebies they had for us. TOTALLY love the fingerless YELP LIFE gloves. I will be wearing these a ton!I was amazed (Scared?), at just how many of the Broadway show tunes I actually knew (considering I think I've seen like 3 actual plays?)After the show tunes, was some top 40 that ya'll were definitely shakin your groove thangs too. It was fun to watch :)I hate that I bought so many raffle tickets, and then was MIA when they actually did the raffle. Oops! FAIL.All in all, a damn good time. Thanks Yelpers!
<review# 1986,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/22/2011,6/25/2011,147,109,9,8,7>Don't judge Pizza & Chicken Love Letter by the empty parking lot and bare dining room.  Don't assume they're closed because all the lights are turned off and there's nothing but a random old Korean guy sitting behind the front desk reading Korean newspapers and watching Korean dramas.  Don't be discouraged that you're quite possibly the only person ordering food from this place today.  Because, despite all this, they make some ridiculous, palate blasting, punch-you-in-the-face spicy fried chicken. Korean fried chicken.  Probably my favorite of all fried chicken out there.  Saucy, spicy, sweet, and the meat is always so incredibly moist while the skin maintains a perfect crispness- even though my tongue is burning, I can't help but take that next bite!  It's so good.  Once it hits your lips, it's so good...The dining area was eerily quiet last Friday, and based on the other reviews, I take it that's pretty common for Love Letter.  The sweet potato pizza is worth passing up, as it just tastes like Pizza Hut with not enough sweet potato to keep me wanting more...  I'll stick with Spicy Fried Chicken for to go, please!
<review# 1987,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2010,6/24/2011,209,356,5,10,9>I came here last weekend for brunch, and yesterday for dinner. I've been here other times, but not as recently. Always had excellent experiences.For brunch I ordered the Harvest Salad, one egg sunny side up, a side of house potatoes, and the bottomless mimosas (of course). The food was excellent, the service was great, and the mimosas were tasty and let's just say they did the trick.For dinner last night I wasn't super hungry so I just grabbed the Harvest Salad (again). Again, the food was delish and the waitress was very sweet. I've had their heavier meals before and never had any complaints about the food at all. They take basic meals and always do something creative and unexpected that ends up being perfect.I will say that I like the atmosphere here better at night, and that the seating is really tight. The menu, which is extremely limited and features almost exclusively meat-based entrees, is constantly updated with new dishes. Never fear vegetarians, ask and ye shall receive meat free fare.
<review# 1988,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2011,6/23/2011,356,378,9,14,13>After reading Newton L's review, I couldn't believe there's a Korean place better than Pine Tree House. And it's around the corner from there? Is that possible?My friend and I made a trip out to Mo Du Rang last Tuesday night to give this place a taste. The lady that greeted us was super nice and told us about their menu and gave us some corn tea and provided us with some chive pancakes to munch on while we were waiting for our food to come out. When I asked her about that complimentary drink when mentioning Yelp, she told me to help myself to a soda in the fridge. Still unfamiliar with the Korean cuisine, I took the easy way out by ordering galbi (BBQ short ribs) and dolsot bibimbap (meat, rice and veggies cooked in a stone pot). According to the menu, you get banchan if you order BBQ, and my, she gave us 11 plates of it. 11! And they were all delicious! The galbi was excellent and great in flavor. The pieces were a little bit fattier than what I'm used to though. The bibimbap was good too. Interesting they incorporated a few buckwheat noodles as one of the toppings. Next time, I'm going to venture out and try the Korean stews and soups, and yes, there is going to be a next time. The lady made us feel very comfortable like we're eating in someone's home. I'll be back!
<review# 1989,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/20/2013,3/30/2013,283,114,13,18,15>A perfect example of excellent food without the modern-day swankiness of urban appeal. Some folks call it Thai and some call it Laotian but since I'm not a professional on either, I call it really good. It's a small family owned joint tucked away in a jaded strip mall on the other side of the drink in West Sacramento. Don't expect to be mesmerized by decor here because it's not much more than dining tables and a fish aquarium in the belly of four walls and a roof and there's not much privacy here even if you wanted some. But don't let this fool you because I thought the caliber of food they provided was amazing and the service was equally impressive.I was here with a few good friends who can throw back just as many groceries as I can so we decided to make this visit easy and ordered everything for to share. We started with the Tom Yam Gung and the spicy broth with kaffir leaves and complex layers melded together perfectly in that spoon, I can vividly remember it well. Next up on our culinary journey was arguably the highlight of the night and an absolute must if you're ever in the same parking lot as this place. The stuffed chicken wings, which have been de-boned and filled barbarically with minced chicken meat & noodles that are married with exotic flavors and served with a sweet chili sauce that was just as addicting as the wings. The combination of both of these left my palette singing Glory, Glory Hallelujah that was more satisfying than a Sunday morning choir. The larb was introduced next and reminded me of a higher quality lettuce cup on steroids and came with our order of Lao sausage. The flavors with the larb were certainly delightful but didn't pop out for me like the wings did and I'm almost certain nothing could've followed in success. Moving down the list, we were given the chili fish next and this was definitely an unexpected and pleasant surprise. A large slab of deliciously prepared and delicate fish smothered in a sweet sauce that's flavored with hints of lemon grass and just the right amount of heat. The lemon grass chicken we ordered didn't really knock my socks off but again, it followed a dish that was extremely more complex and powerful in flavors but it could definitely hold its own. And last but not least, the dish I thought shared the podium with the stuffed chicken wings and this was the banana rolls with honey and ice cream. These were incredibly unbelievable, tasted like greatness and had me questioning whether I should undo the top button of my pants in the restaurant and order another serving.This place doesn't need to be a visual masterpiece to rank among the best of them in my opinion, and sometimes it's those unexpected little guys who pack the biggest punch. We all have our favorite little gems and Vientiane's above-average food and gracious hospitality has done enough for me to now consider them one of my favorites and maybe it will for you as well.
<review# 1990,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/31/2013,3/29/2013,383,246,13,26,19>Yay! I'm definitely a fan of this froyo place!Yippie is a nonprofit foundation that provides 'on-the-job' training, entrepreneurial education & work experience for low-income/foster care youth(ages 16-24). When I googled them and found out this froyo place was for a good cause, of course I had to show them some love! & plus they're walking distances from my house, so I can walk to and from that place & cancel the froyo calories out. *Insert smirk face emoji hereI sampled a few flavors & their froyo is pretty nomworthy(well the yo taste the same as the other shops) & they have the usual toppings--candy, cookies, & fruit.. but no mochi tho :( Hopefully they'll have that next time bc.. they had a rec/comment box & I requested mochi toppings & pistachio flav froyo ^___^ Froyo is $.39 /oz btw.They have a "free topping of the day" right next to the register, fyi ;DI ended up getting half cookiesNcreme & vanilla froyo w/ some unhealthy toppings, it was pretty delish! After finishing our froyos my friend and I browsed the place a bit. They have a book/toy section for kids, which other froyo places don't have. You can even take a toy or book home with you...if you're a kid! They're all about the "pay it forward" concept, you take a toy/book and the next time you come back, you bring a toy/book to give. Nioce.Overall, great place for froyo(they also sell drinks/snacks, too), fun vibrant/happy decor, good service, & free wifi! Whoop Whoop!  Get your froyo on here! & show them some love! :D
<review# 1991,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/5/2013,3/28/2013,642,604,16,19,20>I have always wondered how to call it - Greek food or Grecian food?  Either way, I'm starting to discover a strong interest for this alternative to the other more commonly available ethnic restaurants that are out in our environment.  This cozy little Inn features authentic Greek cuisine with a menu that offers recipes for every palette.   The dining room is not set up for an intimate or romantic experience, but they do cook up some elegant food and attentive service, even during their busy hours. We purchased a nice little Groupon deal for two.  So we couldn't wait to try this restaurant out.  Even though we arrived for what we thought would be an early dinner, the place was filled with patrons already!  Fortunately a small table was open just for us!   Our server was a little overwhelmed and it looked like she was responsible for many tables.  But she managed to give us a friendly smile and courteous service even through the time consuming questions my boyfriend kept asking about the menu.   He finally decided on Arne Me Garides which is lamb shanks with Orzo and Mizithra cheese.  I ordered the Garides Mi Skordo which is 4 prawns sautéed in extra virgin olive oil and fresh garlic, placed on a bed of cooked spinach, with a generous scoop of rice set in the center.   Our meal began with a bowl of white bean and tomato soup, with a side of pita bread.  Then the main courses arrived looking and smelling delicious!  My boyfriend enjoyed his food immensely.  My food was good also, but I wasn't expecting such an abundance of olive oil in this dish.  Still, the combination of seasonings brought about some flavorful shrimps.  The spinach was also a bit too oiled up for me to finish.  However, the rice was tasty and helped me to recover from eating too much of said olive oil.  We ended our dinner by splitting some Baklava.  The flavor of this dessert wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  It had the sweetness of honey, but I think it had a strong flavor of cloves mixed in.  A different kind of taste that I'm not used to eating in Baklava, but acceptable. I could tell that the owners and staff of this restaurant show pride in their establishment by working hard to keep patrons happy.  With a positive atmosphere like that along with their authentic Greek food, you can be sure my interest is still peaked to explore more of those Grecian recipes they have brewing in the kitchen.
<review# 1992,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2013,3/27/2013,182,352,8,18,11>I'm a runner, but have recently grown bored of the treadmill (I'm too afraid to run outside due to those frequent runner-rape stories). After seeing a spinning class segment on Vanderpump Rules (I'm a Bravo/reality TV fanatic; judge away), I searched for spinning classes in the area. TEAMride seemed to be the only of its kind in Sacramento (other spinning classes are hosted in gyms that require memberships). I was skeptical of their lack of Yelp presence, but later learned they've been open for less than two months. $18 for a 45-minute class, why not? I paid online and reserved a bike in a 9 a.m. Wednesday class (you get to reserve a specific numbered bike on a map on their website).The interior is small, clean, and modern - basically consisting of a front desk, cubbies/bench, a room full of bikes, water dispenser, and a bathroom. The girls I met were friendly and welcoming, quickly reassuring me that I would make it through my first spinning class (ever). They showed me where to put my stuff, helped adjust my bike, and instructed how to clip in my rented shoes (free rental for your first class, $1 thereafter).The lights are dimmed during class, so don't worry about your excessive sweat or how ugly/ridiculous you look. "Push ups," "sit ups," and a 2-lb weight sequence are all incorporated into the routine (don't be fooled by the unintimidating 2-lbs; I was sore after). Loud music plays as the instructor guides you through.I already booked my next class (& very glad for the excuse to buy new workout clothes!).
<review# 1993,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2012,3/26/2013,209,356,13,17,11>Now that I've been here for brunch, happy hour, and a Saturday night, I finally feel qualified to review.Brunch - holy balls, guys. I've been noticing a pattern in which their food kicks ass all the time, but their breakfast was better than most places in Midtown. I got the basic breakfast (two sunny side up eggs, house potatoes, english muffin, and sausage). Boyfriend got some kind of omelet with peppers and tomatoes in it. Everything was good, but the potatoes really shined. They use some kind of mustard seasoning and the spuds were done perfectly. Big chunky pieces of onion complemented the taters awesomely. Their sausage was good in flavor, but has a weird ground patty texture that I wasn't crazy about. I'm sure it's because they make their sausage there, but it was a little weird. Pretty sure all breakfast items were under $10. Plus, they do brunch from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm on Sunday so hungover hot messes like me can make it out.Also, I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say they have the best Bloody Mary in town.Happy Hour - totally fun.Met up with a few friends for beers on the patio. Shared some sweet potato fries (omg so good gimme moar) and shot the shit. Saturday Night - I loved it, even though I didn't want to.I'm a big ol' grump when it comes to Second Saturday. Generally I hide in my house and hate everyone. A friend of a friend had an art show at Elixir this last weekend so I figured, hey - maybe it's far enough away from the main Second Saturday craziness that it won't be that bad. You know what? It was not only not that bad, it was totally rad. The beers are cheap. The drinks are stiff. The patrons seem to be either friendly or into minding their own business. The bartenders are totally nice. It's not creepily quiet, but not so loud that you have to scream to order a drink. We kept ordering snacks like sweet potato fries and gyoza. This is a great bar, and I will be back at all odd hours of the day, for all kinds of reasons.
<review# 1994,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/10/2012,3/25/2013,319,199,6,12,11>Pizza Rock has pretty much every imaginable style of pizza on the menu and from my experience, they are all excellent. If I had to suggest a favorite, it would most definitely be the Sicilian Gas Brick Oven "BURRATINA DI MARGHERITA".  Described on the menu as being topped with Burrata, Cherry Tomatoes tossed with basil, EVOO, Balsamic Reduction. If you haven't tried buratta cheese, I highly recommend you give this particular pizza a try. The only warning I have is that it's HUGE. As in, you should plan to share with 4+ people. One other thing, I can't really imagine eating a great pizza without having access to beer. Luckily, they have a good selection of draft beer (both domestic and a few italian varieties) to wash down all that delicious pizza.
<review# 1995,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/17/2013,3/24/2013,146,55,9,13,8>Florez Bar and Grill, where have you been all my life while in Sacramento?!?!? Tucked away in a lovely residential neighborhood just south of Land Park, and furthermore, tucked away in the corner of the outdated shopping plaza it rests in, this place is well worth the seek and find!We were invited for brunch by some sweet friends of ours, who had only eaten here once before. Our friend had heard of this place several years ago, from co-workers at downtown's EDD who raved about this place and frequented here during their lunch hour (seems like quite the drive on a lunch break, but yes, it's worth it). Since it was the late morning, I already had visions of huevos rancheros in my mind...yummmmmmmm. When we arrived, we were immediately seated and I began to scan the room. Almost every table was occupied, with a wide variety of patrons from young to old. Our friends gave us a head's up there is a Mariachi every Sunday, which I looked forward to. At our time of entrance, they were just coming back from their break. While we waited for our drinks, and while munching on some chips and lovely salsa rojo and verde, the mariachi approached us. Our friends requested Sin Ti (Without You), their song, and the mariachi of 3 sang the ballad perfectly while our friends got up in the middle of the restaurant and danced the song away as if it were 20 years ago....*love sigh*With the perfect atmosphere already set, I was ready to order and get down on some grub! I took notice of a different kind of "huevos rancheros" - Rancheros Verdes: corn tortilla, carnitas, 2 eggs, layered and topped with tomatillo, rajas and Cotija. It was served with black beans and a garlic rice....PERFECTO!!!!!!I took one bite and MADE everyone sample my plate as I bragged about ordering the best item on the menu. For a happy tomatillo/Carnitas lover like me (also a huge fan of Chile Verde), I was in Desayuno heaven.One of our friends ordered the Chile Colorado after being offered a sample from a patron he sat next to at the bar. Who does that? It's been quite some time since I've been to a restaurant where a complete stranger offers to let you sample his plate...oh wait, I don't think that has EVER happened to me...a sign of the times. But seriously, that was pretty awesome and goes to show the true neighborhood vibe this restaurant gives. We WILL be returning back. I look forward to trying other plates. If my Rancheros Verdes plate was that good, I'm sure many other things on the menu are just as tasty!!!!
<review# 1996,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/7/2013,3/23/2013,1214,515,9,14,12>SUGAR CANE. As a kid, I'd watch those C&H Sugar TV commercials showing cute ?Hawaiian? youngsters chewing on island sugar cane while the Hawaiian-themed jingle played in the background. My mouth has been watering for that fresh cane juice ever since, and finally I've found a place that serves it!Unlike Irving Street Cafe in the Sunset (another purveyor of fresh-pressed cane juice), at Nuoc Mia Ninh Kieu you'll find sugar cane juice blended with other fresh juices. These mash-ups include fresh-cut pineapple, kumquats, and limes (for those who enjoy the truly exotic, durian is an option too, though I'm not certain if it's fresh). Since the cane juice is so potently sweet and viscous, these sour-tart additions transform a too-syrupy drink into an exciting and delicious flavor frenzy.Vi ("Vee") is a delightul young woman who enjoys squeezing a frothy drink and putting smiles on her customers' mugs. For the first-timers, she'll take the time to explain the day's offerings and to give suggestions. Once your order has been placed, she'll press each drink to order, so the juice is as fresh as can be.I brought some home; my sweetie swiftly swooned when she tasted the juice, saying it reminded her of growing up in Brazil and tasting sugar cane as a kid.Next time I'll try adding club soda and lime juice to make a world-class limeade (there's enough cane juice in the large size to make two). And I can't wait for this summer - I'll order two large juices and take 'em home as a base drink for a frosty pitcher of poolside Mojitos - or Caipirinhas for my g/f!
<review# 1997,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2013,3/21/2013,61,131,8,11,9>I'm torn between a 4 and 5 star review, because I think the prices are high even considering the delicious food and fantastic service. I'm going to err on the side of generosity despite my small plate sized main course (scallops) and some stealthy duck confit. My birthday party of four chose Mulvaney's based on their great reputation. We ordered a few cocktails and beers, all of which were tasty, and then got down to business. We started with the smoked salmon and brown bread, the sweetbreads and a salad. The salad was beautiful and tasty, but I forget what it was called. The smoked salmon was tasty and came with bread, capers, chopped egg and some other goodies. Speaking of which, the bread on the table was served with butter and sea salt and was delicious. The sweetbreads were very tasty and were served over a parsnip puree (I think) with microgreens. I would order them again. For mains we chose lamb chops which were served over eggplant caviar and mint cream. They were cooked perfectly and the flavors were great together. Another friend had clam and sausage pasta which was excellent. My lady had the duck confit pasta which she really enjoyed but I saw exactly 0 duck confit in. It's possible that I missed it, and she liked it, so whatevs. I had the scallops which were big, seared perfectly and served over a tiny smear of another puree (tulip? unicorn? cocaine? whatever it was, there wasn't much of it). The dish was tasty but was noticeably smaller than sweetbread starter and was about $35, so I was a little bummed there. Over all we enjoyed our food very much, and I appreciate that the food is sourced locally, sustainably, etc., but I wouldn't have minded a little more of it. With a bill that started with a prime number and ended in two more numbers I would have liked to have left full. All that said: the service was stellar, never an empty glass or dirty tablecloth. Our waiter was very somber which I enjoyed, it fit the theme. He warmed up to us after we ordered a bunch of drinks, I think. Cliff's Notes: Great service, excellent food, smallish portions. I will go again.
<review# 1998,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/28/2012,3/20/2013,432,335,12,18,16>Gasp.  They were completely sold out of the Chenin Blanc, so I reluctantly chose a different white wine - the Albarino.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Floral notes w/green melon and stone fruits is how it was described.  I grew to enjoy it after a few sips (no swish).We ordered the Bruschetta w/triple cream Brie, strawberries, stone fruit, and honey.  Creamy, slightly sweet, crunchy, delicious dessert snack.BLT heirloom sandwich:  Plump and sweet heirloom tomatoes, butter lettuce, pepper bacon, purple potato salad w/ chives.  Loved and savored every single bite.It was a balmy summer's eve so...my only gripe was the flies. Like, a lot of flies buzzing around, especially if you were seated by the doors or windows.  The ladies next to us were swatting, we were swatting, we must've looked like we were cat fighting or something.
<review# 1999,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2010,11/26/2010,201,374,4,8,7>Went here last night after very thoroughly examining the reviews. I can't stand this part of town, but I quashed my reluctance to attend a restaurant on Fulton Avenue due to Maalouf's. Thank's Maalouf's.Anyhow.We were going to get the Pepper Fin appetizer, because we always get that everywhere, but not this time. We got the 'Awesome', which is seared tuna with radish, jalapenos, and, um...awesomeness. I don't think I can really explain how amazing the tuna was, so I'll just say it was amazing. Totally fresh fish. Not stringy with fish-tendons or fatty or tough. It wasn't even too cold. It was tender and flavorful in a torturously subtle way. Damnit. I want one right now.We also ordered the Orange Blossom, because of all the reviews about it here, just to see. I'll tell you: it didn't disappoint by any means. The sauce the rolls were sitting in was fantastic and there wasn't too much of it. The salmon on the outside was a nifty idea.We also got the 'Krazy Kim' roll that came with ponzu sauce and it was super good. My mom got the Danny roll (or maybe it was Daniel. I'm casual-izing it) and it was really tasty and spicy without being overly spicy.  We also ordered the Philly roll, but I didn't take a picture of it, because it wasn't fancy. It was just awesome. Without being fancy.Conclusion? I'm going back as soon as I can justify the drive. And as most other reviews will tell you...don't pay attention to the area or the location in a mini-strip mall. Or the marquee. It's all very questionable, but the food is definitely not. Make the trip. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
<review# 2000,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/14/2010,11/25/2010,119,183,4,16,13>I came to this store after reading great reviews from Paul J. and Charlie C.  I am always on the hunt for great little boutiques and did not feel disappointed when I stumbled on into this fine establishment.Immediately, I was greeted by a very friendly store associate named Sierra.  I told her it was my first time at the store and she gave me a brief synopsis on what they carry and the type of store they are.  Very helpful...I knew exactly what to expect.  The store can best be described as underground...one of a kind clothing pieces, you will not see at other stores...hip, but not trendy...fun and unique.  The prices are somewhat reasonable (the price is not quite as high as other boutiques, but still more expensive than department stores)...if you luck out on a sale item, it is very well priced : )  I lucked out on a fantastic dress for the summer which was on sale...yippee!You can definitely find me back at this store, again : )Thank you gents with great fashion sense : )
<review# 2001,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2010,11/24/2010,95,282,7,15,15>A great selection of vinyl and CDs as well as a handful of small gift items like buttons, shirts, stickers.  If you're looking for a guitar shaped spatula, they have that too.When we stopped in this afternoon, the owners were telling my friends and I about their mix-tape swap.  Burn a mix CD, bring it in, and get a mix CD that another customer brought in.  Love this idea!
<review# 2002,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/7/2010,11/23/2010,648,305,5,8,8>When I walk out of here I feel fabulous. Not fat. The desserts are that good. Today, we ventured in after lunch, and decided to have the Lemon Blueberry White Chocolate Moose Tart...(I know!?!)  It was actually the server's recommendation- who was remarkably charming and sang along happily to whatever was playing in the background. I was lovin' the 50's decor- and of course, the infamous comfy window booth we snagged- (people watching!) The espresso here is good and strong- a perfect match with that sweet hunk of bliss. OH! Did I mention that... all pastries and goodies are made ON SITE?! Prices aren't too shabby per whole cakes for parties or whatnot either. This will pretty much always be one of those "lets do something sweet but naughty today" places!
<review# 2003,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2010,11/22/2010,244,170,6,10,8>Let me first say that if you're claustrophobic, this isn't the place for you. They have crammed as much hair stuff in this shop as humanly possible. I think it actually borders on being a fire hazard, as 99% of everything in there is flammable. Once you get past that, you realize you may never need to go anyplace else for hair products. They seem to have the full line of the Elasta QP, ORS, Motions, and lots of other brands geared toward "ethnic" hair needs. If you want some weave, they've got you covered. Braids, kinky twists? They have what you're looking for. They're prices are pretty comparable to every place else, but I'm willing to pay a little more if i can get all of the products i need/want in one place instead of going to Sally's, Rite Aid, and a BSS to get hair. I'd like it if they carried some natural hair lines, so hopefully, they'll get on board with that. The staff is friendly and pretty knowledgeable.
<review# 2004,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2010,11/21/2010,512,236,7,16,15>Vanessa you have done an awesome job!This store is like my dream closet. I would seriously buy everything in here in a heart beat! My new favorite pair of owl earrings as well as my new wallet.This is a charming little spot on Capital but do not let the small space fool you. It is banging inside. The prices are not expensive boutique prices. They are low and affordable. Perfect for the normal Sacramento girls since we're all broke now a days!She also has wonderful accessories and my new favorite, Vegan handbags, which are also priced very low. I can't wait to get my hands on one of those gems.This place will go far, I'm super envious and wish I had an adorable place like that! But my envy will only bring me back countless times to support an awesome stylish gal!
<review# 2005,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2010,11/19/2010,451,183,2,8,6>What an awe-some place!! I love the fact that the entrees were served on school lunch trays! I came here with high- hopes that the curse of this space and the previous restaurants would finally be lifted! I am positive it will.     The food was so good! I ordered the chicken tikka masala for my dinner and the chicken momos (Indian potstickers) for an app. They brought me the app first along with three condiments  (tamarind syrup, mint puree, and mango chutney) aside from the dipping sauce provided for the momos (which was a smokey tomato like sauce). The momos were tasty and the dumpling was cooked perfectly.     The tikka masala was excellant!!  I know it was my first time trying it, but it came with pita bread, tzaziki sauce, golden lentils, curried potatoes and cauliflower (called alooe ghobi), and basmati rice, all in the little tray compartments. The flavors were plentiful, vibrant and perfect. Lots of flavor but not over the top. So delicious!We sat at the bar and had a bottle of wine too, which was light and refreshing.I liked the service, up until the bartender waiting on us gave us our bill. My friend put cash in the fold and got up to use the bathroom. The bartender asked if he wanted change and I told her to just assume so. But she left the money there, and asked him again when he came back from the bathroom. How rude!! To the servers out there, if someone gives you cash, just assume they need change. If I get asked that, believe I will dock a percentage off the tip.I really want to try the dessert here. It had a strong mid-eastern influence and sounded interesting. Despite the whole change thing, I love this place! I can't wait to come back.
<review# 2006,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2010,11/18/2010,451,541,,15,10>This place is pretty awesome; i didn't know what to expect coming here. The grounds is decorated with awesome lighting and decor that's suited for the performance/show. The volunteers/actors are really awesome and play their part. (I will not discuss the show beyond that so i won't spoil anything for anyone).  The mansion itself is pretty awesome and hugely decorated for everything; i was in awe in how much was decorated (setup). If you are looking for a great time and cooL performance (and for a great cause); i would definitely recommend this place for anyone. Pros: Awesome show, great cause, FREE, entertainingCons: Space (sorta)Stars: 5 flat easy.
<review# 2007,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2010,11/17/2010,356,378,8,9,7>I'm finally writing a review of Naked Lounge because the black bottom muffin I had yesterday was just awesomely delicious. Maybe I should be giving props to Bella Bru for making them, but thank you Naked Lounge for selling them! I'm a regular soy Cafe Au Lait drinker when I go to Naked Lounge. They serve it in the pint glass, which seems endless to finish, since they're served freakin' hot! But they are consistently great. I sat in one of the chairs yesterday morning to do some leisure reading, and Roman is right: the seats smother you so you can't leave. But with all that caffeine in my system, I was able to bounce up after I finished the pint to take care of some major business at the farmer's market.

<review# 2009,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2010,4/30/2010,74,176,4,6,5>I really thought I had reviewed this place the first time I went there, but I evidently did not.  I DO NOT GIVE OUT 5s that often, but this place deserves it.  This little joint in midtown is awesome if you're into the BBQ scene.  And I think it's damn cheap.  For less than $9 you can get a BBQ Tri Tip Sandwich which comes with fries and a side.  The sandwich is a good size too.  Not bad in my book.I remember the mac n cheese being bomb-friggin-diggity, but the last time I was there they were out, which made me cry a little inside.They have a nice spicy BBQ sauce that they use which is awesome.  The meat on the sandwiches is nice and tender and they are not skimpy on the amount of meat, which is a nice surprise.  The restaurant is kind of small, but it's cozy.One of the best parts of this place is the service.  Everyone is always super nice and helpful.  You order at the register, but they bring you the food and check up on you often.I am quite impressed, and I totally plan to go back.
<review# 2010,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2009,4/29/2010,53,209,,10,8>One of my favorite quotes on food matters comes from Anthony Bourdain.  I believe it was at a Commonwealth Club presentation, and a question came from the audience, essentially asking him why he has so famously given vegetarians a hard time.  His answer: "If you're gonna call yourself a vegetarian, you should at least know how to cook a vegetable."  The crowd instantly erupted in laughter and applause, because they knew what many people know: vegetarian cooking in America generally sucks.    Yeah, there are revered places like Ubuntu and Greens, but in general, vegetarian cuisine in the USA is an oxymoron.  American vegetarian fare veers heavily toward the embodiment of New World puritanism and asceticism, a lifestyle rather than a cuisine, built around the idea of emphasizing what you CANNOT eat.  Vegetarians here seem to revel in the mere fact that they are not eating meat.  Whatever overcooked, half-assed food you lay on the plate, if it is meat-free, it fits the bill, so it must be good by definition.  Western meals are hijacked by the veg ethos by substituting meat with non-meat soy-based alimentary pastes and other such manufactured gruel, giving us such abominations as soy dogs and Boca Burgers.  Does anyone authentically enjoy this sort of thing?  What the heck does this have to do with an Indian restaurant?  Udupi is a vegetarian restaurant to be sure, but one emanating from a culture with a centuries-old tradition of vegetarianism, a true cuisine if ever there was one.  The stark contrast is striking to say the least.  In this setting, vegetarian food is not about what you can't eat, but all about all the beautiful things that can be done with everything one CAN eat.  The absence of meat is hardly seen as a roadblock or deficit (unlike American vegetarianism, where a meat substitute must be sought to make the food accessible and resonant with its perpetrators' cultural heritage).  In short, plant-based ingredients are celebrated for their beauty and vitality, and revered in their preparation.    The lunch buffet at Udupi, on its surface, looks like most any other Indian buffet line: steam trays, rice, stacks of plates, etc.  Once one begins to explore, however, differences become evident immediately.  Rather than offer one or two breads, Udupi gives you idli, paratha, pappad, and a magnificent crepe-like dosa brought right to your table.  Potatoes, beans, and lentils are of course prominently featured, and brightly spiced and seasoned.  At no point do the dishes feel greasy or heavy, as can often be the case at many Indian buffets where dense cream or butter-based dishes are offered, apparently to appease our fat-loving palates.  This may be a vegetarian joint, but make no mistake, it is deceptively easy to over-indulge.  Those baseball-sized samosas, for example, fried but greaseless, redolent of cinnamon and begging for anointment with one of Udupi's savory chutneys, have that bet-you-can't-eat-just-one vibe in spades.  An assortment of desserts threaten to finish you off just when you think you'll make it out without pigging out; my favorite were the laddu, which look like donut holes made by the cast of Yo Gabba Gabba and have a fried savory-sweet quality that will have you stuffing them in your pockets for later.    Thus, in one hole-in-the-wall restaurant in an inconspicuous suburban strip mall, Ududpi simultaneously gives us justification for the existence of vegetarian cuisine within U.S. borders and one of the better Indian dining experiences in the 916, for less that 10 bucks!  Definitely worth many a return trip...come hungry.
<review# 2011,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2009,4/28/2010,40,61,2,6,3>How can you not be a fan of Fanny Ann's? Seriously...?  Just based on the ridiculously unique decor in this five leveled (or is it six) saloon alone you'd have to give it three stars...kitch on steroids barely begins to describe it.Add $2 Long Island Ice Teas - which have not been on my menu for quite some years - and $8 pitchers - which are most certainly on my menu...and you're up another star.  Bonus for tonight (Th), we did karaoke there for a homegirl's b-day, and it was most definitey rockin' out.I should also take this moment to thank Sir-Mix-A-Lot and Humpty Hump from Digital Underground for the assist in my karaoke experience tonight - good workin' with you fellas.If you're in Old Sac, go to Fanny Ann's - there's plenty of space to enjoy yourself, so go for it
<review# 2012,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2010,4/26/2010,187,255,4,8,6>What better way to come out of my Yelping drought than to write a 5 star review?! Needed to find an amazing new esthetician to do my eyebrows since I've moved from the bay area back to the Sacramento area. :) Saw all the amazing reviews of Jenneane and called and left a message one weekend afternoon.  On her voice mail she said that she would be unavailable until that Monday but please leave a message and she would get back to you as soon as possible.  Now, I'm a bit of pessimist when I hear things like that because I have been burned by certain business people before.  Sure enough, Monday, even though I missed her call, she left a voice mail!  Played some phone/voicemail tag and finally set up an appointment of Saturday the 10th.  :) Jenneane is amazing!  Her place is super cute, she had fun, upbeat music going; a cool change from the sleepy, slow (although I like it at spas!), spa music going. She was so helpful, and a total sweetheart.  Since I was new, she handed me a mirror while she talked to me and was like how do you normally like your eyebrows done, etc.  She was efficient and her quality of work is 5 stars! :) Needless to say, I booked another appointment with her and so happy to say I found my new eyebrow guru in Sacramento! :)
<review# 2013,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2010,4/25/2010,511,116,4,20,6>Being a Nikon fan, this has always been one of my favorite local camera shops.  There's plenty of Canon equipment too though, but they've always been known to specialize in Nikon equipment.  Also a perfect store for photography students that need film and photo paper.  They also offer a wide variety of tri-pods, camera bags/cases, flash diffusers, lights, and other universal accessories.  Always great customer service; the whole staff is very knowledgeable and they don't try to belittle your camera knowledge.  They'll even clean out your camera for free.  The older guy (I'm guessing the owner/manager) can be pretty firm at times, but he always ends up softening up and being nice.  He even threw in free stuff like batteries one time when I bought one of my flashes.The only down side is they still can't compete with online prices which is why I gave it 4 stars.  They can't price match neither otherwise they would be making close to nothing on their sales.  I still try to support the local shops as much as I can though; my next visit is to have one of my older Nikkor lenses repaired.There's no online replacement for being able to walk into a store and play with the display camera in your hands and test out lenses and other peripherals; support Action Camera!

<review# 2016,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2010,4/22/2010,702,960,6,12,10>I was excited to get out of the house and see a movie! Seriously! I haven't seen a movie for my own viewing pleasure for...two years. I was double excited to try out the Palladio Cinemas in Folsom. It is in a soon-to-be upscale shopping area right off of Iron Point Road from the E. Bidwell turnoff. I didn't see anything else open except the movies, but can't wait to see what the rest of this space will look like once it does open. I'm hoping for an H&M, but that's probably too much to ask.Annnnnyway, getting the tix was a cinch, but the tickets do not have printed on there what theater you need to go to, so be sure to listen up when the guy points you down the hall. I was zoning when he said this so I had to walk alllll the way back again. I saw Avatar (good movie, BTW) and was immediately taken aback by the lack of ventilation in the theater, hence I knocked off a star. I even took a break mid-movie and opened the door. Luckily no one was having a sneezing fit or else I really would have been displeased. I could just envision all these micro spheres of germs floating in the air...The screen wasn't huge, but it was fine for me. And it wasn't too loud either, which is another one of my pet peeves. I don't want to be deaf by the time I reach 90! I like the fact that the place has solar power because Folsom gets reallllly hot in the summer. Nice to know that a hot sun can help support a cool movie theater. Parking is easy, there is a multi-story parking garage a short walking distance away. The snack area looked pretty typical, nothing to write home about. I always avoid the concession stand because I complain about people munching away at their silly popcorn during a crucial scene in a movie and I wouldn't want to be a hypocrite.
<review# 2017,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2009,4/21/2010,826,495,3,3,6>My children are currently 6 and 3 and Fairytale Town is perfect for them. I'm sure in a few years they will think its uncool and just for little kids, but for now its great. With lots of themed play areas, slides, things to climb, animals and places to just run, Fairytale Town does a perfect job of entertaining and wearing out your children.As a parent I appreciate the fact that adults must be accompanying children or they aren't allowed to enter the park. This provides a sense of security and removes that sense of alarm you sometimes feel when a random person starts walking near your children at the park or other locations. I also appreciate the fact that they allow you to bring your own picnic lunch and even if you don't the prices at the snack bar are reasonable and nothing like what a lot of places charge for snacks or drinks.Admission to FairyTale town is reasonable; $4/person weekdays and $4.50/person on weekends but with a family of four thats still $16 - 18 each time we go, so purchasing a yearly membership for $55 was a no-brainer after seeing how much my kids enjoyed themselves the first time - and you can apply your daily admission fees to the yearly membership so you don't lose anything. Just since June, my kids have probably visited 6 or 7 times and they will no doubt go back next time they and my wife are in town.All in all, if you have little ones, FairyTale Town is a great place to be.
<review# 2018,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2009,4/20/2010,83,142,5,10,7>One of the best Pho restaurant out here, comparable to the ones on stockton, food wise that is. The place is pretty small, but it was elegant. I tried to items from the menu the ones I always get from any viet pho place. bun tom thit nuong: it was nice, the meat was cooked perfectly, the shrimp were pretty big, not small like the places give you, the noodles was authentic and everything was just good. They put all the veggies too the side which was nice because I always just take them back out, BUT it could of used more peanuts in itbun bo hue(i think): The meat was tender, and there was a good portion of it, the noodles were good, came out really really hot so that was nice, the broth was delicious. Both were really good seeing how I order both at the same time, so I couldn't enjoy both of them as much as I could. I will be back for seconds, maybe to try the hamburger or taco or something.It is DIRECTLY behind BJs, I drove around looking for it everywhere I didn't think It was in the same plaza as the Hotel which really confused me, and it was hidden too or maybe I was just driving. But give it a try.One of the best customer service I ever gotten too, maybe it was just wasn't busy or something but we will see next time haha.

I love the food, decor, music, cute waiters, you name it.  My favorite dish is the #11 Ligabue--pizza style.  It comes with Pesto, Pine nuts, 2 kinds of cheeses and I add Prosciutto.  The pesto is so damn delicious that I want to dollop a spoonful on my morning eggs, season my chicken with it, and smear it all over my husband's rock hard abs (uh, did I really just write that? What a slut).  Anyway, my point is that I'm sold on the pesto.   The gelato is also scrumptious and worth mentioning! The last time I went I had the basic vanilla and it was very vanilla beany, which is a good thing in my book! I'm going to be a bit more adventurous next time and try the Ferrero Rocher or Tiramisu flavor.The service has been hit or miss, but it's worth taking the chance since this is such a cool place to eat.  Oh, and they have a nice patio area too!

Then we proceed to go into a food coma...a very complicated relationship.Nonetheless their food was deserving of a whirlwind culinary romance. Yes, vegetarians and chicken sandwich connoisseurs alike, you should have ordered the burger! I don't care if you don't eat red meat, do it...or don't complain about what you ordered. End Rant. That's what this place is all about....BIG...JUICY... BURGERS!Oh yeah, and the milkshakes...how can I forget about them, friggin' genius! More about that later.......Tonight, on a night where the stars were aligned, Tara W, my vegetarian roommate suggested we go outside the grid and venture on over to Gatsby's. God bless her. Overall, I was really impressed by the layout...almost like a Benihana's in the style of cooking, 2 grills in the center of the restaurant. An upscale diner if you will. Checkered tile flooring...oh you really cares about the interior, on to the food!I ordered the standard Gatsby Burger, no red onion, substituted for caramelized onions, fries [although the salads looked worth it] and the special milkshake of the day....drum roll, please. A fucking banana foster milkshake. Good gravy that's good!!!! No...GREAT. Probably the best milkshake I've ever had. The creamy, not too sweet treat that made me believe, yes, you CAN have second dessert if this is served first.Unfortunately, the server Steve got slammed immediately after we ordered our food, so we didn't see him much after that (1 star off....sorry but I'm needy and want my food under 30 minutes, and yes, water would be nice). But Steve, your personality rocked!!!So...when we finally received our food, I was extremely happy to bite into a deliciously prepared burger...so juicy, paired with this sauce that was wonderful. I swear horseradish is in it!!! Fries...a throw away in my opinion -- crispy, too crispy...but MMMMM....well done Gatsby's...you made me the proud mother of a food baby.

Yes that Phil Collins song was the "theme music"   for this night.  Tonight was my night to finally try green curry. I couldn't back out on my besties.  They set up a UYE for me so I couldn't back out.    Thanks to Rachel Z for hosting it and Tara W, Cinamon,  and Angelo for coming out. I drove up to the place -bike parking out front ...(Cue Pointer Sisters song "I'm so excited")   I walked into the restaurant and it was very nice. I was greeted by the staff and immediately sat next to the crew. We ordered about five dishes but the star of course was the green curry. I will honestly say I actually loved every dish I tried!  The green curry chicken was really good!  I even tried the yellow curry and that was really good also. The service was excellent.  I will definitely go back for more green curry chicken very soon. Overall I really like the place and the service.  I didn't give it five stars because it was my first time here but I will return and update.  Will Thai Palace make it on the list???  Stay tuned....

I won't try and persuade you to try any one thing (although the chicken chow mein is bar none the best in Sac I've had) I will say go with some hungry friends and order everything. Trust me you will not be disappointed...and if you somehow are, don't worry I live around the corner you can drop off the leftovers.
<review# 2024,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2010,10/21/2010,168,456,4,23,18>Wow!  Just got through trying their lunch buffet - what a great value!  You generally don't expect much from a pizza place's salad bar, but there were two kinds of lettuce plus spinach and all kind of fresh veggies.  If you want a light salad dressing, you'll have to ask for some balsamic from the kitchen.My glass stayed full (they even went next door to borrow some splenda for my tea), and the custom pizzas for the buffet came out pretty quickly.  Definitely try the BBQ Chicken pizza - yum, yum, good.  Meat pizzas were teeming with meat and the Hawaiian was tropical.   Check it out!
<review# 2025,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/20/2009,10/20/2010,97,108,4,4,4>I LOVE this place!! I should start by saying that I don't enjoy ramen. I pretend to enjoy ramen because I'm Asian and I feel like I should but I don't. I never drink the soup. I don't use chopsticks. I just don't care for it. But on a cold day, the boyfriend took me here to eat and let me just start by saying that it is a SMALL space. It was fairly busy and we were seated at this tiny table next to this other couple. Basically it felt like I was on a double date. I could hear every word of what they were saying and I had to actively remind myself that it's creepy and socially unacceptable to listen to other people's private conversations and want to interject. But the ramen was awesome. I had the noodles in the soy milk based soup and it was perfect for me. The broth was smooth and slightly sweet. When I mean soy milk, I don't mean that stuff you buy in the market. I mean like true style asian soy milk strained from soy beans. My grandparents used to make it fresh in the mornings when I was a kid and this is what it reminded me of. Apparently they get their supplies fresh every day from a local tofu place. It sounded weird but it was delicious and it came with a side of sesame oil for you to add at the end to flavor the soup a little more. I drank SO much of that soup. It was heavenly. And I also normally hate the bamboo they put inside ramen. I think it's too hard, sometimes overcooked, sometimes too chewy and mostly just flavorless. But I LOVE their bamboo so much that I ask for a side every time and the last time I was there, my side didn't come until a lot later and I had to stop eating to wait for it so that I could have the perfect flavors in my mouth all at once. The service is a little slow because it's basically like a one man show and again, there is not a lot of room but the flavors are amazing and the price is SO fair. The boyfriend and I usually walk out of there too full to talk for under $20.
<review# 2026,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/27/2010,10/19/2010,194,575,1,7,8>I recommended this place to my parents, based on Yelp reviews, 3 weeks ago. They have already been back 3 times, and this weekend, they finally took me with them! The Sac Bee review gave Evan's 1 star for ambiance. I disagree; I feel that the informal, comforting ambiance fits in well with the location on Antique Row as well as the food served here, which falls solidly in the category of "comfort food". I liked the wooden tables, the fresh flowers, the calming pastoral landscapes that adorn the walls (painted by local artists).Now for the food. The Lamb Lollipop appetizer was gorgeous, the crusted prawns sat in a delicious sauce, and the smoked salmon was unlike any I've had anywhere else.The clam chowder was a far cry from the pasty, thick, white stuff you often get - a chunky, vibrant treat. My main dish was a steak with a mushroom sauce - perfectly cooked as I'd ordered it. It came with sour cream mashed potatoes (I don't even like mashed potatoes, yet these were incredible) and addictive green beans. That's right. I don't know what herbs or spices they put in those, but these veggies were like manna. I hate to find fault with anything here, but the desserts weren't my favorite. I tried some of the apple crisp, carrot cake, and molten chocolate cake, and can't bring myself to recommend getting dessert here, but the friendliness of the server, Rick, more than made up for any short-comings. I can't recommend Evan's Kitchen enough. Go there. Eat there. Love there. End of story.

Just when I was getting really nervous the anesthesiologist showed up, stuck something into my IV, and the next thing I remember I was in postop.  Again, really sweet nurses who patiently answered my questions over and over again (according to my husband.  I don't remember this part...those drugs are strong stuff).  If you need to have surgery, this isn't a bad place to do it.
<review# 2029,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/11/2006,4/12/2007,174,576,,4,2>Ahh, a staple of my youth.  A talk thread about Chinese people making Mexican food prompted me to remember where I spent a good portion of my youth, consuming unnecessary calories while ditching out on swim practice.  This place is own by Asians but run by Mexicans, and while their food and atmosphere isn't going to rocket them to the "Best of Sacramento" list anytime soon, its DAMN GOOD.  Not perfect, but its hard to find anything blatantly not good here.  The salsas are all tasty, although they are a little stingy on handing it out, so you have to constantly go up and ask for more.  A great place to come for a step up from fast food.  I definitely stop by anytime I'm in the neighborhood for satisfying, generous portions of delicious Mexican food all at the right prices.

<review# 2031,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2006,4/10/2007,25,145,,10,4>Babetta's is a bit of a trek from midtown, but I think it's worth it not to deal with the bad attitude at Rumpelstiltskin.It's a beautiful store, with a large and varied selection of yarn. You can check out what they have on their website. There is a sofa and a table and chairs in the back, plus an electric fireplace! I love it. There is almost always at least one customer hanging out and knitting. Babetta and her daughter are really nice and helpful. They also have a lot of books and supplies. I think they have rovings and other spinning supplies, but I'm not into that so I'm not sure specifically what they have.They also have a frequent shopper card, so you get I think $20 store credit after spending a certain amount of money there. Bonus.
<review# 2032,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2007,4/9/2007,164,248,,8,>My favorite used book store. I go about once a month. They take my used books and give me "credit" for them, which amounts to a discount on the books that I buy. Employees are friendly and willing to look on their database for a particular title. All the books I have bought here have been in good condition. The store is clean, bright, and spacious, which is more than can be said for most used book stores. They do accept plastic, thank God, because who the hell carries cash anymore?Update 4/14/07OK, I cursed them with my 5 star review and they are now going out of business. I am so bummed, but the good news is that everything is at least 60% off, while supplies last.
<review# 2033,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2007,4/8/2007,242,141,,12,4>** UPDATE April 2007 **With sadness, I must change my review from 5 to 4 stars. Proprietor hasn't been on top of his game/distracted/unprepared last couple of visits. Hope he can pull it together. Still great wine, but you are unable to enjoy any snack or even a glass of water with it. [end update]  **Though this intimate wine bar is in the very heart of downtown, if you blink, you will miss it. It is cleverly incorporated into the southeast corner of the parking garage at 16th & L.You can find wines from all over the world here -- sold by the bottle and glass -- plus a handful of small appetizers. The interesting wine menu, designed by Aziz Bellarbi-Salah, is constantly evolving. On our visit today, wines by the glass included eight whites, eleven reds, a number of ports, medeira, and a handful of beers. The appetizers included olives, a tapenade plate (olive & pesto), a salami plate, and a cheese plate (camembert, brie, & a pungent blue served with handmade crostinis).Bellarbi-Salah is the son of the owners of Aioli's. There is no wine snobbery here; you can tell him what characteristics you are looking for and he will pleasantly guide you along your journey. He knows his stuff yet remains friendly and humble.I'm sorry to say I don't remember the names of the wines Alan S. and I had (we tried three) though I can tell you we thoroughly enjoyed them, as well as the cheese plate. To be honest, we were having too nice a time to be bothered with those details.It's cozy; about 300 square feet. However, there is a small outdoor patio where you can bask in the light of the cool vintage Big-O tire sign, just to remind you that you are indeed downtown. Though the interior is small, it doesn't feel cramped due to the tall ceiling; the vertical axis is highlighted by dangling amber glass light pendants.Wines by the glass run about $7-11 for a 6 ounce glass; ~ $3.50-5 for a 3 ounce glass. A nice place to stop for a superior glass of wine before or after dinner. Hours as listed on the door: "Midday to Midnight, M-F; LateAfternoon to Midnight on Saturday."Salud!

Their service is friendly and their interior decor is exquisite. From the street, the shopping center seems like it wouldn't house a restaurant as good as Famous Kabob. But, enter inside and you'll think your eyes are playing tricks on you!Definitely try the kabobs, but for the more courageous, try the stews (served with fluffy basmati rice) and definitely check them out for their cheaper lunch specials!
<review# 2036,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2007,4/4/2007,78,413,2,7,6>Honestly, I wasn't expecting this place to be as good as it was. I'm used to great tapas places like Cesar or Cafe de la Paz, and wasn't expecting Aioli to be so great.The portions were quite large for tapas - my date and I ordered 3 dishes and we couldn't finish them between the 2 of us. The salmon and chicken were delicious, but the potatoes were a bit bland - I was expecting a little hot to go along with the spicy. If I wasn't graduating and leaving Davis in 3 days, I would definitely come back here.
<review# 2037,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2007,4/3/2007,255,791,,6,3>Ate here tonight because of the great reviews on yelp. I loved that it was all you can eat! I totally loaded my bowl with noodles, celery, carrots, broccoli, onions, Kung pao sauce, garlic, and chicken, then went back for a seconds. They had other veggies I skipped but I'm sure others would enjoy like water chestnuts, mini corn, pork, beef, lamb, green onions, cilantro, mushrooms, lettuce, and what looked like spinach? Basically you pick out what you want, fill your bowl and they stir fry it while you watch. I ended up with a hot healthy meal. They also had Jell-O, and fried appetizers like egg rolls, wonton wrappers, and sesame bars. I wasn't impressed with the egg drop soup because it had the consistency of gravy. Also the fried rice wasn't very good, it just had egg in it and was kind of blah. The Mongolian bowl was just perfect, piping hot and loaded with my favorite veggies! I made sure to tip the chef when I went back the 2nd time and he did a wonderful job of thoroughly cooking my meal. They have all you can eat, and I got a soda for dinner it set me back $11, even though I was dining alone that wasn't bad, I've spent more on chinese food. And I really enjoyed my healthy hearty meal, and being able to go back for another bowl and trying some of the different sauces.
<review# 2038,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2006,4/2/2007,59,152,2,2,1>It defies all logic but Whitey's Jolly Kone, the burger joint that time forgot, has the best milkshakes in America.  I don't know why there isn't a single person in the Bay Area who can make a shake to match what underpaid teenage girls make here, but there just isn't.  The apotheosis of their shakes is the legendary fresh peach, available only in high peach season (as of July 6, they weren't available yet this year -- but wait!  as of July 13 they are!), but any shake at all is made with perfect fresh fruit and is so thick you can turn the cup upside-down and nothing will happen.  I love their ambience, the other customers, and their burgers and fries are all better than average too.  Get a real slice of life in West Sac with your food!
<review# 2039,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,9/1/2014,152,79,16,25,20>A new Taiwanese milk tea joint amongst many other Asian drink competitors already in the Stockton Blvd area. So what makes this place different than the others?1) It's not actually a "boba" place...because they don't have boba! You can get your grass jelly fix here instead.2) The price of the drinks is a little higher (~$3.50-4.00 for a regular) BUT this is because the size of their cups is much larger than other places. The regular is the size of a large at Lollicup and the large is HUMONGOUS. Like, seriously crazy-big. I would totally get it one day just to look like a milk tea goddess.3) The service! NEVER before have I gone to a milk tea place and been offered samples. This was super helpful since I wasn't sure what to get, and I was able to sample several of their most popular drinks, such as the roasted milk tea and the mango green tea (which I ended up ordering!). Drinks were also put out quickly.4) You can choose your sweetness level (reminiscent of Gong Cha). This might be something you need to experiment with. I ordered the mango green tea with regular sweetness and would gladly get it again, but may want to lower the sweetness next time since it's a sweet drink already. On the other hand, you might want to increase the sweetness of the roasted milk tea due to it's smoky flavor? It's up to you! Customize away!5) The atmosphere is just cute in general. Pink walls, pop music playing in the background, tons of colored straws to choose from. Still waiting on a sign outside, though!Overall, a great first impression. Drinks were yummy and refreshing. Would definitely come back!
<review# 2040,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/24/2013,8/31/2014,3276,1443,32,49,32>Flash In The Pan?SITREPYes. "Flash In The Pan".  I am standing, waiting in the buffet line, wondering why I can see the "flash of light-reflected from bottom of the pans."  Oh!  That's because the pans are empty- they don't contain any food!SETUPI've been back to Darna a few more times, but I was particularly disappointed this go-around. To give a Cliff's Note's version up front:  customer service / cooking prep were lax & unprofessional.  When you are on the clock for lunch, the buffet is supposed to be an efficient lunch option, letting you get in & out in a timely fashion without fuss or muss of ordering, and waiting to pay a server (cause you do that first).  The expectation is the food will be presented & piping hot for you to serve yourself and enjoy.However, that was not the case:DEFICIENCIES:*  Out of Kabobs (a gentlemen in front actually grabbed these last ones as I took this picture). More than 10 minutes to refresh this pan:yelp.com/biz_photos/darn*  Out of Pita Bread (they still have the same pitifully small basket I noted in last review) and took 10 mins to replace:yelp.com/biz_photos/darn*  Out of Falafils and took 15 minutes to replace:yelp.com/biz_photos/darn*  Sadly (especially for me), Massouka was NEVER replaced entire 30 mins I was there from 12:20pm-12:50pm:yelp.com/biz_photos/darnBUFFET METRICSCome on.  After 10 mins of hovering, I finally had to confront the shawarma attendant (who was periodically in & out), and said, "You are out of Massouka, Pita and Falafils, and other things."  His golden response was, "Oh!  We're busy."Really?  Like it's MY JOB to inform staff that they are out of food?  And "busy"?  Like having people come to your business at lunchtime is some unexpected surprise?  Like finding out that water is "wet" kind of surprise?  WTF.  It's lazy & unprofessional for them to not be prepared for the lunch-crowd, to NOT be monitoring the food buffet situation.  Any so-called good buffet employs the metrics that if a pan of food is down to 1/4 or under, you REPLACE IT IMMEDIATELY.  You don't let it run out during the lunch buffet hours.SHORT ORDER VS. BUFFETWhat I DID notice also is that the couple behind me that I still overheard order the Chicken Pita & Fries combo for lunch for $9 as I was putting change back into my wallet, actually got their orders in 10 mins.  BEFORE, mind you, I was able to get the buffet items I wanted.   WTF?So the irony is that your premium customer who is paying $14.01 for the buffet, is having to wait longer than the short orders taken.  That's an askew prioritization as far as the buffet vs. short order menus are concerned.  POOR POOR RACHEL AND HER "TO GO" ORDERHowever, the worst case-scenario of this total deficient "buffet-prep & delivery" was the poor gal who had been 2 spots in FRONT of me at the register - she had gotten the "To-Go" option, probably thinking (like I would LOGICALLY also) this would make things "faster" for her.  ("Hahahahahaha!  Oh god.")  But Rachel (I had time to make her acquaintance while we were both awkwardly waiting for items to show up) actually had the worst end of the lunch deal.  She was waiting and waiting and standing AND WAITING AND STANDNG the same 10-20 mins I was for items to show up.  At least I could grab dolmas and tabouli and some other items and eat.  I almost felt like asking her to go ahead and sit down with me and pick from my plate til the premium entree food items we both were waiting for would show up.  She just confided to me that this was going to make her late in getting back to her office and her whole idea thinking that this would "save time" for lunch was "hijacked" by their lax customer service.  "Hijacked".  I liked her use of that word. Funny thing is that I'm already familiar with lazy buffet operations who engage in this lax attitude about food replenishment - they include such notorious stalwarts as Annabelle's in Old Sacramento and Mountain Mike's Pizza buffet off of College Town Road. I just had no idea that DARNA would devolve to such depths.But the fact of the matter is that Annabelle's and Mountain Mike's are only charging me between $7-$8 to waste my time and hijack my lunch hour.  You, Darna, are charging me exactly $14.01 for that privilege.  So no thanks.THE LOWDOWNYour food - when PRESENT - still rocks. But you lack a professional buffet with customer service metrics expected of such an operation. I may give it another try. I may not. But in terms of cost & saving time from reduced frustration right now, I think I'm better served going to Golden Rice Bowl just two doors down for their daily $5.95 special.

At the rate my kids read and want books it seems to be the only way I can keep up.  We go to the library a lot but my kids really like having books at home that belong to them and new books stores are excellent but expensive sometimes.  My youngest son collects Ripley's books and some can't be found at stores that sell new books so we come often to see if he scores a new to him book.  Sometimes they have them and sometimes they don't but when they do... it's cause for celebration.My kids and I like to go in without having any specific book in mind and just look around to see what seems interesting.  The prices are very good and the selection is HUGE.  The guy that has been at the store the last couple of times is an absolute pleasure to talk to and super helpful.  If I'm looking for something specific that they don't have he has had no problems calling their other stores to ask.  Definitely a 5 star place to me.

Street fairs are kind of our specialty. Ever since Thursday Night Market was taken away a few years ago, we go at our farmer's markets and antique fairs with a vengeance. There was a wicked antique fair out today. The whole street was packed, from the front of the steak house to the lightrail station, and then some. When it comes to clubbing, we have Scarlett's. That's pretty much it, but you can also dance at Powerhouse, the hotel, La Hacienda, or maybe Sutter Club. (I miss Yager's so very much!!!) There's a nice handful of places to drink on top of those, and when you get the munchies, you can either hit up the 2am hot dog stand, or grab a taxi to Adanberto's, which is really within walking distance for those who aren't in heels.For the loners and stoners, there are a couple of really nice courtyards if you look around, but I won't describe them, because I don't wish to share.If you're looking for someone to flirt with, it's mostly valley girls and bros, but hey, in a pinch...
<review# 2043,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/15/2014,8/28/2014,50,75,6,18,13>I was delighted to spot Sun & Soil as I was driving on P Street the other day.  Had my dreams come true? A high quality organic, raw, cold-pressed juice company! In Sacramento! I miss LA's Pressed Juicery dearly, and I've been trying to fill this significant gap in my life for a while now.Sun & Soil is a relatively small shop.  There is a counter where you order your juices.  All the juices are made that morning through a cold press, which keeps them raw.  That means there are NO preservatives, you are drinking 100% pure fruits and vegetables.  The way it should be.  However, this means that there are no custom juices.  In contrast, they also do made-to-order smoothies that are easily customizable.  I tried the BETA BOOM and it was delicious - kale, collards, orange, and carrot made for a very mild and tasty combination.PRICES:One juice is $9 plus a refundable bottle deposit of $2. The juices come in a beautiful glass bottle that you can take back in for refills.  Cold pressed juices are expensive, and I am fully okay with that!  A one-day juice cleanse is $47. This is an excellent price for a high quality cleanse.  Pressed is $50-$70 for a day, and Blueprint's are around $65.  Yay for local!PARKING:Street parking, as always in this area. It's easy to find.I am so excited! So far this place is absolutely living up to my expectations. I can't wait to return and try more juices!
<review# 2044,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2014,8/27/2014,199,139,15,26,18>I have never written a review with the intent on having it recognized as the Review of the Day (ROTD) - until now. Not for selfish reasons-- but to recognize the hard working couple working in the dark at one of the best kept secrets in the area. Seriously, I don't think there is a single florescent light, light bulb, or candle  in this shop. Perhaps that is why there have only been two reviews on this little gem in the past year. Customers have probably driven up to the shop , thought it was closed, and kept on moving. I almost made the same mistake this afternoon, but I am sure glad that I went up to the door and peeked inside.My family and I walked in, and there were no customers in sight. Usually that's a bad sign, but I think in this instance people just don't know about this place. After carefully studying the display case,  we settled on two different types of turnovers( lemon and cherry), two piroshki's (potato and beef) , and a beef and cheese khachapuri.The gentleman behind the counter told me that the potato piroshki's came right out of the fryer. To my surprise, the piroshki was not greasy at all. How does something come right out of the fryer so light and fluffy?  I took my first bite and immediately knew that I had discovered an amazing treat by accident. The potato filling was perfect and had just enough seasoning throughout - is that dill that I taste?The beef piroshki and beef and cheese khachapuri did not disappoint. The beef was well seasoned, and the dough to filing ratio was on point. In other words, the beef didn't ooze out of the end of the pastry creating a puddle of meat that you don't know what to do with once you are finished. Once we devoured our savory options, the turnovers were next. I have heard of apple turnovers, and cherry turnovers -but lemon?  I went straight for the lemon turnover and couldn't believe how soft, flaky, and delicious this thing was. The outside was so tender , and the filling inside was just tart enough. Easily the best turnover I have ever had the pleasure of stuffing into my face. Personally , I am not a fan of cherry anything- but my wife and daughter loved the cherry turnover just as much as the lemon turnover.I now know what I am going to do every weekend for the rest of my life. The best part, is that the piroshki's are $1.49 , and the turnovers are 1.99. What? Are you serious?  I can't think of a better value on the planet. I am so thankful that I decided to stop in and take a chance on this bakery. Hope to see you there......
<review# 2045,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,8/26/2014,189,452,9,15,15>We were a party of 5.  What a cool place.  My friends and I tried this place right before class because we wanted to try it out.  We always passed by on freeport and we just had to try it. We were attracted to the $5.00 sushi rolls happy hour.  That was one of the reasons why we walked in.  ENVIRONMENTThe place looked slightly dimmed.  The warm colored walls and the seats were very cooshy and soft.  Very comfortable!  FOODI know I said earlier that we were attracted to the sushi rolls, but I couldn't pass up to try their TAN TAN MEN noodle soup.  That was what I ordered.My friends ordered rolls and they couldnt finish it.  So I tried tasting those too.  TAN TAN MEN - To me it had a deep flavor.  It is pretty unique from other restaurants in Sacramento that do make it.  It was very delicious.  I had to eat it really fast because class was going to start within that 30 min period when my food arrived to the table.  Slightly spicy.  I ordered it this way because I knew I had to woof it down because of class. I dont think I couldve eaten that quickly if it was SUPER spicy.  But I loved my tan tan men.GODZILLA ROLL - That was the name of the roll that I remembered.  Easy to remember the name but I really enjoyed it a lot.  The other rolls, I didnt remember the names but one was crunchy and the other had a spicy kick.  Overall I enjoyed all the rolls that was ordered.  It was super delicious.GRIPEOkay it was a great restaurant.  The only gripe I had was that it took 25 min to prepare our food.  I was rushing back to class.  But  it could also be our fault because I told the waitress to make sure my soup was done the same time as the sushi rolls so that we can eat at the same time.  That could be why.  So no problem!  Not taking away any stars. TRY AGAIN?Yes I will definitely try again.  I enjoyed the food.  I wanna try their other stuff too.
<review# 2046,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/27/2014,8/25/2014,569,79,8,14,11>This review is for Wednesday, February 26, 2014Blackbird Kitchen+Beer Gallery is a newly reopened restaurant located in the Heart of Downtown Sacramento just off the Plaza on the east side of 9th Street between J and K Streets.  If you remember the old Fumy's, you've found it!Carina Lampkin, chef and originator, once again, creates delicious eats and visual art.  You can see her crafting in the kitchen through the large front window.Demetri Gregorakis, co-owner, adds a fresh concept to the restaurant with 50+ craft beers.  Demetri can be seen throughout the dining and bar areas, conversing with patrons.  He came by my table at least twice and instantly made me feel welcome.Our waitress was very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  She was easy to talk to and commutes from Woodland, CA and is of Spanish decent. ;)I went here for dinner during their 'soft-opening".  It was a limited menu, but saw something for every palate.  Here's what we ordered:Fish Tacos ($6):  Lightly battered and fried to perfection.  Simple concept, with complex taste.  A deal at $6 for the quality of the fish and freshness of the ingredients.Blackbird Burger ($12):  Small in diameter, but out of this world in taste!  The house smoked bacon melts in your mouth and makes this burger!!  Or was it the wonderful bun?  Or was it the perfectly cooked patty? Or the cheese?  I dunno..... get one and decide for yourself.  Either way, this burger is worth it if your carnivores tastes need to be tamed.Captain's Chowder (normally $12/bowl, but I ordered half a bowl to sample):  As the late Michael Jackson would say, "This is It!"  I love chowder, you love chowder.  Who doesn't love a good chowder? If you want a good seafood chowder, you go to Fox & Goose.  If you want the absolute best chowder, look no further, because....This is It!!!  The creamy, buttery flavor along with the fresh seafood and smoked clams will satisfy any chowder lover.  The grilled bread with make it a meal in itself.  Don't underestimate or you'll be bringing something home. And it won't be this chowder  Seared Arctic Char ($21):  I had to look this up.  Wikipedia says this cold water fish is related to the both Salmon and Lake Trout.  It tastes just like Salmon+Trout as well.  I ordered mine "medium", like my steaks, and it was incredible.  My favorite part of this meal was the potatos and poached egg on top.  I love me some breakfast and this dish was surprisingly like eating breakfast with a side of Arctic Char.  I would get this again, but will probably take some home because of that killer Captain's Chowder.I would rate this soft opening of Blackbird Kitchen+Beer Gallery an accurate 4/5 stars.  The only reason why I rate this four stars, is because the dining tables are upstairs and there is not an elevator on the premises.  Even the waitresses have to hand carry your orders up the stairs.  Sure, there are tables downstairs, but on my visit, the tables downstairs seemed to be for the bar patrons.  It's noisier downstairs and I could see how that may kill a romantic dinner the upstairs tables could offer.Did I mention the chowder was Simply Wonderful?
<review# 2047,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2014,8/24/2014,358,274,8,23,8>Pricey, most definitely, but an amazing experience for an All-You-Can-Eat nonetheless. I don't get a lot of opportunities to try Brazilian cuisine in the area, let alone one that offers this much array of food, so I was really looking forward to this visit.Not what I expected as I walked in the door. More upscale than I imagined. The decor is sophisticated and classy. My casual shirt, shorts, and torn up Vans would've suggested otherwise. Needless to say, I was a bit underdressed. Service was still very welcoming. We were seated right away, and immediately greeted by our waiter who carefully explained how everything worked. The salad bar was plentiful -- 35 different types of gourmet salads, cold dishes, rice, and beans. It certainly had variety as you'll see in my photos, which I'll include. Cue in the Gauchos (meat carvers)! They brought in Chicken Wrapped in Bacon, Tri-tip, Lamb Chop, Pork Rib, Top Sirloin Beef, Parmesan Chicken, and Rotisserie Pineapple, among other things we didn't get to try b/c we were already too full (next time!). The whole course also included Brazilian side dishes, such as Fried Banana, Pao de Queijo (cheese bread), and Brazilian-style mashed potatoes, all of which were fantastic. I wish I had a larger stomach to accommodate seconds on each of those. Favorites -- lamb chops, cheese bread, fried bananas, and rotisserie pineapple. To top it all off, I tried their Papaya Cream dessert (blended ice cream & papaya, served with Cassis). The mixture was light and sweet, while the sauce added a grape-like, gourmet jam-ish flavor; a refined presentation and taste of an aesthetically and deliciously pleasing dessert. Must-try!Dinner: $45/person, $22.50 for ages 8-12
<review# 2048,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/12/2014,8/23/2014,570,275,12,13,12>Dear waitress who served me and my fellow:I failed to get your name, of which I'm sorry for, but you're awesome. You and I discussed Old Navy clothes, and you provided lots of laughs that evening. You made sure we were well taken care of, brought all of our food/drinks out in a timely manner, and were just overall fantastic. You are the type of person that brings me back to an establishment. You made us feel welcome and happy to be there. So, you rock!Going on a early Saturday night while it's raining is the best time to go. It was quiet enough without being bar loud obnoxious. There was also happy hour until 6, so snacks and beer were super cheap: 3 food items and 2 beers for $20. We were satisfied. I'm not in that area much, but next time I am, I'll swing by and enjoy the good and "real" onion rings. :)Sincerely,Tara H.
<review# 2049,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/14/2014,8/22/2014,263,136,8,19,16>I want to eat here everyday!  Everything was pure heaven.  My friend and I ordered the deviled duck egg toast, a meat board, and a cheese board.  We also ordered the Mad Hatter cocktail.  Everything came out to be a little under $60.  What a deal!  This place is small, so I would recommend coming in on a weekday rather than a weekend.  The place was packed on a Tuesday night.  So I can't imagine how it is on a Friday or Saturday night. The meat platter comes in 3/6/12 choices of meat.  My friend and I overheard the server tell the two ladies next to us that usually for two people they recommend the 3 meat platter, but we ordered a 6 meat platter for two people.  We felt like fat lards, but when everything came out it was the perfect amount.  Actually, I wished we ordered more!  If you are having trouble picking what types of meat or cheeses you want, you can just have the chef pick for you. Chef Michael Tuohy even stopped by our table to make sure everything was okay.  I love when I get visits from the chefs at restaurants.Can't wait to come back!

<review# 2051,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/11/2014,8/20/2014,466,199,15,21,19>Sometimes you just want to have a good time with friends out on the town but don't feel like hitting up the old midtown bar scene. Comedy sounds fun but most of the comedy clubs have a two-drink minimum and feature the same comics that you can catch on TV. That works if you've seen their stand-up specials before and want to see the same thing live, but for something different, check out Sacramento Comedy Spot.Much of the performances are improv, so the comedians have to be on their toes. A recent show of the Anti-Cooperation League had me in stitches, due to comedians'  personal stories, including sex with a stranger in an airplane bathroom, and naked streaking down a suburban street.There's a small bottle bar in the corner but no drink requirement, although my friends and I probably surpassed any drink minimum that the club could impose. Prices are low, the people are nice, and the material is good old adult entertainment - better not bring yo kids.
<review# 2052,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2014,8/19/2014,146,90,13,23,16>When I heard that "Claim Jumper" would be opening a restaurant in Downtown Sacramento, I had a very mixed opinion of how it would fit in this neck of the woods. And considering many of their restaurants are in less busy traffic areas, this would be an interesting fit to say the least. As many of you already know, they took over where "McCormick & Schmick's" once stood. And many of the employees who were part of that operation still work for "Claim Jumper" as they're owned and operated by Landry's Inc.I came here with my lovely lady and a couple of our friends on a beautiful weekend day as we give their Happy Hour a try. Little did I know that they offer a Happy Hour every Monday through Friday from 3-6:30pm and Saturday from 11am-3pm. As we walked into the restaurant, we sat at the bar to take full advantage of the Happy Hour offerings.The interior of this "Claim Jumper" is fairly spacious and from what I remember about "McCormick & Schmick's", they didn't modify too much on the inside. However, the bar area was slightly updated while the dining areas were kept the same. This location is a bit smaller than the Roseville one as square footage is limited with space in the historic Downtown Sacramento building (on J and 11th St.).As I already have a general idea of what I want, I decide to try a pint of their Blonde Ales (for $4.00) with an order of "Mini Caesar Salad" (for $3.00). My beer is brought out immediately while my salad arrives about 15 minutes later. One thing that makes "Claim Jumper" unique are their hearty portions. I gotta say, for a "Mini" Caesar Salad, this thing was huge! I literally took my time eating this as I got full off of that alone. However, I needed more food in my system to get me through the rest of the day. Therefore, I gave their "2 Chicken Street Tacos" (for $4.00) a try. These only took a few minutes to arrive and were extremely taste and fulfilling. Our other friend tried the "2 Classic Beef Sliders" (for $4.00) and mentioned they were one of the better sliders she's had especially with the toasted bun and hearty portions.As I was surprised that many of my Yelp peeps gave "Claim Jumper" three or even two stars, I will rate this experience a respectable four stars. The pricing, atmosphere, and most importantly, the service is what makes this experience a memorable one. And I just wanted to give a shout-out to Michelle (who works at the bar) that did an absolutely wonderful job in giving us exemplary service with our above-average dining experience.To sum things up, I will definitely come back to this "Claim Jumper" location again. And before we all left for the day, we tried a drink that one of the neighboring parties had ordered, an "Oatmeal Cookie". This was none other than your basic "Bailey's Irish Cream", Goldschlager Schnapps, and butterscotch Schnapps. As I'm not a big fan of those creamy-liqueur drinks, this one actually tasted pretty good and much like an actual oatmeal cookie. Overall, we definitely got our money's worth as this was a perfect way to spend our weekend day!
<review# 2053,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2014,8/18/2014,313,152,32,25,23>I can only think of one word when I think about this delicious luxurious place. CHEAT DAY!Everything here is pure ecstasy with a side of condensed milk.  If someone dumped you or you just got fired from a job or your boobs hurt or you just want a place to drown your sorrows and get fat this is the best place to do it. I swear the deserts here go straight to my hips but I don't give a fak. The sugar rush you get here is better than blow I swear. I am puzzled as to why others have given this place less than 5 stars shame on you. I know some of the flavor combos seem bizarre like mango with grass jelly or honeydew snow with water melon, however once you take one bite the weird and puzzling dessert combo your mouth will tell you your initial assumptions were dead wrong. I am often seen leaving where pop locking my way to my car with a grass jelly mustache from ear to ear. Take my advice go here and try it at least once and you will understand why I love this place so much. This is officially my new emotional eating spot.
<review# 2054,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2014,8/17/2014,1292,369,13,20,17>I came here after seeing Jenni T. check-in here this morning and I'm super glad that I came by! This location of Insight Coffee Roasters only opened up about 5 weeks ago and you can tell that word hasn't really gotten out yet since I was the only customer there when I first arrived.I had really good service from Tyler "Buster" who talked me through what was in the pastry case when I asked. The pastries were from Yellowbill (also known as Magpie Cafe) and looked super appealing. I've had Yellowbill pastries at Chocolate Fish several times and I'm glad to see other coffee shops carrying them too. Other Insight locations sell doughnuts from Doughbot, but this location is still working on getting them carried here.I ended up ordering a bran muffin and Matcha Latte and both were super good. The only thing that knocks down my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars is that I don't like the yuppy shopping plaza that it's located in. Definitely come check them out and spread the word that this location is now open!
<review# 2055,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/5/2014,8/16/2014,114,195,8,11,9>I've been meaning to try this place for awhile, based on the reviews, and I'm glad I did.Let me get the bad news out of the way first:- Place is DINGY. Dirty and old and run down.- Location is not that great. We work downtown and live in Tahoe Park and it took us nearly 25 minutes to get there. And the parking lot is tiny.- Service was quick, but I noticed a regular come in and get multiple rolls within minutes of sitting down while we were still waiting on our food that we had ordered 10 minutes before he got there. That always rubs me the wrong way.But onto the good news!- Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.- A million rolls on the menu. Okay, that's an exaggeration, but I am an indecisive person and putting that many rolls on the menu made it hard to choose. But...- The Crazy Horse roll was DELICIOUS. Lots of fresh fish. I think it could have used some more texture though, because it was all soft. Cucumber would have been a nice addition.- Masago nigiri was abundant and fresh.- Fiance got the bento box. The sesame chicken was crunchy and perfectly fried. SO tasty. - The gyoza was AMAZING. As my fiance put it: "they really have their STICK together." Yeah, he's kind of a weirdo, but I love him anyway.- Price was right. Rolls were fairly priced.Overall, it was a really good experience and the sushi was tasty, but getting there was a bitch, and I don't see myself going out that way very often.
<review# 2056,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2014,8/15/2014,99,72,10,11,12>!!!Thank you Jebus!!!FINALLY a legit Korean sit down restaurant in the midtown/downtown area. This has been long overdue and thankfully it's here. No more journeys out to Rancho or South Sac for Korean. Located in the mansion flats neighborhood on the corner of 14th and G. It's strictly street parking but it wasn't too hard to find a spot. The restaurant itself is a bit on the smaller side but there is plenty of seating. The decor is modern and stylish with two big flat screen tv's.  So this was our first time here and upon entering we were immediately greeted by the staff. We opted to sit at the bar to catch the rest of the Heat vs Nets game. The bartender/server was cool as hell and gave us samples of the beer on tap. And after we ordered a round of the 75 cent soju shots he  came right back with another round on the house which was a great touch. Down to the food, I ordered the spicy BBQ pork and shared an order of the Crazy Bulgogi Fries. Our meal was accompanied by an assortment of side dishes such as Kimchi and bean sprout salad... Sorry I didn't want to butcher the Korean name for that dish haha. The BBQ pork came out on a sizzling platter garnished with jalapeño slices and green onions on a bed of sliced onions. The pork was just the right mix of sweet and spicy. As for the fries... OH GAWD! They were amazing! The fries were cooked to a perfect crisp with slices of Bulgogi and slathered in sauce. I have no clue what was in that sauce but it was delicious! The service here is excellent, very attentive and friendly. Our glasses were never empty and they were able to split the check 4 ways when a lot of other restaurants frown upon that. The funny thing is, we didn't even ask to split the check and they offered to do it for us. I'm happy to say I have found my go to Korean restaurant when I want to stay in the neighborhood. Great food, great service. It's a can't miss.
<review# 2057,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/13/2014,8/14/2014,343,568,10,17,14>We came in for lunch after a morning at the spa.  After a quick wait at the counter, we ordered a sandwich to split: turkey and avocado.  I ordered a soda and was given a can.  We were given a number and sat down at a table.  Our food was brought out  after a few minutes.  The sandwich was very tasty, but the pasta salad that came with it was flavorless.  Also, for the price I had expected a larger portion!  The fun part came AFTER lunch, when we returned to the counter for dessert.  The cases are not marked, so we had to have an employee come out from behind the counter and point to each item individually and tell us what it was.  Kind of annoying, since there was a line behind us, and it was hard to hear her as she faced the case, so there was no way we could hear and remember everything she saidin order to make such an important decision!  We selected a few items: a chocolate cupcake with raspberry frosting, a slice of chocolate cake, and a cherry breakfast pastry.  We ate them over the course of a day and they were all very good.The prices seem high for the product, and the inconvenience of not marking the cases is annoying, which knocked this place back a couple of stars!
<review# 2058,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,8/13/2014,206,220,10,13,9>Aww, Pita Pit, I lava you! Pita Pit truly is the mediterranean version of Subway. Though on their menu they have a list of a bunch of different Pitas they can make, what actually goes in each pita (other than the meat) is really up to you.Customization here is KEY. I usually get the chicken souvlaki (trust me, it is divine), and add all the things to it. I definitely overstuff my pita full of veggie goodness (in addition to the grilled mushrooms and onions, I add spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, olives, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce.) I also love that they have whole-wheat pitas (yay for attempting to be health conscious). The ingredients are fresh and make for a scrumptious pita-- definitely has become a go-to place for me when I'm too lazy to cook and just want to grab a quick bite to eat.I will say though, that I wish they listed what their "recommended" ingredients/toppings for each type of pita were. You can find them online, but it would be more convenient if they could find a way to squish that on the giant board where they list the types of pita. Even so, if you get stuck, just ask the person helping you what they would recommend you add for the type of pita you ordered-- they usually know what they're talking about.All the people who work at Pita Pit are super sweet and very student-friendly (show your student ID card for a discount on the combo!). A lot of the people who work here are also Sac State students, so that might have something to do with it...Again, with everything else in this plaza, I love the location. Recently I've been combining my Pita Pit trips with Starbucks runs and it's been lovely.tl;dr: Roommate can attest... I have become obsessed with this place. I sometimes dream of the pita that I will eat the next day. No joke.
<review# 2059,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/16/2014,6/12/2014,255,144,7,13,8>It pains me that on a brief glance at stars, Tako's Davis location measures up exactly the same for me as the Sacramento location. Was it the same experience? No... But did it merit 4 stars? Not exactly... So hear me out! In terms of the location, I love it much more because a couple rounds around this lovely Davis area would definitely give you a good parking spot. As for the Sacramento location, it's in the middle of nowhere and the probability of parking is so random that, for the most part, I don't even think it's worth venturing over to see if there is a spot. The food is quite standard across the board and is the same as that of the Sac location. I had the pleasure of trying the pulled pork nachos, kimchi quesadilla, and bulgogi tacos. The bulgogi meat was a little too sweet for me but it was definitely well marinated. After attending the yelp elite event here, my eyes were opened to the delicious pulled pork they have. I've always been bias towards chicken or beef but the next time I visit a tako I definitely won't be going for my go-to proteins. I absolutely adore the pulled pork nachos with its pile of artery clogging goodness of sauce, tomatoes, pulled pork, and whatever secret addicting ingredients my mouth could not define. I enjoyed that the location was spacey in comparison to the sac location so I wasn't knocking my hips into the shoulders of diners as I stood in line pondering what to order. I was hoping to try the fries, but didn't get a chance to so I guess another trip is in the near future!
<review# 2060,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/1/2014,6/11/2014,195,127,6,11,7>What's the big deal about the Fox & Goose? It's a bit like coming to the Crocker for lunch. You may or may not get the best food and service, but that's not why you're here! You ARE here to be transported from the doldrums of Sactown to the foggy streets of London - and to their credit, the owners have done an amazing job of recreating an English pub in this old and slowly gentrifying warehouse district of R Street.The crowds will mostly gather on weekend mornings for brunch. The patio is a welcome and long overdue addition that provides an enjoyable open air meal and cuts down on that (often interminable) wait list.Come, try out the food and have a great brunch. Stroll down a couple doors and check out the nearby shops that deserve a few more patrons than they're getting.And don't forget the pub! We really do have a treasure in this authentic English pub serving at least a dozen taps, and the best Guinness pour in Sacramento.If you've a group, you might want to ask about the private dining room that's visible from the pub. And, your experience won't be complete until you've gone to the loo. The feeling of walking into a darkened London subway is complete, right down to the subway map on the wall and the white subway tiles in the nicely remodeled bathrooms.Go!

The dishes we tried we're not only creative but very fresh and well presented. We were fortunate enough to sit at the sushi bar and watch Lou work. The communication between Lou and his staff was amazing. You would have thought you were in a Michelin Star kitchen. Our food came out with perfect timing and the right temperatures. I would have giving Lou's 5 star but the servers seemed a little timid with their follow ups. We had to ask for more hot tea and they forgot my fork...YUP, I cannot use chopsticks. Lou is a white guy who has mastered the art of sushi...not just throw some stuff together.
<review# 2062,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2014,6/9/2014,58,228,7,18,13>Well since my last review never posted, I'll have to let you in on a wonderful secret: Cultured & Cured has one of the most luxurious lunches in town and amazing products to take home or to a picnic. I got some really nice gifts for my Dad for the holidays from here, the kind and informative staff helped me pick out a dozen meats and cheeses to delight his taste buds (mine too, we ripped into it right away). I'm always greeted with a friendly smile and helpful staff, even when they are busy.The seating is limited, but the outdoor tables are really nice in this east-sac neighborhood. The decor is contemporary with steel and wooden fixtures/counters/walls. There are two main cases, one for meats and sides (some of those look mighty interesting, but intimidating) and the other for the myriad cheeses. They have expensive items like the luxurious crudo prosciutto and more moderately priced ones like spicy salami. I love their wide selection of sheep and goat cheeses, the sheep are very similar to regular diary.My favorite thing right now is to get a small cheese plate for lunch on the weekends. For $12 you get a smorgasbord of flavors and textures. They give you seasonal fruit (I have had pear and persimmon), dried fruits like cranberries and figs, roasted nuts like pistachios and marcona almonds, beet shoots (surprisingly flavorful), honey, toasted bread and crackers and 3-5 types of cheese. It is super filling and I usually take a bit home with me. When you get it to go there isn't quite as much stuff, or they toned down the portions recently.The Cultured and the Cured is  a really great addition to the near east sac scene and is a highlight of my food month. Head out for a snack, lunch, to-go order and more very soon.
<review# 2063,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/2/2014,6/8/2014,91,144,6,18,8>I am happy to see some new placed opening in downtown Lodi, and Smack Pie has some really great ideas. However, they still need to work on the execution.The owner was working the front counter and explained that Smack Pie is "like Subway, you build your own pizza". She was right in that the pizza is satisfying and fills a hungry tummy, but also like subway compared to an authentic deli sandwich, Smack Pie isn't as good as other pizza places  (Rick's, Pizza Rock). I like the idea of individual-build-your-own pizza, however, the toppings offered were not anything exceptionally (the owner asked for suggestions, I offered prosciutto and figs as options). Also, the oven they use seems too small for the volume of pizza they're currently making. Additionally, the cost for two people is the same as ordering a regular size pizza elsewhere. I will concede that they've only been open for a short time, so perhaps service will improve, but from start to finish it took an hour and twenty minutes for us to get our dinner. They do have a nice patio area for the upcoming summer evenings and farmers market.
<review# 2064,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2013,6/6/2014,136,157,11,12,11>Annual purchase of Christmas roast :-)I must have lost some check ins here because I only see a few but come here about once a month. This is a really great spot to grab a sandwich at lunchtime or grab something to take home for dinner. As you see above, I grabbed my Christmas roast here- we usually have prime rib but they had this cut called the "Baron of Beef' and gave me full cooking instructions. It was fabulous!  I miss the bones from the prime rib (I use them for stock) but this roast had virtually no waste as it's much leaner than prime rib and was every bit as tender and delicious!I come in here frequently and pick up an entrée to heat for dinner on the nights we are too tired to go out and neither of us feels like cooking. Grab some chicken parmesan and heat it up, serve with a salad and bada bing- dinner's done!Do yourself a favor, even if you don't like Italian food (in which case we're probably not going to be friends for much longer) and pick up some of their bacon. It's so good that some of my favorite people got it for Christmas this year. (not kidding)Read all the other reviews for more details if you must, but you would be smarter to just stop in and check it out for yourself :-)
<review# 2065,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/30/2014,6/5/2014,142,141,8,15,11>They are finally in Sacramento. I have been waiting for them to come this way for couple years now. They are located in the Chase/chipotle parking lot. Truxel and Gateway blvd.Since Firemen started this chain a few years back, the whole theme of this restaurant had a lot to do with firemen. The place inside has a great set up. Pretty big dining area. Once we stepped inside, all the workers yelled out,"Welcome to Firehouse." That felt great. Hope they keep that up after the grand opening effect dies down.Now unto the splendid delicious sandwiches they offer. They have about 10 different subs that they offer. The combo meals come with a medium sandwich, but you can upgrade to a large for $2 more, that's a great deal. I had ordered the smokehouse beef cheddar brisket, and damn, it was delicious. The workers call out your name and bring the food to your table, great customer service.The flavor of the smoked beef and the soft bread and how can I forget the sauce that they put on it, it was to damn good. One thing that they do not offer is fries. They do have some delicious  cookies and brownies though.I will be back many more times. My go to place in Natomas now.
<review# 2066,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,6/4/2014,193,225,14,19,15>The brisket here almost brought a tear to my eye. The light smokiness combined with the tender juicy beef cooked to BBQ perfection? Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?Have I died and gone to BBQ heaven?The setup is outdoors, with heaters at every table. The service was attentive. When I went there was one cashier guy who did all the table work as well. He forgot my sides initially, but apologetically corrected his mistake.I got FAT pieces of cornbread for 2.50 each. My little girls devoured it with included butter and honey.The macaroni salad had a little tang and the macaroni was firm and cold. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!I didn't have the baked beans but I heard they were smokey, with a little bit of meat and BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!Rack of ribs were perfect, and easily cut for serving to the table. Pulled pork was juicy and plentiful. Chicken and tri-tip were a touch dry but still so tasty I didn't give a f... watch yo mouth!As I took the ride from Rocklin over to Eldorado Hills, I remembered why the Sacramento area forced me to fall in love with it. The scenery, which included horses and cows and lush hills ended with BBQ PERFECTION. BOUCANE'S MAY JUST BE THE BEST IN TOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!Oh, and the desserts. HOLY MOLY.COCONUT BAR was on special for 1.25. It was decadent and my wife said "That's the best thing I've ever eaten."That's some review.I had the lemon cake and it was moist and delicious.I love you Boucane's. Would it be wrong if I went twice in one day?
<review# 2067,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/26/2013,6/3/2014,989,460,7,14,11>I really like the layout of this restaurant! It's really spacious and they also have an awesome outside patio. We started off with the scallop sashimi---bad choice. The salt overpowered whatever flavor that was supposed to be there. Nice presentation but it didn't compensate for the taste. We ended up ordering the seared scallops as well, which was something we should've done in the beginning. Not the best we've had, but it was definitely much better than the scallop sashimi.I came across the pork belly and maple glazed pumpkin. That's definitely not a combo you would see anywhere else, so I had to order it. There was a good amount of pork belly, but it was just OK. It didn't have me wanting more. However, I really enjoyed the pumpkin! My beau had the fish of the day, which was the swordfish. I'm not a fan of swordfish, the texture is too dense for my liking but even so, he said it was just OK. Overall, not worth it for the price.
<review# 2068,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/30/2013,6/2/2014,233,33,8,17,13>I have been to Davis Ranch for a Xmas tree for the last 3 years...  I don't know if I will ever go anywhere else...SettingJust about 15-20 minutes outside of Sacramento. Davis Ranch is a working farm with a variety of crops. They are most famous for their corn.ServiceAlways greeted by friendly staff. This is a Farm that has both cut your own and also a tree lot. You will pay more for going to the tree lot. We try to come every year the weekend following Thanksgiving. There are soooo many trees to choose from. Each vehicle is given a saw to cut your own tree. There is also staff walking throughout the tree farm with chainsaws in hand willing to give to a quick cut (for a small tip). I always bring my own chainsaw ;)They also have some food vendors on site. Kettle corn, hot dogs, face painting, BBQ... It is really nice place to bring the family. PriceYou can't beat the price. ANY tree ANY size (4' - 20'+) is $35 + tax. They will trim and wrap your tree for an extra $5. OverallThe trees tend to be a little dry towards the center of the tree. I never have been worried about the dryness at home but expect a little better quality tree if I'm cutting it myself. 4 out 5 for convenience, service, and price
<review# 2069,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2013,7/1/2013,324,135,8,26,20>There was a time when sushi wasn't served with the weighty, staccato beats of Top 40 radio and an overzealous assemblage of modern decor. Sushi houses were literally that, houses where a chef practiced his art. The sushi was fresh, made in front of you so you could watch the strong hands of the sushi master design the plate you would soon devour. These sushi houses were simple, comfortable and traditional. Now, I'm not saying I don't patronize the likes of restaurants like Mikuni or Nishiki--they're fun and the food's still good--but there's something to be said about the old world stylings of a place like Ju Hachi.At the corner of S and 17th, on the first floor of a flood-era Sacramento home, Ju Hachi is small, even quaint. The sushi bar is its highlight and a smattering of tables fill the rest of the restaurant's L-shaped floor plan. It's homey and welcoming and there's always a smiling server who will find you a table or a spot at the bar. The sushi is wonderful. Fresh, flavorful, tighly rolled and ranging from nigiri to specialty rolls. You can also get sashimi and, in the non-fish category, ramen, udon, tempura, katsu and teriyaki. Also notable is Ju Hachi's daily, all-day happy hour where you can gets bites like bbq ribs, chicken karage, small hand rolls and beer and sake for 2 to 5 dollars. I've never been disappointed with what this place has offered and it'll likely remain my favorite sushi house in town. Simple, comfortable and traditional is hard to beat.
<review# 2070,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/31/2013,6/30/2013,410,518,12,11,13>Around lunch time the cinnamon rolls aren't exactly the freshest.  Actually, they looked like they were sitting out for a while. With nothing but a heat lamp to keep them semi warm.  After my purchase, I took a bite, and then put the white Styrofoam that housed my bun in my purse.  Why?  Because I knew it could be better with a 30 second spin in the microwave.    Pretty sure I would have hated it if I ate it straight away as I perused the mall.  The first bite was tough and barely warm. Despite that, I couldn't get it off my mind.  I just wanted to get back to work and devour the thing at my desk after a quick dose of radiation.  So that's what I did.  Taste and texture improved after the 30 second microwave!  Loved every bite.  It wasn't too big or overwhelmingly sweet.  Just right.  I don't think I'd purchase this and eat it right away unless I saw them come straight from the oven.  Definitely a take home and bake/microwave type pastry if you want optimal taste.
<review# 2071,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/30/2013,6/29/2013,266,332,12,21,19>Score!!! Who else would serve American breakfast food along with Asian inspired breakfasts?? This place does!I have a family who has different tastes when it comes to breakfast. We have some who want sweet, some salty, some Asian, and some American? How will we ever agree on a breakfast joint? Holy Toledo! We found it! Damn, this is like a little vaycay, reminiscent to the time we spent in Hawaii. Lots of rice and sausage dishes, similar to what I make at home for a hearty breakfast. Also, there are the traditional American breakfast flare alongside of Vietnamese, and uhhh, Chinese??  How can you go wrong?When we stopped in, the place was packed. all of the tables are full and there are several patio sets outside. The interior of the restaurant seats maybe 25-30? Noticed that there is a sign posted that they would prefer it if you kind of accelerated your time here, if you notice that customers are waiting for a table. Food for thought! We waited approximately 10 minutes, and luckily a table opened and as soon as the group left, "Shazaam," we had a table! Wow, David Copperfield, watch out, the owner has "MAD,  busboy skillz!" We ordered off of the red menu, it is more specifically for the Chinese dishes. The three dishes were delicious, kind of different to what we are accustomed to but noted how expedient and efficient this place is! We received our order within ten minutes upon ordering!Gotta love how hard the employees here work, I noticed that there wasn't a happy table?!! I will definitely be coming back!
<review# 2072,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2013,6/28/2013,283,114,17,27,21>It's called Happy Chicken in Spanish. I call it damn good chicken in English, because that's what it is. Damn good chicken. There's nothing fancy about El Pollo Feliz other than one sexy, mesquite smoker that sits out front with golden-brown chickens sunbathing on a hot grill, over chunks of slow-burning wood.   The restaurant is small, the aroma's are big and the flavors are huge - and the service I received on this visit was personable and full of gratitude. I ordered the #7 plate - a chicken breast, thigh, leg and a wing that came with a side of beans and rice for only $7.49. The beans and rice were a nice way to fill the plate and I enjoyed the complimentary chips and salsa. But, El Pollo Feliz's niche that they've undoubtedly found is certainly with their chicken. A slow process over mesquite wood, yielding a golden brown skin, moist and tender meat, and a perfectly visible, and beautiful, pink ring of smoke. Looking back, I would've been content ordering just twenty pieces of the chicken. You're probably right, I am exaggerating because I do that a lot. But I'm kind of serious at the same time. It was that delicious. The owner welcomed me, the owner took my order, the owner brought my food, the owner thanked me, and as I was walking out the owner was helping on the smoker. The owner was doing it all, and the owner was happy to be doing it all. He smiled, he engaged, he inquired and he thanked. I felt the sense of pride he has in his work and it certainly showed in the chicken. And yet once again, he gratefully thanked me one last time as I walked to my truck, but instead I turned and thanked him this time.
<review# 2073,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2013,6/27/2013,1353,176,23,31,29>Yeah. It's worth every star. This dinner is an event. An experience. (we were there for over 5 hours!) They make you feel like a movie star. I mean it: every staff member was SO NICE and genuine. My veganocity was not only accommodated but *welcomed*, without question or hesitation.They seat you, encourage you to look around. You have a drink guy that comes to your table, and then a host who comes by and talks with you about your needs, restrictions, what are you celebrating, etc. Both were great. They have ACTS, yo. Your food comes out in ACTS. (classy as shit)   ACT I: From the demonstration kitchen, Chef Randall introduces the team and talks about whats to come. (Leeeeeet's get ready to EATSOMUCH.) He's clearly a culinary genius, a bit eccentric, (a lot eccentric), often toed the line btwn offensive and endearing. I lean toward endearing. He wore wacky pants.    ACT II: (veganized for me) A vegetarian ragu with microgreens and mint, pasta stuffed with soy cheese. OMGOMGOMG. My favorite thing.    ACT III: (again, veganized) Fennel, Potato and Black truffle Terrine w/ vegan Cream & Bleu Cheese and Tarragon Oil. YUM.   Intermezzo: Sushi!!! Sushi Chef Josh is the sushi guy.  The sushi, sashimi and tempura is placed around the room and outside so you have to get up, motor around. I had some vegan sushi, marinated cucumber salad, tempura and freshly grated wasabi root. (I'd never had fresh wasabi root, only the paste stuff. WOW. I've now lived.)   ACT IV: Brined/marinated tofu (in place of the scallop!) on a salad of frisee with a kumquat emulsion (say whaaa) potato cubes in place of the pork belly, and a mothereffing pomegranate FOAM on top. Delicious, yet my least favorite round. Still incredible.    ACT V: Okay: the omnis had Beef Wellington, I had a Vegetable Wellington, on a carrot consume with broccoli romanesco, beets, and mushrooms. HOLY. SHIT. This was incredible.       Dessert: Almond milk ice cream, raspberry and blood orange sorbets, a cherry sauce... and a cube of vegan deliciousness of which I savored every single bite. AMAZING. On top of everything, there was also a white glove tea service... you got up and order tea, they custom make it for you in a pot with fresh everything. Of course they do. bc it's insanely classy and magical.Best part: you can have as MUCH OF EVERYTHING AS YOU WANT. My buddy ordered 3 servings of the beef wellington, and another round of everything. I was so proud of him. VEGANS: This place is glorious for us. I LOVED that they served every course to me veganified, but in essence it was always the same dish everyone else was enjoying, so that I was still sharing the experience with my dinnermates. In fact, my whole table was difficult: a vegan, a vegetarian, three Muslims (so no pork or alcohol) AND a preggo, so no raw meat or moldy cheese! Psh, for The Kitchen, no sweat. Probably my favorite thing that happened: Chef Randall kept coming over to our table and talking with us, most likely bc we were such an oddity with all of our crazy restrictions. At one point he came up to me and said, "Okay, tell me honestly: are you okay with a little butter in the sauce?" I made an "ooooh-shit-I'm-so-sorry" face, and he immediately said, "No problem, I got it." and walked away. He later explained that he had accidentally made a sauce for me with a little butter, which he TOTALLY COULD HAVE just given it to me and I would have never known. Instead, he honored my wishes. THANK YOU CHEF!!!We stayed afterwards a bit, sipping coffee, sitting around the outdoor fire. The whole deal took over 5 hours... and it was worth every minute and every dollar.VERDICT: You must GO. Seriously, I mean it. At least once. This is truly fine dining. QUALITY. You are forced to ENJOY your meal, think about what you are eating instead of shoveling it in. Save up for special occasion, people. SOOO worth it. I'll be back for sure.
<review# 2074,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2013,6/26/2013,37,82,5,11,12>Track Seven is exactly the kind of place I enjoy. Good craft beer, moderate selection, local hospitality. The location seems a bit odd on a map, tucked inside an industrial shop row, surrounded by auto repair shops, a cross fit gym, etc. At first it seemed out of  place, but the more I've been there, the more it seems like a perfect place. My go to night is Friday, when the weather is warm, and the doors are up, the clientele can fan out and really make the place seem huge, no defined patio is perfect for dog owners who want to be able to enjoy a beer and good company without having to leave their best friend at home. Inside, there are long communal tables forcing great conversation between future acquaintances, and a small side room, very much like a tiny apartment living room, for a more intimate conversation. The beer menu is great for all types since Track 7 offers a wide spectrum of tastes.  My suggestion is to try a flight to narrow down your favorite, get at least a pint of that, then at the end of the night, get a growler, or have yours refilled with your second favorite. Take it home and enjoy it at your leisure, it will likely grow on you. I have often noticed that when sampling, the one that is your favorite, has strong flavors that you like, but once you have a full pint of it, you'll realize just how strong those flavors are. Generally the one that you will like the most is actually your second, or even third favorite sample.If you really like Track 7, bring extra $$ for merch (pint glasses, t-shirts, tap handles).  Damn near everything is for sale. You'll support a local business, and get some neat stuff.
<review# 2075,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2013,6/25/2013,50,132,5,15,11>My first thoughts upon being seated at Blackbird for dinner was "Wow, I don't feel like I'm in Sacramento" and "I wish there were more places like this in Sacramento." This place is definitely a gem. The vibe is very cool and urban. It's located in the heart of downtown, which unfortunately is not an area many people venture to at night and I imagine most state workers don't have the time to experience during lunch. I have passed by Blackbird several times without ever noticing it was even there. It is definitely on my radar now! I had a wonderful dining experience on a Friday night. John, the owner/manager, seated us and he was very friendly and it was evident that he truly cares about his restaurant and the experience of his customers. Everything on the menu looked really good and the majority of the food items were seafood.  Let me clarify, this ain't your Red Lobster kind of dinner! They have a "raw bar" section on their menu which definitely stands out. We opted with the clam chowder and lobster with beet salad to share. This was the perfect amount of food for two people. The clam chowder was the best clam chowder I have ever had! It is not your typical, very thick, creamy chowder. It is a little spicy, very flavorful, and has lots of seafood. I will definitely be coming back for the chowder! The lobster and beet salad with poached egg and pistachios was also very tasty and they don't skimp on the lobster. Overall it was an amazing dining experience with great food and excellent service. My next trip back will be for happy hour and some $1 oysters!
<review# 2076,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/12/2013,6/24/2013,667,245,8,13,13>Perfect place for a pitcher of sangria on a warm sunny day! Can't beat their HH pricing which includes $13 pitchers of sangria and $2-$3 bites! They also have other drink options on their HH menu as well.  I had their empanadas for the first time yesterday and they were amazing!! So meaty and the dipping sauce complimented it so well! We also ordered pita and hummus. The server brought us more pita when we ran out. It was nice to munch on the pita while enjoying our sangrias.I love their outdoor seating! My doggie was able to sit out and people watch with us on the patio! They are opened late nights as well which is a plus! I believe Sunday-Thursday they have late night HH from 10-closing. However, one of the older female waitresses wasn't so nice on my last visit. Drunk people come through here all the time late at night....deal with it & stop eavesdropping on peoples conversations! Thanks.PS:  If you decide to sit on their outdoor patio...be sure to put on some bug repellent. Some lucky mosquito made a dinner out of my legs! I left with 10 bites!! :(
<review# 2077,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2013,6/22/2013,451,183,7,13,10>Great gym! The price alone- $9.95 a month is great!And no contract! Yep, that's right. Just walk in, pay the first month and the annual fee (which is like $30 bucks a year) and workout!  I love that they have 10 TVs to watch while working out too, so it is very easy to spend time on one of the many cardio machines they have. I can easily spend and hour or more on a treadmill or elliptical when TBS is on.My usual problem with gyms is that they make you pay with an auto debit system. Not here. I pay cash! Every month, I walk in and pay my dues, no problem at all! Great thing too, or I would not be able to workout, haha. This place has a ton of cardio and circuit machines. Even during the busy 5 o clock to 7 o clock rush, there are always cardio and circuit machines available for use. I heart crunch!
<review# 2078,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/16/2013,6/21/2013,267,391,8,9,11>Another great Yelp event!The food was amazing - Dos coyotes provided us with delicious quesadillas and yummy chips and salsa! Dos coyotes salsa is amazing, it's different - it has kick and tang to it all in one bite.If you check in at the Boutique, you get 20% off your purchase. This is a little boutique that can be easily missed but it's definitely something worth checking out! You can get cute stuff and name brand items for a decent price. A great event to showcase one of the shops of East Sacramento!Good music too!
<review# 2079,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2013,3/3/2014,168,200,11,21,13>Oh my God, Becky, look at that falafel! My husband scanned the menus of the food trucks participating in Sacto Mofo's Trucktoberfest in West Sac and were pleasantly surprised to see the always veg friendly falafel at Gyro King. We both started with miso burgers at the Chairman but my husband's stomached roared on and he decided to get a falafel as a second course. I quickly snapped a pic when he sat down and am glad I did as it was quickly devoured. Halfway through, he offered a bite and I was hooked. Insanely delicious- so savory that I was craving more but before I could ask, he had nearly finished. Luckily, I got the very end of it but I am totally craving a full one right now. The pita was warm and thick and the chickpeas were excellently spiced with crisp and fresh veggies. My only complaint (along with my husband's) was that they went a little heavy on the tzatziki and when we go back I am going to have them go easy on the sauce. Really really delicious and I can't wait to go back and order light tzatziki and bump their score up to a 5!
<review# 2080,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/25/2013,3/2/2014,337,422,8,13,9>Mom & Pop's do exist...Well ACE Hardware still is a well known name and store, but not so much these days. It's great to have this hidden one on the grid. I don't have to drive off the grid to a big box - Home Depot or Lowe's - for one thing! Kudo's to you for surviving the American obsession with cheap prices and poor customer service!Please do not expect anything fancy here. That is what is to love about this little place. I went to get two things, both of which I walked out with. (I should add, I went to Home Depot a few nights before this and they were out of the one thing I needed - out of everything they stock) I peeped a few things I knew I'd need in the future, but I didn't buy them at the time. Their prices are slightly higher than the big boxes, but for sheer convenience this place does wonders.There was approximately three people working and one customer (me). Apparently they are doing something right at this store, because they are keeping grid-ies employed. They have everything an Ace Hardware should offer. From paint to making keys, this place is full service. They also sell decorations, lawn chairs, and snacks in case you want to get it all in one fell swoop!They offer free parking! Most places on the grid can't say that! They deserve extra stars just for that alone. One of those lovely grid gems that doesn't make you pay to shop at their establishments ;) Granted it might only be a quarter, but trying to find one elusive quarter takes a lot of time and effort most times!I know where I'm going when I need to pretend to be handy!
<review# 2081,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2013,3/1/2014,356,378,12,17,17>With my move back to Sac, I've also landed work near the cusp of Roseville and Rocklin. Tapioca joints are few and rare. There's Lollicup and Bambu. I've had Lollicup at other locations and the powdery aftertaste has tarnished my thoughts about trying it again even though the nearest Lollicup is only a mile away from work. Then there's Bambu of which I enjoy thanks to the Stockton Blvd location. With the wildly high ratings the Rocklin shop was getting, I had to go try it even if it's a little further away. I came over here during my lunch break just simply wanting a tapioca drink. Not in the mood for che that day. The young lady that took my jasmine milk tea order was super nice and got me my drink rather quickly since I was the only patron at that time. I loved my drink. The tea was freshly brewed and the tapioca was perfectly chewy. My only small concern was that she used the lid for che drinks (round top). Since my milk tea was just liquid and I was taking it to go, I was a little scared it was going to spill but I'm a safe and slow driver so luckily that didn't happen. I'm saving my star for another visit when I have the appetite for che. I'm sure it won't be long from now.
<review# 2082,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2013,2/28/2014,433,220,21,29,22>We picked up a couple of pizzas here for takeout and definitely got what we expected, which is a good thing. The staff were exceptionally professional and courteous on the phone and in person, this was more than I was expecting for an inexpensive pizza restaurant. Pizzas we tried:4 Quarters... $15 - Mozzarella, roasted pepper, artichoke, framani italian sausage, prosciutto di parma w/ tomato sauceGilda... $13 - Mozzarella, fontina, olives, red onion, garlic/parsley/anchovy persillade, does not come with sauceThe first thing I noticed was how fresh the ingredients tasted; as if they were pulled right from the garden, which they probably were. There wasn't a bunch of salt or sugar added so every ingredient was indentifiable. It's a good thing we ordered two, though, because the crust is VERY thin. I was popping slices down the hatch like a pelican. I can easily finish a whole pizza by myself, but with the quality ingredients and reduced carbage, at least I won't hate myself afterwards. I will return in approximately three weeks.
<review# 2083,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/11/2013,2/27/2014,489,900,24,27,23>Angry balls...angry balls and garlic parmesan bone-in wings and the spinach salad. I would consider driving alllllll the way down to Elk Grove from my homestead in Natomas for these fine offerings on Bull Wings' menu.Fellow Yelper Kali D, put together a great UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) in her neck of the woods, with help from BW's manager Robert. Even though it was billed as a 49er-game-watching gathering, I still showed up in my neon green Seahawks hoodie in hopes of seeing the Panthers deflate all the Niners fans around me (and the Niners lost, 10-9...ha!). But I digress...Our group was gathered on the patio, which turned out nicely because it was pretty darned toasty that day, not cold like we thought it would be. Two TVs set up with two different games was a nice touch. Also since we were on the patio, those in our group who smoked were pretty darn happy for the convenience. Thank goodness the winds were blowing the right way to take the smoke AWAY from us!Back to those angry balls (that's what she said)...take Angry Orchard cider and add cinnamon schnapps. Yummers! Damn fine drink, especially for those of us who don't like beer. Many folks in our party had multiples of that drink. As for the wings...awesome! You can get them bone-in or boneless, with a variety of sauces (I loooooved the garlic parmesan!), then you say how how hot, from mild to atomic, you want them (yeah, I'm a whitey wuss, so mild for me). They bring your wings out in one of those old-timey brown bowls (see my pics, you'll know what I mean), and when I was getting to the bottom of my bowl full o' garlic parm wings, there was a delicious pool of garlic-parm butter/oil that was good enough to drink. Ok, I didn't drink it, but I damn well soaked my remaing wing bites in it!Oh, and can't forget my spinach salad. I looove spinach salads, and this one is great. I got the dinner size, only $7, and added steak for $3. Now, truth be told, the steak is actually like ground beef, not sliced steak, just FYI. However, with the ton of meat, plus ton of bacon, plus ton of bleu cheese that was on this salad, I was a completely happy camper. Our main server, Ana, was cool and efficient and handled all of us well. She gave us all individual checks, and made sure we showed that we checked in on Yelp to receive our 20% off the food discount. Tip was also already added in, which I think is totally fair when you're handling a big party with separate checks. Kali said that Robert was a little nervous about hosting a group of Yelpers at his place. I personally wanted to write up this review to assuage his fears...fine job, sir! Great food and great staff. I don't know how often I'll get down to Elk Grove, but I would not be averse to another football-watching Yelp gathering at your place. And kudos, of course, to Kali for whipping this together. Thanks for introducing a lot of us to your little slice of your 'hood, woman! :) Plus, it's really just fun to say angry balls ;)
<review# 2084,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2013,2/26/2014,390,173,22,36,29>Many moons ago, I walked past Dawson's while staying at the Hyatt and thought what a nice place it would be to take a man for dinner. The dark panelling, discreet booths, and mostly older male employees just scream men's club. So when it came time to celebrate the BF's B-Day, I thought Dawson's would be a good fit.We took a seat in the elegant bar while we waited for our table. Peeking at the happy hour menu, I noticed several noshes available for half price. Birthday Boy scored a Sierra Nevada draft for $3. Loved that they serve up smokehouse almonds to munch at the bar (I proceeded to show my tackier side and carted my little dish of these to our table). Happy hour runs 4-6 M-F.It always impresses me when the chef sends out a complimentary amuse-bouche to start the meal. As a great sign of the quality of the food to come, this little skewer of moist, flavorful salmon whet our appetite for more.We started with an order of crab cakes. I'd seen a picture of these online and was skeptical of the celery root/orange salad that accompanied the cakes. What an amazingly fresh compliment it was, absolutely perfect. Deliciously crabby, not over-filled, they also had a smear of tarter sauce for dipping.As an avid pork chop lover, I was happy to hear that it came in second place for the top recommendations from our waiter. When I read the menu description that said "hazelnut finished", I thought it was going to have some type of crust. Admitting that this had been his assumption too, the waiter explained that it's actually a term for what they feed the pigs for the high quality meat. This was one premium chop! So tender, juicy, and packed with char-grilled flavor. I was happy to see that they left it just a little on the med-rare side. As so many others have noted, I went with truffle butter and a side of the red wine reduction sauce, only to find that the butter was all that was needed. I almost asked for an extra little dollop after tasting what a decadent flavor punch it added to the meat.The BF got the waiter's top pick, the bone-in ribeye. A carnivore's dream, this huge piece of meat was impressive laid out on that cast iron. He was kind enough to share a nibble and that was some perfectly cooked primo beef! I love that they get plenty of that impossible-to-recreate-at-home-unless-you-have-a-$­5000-BBQ char on the meat. We both commented on how happy our dogs were going to be with these bones.We decided that with the portion sizes of the pieces of meat we were ordering, all we really needed for a side was an order of the wild mushrooms to share. The sharing part was tough. These buttery, garlicy morsels were so delicious, I almost forgot who was having a special night and declared them all mine. If you make the mistake of offering to split, be sure to get the large size!  Since I mentioned the birthday in our reservation, they were kind enough to bring out a slice of decadent quadruple layer chocolate cake. With pretty chocolate curls and a raspberry swirl, it was the perfect sweet note to cap a fantastic meal.*Almost forgot to mention...they validate for parking in the garage at 12th & L.
<review# 2085,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/28/2013,2/25/2014,131,153,10,11,9>This mall is great as far as being huge and having lots of variety but there are a few cons:1. It's GHETTO! Every time I go there, some kid is getting arrested or getting chased down by security.2. The parking SUCKS! I literally have to keep circling around to find a parking spot, much less a decent one. If you're trying to find a parking spot around the holidays, forget about it. You'd have better luck walking to the mall because you would save way more time. Also, this isn't directly Arden's fault but I HATE having to drive over there. There is always sooo much traffic when I head to that direction from my house.I prefer the Galleria but realistically, it's too far of a drive for me to get out there. Sunrise Mall is closer but lacks a lot of stores, so it's Arden that I go to by default. In all fairness, though, Arden does meet my needs. It doesn't have every store known to mankind but it has the basics that I like -- Macy's, Nords, MAC, so, I can't complain too much.
<review# 2086,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/14/2013,2/24/2014,98,296,10,14,12>(From 9/5/13 visit)It was high time I washed the duvet...and a bunch of blankets...and there's no way all that stuff was gonna fit in a standard washing machine. So I looked up local laundromats and hey, sweet, Sudz Yer Dudz has great reviews AND a Yelp deal. Okay, we're doing this.Parking: a small, kinda cramped private lot that seems like an afterthought, but you're in East Sac now, where cars were an afterthought when the neighborhood was laid out.Inside: a good mix of regular top-load machines and several double- and triple-load machines. Round table at the front and a bar along the wall where you can charge your phone or plug in a laptop and do some work while you wait. They have wifi but I didn't use it. Clean, comfortable space. I kinda wish they had an arcade game in here, because there is something so fun and decadent about sipping on a Fanta Grape or some other noxious flavored soda, playing Ms Pacman or Centipede, while you do laundry.Service: excellent. I wish I'd gotten the name of the woman who was there when I came in, as she was very nice and patient with me while I redeemed the Yelp deal. I hadn't eaten much that day and had spent a few hours in a meeting before coming in, so my nerves were all jangly. I was rushing around buying laundry detergent - the one thing I'd forgotten to grab as I left home - and filling up machines. The man who took over later was also very friendly, and we joked about the giant dryer.Price: reasonable, especially when you consider that drying is free if you wash there. The giant dryer (free!) near the back is awesome - my queen-size duvet was dry in 20 minutes thanks to that huge dryer. Maybe I don't get out much, but I've never seen a dryer like this before. I have lived in apartments that were smaller than that thing.They also have fluff & fold service, and I saw several people picking up and dropping off items while I was there.Pro tip: if you forgot detergent, go to the Stop & Shop next door to buy some, rather than use up quarters buying 75 cent boxes of the powder stuff (which I detest). The detergent is along the back wall and they have several options.
<review# 2087,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/25/2013,2/23/2014,53,209,3,11,5>A promising store in the Arden area, this East Coast-based chain feels like a hybrid of Nugget and Trader Joe's.  Just a bit upscale, but still accessible, FM features some house-branded and bulk items, as well as mainstream brands and some more refined fare.  Produce looks good (of course, this is their first day!), while meat and seafood are only so-so in appearance, with the pork looking particularly forlorn and commodity-grade.  Wine selection is decent, though not stellar...should be more than enough for those weeknight bottle needs.  Cheese selection is fair, not as varied as TJ's or as extensive as nearby Whole Foods.  Prices seem OK overall, though some sale items were very well-priced.  Staff were quite friendly and helpful.  I should give them some props for supporting local producers: they offer Ruhstaller and Temple, although their "Local" section has products from Napa, Bay Area, etc.  I still give them points for the effort.  Moreover, they offer some brands seldom seen out here (Graeter's ice cream?  Hell yes!).I guess I was hoping for a somewhat better-curated selection, but for a nationwide chain they seem to do pretty well at both breadth and depth.  Should suffice for most regular grocery needs, and a definite step up from the nearby Safeway.  While FM will do nothing to supplant the niches which Sunh, Corti's, Taylor's, and the Co-op have in my foodie world, they will likely be a semi-regular stop.  To watch with interest.
<review# 2088,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/10/2013,2/22/2014,178,194,7,15,9>Watch out Y'all, there's a new jerk in town! I'd be lying if I didn't say I've been waiting for this place to open up, and lucky for me, I just happened to be in the neighborhood for lunch when they did! I guess this used to be a Merlino's freeze, so there is no dining room. You walk up and order from the window, and they have about 4 tables and 5 or 6 bar stools you can sit at. The tables are the perfect spot for lunch on a nice fall afternoon! Got the half chicken meal, which came with two sides. The sides were pretty decent (Mac and cheese, and rice and peas), but I came here for the chicken, and it did not disappoint!  They let me get half fried chicken and half jerk chicken, and both were tender, juicy, and delicious!The fried chicken had a light crisp to it, and although it seemed like it was only lightly seasoned, something about it is absolutely delicious, and I found myself wanting more of it  as soon it was gone. The Jerk chicken was also super tender, and had a really good seasoning on it. I got half way through the jerk chicken before I even realized there was a side of the actual jerk sauce. WOW! This is my favorite jerk sauce in town! Next time I'm getting a few extra sides of the sauce!
<review# 2089,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/20/2011,9/17/2011,354,195,11,6,9>I haven't flown anywhere in about 10 years and when I did fly it was always with family who was in charge of everything, nothing for my little self to worry about, I could just sit back and not worry about anything except when the peanuts would arrive. Now that I'm older I'm expected to be an adult and be competent enough to do these things on my own but guess what, I tend to get a little anxious when doing things that Im not used to doing and start to panic if I feel things are going wrong. So this morning when traveling to San Diego all by my lonesome I was expected to know what to do. I would like to think the easy layout of Sacramento International Airport had something to do with the ease of my trip.I got to the airport early, like an hour and a half early, which is a side effect of being a worry wart. It was easy to follow which terminal I was supposed to go to and as soon as I was dropped off I saw right out front was where I was supposed to check my huge luggage off at. I also received my boarding pass there. (however I didnt know thats what it was) After I checked in my bag I walked inside and saw another South West Airlines line and thought, "Am I supposed to wait in that line too?" I felt really dumb standing there not really knowing what to do but to my surprise a man looked at my scrunched face and asked me if I needed help. He let me know that I already had my boarding pass and I was good to go through security. Standing in the line I was surprised at how fast it went with all the people in it. However I didn't know I was supposed to take off my shoes. IKK! I stood in the bare carpet hoping that these people were smart enough to disinfect the carpet area  where many other barefooted people once stood before me. After check in I went straight to my boarding area to "check-in" I thought they needed to know I was here! But no they didn't, however she did recommend me to the nearest sports bar where I would be able to ease my pre-flight jitters. I went to a sports bar at 7:30am and ordered a Jack and Coke. I felt a little horrid ordering a hard drink so early in the morning and sorta whispered it to the bartender, however he put me right as ease by not hesitating to ask in return "Want to make it a double?"yeah...yeah I do!I boarded 10 min before the flight was going to take off due to the fact that I thought you were supposed to board at the time written on your ticket. Luckily I noticed that my area was less crowded then earlier and had the sense to ask. Yes, I was supposed to board the plane now.So thank you to all the people who helped this sheltered little girl fly off to have a great vacation.See you next week SIAP!
<review# 2090,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2011,9/16/2011,25,252,9,7,23>I will tell you the mushy, lovie dovie story first then move on to the actual establishment part of the story.  Every year my mom and I visit my Great Great Aunt(now around 85 years old) in Las Vegas.  Every year she would tell us a story about back in the 70's how her and my GG Uncle owned a bar in Sacramento.  She would always say she highly doubts it is still around.  It was called the L & H Club.  She told such detailed stories about it how she would be the cocktail waitress and Uncle Ernie was a kick @ss bartender.  She would talk about fights, about the locals, about a guy who came in the bar with a loaded gun to shoot my Uncle for 86in him(I think he actually fired a round), also about the OOOLD wooden bar with some weird English quote above the bar and how everyday she would make happy hour food from scratch. FROM SCRATCH!!!  I got to tell you this was highly enjoyable stuff to hear.  Anyway over the next couple years I gathered enough information about it to try and track down at least the building if it wasnt a bar anymore.  She couldnt remember a whole bunch about location.  She just remembered it was on Folsom blvd, right on the street and kind of in a little strip shopping area.  I did some searching via going drinking around town and used yelp..................................................I walked into this place one day with my buddy.  I had a good feeling.  It was long and narrow liked she mentioned.  It was in a small strip mall and right on the street.  Talked to the bartender and YESSSSSS, this was the place.  The bartender was super cool telling me about the bar back then.  They remodeled the bar and it looks REALLY nice BUT kept the old wooden bar with the quote up above the bar.  Very nice, little sports bar.  We watched a game and had a couple drinks.  I was happy.  I played a couple songs on the jukebox and then took pictures and videos.  It doesnt look like much on the outside, but REALLY nice on the inside.This year I went back to see my GG Aunt and showed her the videos/pictures.  She got all teared up and gave me the biggest hug(RIP Uncle Ernie).  Funny thing is she ended up finding some old pictures which showed that wooden bar with the quote.  Pretty cool.Anyway, besides all the mushy gushy stuff this place is super cool especially to go watch any kind of sporting event.  I shall come to this place for now on.
<review# 2091,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2011,9/15/2011,211,129,5,9,8>Pho Le Pho' Me please!I came here yesterday with my boyfriend and niece and nephew for the first time and was pretty much blown away.Service: I just HAD to give this place 5 stars because of the OUTSTANDING service we all received. We not only had one waitress that tended to us, we had all 4! They each took their turn to refilled our waters and asked how everything was going. My nephew was consuming his water like a beast so they refilled it as soon as it was low. They all smiled at us and was super warm and friendly.Food: BIG portions! I had the pork chop rice plate and it was humungo! They did not go stingy on the pork chops at all. It was cooked perfectly, not dry and was flavorful. My niece ordered the seafood noodle soup and her bowl was so big she could sit in it. Decor: The decor of this restaurant was fabulous. Modern and contemporary! I would actually decorate my dining room like this! I would most definitely come back as a regular here. They knew exactly which spot to tickle me and how to lure me back. Great service will do it! I mentioned FACEBOOK to our waitress and got 20% off our bill, as per a tip from Tina N.
<review# 2092,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/20/2011,9/14/2011,352,248,7,9,12>Mel's Diner was the after party food spot after the shenanigans from a birthday celebration at Boxing Donkey. The place has a 50's decor which is pretty cool but the younger people would have to google that era now. We were greeted and seated with no problems even though the place was a little busy. I ordered the Wolfman Jack breakfast special. * Side Note( Wolfman jack used to host a show called midnight special this was before Friday night videos- google it) ok end of side note* The service was fast and my food was hot. My eggs were not overcooked and brown. The pancakes were fluffy. I must say the food was pretty good. I am a huge IHOP fan so this is a step below IHOP but a Major step above Denny's or Waffle House. We pumped plenty of quarters on our table mini jukebox to listen to some blasts from the past. Overall  good food at a decent price but hey you really can't mess up breakfast food.
<review# 2093,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2011,9/13/2011,209,356,4,9,8>I've been coming here lately for breakfast and I must say, it REALLY hits the spot. Whether you're hungover or just need something nice and solid in your stomach, Cafe Roma's breakfast is your morning break destination.I get the two egg breakfast (scrambled), with fried house potatoes, sausage, and toast. It's like $6, but so worth it and they give you a pretty heapin' helping of yum. They put pepper and a few other herbs/spices in their scrambled eggs so they're just like mom made them. The sausage isn't a patty or teeny weenie, it's a proper Italian sausage, cut in half and browned. It's similar to a traditional breakfast you'd see at Waffle Square, Denny's, or Lyon's, but tastier.They make it when you order it, so if you're in a rush you should call ahead. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to finish my breakfast.
<review# 2094,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/15/2011,9/12/2011,112,134,9,23,12>To fully appreciate Fuji, you have to be in-the-know.  They have a secret menu of sorts, and unlike In-N-Out's "secret" menu that is plastered all over the internet, Fuji's is truly secret. When you go to Fuji's, keep your eyes and ears open for new dishes you may not have heard about. Knowing what to order is only one piece of the puzzle. The other is to be aggressive. The people popping in and out of the kitchen don't greet you with a smile and ask what you like. They quickly avert their eyes and dive back into depths where unknown goodness happens, not unlike leprechauns hoarding the gold for themselves.With these facts in mind, here's what you do to have a good time at Fuji's:1. Ignore the boats2. Wait patiently at one of the ends near the kitchen and attempt to make eye contact with one of the sushi chefs or cooks.3. Fail to make eye contact and shamelessly belt out an "EXCUSE ME!" and make your order.4. Enjoy!Here's my go-to list of things to order:1. Soft-shell crab: a lightly breaded and deep-fried soft shelled crab2. Fried oysters: small oysters prepared in the same manner3. Seared salmon: sliced salmon sashimi seared in a light sauce4. Sashimi: get this "mixed" to try each fish, or order the specific fish you like5. Salmon skin hand-roll: what it sounds like6. Spicy ninja roll: didn't pay attention to what's in it. I liked it though!7. Fresh shucked oysters8. Hamachi kama: grilled yellowtail collarThings I pull from the table ends:1. Cucumber salad2. Seaweed salad3. Fried bananas4. Fried sesame ballsGo for lunch for the best value. It's about $13 including tax. Dinner adds a few trivial things that I don't care much about. I also find that lunch tends to be fresher and tastier than dinner.Sure, Fuji's service isn't the best. The crowds you must wade through to get your food can wear you down. But this level of food at this price makes it my favorite sushi place to eat without abandon.
<review# 2095,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/21/2011,9/11/2011,193,225,17,13,17>This was my first yelp event and it was AWESOME.Being a complete swag whore, I got a yelp pen, bag, and a yelp bottle opener. Hells yes.Being kind of shy I didn't get to meet many yelpers but I did recognize a few. I dressed as the Freddy Krueger cowboy, but my mask was too hot to keep on for most of the night. I kinda over did it on the costume but like I said it was my first yelp event and I wanted to have fun.The casino was awesome except that I lost 40 bucks, not including the free chips. That wasn't awesome at all.However everything else was. There were super friendly servers just handing out loads of food. I had these little pulled pork sandwiches, some meat on stick that had a good flavor I can not identify, and a bunch of fried stuff. The fried green beans here are off the hizzle.The only free beer on tap was Olympia and it was okay. They did have a ton of happy hour free specials and three types of Bacardi samples to try. I was happy buzzed on beer and Bacardi for over 2 hours.There was a band, and except for the blaring feedback at the beginning they were pretty cool. It's not every day that a black man gets to hear a banjo and feel completely comfortable.At the end of the night, when I was near unconscious between shopping for my costume and the fun,  Michelangelo S. came up to me and took a picture of us both. It should be floating somewhere around here. I wish I recognized him right away, I should have. It was a lot of fun. I definitely had a blast, and I'd be more than happy to go again. I also don't have to shop for a costume for halloween. Seeing how much I detest shopping, this was a double win. Thanks Yelp and thanks everyone!
<review# 2096,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2011,9/10/2011,1059,313,17,18,16>I drive by this place all the time and I always tell myself that some day I will stop and try it out. Today at lunch time I was not even in the area and this place came to mind. I had no idea what I wanted and no idea what they sold although I knew it was a vegetarian place.  I just wanted to try it. Well let me tell you that there will be no more of that driving past this place nonsense anymore. I looked at the menu and wondered what any of that stuff would taste like. The falafel looked like something I could try and if it wasn't all that then I could at least rely on the pesto pasta salad I ordered on the side. It took about 15 minutes, so in the meantime I people watched. There were quite a few customers there. Some came in after a bike ride, some with their dogs, some walked and others drove. There is a pretty cool sitting area on the side and some benches too. This place was non stop taking orders the entire time I was there and so besides being hungry I waited for my falafel with anticipation. "Order 73" I heard over the loud speaker. I WON, I WON!!! I took it to go because I was running out of time. I opened it in my car and I am telling you that I heard angels singing in the background. This was a monster, a beautiful monster. Cucumber, bean sprouts, yogurt sauce, garbanzo patty and the wrap.  I took my first bite and I was in heaven. I was immediately in love. This falafel and I are exclusive now. I will not eat another falafel anywhere else. I don't care if anyone else makes it better or worse. I will not cheat on my Sunflower falafel. I had a difficult time eating this neatly in my car but after the first bite there was no way I was going to wait and eat it at my destination. I will definitely be seeing "my love" on a regular basis.

Decent portions and they have a LONG list of sushi rolls (in order from cheapest to most expensive) All rolls are pretty sauced up but that's ok, I'm not mad at it! From history, their salads are quite tasty but a little bit on the spicy side, they load it up with tons of sashimi too! I reccomend ordering:-Spicy Babies-Red Ninja-Rhonda SpecialAs for drinking special... har har har where do we start?Tuesdays are .99 cent sake bombs all day, Thursdays are buy 1 roll get 1 free, Friday nights are .99 cent sake bombs after 5pm (each person must order food)You will get slizzard whether or not you want to, especially if you're with a group of good peer pressuring friends. And if it's your birthday, you are sure to get butt wild drunk. Be like NIKE, just do it! The owner/manager's name is Julian and he is a party animal alone! He will want you to have fun/get your drink on, and especially if it's your birthday, he'll make sure you're drinking your butt off.So make sure you have a DD, no buzzkill's please.
<review# 2098,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/19/2011,9/8/2011,291,553,10,16,13>I've been to Elk Grove Tofu House several times now and each time, it's been busier and busier. I'm happy for the restaurant; but a part of me is sad that I now have to wait for a table. Still, it was only a 5 minute wait when I went this last Friday for my birthday. The four of us sat down and were given menus (they are now laminated instead of just paper!)  We quickly decided on what we wanted, and when the waitress brought over our waters, we ordered. Our dinner consisted of:-Side dishes (free): bean sprouts, tofu with sesame oil, Kim chi, brocolli, glass noodles, and some other dishes that I am unfamiliar with, but were tasty.-Seafood pancake ($12.99) very large, comes with about 15 pieces. A pan fried, seafood filled, chewy and crispy pancake. It comes with a soy-vinegar dipping sauce that is delicious. All of us really enjoyed this dish. We also ordered two combination dinners to share between the four of us. Each comes with a barbecue dish and a soon tofu (tofu soup) dish as well. -Beef bulgolgi ($15.99): it comes out on a sizzling plate and there is a bed of cabbage beneath (which is also tasty). There is a lot of meat and it's very tender and flavorful. -Pork bulgolgi ($14.99): also very tender. The pork has a little more fat and juiciness than the beef. It was also really tasty and the portion is equally large.-Orginal tofu soup #1 (free with combination dinner): we ordered one beef and one pork tofu soup and both were great. We ordered a medium and mild and they both had just the right amount of spice to them. The tofu is plentiful and it is very soft. Eating this dish with rice is just amazing. The servers are pretty attentive here, even when the restaurant is filled. They are primarily younger teenager/20-something-year-olds and use very casual language and even slang when talking to you, but that's fine by me!  They refilled our waters several times and even refilled our free side dishes for us. They ran out of some that we particularly liked and we were even given a new dish that was just prepared. I also appreciated that they brought each of us a bowl of rice, even though only two combination dinners were ordered. Overall, this is a solid restaurant for some tasty Korean food. This is about 20 minutes away from me, but its still closer than Oz. Also, it's significantly cheaper; I'll be back again soon. Notes:-The seafood pancake is delicious. You can even ask them to fry it with kim chi for a different spin. -They have a large parking lot. -They don't do anything for birthdays. Oh well.
<review# 2099,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/14/2013,11/10/2013,210,713,8,11,10>I'm not a big fan of their food truck- Wicked 'Wich; even so I wanted to come here specifically for the Banh Mi fries. The restaurant/bar is located on the edge of West Sac near downtown. It is nondescript and it's dark inside. We seated ourselves and a waitress came by with our menu. Service was great. She would periodically see how we were doing. Banh Mi Fries (topped with slow roasted pulled pork, pickled vegetables, jalapeños & house made citrus caramel sauce): Genius! The half order was more than enough for 2 people to share. The fries were full of flavor. The fries on the bottom had too much sauce though. Bacon Mac & Cheese- The best mac & cheese ever! It's grilled which made a crispy top. Bleu, gruyere, aged white & cheddar cheeses with parmesan on top- so much cheese! Applewood smoked bacon within made the mac & cheese smoky and full of flavor. A strip of rolled up crispy bacon sat on top. On the bottom sat a small pile of arugula, maybe it's used to soak up the grease. Flank Steak Salad (iceberg lettuce & locally sourced vegetables, topped with Naked Fries and onion strings, boiled egg, cheddar cheese, & marinated flank steak): I asked for balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the side. The steak was already well marinated and full of flavor, so I didn't even end up using the dressing. I ordered the salad in order to balance my meal, but it wasn't the healthiest salad with the fries and onion strings. I really enjoyed the salad though, and a half order was a generous amount. I'm glad I didn't suffer from cardiac arrest after eating such a heavy meal, but I made a mental note to myself that I must run to make up for the meal. *Check in on facebook and save 10%- Mondays & Tuesdays (Darn, I didn't know until after the fact.)
<review# 2100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/1/2013,11/9/2013,337,422,12,14,14>Urban farming...who knew??I sure as hell didn't! My first experience, and hopefully not my last, was while volunteering at the Autumn Equinox Celebration a few weekends ago. I generally associate Hurley avenue with The Kitchen, the street to the mall, the movie theaters, a bunch of random big box stores/shops...not where I'd find a hidden oasis of urban farming!I can't really review the farming situation, because what I saw was a decked out landscape of food tasting, booze drinking, social responsible being group of people who were supporting an underground culture of urban farming.A friend asked if I'd like to volunteer at this event. Sure, I don't mind donating my services to a good cause. This BY FAR is the most underrated event in Sacramento. I almost don't want to yelp about it, so it stays cool and awesome - but they do cap it off, so get in where you fit in.Every good eatery on the grid and in the Handle district is here. Even some of the good spots off of the grid were here too. There was plenty of food for everyone and booze, no short supply of anything. Unlike most events, IF you even had to wait in a line, it was less than five minutes. The whole event was also "no waste"! For those of you who don't speak hippie, this means no trash was created - we used mini wine glasses, plastic plates, and silverware. The vendors generally just plated everything on your plate, with the exception of a few vendors. Those that did use a serving dish, were made of bamboo or something hippieish of the sorts.After volunteering and consuming their food and booze (this was okayed by the volunteer lead), I realized that I want to volunteer at their actual farm in Rancho Cordova. This event made me want to volunteer my time to their efforts, it is a great non-profit. Everyone was so warm and inviting, and genuinely nice - from the staffers, the other volunteers, the vendors, and the celebrators, not one person had a bad attitude. I am now a believer...I'm ready to get down on some urban farming!
<review# 2101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2013,11/8/2013,569,79,12,19,18>Ordered the Cuban Caesar with Chicken. I told the woman at the register that I was diabetic, she asked what type, I said TWO, she said, "Get the Cuban Caesar with Chicken and no Croutons!"   I agreed!I watch the kitchen crew assemble my order. One was adding the ingredients to a large salad bowl, then proceeded to toss it. Another was grilling my chicken while yet another guy prepared my salad container, fork and napkins. This was all happening while Joelle, the woman at the register was shaking her fist in the air as if she was rockin out at a rock concert.  She was obviously happy, upbeat and expressing herself. I smiled at her. The salad tasted fresh and full of flavor with chunks of garlic and cheese. Reminded me of a great Italian vinaigrette dressing. The chicken was marinaded in some herby stuff and tasted just as wonderful.  It was also served hot. The only drawback would be wilted lettuce if you take it to go, so suck it up and grab a table and people watch as you grub on this magnificent creation of a salad. 5 Stars for a great salad when eating there and NOT taking it to go. Simply Wonderful!!!
<review# 2102,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/3/2013,11/7/2013,144,58,14,23,14>My family has been coming here for years! The cakes are always tasty and consistent. It's not too sweet and not to spongy. The fruit filling is always fresh and full. My family is crazy about the green coconut cake. The prices are very good in my opinion. (I think it was only $25 for a quarter sheet of the coconut cake) I like how you can call in the morning and still place an order for a cake for pick up that same day. So why did I give them 3 stars and not 5 stars? -Customer service really lacks here because there is none. I've never seen the lady(who works in the front/might be the owner) smile, EVER. And I've been coming here since I was a kid! -Almost 85% of the time my cake is not ready when I show up. (It's super annoying because they are not friendly, the bakery is uncomfortable to sit and wait at, the temperature there for some reason is always really warm and it's always more than a 5 minute wait) -And I think they have no idea what the color "purple" is. On three separate occasions, I asked for purple trim/flowers on the cake and when I arrived, my cake was pink. Did they fix it? Yes, but I had to wait of course. I was so irritated with this problem, I learned how to say "purple" in Chinese. "Chee-seck" for all you who like purple, you're welcome.-They are CASH only So when you come here, add additional wait time, prepare yourself and be patient. I have to tell myself that every time because that damn Coconut Cake is really worth it.

They are professional, easy to chat with, and know the tricks to making a tan look natural and not oompa-loompa like.  I also love that they store your formula (the darkness level of the solution) to your profile for future visits.  Like most Americans, I love the instant gratification of looking like I have been sun-kissed.   R U Tan also offers hydro therapy, UV beds, and mystic/versa-type spray tanning booths, but I'll stick to airbrushing because of the ability to customize your tan.   The cost is $35 per air brush tan.  I usually purchase two tans at $45, so basically you save $25 bucks.

Tiramisu, cannolis, biscotti, lobster tails &  colorful mini cakes and then some.Stopped by on a weekday rnd 3pm--Bakery was fully stocked! Browsed for 5 minutes, everything looked delectable, I didn't know what I wanted. Ended up asking the guy behind the counter for the most popular cakes/pastries. Champagne cake, he said.  Ordered that w/ a cannoli on the side. Paid, then stuffed my face when I got home. Both were delicious and not too sweet. Prices were reasonable, I think I paid 5 something for both? Not bad, not bad. Service could have been more friendlier & helpful (I didn't even get a 'hello' when I walked in and I was the only person there). But anywhoozies, would I come here again? Of course! I have a sweet tooth that I need to keep satisified ;D I definitely want to try their tiramisu next!
<review# 2105,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2013,11/4/2013,129,149,9,17,12>I loved every part of my experience here. I was expecting a casual, cafe-style, nothing fancy, nothing crazy, kind of place. That's exactly what I got and I was very pleased that my expectations were met. The place is small and nothing special to look at, but clean, simple modern look, with some Turkish flair (paintings, tiles, etc.). We were greeted and seated immediately, and handed menus. Everyone there seemed to really be enjoying themselves, so that immediately started the experience off well. The staff was buzzing around, making sure we had water, keeping everything SO clean, and turning tables efficiently. I think they could really benefit from providing a more proper menu and not a pamphlet with pictures. I mean, I can understand the photos simply because Turkish food is not easy to come by and most people are probably not familiar with it, but it can be kind of tacky, as can the 'pamphlet' style of it. But the look of the menu is literally the only bad thing I can say about them!I ordered the kebab sampler, which was pricey at $18, but it really was a HUGE sample plate of four different kinds of kebabs. I don't normally like lamb, but the lamb kebabs were so good! Exotic spices, different cooking methods, Mmm Mmmm Mmm! The entree was served with rice, pickled vegetables, yogurt sauce, etc. The "sandwiches" were all under $10, which is more than reasonable (and they're big!).I plan to make several more appearances here, I just really loved the food and our wonderfully friendly server! Yay new restaurants! Yay new cultural foods! Check this place out, you will love it!
<review# 2106,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2013,11/3/2013,317,342,12,21,17>The Greenhaven/Pocket area is not one of the most robust spots in Sacramento.  But it is my old hood, and I was saddened when Las Casuelas closed.  My sadness changed to intrigue when I walked past it one day to see Pocket Bistro installed, but I kept putting it off to try it.Came in with a large group of friends for a CYE, and I had a grand time.  I really hope the other folks that attended that normally would not have gone to Pocket Bistro will join me and come back, because the service was exceptional considering we were rolling what looked like 30 deep.  MUST HAVES: Clam chowder, garlic fries, chicken picatta, prime rib, creme brulee.  The clam chowder was dare I say among best in Sacramento.  Served in a large square "bowl", creamy, smokey bacon, and a crostini.  Garlic fries were not your run of the mill garlic fries that gets the garlic and parsley on your fingers.  The garlic was coated with something because it was slightly crunchy and made up for what looked like plain fries.  They were flat out great!  Prime rib was really good, but only served on Thursdays and Saturdays.  My disappointment was I order mine medium, and it came cooked medium well.  Some of my fellow dining companions ordered their meat medium rare and it was served medium.  I don't know because of the demand at 7:30, but keep that in mind.  Creme brulee was really good with the carmelized top and served with berries.  Chicken picatta was a great dish served with a delectable sauce, not overly fried and tender.Great job by the staff, and they have what appears to be a good happy hour menu and serve fried chicken on Mondays.  This could be THE spot to watch Monday Night Football this year for me!
<review# 2107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2013,11/2/2013,466,199,12,19,13>Vegan food. Ah... makes you feel hungry just reading it, doesn't it? I didn't think so.But lo' and behold, The Plum Cafe is plumb delicious!The AYCE brunch buffet fills all my brunch needs. My recent meal included pancakes, french toast, cookies, muffins, fresh fruit, salad bar, biscuits and gravy, tofu scramble, and an Indian-spiced bean and tofu mixture. All legitimately delicious, vegan or no.The tempeh reuben is positively addicting. Word to the wise - don't get it to go, as this sandwich needs immediate consumption or else you'll end up with soggy bread. And then there are the desserts.  Vegan desserts used to mean dry cookies with funky-tasting carob chips. Or, even worse, weird moist green cakes with coconut shavings, typically served by hairy women at music festivals. Believe me, it used to be pretty tough out there for the poor vegans. The Plum Cafe kills those ghosts of vegan-desserts past and offers a unique dessert option for midtown. Giant cookie sandwiches with cream in the middle! And they are not just good or passable, they are amazing! The Whoopie Pie is my personal favorite: two chocolate cake cookies with cream sandwiched in between. Whoopie!!!
<review# 2108,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/22/2013,11/1/2013,202,116,16,37,18>Ok, so this was my third visit. The first time I went, I felt special for being at the acclaimed Kitchen Restaurant. So of course, I got overly excited about everything: Wow, white glove tea service - Chamomile tea served by a guy with white gloves on! I am special! Oh, real wasabi, not that fake horseradish-with-green-dye-added-garbage; no I only eat real wasabi! I am special! Ooh, truffle oil flown in from Barcelona! Is that a good place to get truffle oil? I don't know, but I am special! I can walk in the back of the restaurant where some guy is doing the dishes - not sure why I want to do that, but I love that I can. I am special!But now that the initial allure has worn, it's time to look at this place objectively. I came on a special occasion after two positive experiences with Chef Noah at the helm. So how did this experience stack up?NEW CHEF JOHN GRIFFITHS: He's very nice, came and talked to us personally about our special requests, and described the menu (his first one) competently during his initial presentation. It did feel a little like the big presentation and playbill theme were forced and didn't completely gel with his personality. He does not have the same flair or big personality that Noah had, and no hugs at the door as we left or anything like that, so it's a little more low key.  FOOD: [July menu] The food was 4/5 stars. The Roasted Sweet Corn Soup with a Soft-Poached Egg, Halibut, and Seafood Pasta were very good, as was the Panna Cotta. The dessert chef talked smack about other panna cottas, like how they come from jell-o molds and tremble like a frightened animal - that was funny. My only substitution was snapper for the lamb course (the lamb looked almost raw by the way).ISSUE: The portions seemed to have dwindled dramatically. During my two previous experiences here, it was like a feast - I got puffed up and almost had to be carried out in a wheelbarrow! This time, not so much. My fish main course was three or four bites of fish at best - probably just a few ounces. The sushi course, which used to be about the best sushi situation in Sac, is now much more limited. Rolls are tiny and razor thin. I tried to go back for seconds, and everything was gone.The biggest problem is that the meal takes place over about 4 hours! And of course I didn't come to a dinner like this full. So I was served a small portion, and then had to endure the 20+ minute gaps between courses. At a certain point, all I wanted to do was eat! The garlic bread was incredible, but I didn't come to fill up on bread.WINE: Interesting wines that paired well with each course as expected. I recommend splitting a wine flight, as the pours are generous.PRICE: Everyone knows it's expensive. Dinner for two, splitting a wine flight, on a weekday, is around $460 (I forget the exact figure). That's about 4 meals at Ella, Mulvaney's, the Firehouse or another similar spot. So it should be an incredible, memorable feastlike experience! The best part of my meal with sharing it with Danielle O., which I know is very sweet, but honest for these prices, the best part of the meal should be the food! (just kidding Danielle O.)OVERALL: The portions have shrunk, and for some reason, it just didn't have the wow factor that it used to - and I really don't think it was just because I've been before. Taking into account price and portion size, I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars. The service is friendly and professional, the atmosphere is intimate, and the food is very good overall. Still one of Sac's best restaurants, but it'll be awhile before I return.

<review# 2112,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/25/2007,12/9/2007,578,1891,1,12,8>"Sacramento Hmong new year celebrations is all about delicious food, live music and various sports activities. It's just the perfect time to have fun, meet new people and time to wear traditional black dress with fluorescent pink, green and yellow beading adorned by dozens of dangling aluminum coins producing a steady jingling sound throughout the fairgrounds. The new year's celebration provides ground for Hmong's to meet their friends, family and celebrate the new year with a lavish spread of dinner. The main highlight of the Sacramento Hmong new year Festival is the convention of playing traditional "toss-ball" game which aims at throwing a ball back and forth to know people. The festival is usually pre dominated by live dance performances, talent contests and music with more than thousand visitors enjoying the lively event every year. It is perpetually a time for celebration and joy. Traditional Sacramento Hmong new year is celebrated with the beginning of the lunar-based Hmong calendar which marks the completion of their harvest season. It's also the time to ponder on mouth watering delicious food prepared extensively by the women folk of the house. Sacramento Hmong new year carnival highlights particularly on the rich inherent traditions and cultures, rebirth and rejuvenation."I like learning about different cultures AND appreciating new foods. This event fulfilled both of those things. It was interesting to learn about the Hmong people and their customs, but more importantly- being able to try their delicious food! The food has heavy influences from Southeast Asia (Laos, Thailand, China, and Vietnam).There were over 30 vendors selling mostly the same items. Warning: it is very smoky from all the barbeque pits.I tried papaya salad (Lao style), grilled chicken, grilled pork (really really cripsy skin) with sticky rice (the more purple- the better), kapoon/khao poon (rice noodle soup with chicken in a coconut -based broth), and fried bananas. They were ALL extremely tasty. I also saw that other popular dishes were fish steamed in leaves, fried fish, and grilled sausages (either American or Hmong style) with sticky rice, pho, and larb.
<review# 2113,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2007,12/8/2007,22,39,4,3,3>I like this place.  There's just something about this place that makes me feel like giving it 4 bright and shiny stars.  I really like the potato pancakes (Czech and Bohemian), pizza and beer (although not all together).  The goulash is okay.  The brusceta was not quite what I was expecting.  It was on the same soft bread which is quite nice for the dumplings, not so much so for brusceta.  Service is nice and friendly, but can be slow at times.  The atmosphere is nice too.  But on occasion families with their kids or hungry drunks from next door (Bonn Lair) can cause a bit of a ruckus.  My current situation links me to the former, but I look forward to again being part of the latter.I guess the bottom line is that you can easily have a 4+ star experience here, but if the stars do not align in your favor you might just end up with a troika.

Maybe because the fact that I wanted to eat my Mochii Yogurt first. Ok lets talk about Shoki Ramen House.I never knew such a place ever existed. I am so grateful for yelp to help discover this place, and of course the first yelper who found it. I would like to also state that finally, Eddokos, is now one down from this place. Shoki, you're my next best friend in the Ramen business.  I had to really try this out. Even on a summer day I was drooling for some ramen. I mean I could have just opened a .10cent package of Top Ramen but NO, I needed something better. The place is quite small, and don't intend to bring a party more than 10 people, you'd actually be renting the whole entire restaurant. Yep, its that small. I ordered something simple, I did not want to sit there with a burnt mouth scarfing down the spicy tantan men ramen, so I chose the Shouyu Ramen Set + C.  The C set came with this small bowl of rice and lil small fish on top, avocado, and sesame seeds. Very tasty, and easy to prepare. The small bowl came out first, but I didn't touch it until the Ramen Arrived.The ramen, set into a Regular Bowl, was your typical ramen. The noodles were of course much more fresher and better than Eddokos: Not too soggy, or not too hard, it was just right. The broth that I had ordered, the shoyu, was golden brown, and less cloudy than Eddokos. The vegetables will always be vegetables, never different. But the PORK. OH man, the PORK...was not dry. It was a good enough slice for the meal. But, unfortunately, I was expecting a full bowl rather than a half. I spent $12, the meal was actually $9.95. I love the environment. I love the staff. Thank god they're japanese. Although it may be just ramen, I still would love it as much Japanese as it can be. I might be going here more often "PHO" an alternative for soup. If you get what I mean.Alllllllllright!!  I love this place!!
<review# 2115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/30/2007,12/4/2007,24,116,1,7,3>A solid 4.5. The comparison is inevitable, so I'll just get it out of the way. Mulvaney's is better than The Waterboy. In almost every aspect. Let's go into the dishes first.-an amuse of duck confit over endive. the confit tasted a little funky. a bit too "duck-ish" if you know what I mean. made me glad I didn't go with the duck.  -started with the smoked salmon plate. the salmon itself was delicious, clean tasting (not over smoked), and rich. accompanied by the infamous brown bread and the usual capers, what seemed to be hard boiled egg crumbles, onions, and cream cheese. I actually wondered out loud why I don't eat smoked salmon more often while wolfing this dish down. -gnocchi with gorgonzola and pine nuts. this was the second best gnocchi I've ever had, only falling short of the gnocchi at Casanova in Carmel (of which there can really be no gnocchi greater...honestly, it was the perfect gnocchi). This was still damn good gnocchi. The sauce was rich and complemented the light texture of the gnocchi quite well. And thus begins the direct comparison to the Waterboy, it was much better than the gnocchi I have had there. - For entrees we had the Bledsoe Pork Chop w/ whipped potatoes, arugula, and fennel and the braised lamb shoulder. While my lamb was quite good, if a bit undersalted, it was surpassed in every way by the Pork Chop. There was a complexity to the flavor of the Pork that I could not believe and was easily the best Pork Chop I have ever had at any restaurant. This would include Masque, Enotria, Downtown in Berkeley, amongst others. - had the ding dong for dessert. it was chocolatey and delicious, but not as interesting as the flavors that had preceded it. better in idea than execution. The serviceGot to give it up to my man Andrew W. for an incredible night's work. There were a couple of big tables last night, but he did not miss a beat. He even knew that our table was wobbly and fixed it for us without us saying anything. As others have said, the staff is extremely knowledgable about the food, the wine, and you can tell that they enjoy the stuff as much as you do. This is definitely where Mulvaney's exceeds the Waterboy most clearly. I've had waiters who were simply absent for too long, were snobby, or just completely disinterested at my various visits to T.W. I'd put the service here, not only into the Mason's category, but up one on that establishment. It's somehow, less formal and more formal at the same time, if that makes any sense. Plus Andrew looks a bit like Seth Rogen. Which is excellent in and of itself. The Wine - lucked out on a bottle of Emeritus pinot after my initial syrah was out of stock. The wine is a bit pricey. Not too much under the 40 dollar range. But our selection was fantastic. the wine list is rather brief and not quite as deep as one might hope, but not so much so that you're going to wonder about the corkage fee. you can leave the bottles at home. the cheese- at the very end of the night, we were offered a bit of ewe's milk cheese on a cracker. it was described by andrew as tasting like "the entire barnyard". folks, when someone tells you that something tastes like "the entire barnyard", take them on their word. I've never been one to shy away from funky cheese, but this stuff made limburger look like the glenn miller band to it's parliament funkadelic funk of a taste. literally, i felt like i had a sheep in my mouth after consuming it. I took it all in good humor though, as it's one of those experiences I'm glad to have had. but good lord, know what you are in for if this cheese gets put in front of you. OVERALLGreat restaurant. Great service. You'll find some low and flat points in the meal itself that will be made worth it by when this restaurant really nails something. Because when it does, it's pretty spectacular.

The kind of place where you can meet the oldest prostitute in Northern California, who claims that all her problems stem from people being jealous of the fact that she is from Hollywood. The kind of place where lost souls go to mingle and old men go to die. A killer juke box and a shuffleboard, stiff, cheap drinks and a laid back attitude complete the scene.Now, there are hipsters in Sacto that will tell you the Flame was better 7 years ago and in many ways they are right. Back then we called it Fight Club and the only thing keeping it from being a saloon were the swinging doors.Back then there was a certain underground feeling then that is gone now. The bar was frequented by equal parts rockabilly, underage kid, homeless crackhead, hipster and drunk. It was the kind of place you could stumble into at 3:00 pm on a Tuesday and find a drunken assembly member with his mistress sitting next to 3 retired bridge laborers telling war stories sitting next to a spoiled rich hipster reading Bukowski. Plus, the drinks were $2 then opposed to $2.50 now. But even with some conformity, it still can't be beat anywhere in town.

<review# 2119,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/1/2007,1/29/2008,40,38,10,11,14>It's Friday night.  After a long week of heating up Trader Joe's frozen entrees, mom needs a break from cooking.  We have our usual discussion:  10 year old boy wants pizza from Wenelli's, mom wants to go to Bandera for the "chicken" (aka known as an extra dry Bombay martini, straight up), dad wants meat.  As happens every Friday, we come to a stand-off, so we grab the paper to find something new.Hmm....a restaurant called La Perla is on Fair Oaks, just up the street.  I've driven by it before, and naturally, I assumed it was an expensive lingerie shop.   I'd even planned to stop by sometime to see what a $70.00 bra looks like in person, but never got around to it.  Good thing, as I'd have been sorely disappointed in their lingerie offerings.Because it has the word  "Bistro" in it, I tell the kid that they probably have burgers, and we head off.  It's winter and dark,  but the outside of the place looks like every other little building on that street - pane glass windows facing the parking lot, shabby.  Once inside we were surprised at the elegance.  The low lighting, the white tablecloths, candles, and the jazz band playing softly in the corner was a clue that may not be the best choice for people with a ten year old boy.Another clue was the black-suited maitre-d who took one look at us and handed us a menu, telling us we might want to look at it before we sat down.  A quick glance made us realize he may be right. But then he asked my son a fateful question, "Do you like gnocci?"  My son, nodded eagerly and said, "Yes, I LOVE gnocci!"  And, he does, he's had Trader Joe's frozen gorgonzola gnocci many times and eaten it heartily.  The Maitre-d pointed out that one of the small plates was gnocci with veal sweetbreads and greens with ten year old balsamic vinegar.  I look at him in horror, and he smiles and winks at me.  My son said that sounded good, so we were seated, with mom now having to keep a secret.Now, my son is extremely mature for a ten year old, and took to fine dining like a pro.  My husband and I were uninterested in a starter, but my son wanted to try the roasted butternut squash soup with apple compote.  The soup arrived and was thick, creamy and beautifully spiced - like liquid pumpkin pie.  The kid ate almost all of it.  For the main course, my husband chose a "pork chop with sweet potato something or other."  Meat, basically.  He said it was very good only he thought that the meat was too rare.  (He still believes that pork contains trichinosis and needs to be cooked until it's gray). I chose a beef wellington small plate, with new york strip.  The wellington was oddly flavorless.  The meat was much more well-done that I would have expected, barely pale pink in the middle.  However, it was very tender, with a flaky wellington crust.  There was no pate or anything to top the meat, which left something missing.  It came on a bed of greens that were absolutely delicious.My son did order the veal sweetbreads with gnocci.  And, he really did like the sweetbreads.  The gnocci wasn't quite up to Trader Joe's standards but still he enjoyed it.  He made a very insightful comment - that there was way too much vinegar on the dish.  I tasted it, and he was right. It was wonderful vinegar, don't get me wrong.  Aged to perfection, the right amount of sweet and tart - but his meal was drowning in it, with the exception of the sweetbreads.A tense moment came.  The maitre-d came by to ask my son how he liked the sweetbreads, and my son asked what part of the veal it came from.  The man answered, that it was a gland called the thymus and said he liked it because it had a very creamy texture.   My son, knowing perfectly well what a thymus is, didn't throw up, make a scene, scream at me that I'd tricked him or make gagging noises.  He nodded thoughtfully and said, yes, the texture was creamy.  But, he thought there was too much vinegar in the gnocci.We also ordered a dessert, which was a chocolate cake with espresso creme anglaise. The piece was very small for three people,  but was absolutely delicious.  The creme anglaise had a bit of a sour flavor.  I don't know if it came from the espresso bean or if lemon had been used in the base.  A small matter as we licked it all up.We got a lot of compliments on my son and his behavior.  The maitre d said that they never saw kids in the restaurant and he was pleasantly surprised to find one so interested in food.  I explained that we were fans of "Top Chef."  Without reality TV, there would be no sophistication.I wish I could compliment them back with five stars, but they aren't ready.  The menu was adventurous and interesting, with fresh ingredients, but each dish missed the mark just a bit.  The inside was attractive but cold.  The live jazz band was a lovely touch, but it's always awkward to want to clap but need to eat.  However, it may have just been an off night and we will definitely go back.  It's worth a try.
<review# 2120,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/17/2007,1/28/2008,0,6,3,2,1>I tagged along to Mama Ann's with several of my co-workers who raved about the panini sandwiches and lasagna.  The varieties of luncheon meats and breads are impressive, and the desserts (slices of pies and cakes) looked delicious.  I decided upon the "Little Nicky" sandwich (pepper cracked turkey, cheddar cheese, liberal amounts of mustard, mayo, lettuce, and tomato piled a toasted panini roll).  I enjoyed the sandwich immensly while I was eating it (except for the parts that found their way onto my shirt), but afterwards wondered why I ordered it in the first place (I knew that the mayo would anger my sensitive tummy).  I had a somewhat similar experience with the movie that the sandwich was named after...but that is a story for another time. In short, food was good; seating was somewhat limited; and parking was terrible.  I will definitely try the lasagna next time I go to Mama Ann's.  Note:  I did not enjoy the movie nearly as much as the sandwich.
<review# 2121,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/7/2007,1/27/2008,15,51,4,11,6>UPDATE:  After being in continuous business since 1923, Wakano-Ura has closed.  I don't know if it is the recession or just that time passed them bad, but it is too sad.Wakano-Ura Chop Suey has been a Sacramento establishment since 1923 -- and for that reason, and no other, it is worth a visit.  The original Wakano-Ura, located near 3rd and M Streets, was named after Wakanoura, a place near Shizuoka-Ken in Japan.  When "redevelopment" displaced Sacramento's J-town and Chinatown, Wakano-Ura Chop Suey moved to its current location.  Wakano-Ura's schizophrenic Japanese/Chinese menu was created in its earliest days when immigrant owners from Shizuoka, Japan teamed with an immigrant cook from China.  The partnership flourished in the 1920's, serving bootleg sake through the Prohibition (the FBI once tried to close down their sake operation!!).  The restaurant survived the Depression, but closed during World War II with the internment of Japanese Americans.  New owners re-opened Wakano-Ura, and it was the site of frequent banquets through the 1950's and 1960's.  The last time I visited, the food had a taste that reflected the Kumamoto-ken heritage of its then-owners.  Six years ago, the restaurant changed hands a final time and is now owned by Chinese immigrants who have preserved the character of the restaurant's original menu.K and I dropped in for lunch -- I ordered the yaki-sakana lunch special and K ordered the beef teri special.  The owner/wife/waitress pointed us to the "salad" bar that consisted of edamame, lettuce, and pickled beansprouts.  Not your usual salad bar, but pleasing nonetheless.  She promptly provided us with two glasses of iced water that was really ice water because it had plenty of cubes (I only mention this because too many places disappoint me with lukewarm do-you-not-understand-the-meaning-of-ice-water water).  Next were bowls of piping hot Japanese clear soup.  Like burns all the way to the stomach hot.  Our lunch box came with 3 slices of California roll, an orange slice, and a mound of rice.   I had a very generous serving of mackerel -- the tail must have been at least 6 inches!! (your inner mama says size does matter) -- and a nice size dollop of daikon oroshi to go with it.  The lemon that came with my fish was juicy so I didn't have to try to coax liquid out of a pulpy rind.  K was happy with her beef teri.  The whole lunch for the two of us came to $11.31!K thought the lunch was such a good deal, the service pleasant, that Wakano-Ura deserves 4 stars.  I appreciated the small details -- like the fresh lemon -- but give it a 3 because it has no ambiance whatsoever.  Split the difference, it comes to 3.5 stars.After lunch, we trotted next door to Osaka-ya to get the best shave ice in the world (yes, even better than Matsumoto's on Oahu).  Life is good.
<review# 2122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/3/2007,1/26/2008,260,392,7,5,11>Another great hole-in-the-wall bar sniffed out by the Sacramento Dive Bar Connoisseurs! The management here was kind enough to accommodate our group and pre-arranged extended business hours just so we could have the proper Pre-Flite Lounge experience.  Our group easily filled this inconspicuous little bar that is located below street level (a true according-to-Hoyle DIVE!) on the periphery of the Downtown Plaza Mall.The original business model for the Pre-Flite Lounge was to offer a watering hole for visitors/workers in the Capitol who wanted to get their drink on before catching a shuttle to the Sac Airport.  The decor gives the undeniable impression of a cheesy 70's airport lounge, and it should be put on the historic registry if there is any justice in the world.The name reminds me of the lyrics in Elton John's "Rocketman":She packed my bags last night pre-flightZero hour nine a.m.And I'm gonna be high as a kite by thenA good time was had by all... drinks flowed, chatter ensued, the ladies at my table tolerated my booze-fueled humor and shameless flirtation.  The Pre-Flite felt like the Soul Plane, and all I ever packed was my modest satchel.
<review# 2123,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2008,1/25/2008,2300,8619,4,6,7>It's funny how polarized opinions of the Cheesecake Factory are. People either really love it or they hate it. Since I grew up with it during my younger years in SoCal it's got that weird comfort food/chain thing going on for me. I can appreciate the gluttony of American excess at it's best but there are certain drawbacks I try to avoid, namely the ridiculously long lines without reservations. How to avoid that? Go to it on a Sunday night at 10:45pm. Now I'm a night owl and all but this is even late for me. However, when you're stuck in the Sierras because people don't know how to got damn' drive when it snows and there's a chain control, you look for what you can after 10pm in the Sacramento area. After a grueling few hours driving slower than molasses, eating establishments were dropping like flies and In-N-Out, TGIFridays, and Murder Burger (yes I said MURDER) weren't going to cut. We wanted to sit down, stretch out and relax our weary selves. Got the ranch house burger with steak, bacon, mushrooms and cheese. Wow, they actually got medium rare correct. Big plus points for that. The burger was huge and the attempt to pick  it up was complete failure, so I ended up cutting it in half and only finishing half.  After that and a few refills of coke, I sugar'd up some more with a slice of lemon, raspberry cheesecake.Since it was a long weekend the place was actually surprisingly busy for that late at night. Lots of high school kids and this creepy dude that sat next to us. Even a bday celebration broke out. Service was good and we felt taken care of. I have to admit I felt pretty darn good about my experience here with the  long day we had. After we regained our energy it was once again time to hit the rainy road back home.

<review# 2126,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2007,1/22/2008,108,68,6,11,6>This is a homey, homely, heavenly little bit of Chicano cookery nestled down 21st Street alongside the ubiquitous lair of Zelda; slow down as you're driving, because it's easy to be missed. When Mother Nature blesses us with the three vainglorious weeks of fine weather in spring or autumn, it's quite a pleasing past time to settle down with a generous plate beneath an umbrella table, and watch the passersby through the iron entry gates.And the dishes indeed, what marvelous, mouthwatering, gut-bustingly good food they present. Trans-fatty everything with a side of spice; not to be missed are the carnitas, some of the most crispy-tender, savory mouthfuls of luscious pork I've ever experienced. No lunch would be complete without one of the saccharine, syrupy Mexican sodas found in a cooler squatting near the order counter.There is no table service. There is no ambiance, save for the cheesy, charming assemblage of knick-knacks and tourist collectibles scattered about the interior space. There is no fine dining, no linens, no silver cutlery, no wine pourings. Just good, greasy grub, and plenty of it, presented in the nicest possible way.

Nearby strange sounds seem to merge together--children crying? cows mooing? sheeps bahhing? people trying to hawk useless crap that will get stuffed in the rafters and forgotten about? Smells overwhelm the nostrils...fried chicken, fried artichoke, fried twinkies, fried coke, fried avocados, livestock crap. Hordes of people rush to the expo buildings hoping for some air conditioning, only to find the buildings so crowded that bodily injury is guaranteed.And then..and then the sun goes down. The carny rides light up. Reality shifts, changes, and you realize it really just might be possible to win that giant stuffed dog even if it may be 6 tries and $36 later. Suddenly the death-defying, rickety, confidence-uninspiring, g-force inducing rides couldn't seem like a better idea. Teeny boppers crowd in the aisles laughing, flirting, and you remember you too used to be that young, and that oblivious. The sun goes down, and the magic and imagination gets sparked, and I remember why it is that I've been to the State Fair almost every year of my life.

Inside is a spacious room with the bar, plenty of seating and pool tables... a great dark hidey-hole from the summer heat.

Spent a lazy late afternoon there recently amidst the water misters, flowers, bamboo trim and carved tiki gods, and just had a relaxed blast.The bartender was super friendly, the drinks were well-made and pretty dang cheap (extended Sunday happy hour, huh! what!) and the vibe was very chill.

Prices have sure gone up!This place is AWESOME! If you are hungry and don't want to cook, come here. It's a restaurant, bobba drink, to-go sandwiches and packaged food items spot all in one little restaurant.  I come here for the sandwiches!Best Vietnamese sandwiches ever! The BBQ pork is my favorite! The bread is fresh and chewy on the inside but has a nice crunch on the outside. I love the pickled carrots and onions, it's the perfect bite! There is a good amount of meat in each sandwich. I sometimes ask for extra jalapenos because I love anything spicy! They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from like fish patty, BBQ chicken, pork, I think they even have a vegetarian one.  They make it fresh when you order. They also sell fresh bread, eggrolls, and a bunch of pre-packaged food items such as spring rolls and chicken over rice. Prices have been pretty consistent recently at around $3.50 a sandwich.The bobba drinks are so good and fresh. The drinks are $3.50 and there's lots of bobba pearls! It's kind of confusing when you walk in. You're not sure where the line starts so just make your way to a cashier and order. Most of the people standing around are waiting for their order :)I love this place! I always have room for a sandwich at Huong Lan!This place is super Asian, don't be scared! Be brave!! LOL

First off, they employ a sommalier. Yes. A Sommalier in a grocery store. The wine selection is vast. I got lost in happiness for a little while.The wine section happens to be in close proximity to the deli, and to the beer selection. The only other place that has overwhelmed me with fantastic choices as far as beer goes is BevMo, and NOBODY can showup Corti Bros Deli...Oh, and they have hard alcohol, too. Lots of different specialty brands, including about 10 different types of bitters for those of you who are mixologists.The sandwiches.... I inhaled the scent of something that smelled of Italy, memory, and sweet bread.... and I wanted it. There are so many sandwiches to choose from, and they are all made to order. If you peruse the cold case, you will be impressed. From mortadella, to cold salads, to deviled eggs to anitpasto, you will not be disappointed. Apparently, they are Trader Joes' biggest competitor in this area. I believe it. If you're looking for delicious food, European items, and great service, come here. I literally love walking into this place.

So when I discovered Konditorei, I was pleasantly surprised that they had everything to follow my strict food group diet.Vegetable Group- Spinach Cheese Croissant.  I love spinach! So when they wrapped one of my favorite veggies along with cheese in an easy to devour flaky croissant, I couldn't resit the handiness.Fruit Group-  Blueberry Strawberry Cream Yogurt Cake.  You double up on your fruits with this cake, in that two fruits are being layered over a cream filled cake with chocolate shavings flowing down the sides.  There is also a variety of fruit danishes and croissants available for substitution that include cherry, apple, prune, strawberry, peach and blueberry to name a few.Cheese Group-Topfen Strudel.  I prefer this quark cheese filled treat because it comes served with vanilla sauce but any cheese croissants will also fulfill your daily dose. Meat , Poultry, and Egg Group- Breakfast Pizza.  Take a baked crust, add a fried egg, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausages, a piece of turkey, some ham and you have your recommended daily allowance for the group in one convenient sitting. Bread Group- Vanilla Chocolate Bread. It is a bakery so the bread group is easy to fill, but it's a bonus when it's accompanied by chocolate.  So if you are a health nut like me and are tired of driving around town trying to locate your foods, give Konditorei a try for all your health needs.
<review# 2134,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/8/2012,6/4/2013,1211,148,22,33,18>I have never been to a restaurant where I've received both EXCELLENT and HORRIFIC customer service all in the same night. Therefore, I have also never been so confused as to what rating I should give to a place.It started when I called a few days ago for my dinner reservations for 14 guests. I was pleasantly surprised when they said that it would be possible. The guy answering the phone each time I called back was very helpful and welcoming. The location was a bit difficult for my friends and I to find. At least half of us got lost trying to locate it. It's a nice building with red decorative lights on the windows, but they have the teeniest little shop logo that is easy to overlook. Upon arrival, I was immediately impressed with Plan B. Although it is a smaller place, it is still very elegant and and intimate with the dim lighting. The waiters were enthusiastic and friendly. Even though my party turned out to be a bit bigger than expected, they still managed to make it all work and was being very accommodating to us all. The food was excellent. Most things were on the pricier side, but it was definitely nothing too outrageous at all. I ordered the duck breast that comes with a side of mashed potatoes and string beans. I LOVED IT. The duck breast was juicy and tender, topped with the sweet and tangy pomegranate sauce. It was amazing. I also loved the string beans on the side, although it was heavily salted. But I am a fan of saltier foods, so I didn't mind. As for the mashed potatoes, it could have been better. I think I speak for most people when I say that mashed potatoes should be rich and creamy, not sour. Also, the french onion soup wasn't the best. It was a bit too bitter for my taste. Nevertheless, everything else was delicious, and I really enjoyed it. Things sounds exquisite so far, so why the mixed feelings? Because of the girl that works there. Yeah, I said girl. Because she sure did not behave like a lady. This girl with the short blonde hair, possibly the only girl I saw working there that night was downright RUDE. One of my girl friend arrived a bit late and was trying to put her order in. She had some questions about a specific dish and asked for the waitress to explain it to her. This ill-tempered girl flashed my friend a dirtyass look as she shoved a menu at her and said, "look it up." ...and just walked away.All of us at the table were shocked by her behavior. What the bleep just happened? Aren't you going to turn back around, apologize, and say just kidding or something, beezy? CUS WOW, she was way out of pocket.  Later on, most of us also heard her yelling at our waiter, saying things like how our table has to leave. Schwat????For the record, we were not being loud or obnoxious. And there were no alcoholic beverages present the whole night. Nobody was being crazy and drunk. Regardless of the size of my party, it really was just a nice and intimate gathering with the people I love most on my birthday. Props to our patient waiter that was able to keep his cool, even after being b*tched at by crotchface. The only time we really saw him a bit irritated was the part where we had to ask him for separate bills. But I've been there, so I totally understand his frustration. I'm not sure if it would have made a difference if we specified that from the beginning, but I did feel bad about forgetting to do so.  I had a wonderful birthday here, and I'm not sure what that girl's problem was, but I wasn't going to let her ruin our night out together. She is irrelevant. She's definitely in need of an attitude adjustment for the good of this restaurant. But it probably wouldn't stop me from coming back because everyone else was super friendly, the food was delicious, and the restaurant itself is beautiful.
<review# 2135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2013,6/3/2013,434,368,9,15,11>Made reservations for 9 people for a Friday night dinner. I was coming from the airport to pick up some family beforehand and they were able to accommodate pushing the reservation back an extra half hour as well. The restaurant is so open and the decor was simple and minimal. There was a spacious bar and lots of seating. Happy hour lasts until 8PM (WHOO!) and were able to get the specials at our table as well. I had bites of the sweet and spicy chicken (white meat, so healthy but flavorful), the spinach dip (ok), the lettuce wraps (real flavorful!), but the tamale cake was my absolute favorite! The cornmeal was on the sweet side, reminding me of cornbread, and it was light, fluffy, and really complimented the peppers in the sauce. YUM! I had the salmon for dinner, which was on the thin side, but came with veggies and sweet potato mash. I had a bite of the beer can chicken and I should have got that! My absolute FAVORITE part of the meal was the red velvet cheesecake. It was to die for!!!! They also will make a whole cake if you special order it so I plan on doing so for the next special occasion! The only downside to this spot was the service. Our server was slow, seemed detached, forgot the drink orders, only provided silverware for 5 people even though I clearly made a reservation for 9, didn't keep the water refilled, and just seemed lost. The other servers were helping us too so maybe they just don't have an organized system. Also, parking is free in the structure connected to the building, but it closes early so getting out was a hassle (the security guard had to manually open the gate, we had to get our tickets validated but for no reason, etc.).

We called up this place and they said, "Yeah we have dim sum. Come get sum."(Not exact words). For dinner time, they give you a menu and you can order as much as you want. It was sad to see some of my favorite dishes sold out, but I kinda expected it as dim sum is normally served for brunch. With that said, they still had a great selection of food, and it was pretty cheap! $2.25/small$2.75/medium$3.25/large$5.00/specialWe ordered many dishes including the Har Gow, Siu Mai, BBQ pork buns, beef balls, and chicken feet  to name a few. We had a group of 11 and 29 dishes + 2 fried rices was more than enough to feed us all. The food was all freshly made and were quite tasty. The only thing negative I have to say is that the chicken feet wasn't saucy enough for me, but it was still good overall.The place itself is massive. There's a whole 'nother side to it that we didn't see. There's also a stage, where can only assume people can get up and do speeches and karaoke or whatever it is that they do at events. This place is big enough to hold an entire wedding reception (they probably already do this). There were only two waitresses that I saw (It was late Sunday night) and attended to us. They were extremely attentive and even suggested a few dishes for us.Overall, I had a great experience here. Food was good and cheap. Service was really good and it has a nice atmosphere.Side note: My friends and I found it hilarious that they were playing pretty rachet songs. We heard Rihanna, Kanye West and even 2 Chainz. Albeit, they were playing through a radio station. Nonetheless, it was pretty amusing to be eating dim sum and listening to hip-hop at a Chinese restaurant.
<review# 2137,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2013,6/1/2013,175,154,10,20,9>I used to work for the full line store and now that I no longer get my employee discount I've come to realize how ridiculous overpriced everything is (don't worry Nordies, I still love you. I just can't afford you as often). Thankfully the Rack comes to the rescue!Think of the Rack as Nordstrom's little sister. It gets all the hand me downs from the main store and offers it to customers at a significant markdown. While they don't always have the latest trends, there are some great finds if you put in the effort and there's also a good selection for classics and basics. I like this location because it's clean and organized with helpful employees. Parking can be a drag though so prepare yourself.Noteworthy news: I have heard through the grapevine that they are intending on changing things up and will soon be receiving merchandise directly from vendors!Pro-tips: 1. Do NOT wait in line. You no longer have to! Anyone that is wearing a green shirt can ring you up on the spot. Just walk over to them and say you're ready to go. 2. If you're a frequent shopper here, sign up for their rewards program. I suggest the MOD card. Similar to the Nordstrom credit card, the MOD card is a rewards based program that let you accumlate points from your purchases. Once you reach a certain amount of points, you get a Nordstrom Note (which is similar to a gift certificate) that you can use at main store, the Rack, or online. The difference is it is linked to your checking account so you never have to worry about making payments, accumulating interest, or going into debt! (Ugh, can you tell that I used to be in sales?)
<review# 2138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/3/2012,5/31/2013,178,144,15,19,12>I came here on opening day about a month and a half ago and I think I've been there 10 times since then. I think their ramen might have actually toppled my raging pho addiction. Plus everyone speaks Japanese! Huge plus for me since I love to impress my dinner companions with my Japanese speaking skillz. This ramen is made by a true Japanese ramen master (according to the back of the menu). I've only tried the Aka and Kuro Tonkotsu ramens. The Aka is good but I'm in love with the Kuro, which, unfortunately isn't spicy. I haven't snuck in my bottle of sriracha to ramp up the hotness guerilla style (which I've been known to do), since I'm afraid of ruining the "balance" of the ramen, but I have added a ton of that pepper from the little shaker with the red cap and that made it reasonable spicy after about 15 shakes. I'm sure the other ramens are good but it's clear that the tonkotsu ramen is their specialty.Also, I highly highly recommend the takoyaki (fried balls of this dough stuff with a piece of octopus in the middle). Holy $%*& they're amazing. Like maybe the most delicious thing I've tried all year amazing. Like when I had my first bite time stopped and I may or may not of had an orgasm amazing. Even if you don't like octopus (which I don't), give them a try. I also really loved the katsu-don, but I'd skip out on the Kurobuta sausage. It tastes like a hot dog, nothing special.This probably isn't the place for vegetarians/vegans. They do have a vegetarian ramen, and although my roommate says it's pretty good, this place is really all about meat, especially pork. Most of their appetizers are also meat-based and it's clear that you should be ordering tonkotsu based ramen for maximum deliciousness.If you haven't gone yet, get your life together and go. Immediately. Today.

I'm very familiar with the area since my grandparents lived in a little pink house off Broadway in Tahoe Park, FOREVER. I used to spend lots of weekends as an unsupervised child running amok in this neighborhood. Too bad there was no Wing Stop back then. I could have loitered for hours. Upon entering the Wing Stop the employees were friendly, helpful, fun, and sassy. They just kept braggin' on the place. "Our wings are the best!" With a little help from the Wingstop crew I decided to order the hickory smoked BBQ wings. Touted as  being bold with a little kick and they definitely were all that. I also ordered the Hawaiian wings which were sweet and tangy. I preferred the hickory smoked. The fresh cut fries were outstanding! Fresh cut Idaho potatoes with tasty seasoning. Some of the best fries I've had in a while. The Wing Stop is a new and refreshing change from the usual crap that seems to keep popping up all over town  Just ask former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman. Huh? Troy Aikman? Yeah...he's the Wingstop's #1 fan and National Spokesman.

I never believed why everyone keeps telling me how Subway is so good and why it's good but I do now.After I saw commercials for the $5 foot long subs, I knew I had to check it out. Finally I got the chance when my BF suggested Subway for lunch. I was actually kinda excited. Like how little kids are excited to get ice cream, I was excited to try Subway. There were plenty of options on the menu. What caught my eyes was the chicken and bacon ranch on an Italian Herb and Cheese bread. BF got the sweet onion chicken and prime rib sub. For $5, the foot long sub was my lunch AND dinner! Choosing your own toppings makes the sandwich even more filling. I opted for only avocado and lettuce. O M G! When I took my first bite, I was in love. It was so delicious!!!! I thought to myself, "Hey! I think I can go on a Subway diet now!". I know that they diet works too, if you only eat Subway because my brothers friend lost SO MUCH weight since he's been on it he looks like a totally different person. With the subs tasting this good, I can live on it and lose weight without starving myself!Finally I know what to eat when I'm hungry and broke!
<review# 2144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2008,5/6/2008,164,294,14,11,12>Cacophany of cantankerous characters compliment this carniverous cuisineSo you're thinking, what's us citifolk doing at this pizza joint in the middle of bumf*ck Sacrapmento??Well, it's about halfway to tahoe from the bay area, well rated on yelp  open late and inexpensive (dinner for 3 with wine was $26)The food was great, and the place has a real history (judging by the nary updated decor from the 50s as well as the oil soaked dustbunnies on all upper surfaces).Even more interesting was the people who were there. Luigi (the owner, not his real name), was very nice, a bit creepy (in a Zed's dead type of way), but harmless. This is his world, been there for 40 years, since he was 16. He's the type of person you meet and want to invite him over for thanksgiving  (just don't leave your kids alone with him. -- i keed, i keed).The rest of the people (including the workers) looked like they were released from /on their way to prison or just got off the set from Sin City part 2. Yes they made the experience THAT rich, So much so that we proceeded to write a virtual Quentin Tarrantino script on the rest of the trip to South Lake. They ex-hippie cook who just cut his hair, The Lenny (from Lenny and Squiggy/put the lotion in the basket) guy who was spending his Friday night 6" away from the TV that was blasting the "So you want to be a Hooters girl" reality TV show. They old timers in plaid long sleeves as part of their routine before heading over the the VFW. The busted, worn out hooker who could give you and STD just by shooting a look. The drunk/tweaker that kept on asking the staff for a quarter to get his Pac Man on (and they even gave it to them)The list goes on and on, Kubrik, Coppola, Gibson y'all listening??They even have a yelp sticker in the window, not sure if they even know what a computer is. When I mentioned that we chose this place because of yelp. Luigi gave me a blank deer-in-the-headlights stare. After he did some math on half scribbled paper to give us our total (didnt even use the old register), I figured it wasn't worth the engery to 'splain itAnyways, if you find yourself looking for something other than In-N-Out or Big Kahuna Burger on your way to/from Tahoe late at night and want some good grub and great material, look no further.Just park close and move quickly to your car with keys in hand and mace in the other (outside the establishment unsavory characters seem to slowly move toward you)If you're lucky you may catch Fonzie jumping the shark out backyoutube.com/watch?v=NI5RPS I upped a pic of the 1953 menu from the place they have hanging on the wall

<review# 2146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/26/2007,5/4/2008,42,78,1,11,4>This restaurant is located across the street from Mel Rapton Honda on Fulton, right next door to the Carl's Jr.  The only reason I am so specific is that it is near impossible to find.  Also, the banners still read Waffle King.  Apparently this location was the Waffle King until a few short months ago, when the current owner bought it.  The food is very good.  The menu is still in the works, and you can get the "American" or the "Peruvian" version, which they offer you when you enter the place.  If you are stumbling in after a long drunken night, I suggest the American Waffle menu.  Most of the items are under $5 and what I saw looked good.  However, if you are interested in good South American grub, then order some ceviche and causa to start, and then pick any of the main dishes which feature Arroz con Pollo, Chimichurri, Lomo, Milanesa and many other latin staples.  We tried a variety and shared, and they were all cooked just right, with very generous portions.  The spices were balanced and the meat was tender and juicy.  Keep in mind that this establishment is still being worked on, but I recommend it highly if you want something different.
<review# 2147,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/27/2007,5/3/2008,177,474,4,6,4>Well, I liked this place better than Big Spoon.  Big Spoon makes me dizzy.  Yogurtopia makes me think "where's the topia?"  It's pretty white, bright, and bleak.  But I guess that's the "DIY Yogurt" theme.I like the sour yogurt.  I got the plain white kind called euro style or whatever.  I did put some sliced strawberries and blueberries on it.I am a fan of Red Mango in Seoul.  I've been to the one in the Lotte Center about 6 times.  I always have them dump tapioca, blueberries, strawberries, chopped watermelon and pineapple nibs on it.  It's considered 'Well Being" food, like brown fresh puffed rice cakes, red steamed breakfast rice, and sweet potatoes covered in blueberries and fresh whipped cream (this is awesome for lunch, by the way, but I digress.)Anyway, the plain yogurt is really yummy.  I bet it would be good blended with banana.  I eschew all candy toppings, because really, why do you need to do that to yourself?  I am not 12.  I did not see 8 different kinds of yogurt.  I saw euro and chocolate.I also noticed that it's about 190 calories for a 6 ounce serving of the yogurt.  the smallest cup holds about 1.5 cups of yogurt, so be careful if you are only trying to get one serving.  I'm not that calorie conscious normally, but we had just eaten a massive meal at Yummy Guide, so I did one swirl around and shared it with the PF since the Bean was stuffed full of chow fun and egg puffs and was saying "no moh" to food that night.One thing to note: crossing the street to and from Yummy Guide is dangerous.  Especially on a full stomach.You know what would be scrumptious?  Egg puff dipped in euro style yogurt.Yeah.
<review# 2148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2008,5/1/2008,87,115,5,16,10>Preface: Been all over Mexico. Culinary trips with Rick Bayless, Diana Kennedy and other famous chefs. Specially arranged private tours with local foodies (Mexican locals). Oaxaca, Veracruz, Chiapas, Mexico City, Puebla, Michoacan, Guanajuato, Tequila, etc. Serious cooking time on my own with the most authentic chilies and other ingredients possible. Not braggin', just been there, done that. I know my shit.Although I have not been to Hidalgo proper, so I don't know the local cuisine first hand, this place is "probably" the real deal. How do I come to that conclusion? Well, besides the fact that everything I've had there is incredibly good, they go to all the trouble to get fresh huitlacoche for quesadillas ("corn mushrooms" is the nice term--it's actually corn smut), which is almost impossible to get (La Superior has the vastly inferior canned stuff), and squash blossoms.On the weekends they do lamb barbacoa, which I've never had before (I've had had goat and mutton) they serve it three ways, or get three types of meat from the process of cooking the lamb--your basic lamb meat, your basic lamb head meat, heart, lungs, tripe in a red chile sauce, and your lamb sweetbreads in a green sauce. I got all three with a big pile of hot tortillas served on a piece of aluminum foil--nothing fancy here! Diana Kennedy describes all three styles of meat in her book My Mexico on her trip to Hidalgo, to a T.Now here's the deal with restaurants in Mexico. For the most part, the best places to eat are the "comidas" or kitchens in the markets, and even they are hit and miss. There's usually a big hall adjacent to the actual market where you find the comidas. Row after row of open air kitchens staffed by one or two ladies serving the special of the day--each one different. You pick one based on the smells and how many people are eating there. The more people, the better the food. Kind of like trucks at a truck stop. it doesn't help in the decision process that one of the ladies is calling and motioning to you to come and sit down.Fancy sit-down restaurants with menus are a rarity and usually cater to business people and touristas. The food usually is a take on American steak houses, circa 1950, or "Continental" food--remember that? It's overpriced, over staffed, and awful.Why am I telling you all this? Because although the do exist, and as hard as it is to believe, good restaurants in Mexico are actually hard to find. That's why Rick Bayless spends so much of his time on his TV show in the markets and roadside stalls. There might be one or two places in a region that really up the bar and put out consistently good food. That's why I'm so excited about Lalo's.This place could hold it's own and would pack them in in Mexico. It would be a destination for miles around like the barbacoa joint I ate at in Mexico City that was featured in Saveur magazine, or the little restaurant that specialized in Mole Amarillo outside of Oaxaca, or the place in Puebla that specializes in chicken in pipian (pumpkin seed) sauce.I went back with my biz partner (the ex) for lunch and we had the place pretty much to ourselves. We had a huitlacoche quesadilla, a flor de calabasa (squash blossom) quesadilla, and some tacos de al pastor and lengua. When the ex and I were married, we traveled all over Mexico. At the first bite we looked at each other and tears whelled up in our eyes--not for old romantic shit--that is so over--but for the food! It was incredible! Best tongue I've had in years (only tongue I've had in years--sorry, I couldn't resist!)  Please go there and be a little adventurous! Yeah, they've got burritos--this is America and they've got to make a living, but try a huitlacoche or squash blossom quesadilla along with that burrito. The tacos are great, and a steal for $1.25.This place is so much better that La Fiesta or La Favorita, it makes those place seem like Taco Bell in comparison, and I like those places! I can't wait to go back. I'm going there for chilequiles Saturday, and I might even go back Sunday for more of that barbacoa!
<review# 2149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2011,5/11/2011,299,309,9,13,11>I went for lunch, and for $13, I filled up on a large selection of rolls from their lunch menu, as well as a full selection of Nigiri.  This is the kind of sushi place where you order a few rolls at a time from a waitress, and that sometimes can be frustrating because you constantly have to wait to get more (think Azukar-Sushi downtown), but I never felt as if I was waiting too long here.  Service was friendly and fast. Quality of the fish was good, and the cuts were decently thick. -note: regular rice used in nigiri, rather than the sweetened rice.My favorite rolls from the lunch menu were the most simple: the Alaska (salmon and avocado), and the Hawaii (tuna and avocado). But for those who prefer more colorful and saucy rolls, there were plenty to choose from including a number of deep-fried.  I just may have found my new favorite sushi spot in Sac!

I don't have to drive to Reno or wait until I go to Vegas to have an awesome sushi buffet experience. Whoever thought of the smaller portion roll sizes was GENIUS!! 4 to 6 pieces each.Our group ordered so many rolls that I lost track of the names of what I was eating, but lets just say, I liked EVERY LAST one! I am a sushi snob, who knows her stuff, and Azukar passes with FLYING colors.Kudos to Shawn, our helpful server, along with the awesome bartender tall guy.....friendly service with a smile. Azukar is in my top rotation of places to eat when I'm in the mood for a sushi buffet. I look forward to coming back to try more.

I like the sparse and well though out decoration. I adore the minimalistic menu. They really don't need anything else on it. What they have is constructed with care and precision. Really I could not think of more mouth harmony than arugula, prosciutto, and truffle oil. Hello...yum!!! I like the thin pizza crust and I love the salad the comes on a pizza crust.When going for dessert I have always gone for the gelato, but next time I will be going for a dessert pizza.

Everything is made fresh, and I LOVE that their chicken is grilled to order and isn't that nasty pre-grilled, fake grill mark, reheated stuff that so many restaurants find to be an acceptable substitute for real chicken. AND I LOVE that they give you your choice of bun; thank you wheat! They have so many great options and the prices are really great! If you're in the mood for something lighter they have a great list of salads. Shakes are really yummy, made with real ice cream! I don't love their onion rings because they're the breaded ones instead of battered ones, but they have excellent fries! Gotta love any place that gives you little white cups to pump your own ketchup, especially since ketchup is another obsession of mine... Everything here is just so fresh and I really, really appreciate that in a restaurant! A Santa Barbara favorite, I had heard a lot of good things about Habit before I dined here, and oh boy, they lived up to the hype. Great lunch spot!.... especially as a late luncher (3pm - 4pm in some cases) the place is really quiet, when 5pm rolls around the place gets really busy but they always get the food out quickly! I see more and more Habit's popping up, I just hope they don't get too big and start sacrificing quality. Love me some Habit!
<review# 2153,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2011,5/6/2011,125,189,10,14,11>I hear a lot of bad things about this place, mostly that the food sucks, so it's been on my "Don't Bother" list.  And much like Hot Italian, the nay-sayers have kept me away long enough and I finally gave it a shot myself to much surprise.The building is gorgeous inside, but I already knew that, and so did you, you big dummy (Redd Foxx voice).  What I can't speak for, is pretty much everything at Kupros (if we're just talking food) except the burger.  I will say that eveyrthing that went by us looked amazing, despite the guy who proclaimed he was the former head chef there and that eveyrthing sucked (he was just there to see how downhill the place went since his departure he says).  The burger was the main draw for me and it surpassed expectations.  I don't know how this thing was seasoned, but it was fantastic.  I was told that the cheese was some kind Rogue Ale product, and it was incredibly flavorful.  This burger gets a 10/10 from me, easily.Eat light, or bring some pals along, because for two dinner plates, and a few beers, you may get out of here just barely missing the fifty dollar mark.I almost want to give the place 3 stars, or 3.5 if I could, because of the service.  Our server was incredibly friendly, but she was so overly animated and bizarre in her behavior that we suspected perhaps she wasn't completely sober.  She was such a space cadet (erratic, forgetful, loud, damn near hysterical) that I figured maybe she was on ecstasy or something, but as we dined a while I do believe I saw her taking a swig off somebody's beer, and then later witnessed her and the bartender taking some shots.  Not even on the sly - just blatantly getting ripped in front of the customers.  I told my brother this story and he says he's been in there and witnessed the same type of stuff.  It was funny at first, but after a while we just wanted her to reel it in and take it down a few hundred notches.As far as I can tell, the food at Kupros is on point, so perhaps the bad reputation it gets on the street is solely based on the handful of knucklehead employees they have running the show up front.I'll come back for that burger though.
<review# 2154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2011,5/5/2011,390,173,8,21,11>Shout out to Katie B., who's giggle-fest of a review was the one that convinced me to try this place.Bangkok Garden can be credited with my strange midnight cravings for drunken noodles. I should also thank them for educating me in the joys of Thai food. I'd made a couple of feeble attempts to expand my horizons at other mediocre Thai restaurants, but never really ventured away from anything that was out of my familiar comfort zone. Now I can't wait to try something new every time I come in. So far, everything has been delicious. Well okay... the drunken noodles are AMAZING!Tried the fried catfish in red chili sauce today. Creamy and perfectly spiced, the sauce had a wonderful hint of coconut milk. Also had a taste of the Bangkok fried rice that my roomie ordered. Chock full of raisins, pineapple, chicken and shrimp, he happily gobbled it up. I think the crab fried rice is next on my agenda. I've seen it pass by on the way to other tables and been sorry I didn't order it before.Their lunch prices are a steal for the quality of food you get. Most items are $7-$9 for an entree that's sizable enough to leave you with leftovers for dinner. Plus, on weekdays you get a cup of tangy Thai vegetable soup to start (no soup for weekend lunches, wonder why?).One thing I've learned after going at different times of the day- be patient if you go in during or right after one of their rush hours. Must admit, I've gone in and started to get my panties in a bunch when the tables are uncleared or all occupied and it seems like staff is chatting with patrons when they should be trying to seat a new customer. I think it's more accurate to say that they're just really trying to be relaxed and gracious. If that means a few dirty dishes or your drink order have to wait, so be it. On the bright side, once you're seated and the order is placed, entrees come out in a flash.

Every time I go I PROMISE myself I won't spend more than $10 (which is possible, because there are TONS of items under $10 and even under $5)...and it never works. No matter what happens, I always find an amazing deal on a designer item. Last time I found this amazing designer dress that was probably about $200 new and I got it for $30 at Article. Now, I'm not a tiny girl. This is a boutique store for any size. They always have a great selection of sizes 12-16. Not to mention shoes that aren't just size 7s. And, as had been mentioned, they are super kid friendly and even have a small kids selection. This store is such a great addition to the neighborhood.
<review# 2156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2011,5/3/2011,72,83,13,19,12>Best place in Sacramento to get Vietnamese sandwiches. I know, I know. The line is confusing. Let me take a moment to explain. There are two lines and you can use either one. One of them is on the left with just the cash register and the other one is where they make the sandwiches. When you order, it is best that you stay near the line you originally ordered from because the person you ordered from will know that it's your order. Don't go wandering off to the right if you ordered from the left.Stay with me, there will be a pop quiz at the end.They sell more than just sandwiches and while everything else is fine, I normally just go for the sandwiches because it's what they do best. If I want pho, there's a great place just down the street. But the sandwiches here are stellar. Huong Lan is somewhat of a trusted brand with Vietnamese people. One day, I told my mom I would be getting her some Lee's Sandwiches and she nearly disowned me. I had to remedy the situation fast with Huong Lan. They give you a pretty generous helping of meat and veggies, and there are chili bottles readily available on the tables. A bit of that in your sandwich will make it all that much better.Tip: if you're not in a hurry, sit down and order your sandwiches. No confusing lines, they'll bring the food to you. Added bonus is that the bread is fresher (odd, I know - perhaps the bread they use for dine-in people is better), warmer, crispier, better than the one you'd be getting had you gotten it to-go.
<review# 2157,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/7/2010,5/2/2011,192,54,16,17,13>First of all, I am thoroughly underwhelmed by any and all vegetarians/vegans who would go so far as to eat at a Hot Dog joint and whine about how there aren't enough "veggie dog" options on the menu. It would be like going to Sugar Plum and wondering why the hamburger selection is so sparse. Be thankful the menu includes a meatless option at all. Secondly, if you were expecting a ball park frank then for Pete's Sake drop a ten spot on parking and piss off to Archaic Arena or wherever else will make you feel good and gouged for your time and money.Personally, I am more than pleased to forgo the ball game and financed parking rates to get right to the nitrate-laden nitty-gritty. For as long as I can remember I have been completely smitten with everything hot dog related. Other hot dog joints have come in and out of vogue in my time here in Sacramento but none have given me the utter joy and satisfaction of stuffing my mouth-hole with a frankfurter as Capitol Dawg has. Mike, the owner and proprietor of this establishment, takes his doggery seriously; as a Chicago native he knows what makes a wiener worthwhile.To say that the menu is vast would be a major understatement. Eight kinds of frank and more toppings than one could shake a bun at seems more than  enough to satisfy the most selective of consumers. For my money nothing is better than a Bratwurst on a french roll with brown mustard, all available on the Capitol Dawg menu. My numero dos selection would have to be the Tower Dawg, assembled in true BLT styling (the included lettuce and tomato gives me a satisfying albeit falsified sense of healthy living). As side dishes go the garlic fries are solid and the onion rings tasty but nothing beats the sweet potato shoestrings. The wide variety of beers they offer suits me just fine.So enjoy, all you fans of the fairer frank, and relish in all that the Dawg has to offer!
<review# 2158,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2011,5/1/2011,141,309,7,12,11>I came on February 13 for the Dinner for Sweethearts class. There were a lot of couples there of all ages, celebrating Valentine's Day a day early, but there were a lot of single (or married, but they came alone) people as well! We had about 25 people in the class.I LOVE cooking. Well, let me rephrase that; I LOVE food, therefore I cook. My boyfriend got us both into this class to get some good new ideas, but I walked out with a lot more.Paulette's class was a great combination of techniques and tools (what knife to use, temperatures for cooking, etc) and delicious, rich recipes that I would never have invented on my own. We had plate after plate of mouthwatering foods - stuffed mushrooms, shrimp in romesco, gnocchi, garlic chicken breasts, and flourless chocolate cake. I was STUFFED by the time I got out of there! Each recipe was delicious, so my only complaint was how rich and fatty everything was. Whole cream, oil, butter, cheese in MASSIVE quantities - it would've been nice if she offered ways to lighten them up. It's just not a sustainable way to eat, unless you've given in to the American propensity for obesity. Even better - I'd love it if she offered a healthy cooking class! I'd sign up ASAP.

Prices for each tasting vary between wines...the average seemed to be around 3-4 bucks per taste. Conveniently located on top of the wines are a little description of what the wine is made of and where it's from.  It's great because then you don't have to go up to the bartender every time you want to try something new.  You can just browse around and do it yourself which is both fun and un-intimidating for wine noobs that just wanna try stuff out.The atmosphere is nice and the decor is welcoming.  Their set-up is not so accommodating for large groups, but they have a fair amount of seating available.  Definitely can see myself coming back here!

The last time I went in there, they were selling pumpkin noodles, and I was scurrred to try them.  But once I got home, I was kicking myelf for not.  I mean, the prices here are ridiculous cheap, so what did I have to lose?  Ugh, still kicking myself!Fall is here, and Winter is coming, time for some noodle soup!  Time for a trip to Mei Mei Noodle Factory!

I was in foodie heaven, and the impeccable service made the experience all the more memorable. His favorite of the menu was the squab, and mine the beef tartare. For those looking to dip their toes into the exciting world of molecular gastronomy, Enotria is a fantastic place to start. Foams, pearls, reductions, liquid nitrogen crumbled cheese - so tasty and so inventive. The sommelier also gets big props for perfect pairings that made the dishes all the more outstanding. The Dr. F. Weins Prum Ürziger Würzgarten Riesling served with my fiance's (!) pork belly was particularly illuminating. Friday evening was unforgettable in so many ways. I said yes to my best friend. I cried tears of happiness enough to rival the pouring rain outside. I had a phenomenal meal in a classy restaurant that I will gladly cheer on from the rooftops.And I learned a secret that no one tells you about getting engaged. All that champagne and celebratory wine will do you in, and you've never had a hangover quite as awful as the day-after-the-engagement hangover. ...what, just us?
<review# 2162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/28/2012,2/3/2013,364,232,4,16,7>I came here for the first time with my sweetie for a late dinner. We were supposed to go to Boiling Crab but the wait was too long and we were starving (what's new, we are always starving, lol).We arrived at 8:00pm and we were seated immediately. No wait on a Saturday night? Pretty cool compared to the 30 minute wait at Boiling Crab.Our server gave us menus and asked if we've ever been there before. My sweetie couldn't remember (go figure, lol) and my reply was no. She then explained to us about how the menu works and how we pick the level of heat and which flavor we prefer for our meal. We wanted crawfish! Unfortunately that day they were out of crawfish! DARN! We ordered a pound of shrimp and a pound of muscles with the thick blast flavor which was butter, Cajun, garlic and some herbs and spices in the third degree. Zero is no heat and 5 Alarm is the spiciest. We also ordered a side of Cajun garlic fries.The Cajun garlic fries came out first and they were piping hot with the perfect crunch on the outside and slightly soft on the inside. The flavors were wonderful! Lots of garlic and Cajun seasonings, I'm so glad our waitress recommended this! A few minutes later we got the shrimp and muscles, both neatly placed in plastic bags. The bag was so hot we had to let it cool for a few minutes before digging in. The large shrimps came head on, just the way I like it. There were lots of wonderful flavors with a lot of garlic and spices. The muscles were also very tasty. My sweetie and I couldn't finish our dinner so we took a good amount home.Food was really good! I would have to say I like it more than Boiling Crab. It wasn't as salty, the restaurant is a lot larger with cute decorations, the wait wasn't crazy and the service was better. Our server constantly checked up on us and my glass of water was being refilled throughout our meal. We even got some coupons for our next visit! Good food, good service, I will for sure be back!
<review# 2163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2012,2/2/2013,92,91,12,12,9>Well.....personally I think this place is GREAT. And Let me tell you why.I just got back from LA the day before and I had korean food there. When I came home, I was REALLY craving korean food. So I stopped by here since my gram gram had to go grocery shopping. Walked in, greeted by this very kind waitress, and seated down with a menu. At first I was like, FUCK, THIS PLACE IS EXPENSIVE! But what I didn't realize is that they give you a shit load of side dishes, so I understand why. But anyways I ordered the Kimchi Tofu with beef. Only $8.88. Once the food came out, I was like OH SHIT! The food I had in LA was good but their portions were pathetic. Here, the portion was amazing. I mean the side dishes weren't filled up all the way but that's fine, cause my focus was on the soup.Food:The Kimchi Tofu bowl was pretty big. I mean not big as in a bowl of pho, but big as in big for a bowl of soup. They LOADED my bowl with tofu. They were not stingy AT ALL. Kimchi was fucking great. The beef tasted great. This soup was GREAT. It was medium spicy so it wasn't THAT spicy, but it was the right amount of spicy. They gave me an egg so I can crack it myself which I really liked because I wanted to do it. No no, but dude. The soup was great, I told you that. But you know what was also fucking great? THEIR SALAD! OMG! THAT SHIT WAS SO GOOD! I couldn't leave because I wanted to finish it. It has the right amount of sauce on it. The sauce was good too. Shit, it wasn't too vinegary. Unlike Oz's salad, where it tastes fucking gross. I loved their salad. The kimchi side dish tasted like it came from Costco.....so I didn't really like that. but the kimchi in my soup was good. Service: Really good. She was really nice to me and the way she said "Thank you very much" sounded very genuine and passionate cause she kept saying it over and over again. I didn't have a problem. She was really nice. Helped me with whatever I wanted. Refilled my water. Asked me if I wanted more side dished. She was great.Environment:I came really early so it was kinda slow. 4 other tables so I guess it wasn't so bad. The environment was nice. Big tv, nice tables, well spaced. I didn't like facing a blank wall, but that's totally my fault for sitting there. One thing I didn't like was that they DIDNT HAVE METAL CHOPSTICKS! I was like, where dem metal chopsticks at? It would've been authentic. But oh well. This place has really good kimchi tofu soup so I suggest you fucking try that shit bro. Their Salad is amazing and I'd literally just eat that with rice if I wanted to. Waiter is really nice, service is good. I would definitely go back here. No doubt.

<review# 2165,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/30/2012,1/31/2013,337,422,12,12,5>I'm enamored with that Zocalo swag!The DT location has it all, so them branching out could have been tricky! However, they did a fabulous job.Despite being insanely crazy, due to only being open for a week or so, we were able to secure a clutch spot on the patio. Slightly warm, but still really nice to enjoy the epic people watching. If you know those who live in the boughie infested area, you know how great of a land mine this place can be. Cougars on cougars on cougars, just to say the least....They have kept their quality of the important things, consistent - chips & salsa, and booze :) Unfortunately, this was our first stop in a mini tour around R-ville, so we didn't order entrees. But we were overly happy to see the new spot had the same gorgeous decor and vibe. The Strawberry Mojito (sorry bartender, I know you hate muddling the mint leaves) was refreshing, perfectly made. The three blackberry margs that were ordered looked fabulous as well. They are even super fancy here, tequila shots in champagne flutes - I'm not sure if that was a fluke or the norm, regardless it was classy!Definitely smaller in size (sorry I keep comparing it to their other location). But they are workin' with what they have. Great decor, def boughie vibe. I can't wait to get back and check out their menu and see what Chef Ryan has up his sleeve :)As all new places go, there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out, but I am confident in saying they will take care of those things. Parking in this shopping center sucks, I can foresee many parking lot fights for the sacred 8x6 spot of asphalt!Zocolo swag, know about it...
<review# 2166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2012,1/29/2013,466,199,6,15,14>I'm not a "gym person". I've never had a gym membership. I've visited some local gyms on a guest pass and couldn't get out of there fast enough. I liked yoga but it got too hot and too crowded and I wanted something that got me moving outside of the area my little mat took up on the floor. I tried working out at home but it wasn't as fulfilling as having someone else there to offer some encouragement. What to do, what to do...I joined Bodytribe in January because it was close to my house, I was acquainted with one of the trainers and I figured I needed to try something new. This doesn't sound like a recipe for success and it wasn't. The real reasons to check out Bodytribe were not yet known to me but they're the reasons I keep coming back. Here's what I've found in my seven months there:Community - I've realized that larger gyms didn't actually intimidate me. The negative feeling I had was the feeling of something missing. Walking into Bodytribe and being greeted by smiling faces (including smiling dogs and cats) makes all the difference in the world.Variety - Why do I find myself eventually getting bored when I try out new activities? Chalk it up to a lack of focus on my part or, if we're feeling generous, a high level of curiosity to try other new things. Either way, I know myself well enough to know that I need variety to keep my attention. Yoga is fun. Kickboxing is fun. Weightlifting is fun. Hitting tires with clubs is fun. At Bodytribe, I get to try a number of exercises for a more well-rounded workout.Theory - From time to time, I've found myself seated on an exercise bike or stomping on a treadmill for 20 or 30 minutes wondering, "why am I doing this and who told me this is what I should be doing?" Health and exercise has become such a mysterious industry that I've found myself trading common sense for common knowledge. Allyson, my trainer at Bodytribe, explains why we're doing what we're doing, how the body responds to certain exercises, what kind of reaction to expect and which muscles are working. I didn't expect a workout for my brain, but I'll take it!I've had some folks ask about cardio because they think of this as a weightlifting gym. Yes, there is cardio here. We jump rope, drag tires, run up the stairs of a parking garage, do burpees, carry weights overhead from one end of the gym to another, kickbox, juggle (not really, not yet at least), basically whatever works that day. Come with an open mind, be ready to try something new and find out what makes you keep coming back.

It was our favorite place to eat late night eats after some dancing and drinking (I'm since retired from the dancing part and the late night part LOL).  Sorry I'm getting to the point. . . . Monsoon was surprisingly tasty, elegant and right down my alley!!!My girlfriend and I came in for appetizers and drinks.  Our waitress, Jasmine, was fabulous!  She realized we had never been and recommended some items for us.  Those Tamarind Wings were covered in the best tasting sauce I've tasted in awhile, and I have tasted Lots of wings!!!  The lamb naan was full of tasty little lamb bits and filled us up fast!!I agree with Danielle O, "Tasty Twist on Indian!"  Our experience was enjoyable and fulfilling!  Now I'm going to have to convince my Hubby to join me on my next trip in and explore the menu a little more!

First came a basket full of warm, tasty rolls and salads.  Then came the our entrees, various proteins perfectly cooked.  Fish with butter dipping sauce.  Tender goat curry with potatoes.  A slightly spicy, rich oxtail dish.  They were all good. I don't normally first visit review.  I turn my nose up to those that do, but I feel compelled to spread the word.

<review# 2170,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2007,5/23/2008,48,27,13,6,6>I'm half Korean but really I'm a "banana", "twinkie", or any other moniker you can think of denoting yellow on the outside, white on the inside. Being raised by my Caucasian father, my exposure to Korean food and culture is rather limited. Up until two years ago I ate Korean food once or twice a year with my mother. Since my mother moved to Sacramento two years ago my exposure has increased although more to her home cooking which isn't necessarily authentic (but really good). So occasionally we'll venture out to one of the many Korean restaurants along either side of Highway 50, particularly those on Folsom Blvd. Last night we went to the quaint little Cho Dang Tofu House and judging from the Bi Bim Bop it may soon become one of my favorites. We shared two dishes, the seafood Bi Bim Bop and the seafood tofu soup. The Bi Bim Bop comes in a sizzling hot pot with a freshly broken egg on top that you promptly mix throughout in order for it to cook. The dish is made up mostly of rice seasoned with hot red pepper and garlic with the addition of a variety of seafood that included shrimp, oysters, and squid. The seafood tofu soup has a broth made up of what appeared to be hot red pepper,garlic and tofu with shrimp and clams. This second dish was rather skimpy on the seafood but was still tasty and filling. My favorite part of Korean food is always the 10 or so small dishes they bring prior to your meal arriving. These dishes range from pickled vegetables to marinated seafood. Of course you always get at least a couple kinds of kim chi as well. The service was great and my mom actually picked me up my own bona fide Korean friend. She stated aloud that we "should be friends and give each other our phone numbers". Never underestimate the power of a Korean mother to embarrass the hell out of you. Our waitress was this cute 28 year old Korean girl who moved here 7 years ago and recently graduated from Sac State. My mom decided we just had to become BFF's--she later told me we both "needed friends like each other". How the hell could she tell this? Special crazy Korean intuition perhaps?

<review# 2172,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2008,5/21/2008,148,83,7,17,14>My hubby and I just returned from the free Yelp dinner at Formaggio in the R.C. Here's my review by course...Bread--served warm with olive oil and roasted garlic. The garlic was a nice touch! I'm a huge fan of roasted garlic, and have not seen bread served this way in a restaurant. Yummy!Chef's antipasti--a few bites of blue cheese that tasted similar to Point Reyes Blue--creamy, rich, quite decadent. There were a few olives, another forgettable, mild cheese and some roasted red bell peppers. The blue cheese was stunning.Caesar salad--the dressing definitely tasted homemade. I am not a fan of croutons, but I ate all that were on my plate. Not only did they taste good, but importantly, they did what no other croutons do--came in tiny, bite-size pieces, and I did not break my jaw chewing them. Perfect!Rigatoni (roasted eggplant, smoked mozzarella and aged ricotta)--great on the cheeses! My husband described this dish as a sort of deconstructed lasagna. There were gobs of melty mozzarella throughout, so few bites were lacking cheese--always a bonus when it comes to eating pasta. The red sauce had hints of wine, and was light, consisting mostly of tomatoes and eggplant (my favorite). The aged ricotta was a welcome addition, but paled against the high flavor of the smoked cheese. This was the dish I ordered, but my husband and I split it, because it was the tastiest dish, and it was a large portion.Tamas Sangiovese--the red wine was smooth and robust. An excellent pairing with my red sauce.Shell pasta (chicken, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, broccoli, white wine and pecorino)--underwhelming. Where's the garlic? We added salt (something we almost never do), but it still was just -eh. And how come there were peas in there? This was the only bummer of the dinner, but we still had more than enough good food to fill our bellies, so we didn't take it personally.Tiramisu--I believe there are two schools of tiramisu: the ones that 1) taste like cheap liquor, and the ones that 2) melt in your mouth. This tiramisu was a mouth-melter! The thick ribbons of chocolate, the creamy custard layer, and the spongy cake came together perfectly. Even though I was stuffed, I ate my entire piece. And I'm pretty sure my husband licked his plate when he thought I wasn't looking. Thanks for the meal, Formaggio! Well done.

They were having a great time and they helped us have a great time too. Even if we were wearing our preppy work clothes. This is the side of you I really like Sacramento. The Jamie's side.
<review# 2176,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2008,5/16/2008,164,248,17,9,5>Some girlfriends and I hit the Park tonight. First we had a cocktail in the beautiful outdoor patio area. I think it might be part of Masons. That part was a little unclear. Anyway, from there we were able to walk into the Park without paying the exorbitant cover charge, which was nice. The music was a good mix of 80s to recent hits, heavy on the bass, which works for me.The crowd was mostly 20-somethings, ethnically diverse and 90% pretty people. Since I am pushing 40, I felt a little old for this club, but it made for good people watching. I learned that short-shorts with pumps are the hottest thing in club wear these days. Who knew?The mojitos were good, but a little pricey at $8.25.If I was 25, I'd be all up in the Park every weekend, but since I'm a little older than that, I might have to take my geriatric self back to The Cliff House, where I was one of the younger patrons.
<review# 2177,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2008,5/15/2008,242,141,10,21,21>Dedicated and responsive wildlife rescue organization run by volunteers. Visit their website and follow their specific instructions on what to do when you find an injured bird, mammal, or reptile.What do you do when a hawk chases four cedar waxwings into your plate glass window? You remember Amy P. talking about bird rescue on the Yelp threads and contact her for advice -- while looking up the information online.We've had birds run into our windows before, but never like this. As I was getting ready for dinner and my family's arrival, I heard four loud bangs on our backyard sliding glass door. I ran over and came face to face with a hawk, who almost slammed into the glass as well but was startled by my arrival. At first it appeared as if it was Hawk=4, Cedar Waxwings=0.The hawk flew to a nearby telephone wire to wait until I was gone. Figuring that sometimes birds may recover, I stayed and looked for signs of life while the hawk, well, watched me like a hawk. I walked away for a moment to tend to our dinner and came back to three remaining birds. A hawk's gotta eat, you know.One bird came around and looked as if it had a broken leg. Alan S. and the kids arrived, and it became our mission to help the remaining survivor. Props to hubby for retrieving the injured bird. We followed Amy P.'s advice on how to house the bird and called WCA.Even though it was dinner hour, I received a return phone call within 30 minutes from a kind volunteer who made additional calls to other volunteers who operate out of their homes. Although no one was able to respond that evening, the bird survived overnight and calls immediately came in the morning. I delivered the bird to a sweet volunteer in South Natomas who has been helping birds for ten years.The kids were happy to hear of the bird's survival and were entertained with hubby's story during breakfast that it was going to be rebuilt with bionic legs and anti-hawk missiles that would shoot out of its butt.UPDATE 4.10.08, one week later: so what happened to the birdie? I checked in with the volunteer and he was hurt pretty badly. Head injury, wing broken -- at the juncture where it attaches to his body. So badly that it punctured a lung and his body was swollen. But this guy's a fighter and is doing better daily. Prognosis is still unsure but optimistic; I'll be checking in again.UPDATE 6.4.08: Birdie survived and healed. We've rescued a duck since then and recently, a mother hummingbird has built her nest on a camellia bush outside our window. This year is for the birds.
<review# 2178,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2008,5/14/2008,726,863,8,13,9>I don't really eat Chinese food anymore. I used to eat it a lot and I am easily 15 pounds smaller than I used to be because I no longer do. However, on your birthday, you're allowed to eat whatever you want. There are two types of Chinese food. There's the pedestrian Chinese food that you get because it is cheap and it is a step above Panda Express. Then there's the Chinese food that you get only on special occasions or when there is a high likelihood that you will not be paying for it. Frank Fat's is the latter. I'm pretty much considered another one of the kids in my friend Dani's family. Dani's boyfriend's birthday is also only two days after mine. The boyfriend is also considered one of the kids in Dani's family. Frank Fat's was the perfect restaurant for her parents to take us to for our birthday dinner! In fact, if my parents were still alive, they would have probably taken me here for my birthday...my father has been known for hosting fancy Asian banquets with Martin Yan of "Yan Can Cook" after all!We easily got a 7-person reservation at the last minute on a Saturday night. It is walking distance from Old Sac (although the neighborhood looked a bit on the sketchy side at night...that's a lot coming from an Oakland girl...). The service was very attentive, the decor and ambience was very sexy, the bathrooms were clean, and the food was amazing. Dishes of note are the peking duck (which is only ordered by yours truly on special occasions) which can also be ordered as a half order, the appetizer platter (which is usually called a "pu pu platter"....not sure why it wasn't here), the hot and sour soup, and the garlic green beans. Other things to know: Even though they have a full liquor license, be sure to try the lychee martini that is appropriately made with soju. If you are a P.F. Chang's junkie, they will still make you a special spicy sauce (although, not at your table). While most Chinese restaurants require 24-hour advance notice for a Peking duck order, you can order Peking duck on the spot here. If you give them advance notice, you can have them marinade your own goose/pheasant/quail/ whatever that you hunted yourself! If it is your birthday, you get free slice of banana cream pie! (This is, of course, very odd for a Chinese restaurant, but whatever.)
<review# 2179,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2013,10/31/2013,1137,179,16,25,25>Oh Maggie, I love you! And I don't just say that to anyone. I'm so glad my friend Jenny N. introduced me to this place. This small Chinese restaurant just recently opened a little over a month ago. And I would have to say that this place is by far the BEST Chinese restaurant in Davis. The service and the food is just beyond magnificent. Located right next to a Chevron gas station, this place could look a bit shady outside and some tables could be a bit small inside but it's all about the food and the owner, Maggie :D Maggie has amazed all with her food and especially her personality and love toward everyone. To be honest, I haven't ate out this much in a row and especially not with Chinese food. I have nothing against Chinese food, but being half Chinese I have ate a lot of it throughout my life :P But once I stepped through the doors of Four Seasons, Maggie's food and generosity lured me into coming back constantly. I would have never thought that one of my favorite restaurants in Davis would be a Chinese place. It's crazy because Chinese food that is not homemade is usually really greasy. But not Maggie's! If I didn't skip 2 days (trying not to eat out so much), I would have been there 6 days in a row. So you can say I've tried quite of her dishes so far and all have been delicious! Everything was just right; like home cooked food.I could go on with why I love this place so much that I would come back everyday...1) BIG portions (filled up to the brim on paper plates!) for a very CHEAP price (all dishes vary between $5-$9)2) Lunch Special (Monday-Friday from 10:30am- 3:00pm) and these dishes come with white rice. (~$5-$6)3) Lunch Special is actually ALL DAY but it doesn't come with rice and rice is usually $1.00. Worth it because she always asks you if you want more rice and if you say no she insist anyways. 4) Food is never too oily5) Food is never too saucy6) Flavors for all the dishes I have tried have been just right7) BEST SERVICE I have experienced. Maggie always comes by your table to make sure everything is okay and she always asks if you want more food/more rice. She always makes small talk with you and makes sure that her food is perfect for you. The last time I went here (yesterday actually LOL), my friend and I decided not to get any rice but she insisted in giving us a small bowl of rice. 8) Bottle of water bottle is usually $1.00 and juice or soda is usually $1.50 but she has offered it to me so many times for free. She ends up giving me and my company water bottles because she knows I don't drink soda :P9) Maggie speaks Cantonese and Mandarin. So the first day I came I started speaking Cantonese to her and even though I am not fluent she understands every word I say; with a mix of English thrown in there :P In a way, she helps me improve my Cantonese a bit when she talks to me :D10) Lastly, Maggie is wonderful. She doesn't treat her customers as customers but more of her grandchildren. She is definitely like a grandmother to all. I seriously can't get enough of her. Like a grandma, she offers too many things for free like her Crab &Cream Cheese Wontons and/or her Sesame Balls. I ordered/shared too many dishes and all have been mouth-watering. Check out my pictures!Overall, this restaurant feels like home to me. Whenever I'm not in the mood for Chinese food, I always feel the need to go here because I love seeing Maggie and her warm smile and personality. Of all the times I have been here, I found myself giving her a hug whenever I arrive and leave. I have definitely become a regular of this restaurant that she even remembers me by my Chinese name :PHands down, best Chinese restaurant in Davis. Spread the word please! :)
<review# 2180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/8/2013,10/30/2013,910,555,14,24,14>ONE WORD and one word only.  DOISSANTS!!!!!I heard about the cronut about 4-5 months ago and have been obsessed ever since.  Never got to try one, of course..but desperate enough to plan a trip to NYC just to try my luck at waiting hours for Ansel's limited cronuts.  Fortunately for me, Sweet Dozen has perfected the recipe!!  Of course, they call them doissants because Ansel trademarked the term "cronut" but if you call in your order requesting cronuts, they'll know what you're talking about.So I saw an IG post in the morning when I first got to work when I found out about these scrumptious little pieces of heaven and couldn't stop thinking about them ALL morning.  I told my coworkers I'll be taking my full hour lunch break since it'll take half an hour to get there and half an hour to trek back.  SCREW LUNCH!  I called in my order around 12pm and was only able to order 6 because they limit it in the afternoon (but not in the morning).Once I arrived, they almost couldn't sell them to me but then I told them I called in my order and I was A-OK.  *HUGE SIGH OF RELIEF*  So they asked me whether I wanted glazed or cinnamon, jelly filled or custard filled.  I ordered 3 of each, checked in on Yelp and received a free chocolate donut!  Once I got in the car, it was action time!  I bit into one and fell in love!!  Crispy on the outside (you wouldn't believe the crunch), flaky on the inside, everything I expected and more.  The best $3 I've ever spent!!  I'd choose this over a slice of cake or cupcake ANY day.I saved one for my sister and she didn't eat it until about 10 hours later and wasn't impressed.  She said it was good but doesn't live up to the hype..however, that was 10 hours later.  Make sure you eat these FRESH!
<review# 2181,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/2/2013,10/29/2013,702,960,14,26,21>Caveat: I've never had fresh dumplings before.For you dumpling affecionados, I would welcome your opinion, but I must say that this place exceeded my expectations. A converted old house, Dumpling House has a patio outside and a small dining room inside. Walking in, I saw them making dumplings literally in front of me. That's how I knew they were super fresh. I also wondered what would've happened if I had an allergy attack when I walked in as there was no sneeze-guard over that stuff. There are a variety of dumplings including:* Vegetable* Chicken w/ sweet corn* Pork & veggies* Pork & kimchi* Seafood dumplingsI know there were others, but can't recall. Pricing-wise, it was about $7 - $8 for a dozen and an extra $1 if you wanted them deep fried, pan fried or in soup. We tried the pork & veggies pan fried and the chicken ones deep friend. Loved the pork ones - you could taste the fresh ginger and the pork meat wasn't gristle-y or chewy. Wished the excess oil could've been blotted off or something. The chicken ones were good too, just not as flavorsome in my opinion.The service was mixed. The young man seemed like he was just going through the motions but the older woman (I sense she's the matriarch of the place) was much more personable. She thanked us for coming in and recognized me when I came back to get more. We bought some frozen ones to take home. For $17.50 you can get about 50 of one variety. I actually counted 52. Makes for an easy dinner -- stick 'em in some broth with spinach or leafy greens and you've got yourself a winner!
<review# 2182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2013,10/28/2013,387,268,16,24,20>On a lazy Saturday, not in the mood to drive downtown, we decided to drive into Old Elk Grove.  I have to admit even though we live near, we Never go to Old Elk Grove, just a bit to country still. . .But I heard nothing but good things about Brick House and I remembered the large billboards they use to advertise with, so we headed on over.The place was buzzing!  Waiters running around, bartender whipping out drinks so we grabbed a high top table in the bar area.  Shortly after, a waiter came over, he explained he had a large party the kitchen was trying to get served plus a banquet going on all at the same time, if we were OK with waiting they would be able to take/submit our orders in about 15 minutes or so.  We greatly appreciated his honesty and agreed we were not in a rush.  As we sat patiently we observed our surroundings; this restaurant has an older feel, wood bar and tables, a few TVs with sports playing, a diverse crowd of people and to my Delight. . .A Happy Hour Sign (All day Sunday/Tuesday and 11:30-6 Monday-Saturday)!!!  Yay it was happy hour!! But based on the posted signs there is probably a few hours when it is Not.Once it was time to order, both Hubby and I ordered happy hour specials (house wine $3 and well whiskey $4) plus the prime rib french dip sandwich and the salmon salad sandwich with added bacon.  Sandwiches come with homemade kettle chips but of course Hubby added fries for an extra $1.  Our food took  no longer than 10/15 minutes, when it arrived we both were amazed by the portion size.  Our excitement grew once we discovered the flavor was just as big as the size!!! Wow!! My prime rib sandwich was full of thinly sliced beef and great horseradish cream mayo.  Hubby's salmon salad was on thick wheat toast, and full of salmon, crispy red onions and celery.  We both only ate half of our sandwiches.  Full and satisfied we ordered one more drink and declared we need to come back for dinner!Our server, Anthony, was very sweet.  He checked on us every 5 minutes.  He inquired about our meals, and also wanted to know how Hubby enjoyed his sandwich (he never thought to add bacon and plans to now he saw Hubby's sandwich).  And so cute, he even shook our hands as we left.  His mother raised him right!This was a nice surprise for us, and glad we ventured into Old Elk Grove for it!
<review# 2183,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2013,10/27/2013,222,224,8,12,10>After my VA appt, I promised the lil man some ice cream!  Luckily I remembered bookmarking this place and decided to try it out before heading back to Vacaville.Nice little place, easy to get to which is good for people like me who aren't familiar with Sacramento.  I parked in one of the spots right in front and headed in with my youngest two kids.  There were a few families inside and the workers greeted us as soon as we opened the door.  Love that they were playing the Beatles on the sound system.I saw that there were so many sandwich options and couldn't decide so I opted for the lunch special of the day which happened to be grilled cheese with chips, chili and a drink for $6.30 + tax.The grilled cheese was nothing special.  A typical grilled cheese on wheat bread.  The chili was delicious!  I'm a sucker for a great chili and the chili here was hearty and had the right flavors going on!  And duh, of course we ordered ice cream.  The lil guy wanted chocolate and "pink" which of course means strawberry.  I got a two scoop ice cream in a cup which was about $4 and some change.Talk about creamy!  Both flavors were "yummy!" as my 2 year old put it.  I'm typically not a fan of strawberry ice cream because of the artificial flavoring, but here??  I pretty much hogged that scoop all to myself.  It had real strawberry pieces swirled in which made it even more delightful.Check this place out when you want some great homemade ice cream!!

I assumed this was to control the quality and offer tasty food. I WAS RIGHT!I'm one of those really Asian girls who enjoy Laos style papaya salad, so I asked for it. It wasn't super fishy, but it was still pretty good, and it didn't give me stanky breath. I loved the Drunken Noodle dish. I asked for spicy and I sure got it! I asked for spicy papaya salad, so my tongue was still on fire, so who knows. I loved it! It had a great flavor that didn't leave me feeling like I ate a plate of grease.Fried banana with coconut ice cream --- DELICIOUS! My boyfriend and I had no problem devouring it. We'll be back. So glad this place is here. I would encourage you to look diagonal to Thai Basil on the corner of 25th and J, and check out this place. I found my new J-spot. YEAH!Other things I've tried on subsequent visits that I would also get again: -Tom Yum Soup with tofu - fresh ingredients, light, and delightful. -Papaya Salad (regular non-fishy one on the menu with medium spice) - sweet, zesty good. Those peanuts were even delicious!-Green Curry with chicken and brown rice - GREAT. Their brown rice is light & fluffy.-[Pad] Se Ew with chicken - tasty sauce coating the noodles and veggies. Made sure every last bit was devoured.-Chicken Larb - HOW? How is this so good?!
<review# 2185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2013,10/25/2013,728,233,7,17,15>Every item in the menu is 475 calories or less. Really? Had to give this place  a shot. Let me cut the fat and get to the main points.Customer service? By far the best. The servers knows their menu well. Very well. I had Mingo(?) as our server. After ordering, he gave me 3 samples of cab to pair with my entree. If i didn't like it, I didn't have to get. And there was no pressure whatsoever.The food? I had the filet mignon in medium rare. Clean, healthy, and savory. It was the right proportion. It wasn't too heavy, and you would have more than enough room for their bite size desserts!One favorite thing I like about this place - Live piano music. SWOOONEDDD!!!
<review# 2186,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/3/2013,10/24/2013,161,58,9,14,12>As you walk into the lobby of the Double Tree Hotel and past the registration desks you'll come across a small double door entrance with a big RJ's on it.  It seems small because they place that door on the very corner of the club, but as soon as you walk in the full scope of the club comes into view.  They have 2 levels where you can hang out.  The Upper level has seating in regular chairs and padded seating along the walls.  The lower level has counter height tables where you can either stand or find a stool.  The bar stretches about 3/4 the length of the wall and over in the corner there are a couple pool tables and a dart board.  It looks like a big sports bad but if you removed most of the tables and the chairs you could totally see this place being a night club/lounge.The food was good but not memorable.  It pretty much the standard bar fare.  I had buffalo wings, BBQ pork sliders, and other assorted mini bites. I didn't get a chance to test the bartenders mettle with cocktail orders this time.  All i wanted was some cold beers for the hot weather.   They had about 6-10 beers on tap and a fully stocked bar for any kind of cocktail you want.The servers were attentive and i didn't feel like i was being neglected at all.  The 2 bartenders there were a lot busier, trying to fill everyone's drink requests but they had a good attitude still.Overall i though this place wasn't that bad.  It had a lot of places to sit and relax and if you get hungry they have food.  Now if you get bored there are pool tables and darts you could play with or you could play Buzztime trivia on the many TV screens they have around the club.  All this and plenty of drinks, so you can do it all with your favorite libation in hand.
<review# 2187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2013,10/23/2013,202,243,11,19,17>I am very excited about this restaurant. Mexican food for nice occasions is a fantastic idea and one that has been missing on the dining scene in Sacramento. It's a nice space with warm colors, black chairs/booths and white linens on the tables. The waitstaff opens the door for you when you enter and exit. It's a classy place. My sole problem with it is their astonishingly bad choice in music. It shouldn't be that hard. You are an upscale Mexican place. So I dunno, why not play some upscale Mexican music, amirite?!?! Instead, this place had on the worst Internet music station in existence - elevator/on-hold music with some "Rock Around the Clock" (not even kidding). I sincerely hope that they figure out how to match the music to the vibe. Aside from that one issue, the place is on-point. Our waiter was excellent - friendly, knowledgeable, not stuffy. But it is the food that deserves top billing in any description of this restaurant. To start, you are brought complimentary chips and salsa. Both are hearty, rich and delicious. Then, after placing orders, you are brought a taster from the chef - last night it was a mini beef empanada with a delightful sauce. The menu is large and impressive. I plan to go back so I can sample more of it, since we both got a mole last night. He got the Mole Poblano (the mole I have had at other places - dark and chocolate-y) and I got the Pipian Mole (a green mole - light yet complex - recommend this one, which I have never seen elsewhere, for sure).Both moles were excellent. They were presented so nicely too. I really appreciate the fine detailing that went into our meals. And then! The best part of our fantastic meal was absolutely dessert!! We got the Tulipan de Frutas and wow-o-wow. It's gorgeous to look at. The chocolate tulip/cup it comes in resembles stained glass and the flavors of the chocolate with the orange mousse and varied tropical fruit were just outstanding. Make sure you save room for it!!!!!!!! (That's actually !! for infinity cuz that's how sincere I am about the marvel of this dish!) Okay, end game - the service - warm and wonderful. The food - will impress the hell out of you. The place - definitely worth coming to again and again. Make sure you add it to your list of places to visit!

I don't say this much, but their menu was very easy to read with pictures to illustrate certain entrees. I went with my usual: rare steak and tripe pho. Even though I'm trying to eat less and slower these days, the Chinese in me had to get the medium sized bowl because the price difference between the small and medium was minimal. Some Yelpers say Pho Le's portions are big. When my server brought out my food, I was like "pssh! This ain't nothin'." Not until I started diving into my food did I realize that it seemed endless to finish. The bowl is deceivingly full of food, people! Anyway, the pho was great. The broth was light and flavorful and hot enough so that even my last piece of steak cooked (either that or I was eating really fast again). I thought the noodles were a little bit overcooked but it's okay. They garnished my steak with sliced chives and onions. As a person who likes little details, I really appreciated it.The service was wonderful. The ladies warmly greeted little ol' me, kept my cup full, and made sure I was doing alright. Too bad Pho Le is so far from home. Otherwise, I'd be a regular here.

The food is just flat out tasty and satisfying every single time. Service is excellent, portions are plentiful, price is great and the atmosphere is relaxed. Last night I picked up take out for dinner. Sat at the bar and chatted with the friendly bartender over my PBR while I waited for my order. Half BBQ chicken, spicy collard greens, creamy macaroni and cheese, a pound of wings and cornbread. At $22 this was a great deal- and I still had enough leftovers for a full lunch.The smell of my dinner sitting on the passenger seat and the anticipation of our reunion made my stomach water. I made it only 10 minutes down the road before I was sneaking my finger in and licking up that bbq sauce. Once home I immediately tore open the to-go boxes and went to work. The succulent moist tender chicken when lightly touched fell straight off the bone and into my mouth. The greens were perfectly spicy and not bitter at all. I devoured the mild and creamy macaroni & cheese and moist cornbread with light crusty outside. The wings have this addicting spicy seasoning- not sauce. I'm a saucy wing lover so I was expecting to hate these once I realized they were dry but I was pleasantly impressed.I have an amazingly picky three year old when it comes to food. Sandra Dees is one of few restaurants where I can trust she'll clear her plate. As soon as she was in the car and smelled the to-go goodies she exclaimed "Mmmm yummy!" -a first for her to be excited over dinner. Even she knew the delight we were in for last night.They also have a happy hour $5 Sliders with side dishes and $2 PBR, House wine and well cocktails too.I love you Sandra Dees. Thank you.

A bit smaller than the competition (lessay, Icing on the Cupcake), they use quality ingredients and have creative combinations.I had the maple bacon. Yes, you heard right, BACON (here's to you Cesar R!). A crisp slice sits atop maple buttercream frosting. The cake is vanilla - more dense than fluffy. These were a hit! Then came the strawberry shortcake (I think that was the name). Fluffy vanilla frosting topped with a slice of strawberry with vanilla cake. The best part was the surprise slice of chocolate-covered strawberry.Finally the Death by Chocolate. These were the first to go. Chocolate cake, chocolate frosting and a cone of chocolate to top it off. Decadence.Although they don't have much of a cupcake case, so best to call ahead to make sure they have the flavors you want if it is a large amount. If you pre-order, it's obviously not a problem. The Groupon price point certainly helped at $18 dozen instead of $36 (they may have a discount for a dozen here). Unless there is a hefty discount for ordering by the dozen, value-wise, I'd be more inclined for the occasional single cupcake indulgence.

The food was on point, the staff was like family, and for the INSANE amounts of meat they use in their sandwiches the prices are juuuuuuust right.The only difference between this location and the one in SF is that there's not a RIDICULOUSLY long line wrapped around the block during lunchtime. This in and of itself caused me to bump it up the additional one star .Legislature schmegislature. To me, Sacramento is fast becoming the Sandwich capitol of the world!
<review# 2196,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2011,1/25/2012,268,316,5,10,11>I finally made it to the squeeze after all these years of hype, and yes it was all I had imagined it to be and more.The cheese skirt was fantastically crisp and decadent. Sure the burger was dripping with grease, that's how it's suppose to be! The fixins were fresh as all get out, especially the gourmet pickles. The meat was very pink but that's how I like it! The bread was amazing too, so soft and fluffy, like a sesame seed cloud.The fries were normal fries, done right with the right saltiness. Sweet potato fries were very good as well. I was there on a quiet Wednesday night, no lines, fast service. They even came by to ask us how everything was a couple times, love that. I think the stars were aligned for the squeeze tonight!
<review# 2197,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/23/2011,1/23/2012,317,342,10,12,9>Came here after seeing it was such a new place and wanted to get the first review in, but sadly saw I was going to be beaten to it, so I waited it out.  The place is charming with wood flooring, and you can smell the new remodel.Our server came quickly and were given some nice bruchetta that had a nice blend of olives, capers, onions, red peppers and other tantalizing bits.  We passed on the cocktail menu, but it was definitely eye brow raising which we will try another day.  We started with the cornbread skillet at the suggestion of our server,  and I high fived him after we took it down quickly.  It was a hot round skillet with a jalapeno jelly and honey butter.  Inside the cornbread was bacon, which gives it a slight salty and savory flavor, but GOOD GOD THAT HONEY BUTTER!!!  It is not overly sweet, but you really taste the honey!  My girlfriend couldn't decide between one of the po' boy sandwiches or fried chicken and went with the latter, and didn't regret it!  There was plenty of food on the plate, as it had a breast, leg and thigh which were well seasoned, crispy, not over heavy or greasy.  It also came with mashed potatoes and sausage gravy (heavy but sooo good!), a large biscuit (with MORE HONEY BUTTER!) and some savory greens that were perfectly cooked and not spicy like I've had at other places.  I had the short rib hash, which was really good.  It was tender, plenty of it not doused in adobo barbecue sauce, on top of an over easy egg (oh gooey yolk, you are so good to me!) some tender greens and sweet potato mash.  This was my dilemma.  I wanted to give this place 5 stars, but this sweet potato mash was too much.  It was smooth, and it had a orange zest to it, which was good, but it was overpowering where I couldn't really taste much of the sweet potato.I can't wait to come back to try the po' boy sandwiches and the fried okra others have spoken about, and the cocktails, especially hanging out in the front patio during the warmer days.  Nice location, great service (they even sell gift certificates although they are new), and great food!
<review# 2198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2011,1/22/2012,319,199,17,18,20>During the great sandwich famine in the winter of 1732, there was little hope for struggling families across the Hungarian countryside. That was until Drewski's arrived and elevated an entire nation out of hunger and into a national food-coma. Okay, perhaps my history is a little off but it's really more of a sandwich parable to teach children the importance of creativity in sandwich making. Clearly, the Drewski family knows this all too well... allow me to demonstrate:BREAD                   =======CHEESE                ~~~~~~~MACnCHEESE     ))()((())()((BBQ PORK            //\\\////\////\\\CHEESE                ~~~~~~~BREAD                   =======Notice anything strange there? Yea, it's like some kind of narcoleptic chef strolled into the kitchen one afternoon to make a grilled cheese (and passed out). Then woke even hungrier than before and thought "I'm gonna add some of that BBQ pulled pork to my grilled cheese" (then passed out again).  Then woke again thinking "I'M STARVING!!! this bowl of homemade mac n' cheese is going directly IN THE SANDWICH!!!"Allright, so there you have it. The Hemi sandwich. I should add that this thing is fat and heavy as hell. I will also echo the previous comments on the deep fried mac n' cheese balls and tater tots. Both are pretty great, but the mac n' cheese balls are uniquely delicious. While these guys are clearly awesome, I always like to throw out a few improvement points or wishlist items for consideration. My Drewski's Wishlist includes:- Jalapenos or cherry peppers in my mac in cheese (or on the sandwich) Spicy mac n' cheese is just plain awesome. I add Franks red hot or buffalo sauce to any and all mac n' cheese at home.- Fatter bread and a little less butter/oil. I would prefer a little more crunch to the bread and maybe texas toast sized slices to hold that mountain of dreamy comfort food. As is stands, the existing bread gets a bit soft/mushy under the weight of these monster sandwiches. - Steak or natural cut fries would be rad. Onion rings would be killer. As much as I like tater tots, I almost always prefer good fries.- Along with the previous suggestion, how about putting fries and/or onion rings ON a sandwich. I mean really, A Hemi with BBQ sauce and onion rings in there? How about some slaw on there as well. I think I just got fatter writing that sentence.===================================In closing I have to mention that the staff running the truck are  incredibly friendly. While I agree with the folks who rated 3 or 4, I have to bump up to 5 for service, creativity, and price. Drewski's delivers some really interesting and delicious items at crazy reasonable price, and with fantastic service.

But he not only talked the talk, but walked the walk, and in spite of claiming earlier that "no such thing will touch these lips" - - boy took them down nicely and actually enjoyed them.  I underestimated him!  I really enjoyed it too, as whatever "sweetbreads" actually are (we're still not sure... heck, they were not sure.... pancreas?  other body parts?  kidneys?  reach in and yank out whatever?) Waterboy did a great job in cooking whatever they were.  Excellent dish, and given that I have never really been somewhere where this dish was offered - - kudos to them.Having said all that, and adding to that the fact that I would go again - I still hesitate to give it 5-stars only because it didn't blow my MIND in one way or another.  It's a very solid 4-stars, or even 4.5 stars, in my mind....Service was also really nice.  Our waitress was  friendly, and helpful.  She hit it off amazingly well with Archie... but being the chic-magnet he is, he took it in stride and remained cool.  Afterall - she was pretty, but she was no J.Lo or Annette Benning.  :-)It's a charming place, that feels more like patio dining than indoor dining.  They have outdoor "real" patio dining, too, but even eating inside feels wide open and airy.  I have not frequented Sacramento much, and had no idea such places even existed, so all in all, this was a true pleasure to see.  There were many restaurants on that street that I'd have also liked to try - and all were bustling during the early evening times.So the sommelier-by-default proved that his sister, the wine-gal, did in fact exist by bringing a wonderful bottle of wine to accompany the dinner.  We swirled, and talked about how the wine was breathing, yadda yadda, and then just took down the bottle of wine as we had not a clue.  It tasted good, that's all we knew.  Gulp gulp.  And the cheese plate we ordered  -  also really good.  Boy, those toasted bread pieces were YUM!Believe it or not - after all this, we even had coffee and dessert.  Coffee was actually quite good - better than I expected, and it was bottomless as it was filled any time it was half-empty.  The desserts... well, take me, Jesus... excellent apple crostada with vanilla ice cream, and a chocolate cake that near choked me on the first bite from being so rich.  I can't even remember what it was called!  Holy smokes. Good company, good food, and good drinks.A girl can't ask for more on a Friday night!!!

It's not a bad place, it's just not my first option. So I joined her for lunch and decided to people watch while she enjoyed her meal. We were seated drinks came, food came, we laughed...more drinks. Then something caught my eye...Two girls chatting away in a booth oblivious to the world, having an intense conversation about shoes...but what really caught my attention wasn't the shoe conversation; it was the dangling spider right above their heads. It dropped, swayed in the temperature controlled breeze, dropped a little more, swayed, the anticipation was killing me. I couldn't believe it. I figured they had to see IT. I was a table away and I could see it. I laughed, and asked my friend if she could see the spider...her look of disbelief said it all. Suddenly the spider continued its decent from the ceiling, after "hanging out" for a few minutes and dropped right into one of the salads. It scurried under a lettuce leaf as I was about to warn them, but I was too late...one of the girls screamed and jumped out of her seat. She backed away from the table and asked for a manager, and after her reaction I made the decision to sit back down instead. I was too late anyway. The waitress ran over to the table because of the commotion.Spider girl: GET ME A MANAGER RIGHT NOW!Server: is there a problem?Spider girl: yes there's a bug in my salad!Me: (whispering to my friend) actually it was a spider.Server: I'm sooo sorry, let me take that salad out of hereSpider girl: GET ME THE MANAGER!Server: ok, I'll go get himA few minutes later....Manager: what seems to be the problem?Spider girl: I don't know if your server here told you, but there was a bug in my salad.Me: (whispering) a spiderManager: I'm sorry for the inconvenience; you don't have to pay for your meal.  Is there anything I can do for you?Spider girl: I just wanted to let you know this is the worst restaurant I've ever been to... I've NEVER had this happen to ME before. Manager: Can I get you anything else, another salad?Spider girl: NO, my friend and I are leavingThe two girls stormed out of the restaurant so fast I didn't even get a chance to tell them what really happened. OK fine I wasn't planning on getting involved after she screamed. I'm not holding this against the restaurant; it's not their fault. Our server was great, and we didn't find any insects in our salad. Lesson learned from people watching that day. 1. Don't overreact. They're probably going to give you a free meal anyway, right? Instead calmly ask for free drink or wine to calm your nerves. (It couldn't hurt.) 2. Check the ceiling above your table before you sit down to eat, a "bug" might be dropping in when you least expect it.

<review# 2204,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2007,6/15/2007,71,109,7,6,7>Thai Hut is a full service restaurant.  Thinking that this was a fast food restaurant, due to "Hut,"  I never partook until recently.  Tuk (rhymes with Duke) is one of the famous ladies there who sat me down.  Immediately, I heard the dry sense of humor towards her regulars:  "So when you going to adopt me?"  "You been sick?  I take care you.  I make you soup every day."  "You cannot have this (dessert) until you finish your dinner." "See you tomorrow."Cleverly placed face up were the dinner specials.  All under or around $10, I ordered the pumpkin curry with beef, ordered mild.  The Jasmine steamed rice was extra.  When dinner arrived, I discovered that the aroma of curry and pumpkin do not mix.  Switching over to mouth breathing, this was actually pretty good and the serving slightly more plentiful than dishes ordered at either Amarin Thai Cuisine or A Taste of Thai.  Also, ordering mild, there was a little bit of a pepper bite to my order... just right.  Tuk talked me into ordering the standard F.B.I.  (fried bananas and coconut ice cream).  Overload, the coated dessert was more than I could handle.The atmosphere for the evening was so relaxing and comfortable, that I pulled out a book and started to read.  Tuk came by to see how I was doing and said, "Please stay.  We clo' at 9:30pm tonight."  It was around 7pm when she said that and she never handed over the check.  During my 40 minutes or so of reading, she passed around the famous 1" square coconut cake.   NOT bad.  More coconut than cake.Looking up at the time, I almost forgot that I needed to meet with someone in Roseville.  I beckoned Tuk for the check and told her I had to go.  "You cannot go yet.  It not yet 9:30."  "You come back again, yes?"Upon leaving the restaurant, I noticed that Tuk's work wasn't done.  She was taking down orders at a table with 3 middle aged guys seated there.Tuk:  Okay handsome, what you want to order?Guy:  Oh, I like this restaurant already!I laughed all the way to the car and yes, I am going to return.  Situated at a shopping center, parking is most likely available.  The dish quantity is slightly larger than than the 2 restaurants mentioned above.  Tuk mentioned that the dishes were home made and the ingredients fresh.  I did notice that my order was chunkier than normal.  For now, this my favorite Thai restaurant when in Sacramento.

Nice interior decor, too!Very good kabobs (we tried lamb, chicken, and beef), excellent rice, bread, sabzi (greens), feta cheese, and above all, excellent soda (I hate it when restaurants bring you your $1.75-Coke in a can with no refills!). If you've tried Famous Kabob or you're in the mood for good Persian/Iranian food, head out here because you'll leave very satisfied. Perhaps even more satisfied than the morning after your wedding night. Perhaps.

I digress: The culprit, as we all know, is a fresh/right-out-of-the-oven PIZZA. I think most can relate... That said, gear yourself up for some blistering with your visit to Zelda.

Now, how does the PZA rate? I'm no critic so I'll leave it up to my dog, Pearl, to illustrate this necessary conclusion. Having received a 'to-go' pie, I failed to see the results of leaving the boxed eats on the kitchen drain-board while I visited the B-room to freshen up; Just a short visit. That visit was long enough for her to consume the entire contents of said box. I checked the roof of her mouth and -sure enough... Need I say more? And, just for the record, I gave Pearl a pat on the head and a hug to convey that the greatest dog to ever live, deserves the best pizza Sacramento has to offer.

This bad boy is getting devoured tonight!  Tender, juicy, perfect.  Served on some delicious toasted rolls with lettuce, tomato, and (what might be garlic) mayo.  Definitely one of the best steak sandwiches I've ever had.And no, I didn't give my hard-headed boyfriend one of the sandwiches.

Must be a good sign to see so many big diesel-hemi-like trucks in one spot. They looked out of place but just kept rolling right on up, one after the next. It was like a parade of big strong hungry men. *single ladies take note*Tuesday's special is a Pulled Pork sandwich. Went with Alex L's recommendation- and thank the gods I did. That sandwich was heavenly. Perfect amount of sweet and tang. The house is also fantastic. A junior size would fill almost anyone, except maybe those construction guys. Their sandwiches looked to be as long as their arm.The deli walls are filled with beverages, various beers and snacks. A long line usually winds itself around the eisle so fax your order in to skip the wait- the order form is on their website. If you do wait in line, have your order ready when it's your turn or you'll feel like you just got kindly scolded by your Grandma. Not that they're mean, but serious about their sandwiches. Seating is all outside- I'm still not knocking off a star. I'd freeze for this.I highly reccommend Roxie to anyone in the East Sac or River Park area. Heck- I drive across town on my lunch to grab a sandwich to-go. Love you Roxie!

My first time out was for a Yelp event ages ago and I thought I should revisit to have a paid experience. Love how this remodeled house transformed itself into a warm, chic and classic establishment. Who would've known it was once home to a used clothing store? I had their house gin and tonic ($3) which hit the spot on a hot day. Also tried the:* Fried pickles ($4) - The pickles are house made and still retain their crunch through the crumbed batter. Very interesting combination that would go well with beer. * Mac and cheese ($4) - What I liked about the mac and cheese was the zinginess of the cheese - it's made w/ Arrogant Bastard ale and Widmer Cheddar.* Angus burger ($12) - Served with fries, the angus burger ordered "medium" came out just the way I like it, cooked through with some color. The house relish was what really made it for me. The upstairs is intimate and would be great for a small company holiday dinner or private party. Though on the small side, the patio area would be lovely on a hot summer night as well. Sitting with fellow Yelper Theresa F, I skimmed the cocktail menu and decided that I need to test some of these out at the next visit. Chatting with the bartender, I spotted a drink on there that caught my eye:Me: "Oh! There is a cocktail named after me!"Bartender: "Really? Sexy Beast?"Me: "Er...no. Breakfast at Tiffany's."[Awkward silence]Well at least he didn't say: "Really? The Flying Dog Raging Bitch IPA?". Needless to say, I plan on returning and so does Theresa.
<review# 2212,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2011,5/6/2012,58,228,6,7,6>A review of organization/event:Pretty cool set-up. Great location with lots of parking and ample space for the lines. The tables and chairs were needed and very welcome. The music was a nice touch and the toy drive was very cool. I could see how they incorporated feedback from prior events, so props and an extra star for that.Not so sure about some of the other promotions, like massage and XOSO. Also wasn't so keen on the non-truck places, they felt more like a farmer's market or other event caterers, rather than something we'd see out on the street in town. There could have been a big sign with the map of who was where, as well as what was local vs. from out of the area.As for the food/trucks themselves, what a disappointment. I really enjoyed the mobile foods when I lived in LA, they have really made it an art. I wasn't impressed with the menus and especially the prices at this event. I don't have too much experience with Sac-based trucks, but this wasn't a good introduction. Over-reliance on frying stuff, hot dogs, emphasis on meat generally and pork specifically was a major turn-off for me. I don't do cheese or much meat, so my options were quite limited (although I did see some vegan options, none really sang to me).The lines were more than my level of tolerance for food. I showed up at 11:20, so there really shouldn't have been such insane lines already. I wanted to try some lumpia, but wasn't about to wait around all day for it. Everything was too pricey, especially for the lack of overhead. Maybe LA trucks do more volume and can keep it down, but this is Sac. C'mon, $4 for a ten ounce smoothie?The worst was watching the bacon truck cross off their sides, after crossing off three of the five entrees, at 11:25AM!!! How bad can you be as a business owner to run out of food that quickly? I mean, why even show up?All in all, I'll probably pass on the next one.
<review# 2213,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2012,5/5/2012,87,39,7,7,8>Ohhh Smashburger, thought you would be neck and neck with my favorite burger joint, but not even close!! I think my friends over-hyped it up. I'm not going to lie...it was good but not as good as my original and fav burger joint: Burgers and Brew!Like most burger joint, it's an order at the counter, but this place gives you a number and you they bring it out to your table. They have all type of burgers and you can add a lot of things too like a fried egg, bacon, ect. You can order you burger with a meal or just the burger itself, They have two size, the Smash Burger size, which is the bigger one and a smaller one; I think it is called a mini-smash. They also have sweet potatoes fries and fried pickles that you can get with on the side. They bring your food out in a medal wire tray and the burger. They have the burger split open; on the top bun it has the garnish including the lettuce, tomatoes pickles and onions and on the bottom bun it has the patty cheese and whatever you order with it.  This place have a good amount of seating with booths and some regular site down. They also have a lot of outdoor seating. Thank goodness! When I was the in there, they inside dinning smelt and felt like major BO (body odor).I ordered the Classic smash burger with an fried egg. Break down: All the garnish was fresh (+) but the lettuce was big, bigger than the bun and the patty, it was just harder to eat (-). They patty was like an home made, from the ground beef and none of the the perfectly circle patties you get from freezer (+), and it was was thin and not dry (+). It was too juicy, it got my buns all soggy and everything was dripping everywhere (-) The bun of the bread was really good too, big and fluffy with a fancy bread cut on the top bun (+). Everything in the burger was bigger than the bun, soOOOOooo freaken messy to eat! (-) Eventually I cut it in half to get a better bit out of it. A lot of stuff feel out because the meat was making everything slippery. Over all the burger was was really good. Better than most place. I'll give it 4.5 stars minus a little more for the BO smell. Next time I will get a smaller size to try with the side orders!
<review# 2214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2011,5/4/2012,523,171,7,10,9>I have been coming here since high school! We used to pile in the back of my truck in the wee ours of the morning, jammies, sleeping bags and all (ok sure this was after a bit of underage drinking).....but thank God Baker Ben's is open 24 hours!So basically I have been coming here for 20 years. YIKES. Now THAT'S loyalty!I came here around 9 am on a Friday (National Donut Day even!), and there was a LINE! They had run out of my favorite donuts, but that was fine because pretty much all of their donuts are amazing.The sweet ladies behind the counter are always smiling and so friendly.One downside, bring CASH, because you have to have a minimum order of $5.00 to use your ATM card.I plan on coming here for another 20 years. WOOHOO
<review# 2215,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2011,5/3/2012,903,380,19,10,12>After anxiously waiting and watching others get their sandwiches before me, I was about to dub thee Droolsky's.  Man, talk about envy.  I ended up eating tacos because I wanted to try both the pulled pork and short rib meats without getting the inevitable food coma, without overstepping my meager state worker lunch allowance, and well l got tacos because I'm Mexican.  What else am I going to order?  Quiche? Yeah, that was the plan.  I did order tacos.....an den this lactose intolerant added a Tricycle, Drewski's grilled cheese with havarti and some other amazing cheese.  Doh! All items were packed with flavor.  The short rib with spicy kimchi was especially terrific.   As a taco these are about as flavorful a $2 taco you are going to find anywhere.  I can do the math and figure out the sandwich version is probably great too.  I was planning to eat the Tricycle later, but that didn't go according to plan either.  Ha!  That was good too.  Good cheese, grilled using butter.  Simple.  Good.  I was there when the pre-order thing Katie B mentioned went down. I can't knock it though.  It was disappointing to wait, but it's gots to hard to make a buck in the food truck game.  I must also note Drewksi's offers primarily "Darren M yelp.com/user_details?us sandwiches" ie  meat and cheese.  Veggiecentrics might not be hip to it, but I guess the man named it Hot Rod Kitchen, not Photosynthesis Kitchen for a reason.  It sits a little heavy in the gut, but overall I'm sure I'll be down to do it all over again sometime soon.
<review# 2216,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/1/2011,5/2/2012,434,368,6,8,9>I was referred to the soft opening of this location by a friend of mine. They were offering free waxing for 3 areas. Score! I booked my appointment by phone and they were really accomodating with the reservations. They even gave me a reminder call the day before. On the day of my appointment, I was running all kinds of late so I called them to give them a heads up. If you're 10 minutes late to your appointment, you have to reschedule. Luckily I got in right in time. It's located in the Park Place plaza right by Bel Air. The facility is brand new so it's super clean and the decor is cute. I thought the red and black motif would have extended into the waxing rooms however it didn't  and the rooms  were kinda sterile; like a doctor's office. My waxer was named Jamila (sp?) and she was awesome! The 5 stars are mainly for her. She kept me distracted from the pain by talking to me the whole time and she was really knowledgeable about the process. They use hard wax here which took some time to cool down and harden, but I didn't mind because Jamila was cool. She's also damn subtle with her sales techniques because I walked outta the free wax appointment with a bottle of anti-irritation serum for $25. I'm such a sucker for sales people. I made my next appointment for a brazilian, normally $42, but it'll be 50% off because I'm still considered a new customer. Score again!

This place was turend onto us by some friends who go here so much the chef named the rolls after them! First I have to say you must try the Ryan special! It is tempura shrip with crab and avocado, covered with these tempura flakes, it is so good! Then I would say get the Ben special! ***I must warn you it is spicy!*** It has jalapenos on top with spicy sauce and crab and shrimp and other sauces, a must have! Then if you are still hungy get the Highway 65 roll. It is one of their signaute rolls.They can be a bit slow on your order but have patience becuase it is well worth the wait! You can always snack on some edamame or bbq tuna before hand if need be.If you can sit at the bar and ask for Peter! He is the best sushi chef there!The price is a bit more but you will find the value for the quality and quantity really high, you get your bang for your buck there! I can't wait for our next visit!!

Nice decor and friendly service.Really good all you can eat korean bbq! Best and only one in the sac area that I know of. They have everything from bulgogi to kalbi. And also have a regular menu fo those that dont want the all you can eat(I suggest the all you can eat). But since it is the only one, gives them the abilty to charge how much they charge($18.99 weekdays,$19.99 weekends). But since im a fan of korean food, I just keep goin back! The key is EAT ALL YOU CAN to get you moneys worth!PS-Your going to smell like bbq
<review# 2219,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2009,7/23/2009,35,25,3,4,2>I have lost a lot of weight since i moved off the grid and a big reason is probably because i am no longer eating at this place 3 times a week. It gets very crowded on the weekend because everyone knows how great it is. It is affordably priced and the service is good when you can get a seat. The only drawback is that they dont accept credit cards... not sure why they cant get a credit card system now that they are crammed full of people all the time... They do have an ATM up front.The best way to order at this place is to look at the vaarious white boards hanging around and order something that is a daily special. The best food I have ever had there has been off of the special menus.If you havent eaten here before, I would recommend checking it out... MAKE SURE TO GET THERE EARLYYou will wait 20+minutes to be seated if you get there in the late morning.
<review# 2220,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2009,7/22/2009,24,20,4,12,9>Since I gave 24 hr Fitness 1 star, I would like to give the polar opposite gym a similarly fitting rating, fiver.I've been going there for quite a few months now and am still just as in love with it as I was when I began.  It makes staying in shape not effortless, but easy.  The staff is very friendly and accessible.  In fact, everyone around there is pretty friendly.  There are little to no frat-bag/meatheads.  I mean there's some big dudes in there lifting, but not douches. it is also never really that crowded.  Lunch and 5-6 are about as crowded as it gets, and that it still very managable.  And if you go anytime after 8 it's a ghost town, which is nice.  The place is also kept up very well.The CAC also offers quite a few classes for free.  Having your own locker which comes with laundry service, makes coming even less of a hassel.  They have both a basketball league and a co-ed volleyball league.  The basketball is very competitive, in a good way, and the volleyball is light-hearted and welcoming.  They have a nice variety of cardio equipment, including a gem/beast called Jacob's Ladder.  The pool is nice and there's even a swim instructor out there a couple times a week.  Also features a full sized hot tub, sauna and steam room.  I am absolutely in love with the steam room.  It's a game-changer.  They have other stuff, too, but I'll stick to what i know.  Couple downsides are that the hours are pretty limited and sunday it's not open at all.  People may say the price is, too, but I justify it with ease.  Really dig this place.
<review# 2221,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/25/2008,7/21/2009,9,33,1,19,7>The Sac Ballroom is a big and cavernous two-story dance space, where people go to learn to salsa, waltz, tango, foxtrot, hustle (do they still do that?), and about 10 to 20 other kinds of social dancing in both group lessons and private. This is a cheap form of entertainment, education and fitness combined - a drop-in group class is only $7 and a class card can bring that down to about $5.50.  The main room has a huge wooden dance floor - 50 by 75 feet - lined with mirrors. The dance space is surrounded by a seating area where people can relax during breaks or before class. There's a snack bar area supplied with free munchies, coffee and a row of half a dozen immense Igloo water dispensers filled with icy cold water to slake your thirst after dancing, plus bowls of breath mints everywhere and private studios which you can rent to practice your moves in. There's lots of additional studio space on the second floor too, where smaller classes and private lessons are held, or to rent. Parking is free but it can fill up and spill out on the side streets. I've only been to the salsa group classes on Monday nights, which generally have between 30 and 60 participants, but there seems to be something for everyone, including country line dancing, same-sex waltzing and wedding dance preparations.  Each class is attended by a wide range of people of all ages - I've danced with nervous high school sophomores and assured octogenarians, but the average age is probably around 40. It's a great place to meet singles if you are so inclined, as you must rotate partners about every 30 seconds - at least in the salsa classes. There are lots of regulars and if you keep going you get to know the faces, dance styles and personalities quite well. Couples can opt out of the partner switching if they wish, although isn't it more fun to rotate?  The Ballroom is a little strange with its Astroturf-like-green carpet, white rope lights around the poles, and white, cast iron dance railings, but they've been there for over a decade so must be doing something right. It's not particularly intimate, and you might get more personal attention someplace else, but if you just want to try a beginning dance class without a huge commitment, this is the place.
<review# 2222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2008,7/20/2009,17,22,8,6,9>So, it's been woefully long since I've seen my mom (who lives in Florida). Tonight, as we shared stories in her kitchen after my very long day of traveling, my mom cut me off to say "By the way, your hair looks healthier than I have ever seen it. It's always been so thick and coarse that it looked unhealthy. Now it looks so sleek and smooth, I want to touch it! And the color is so nice!"She's absolutely right about the coarseness. I have no idea what is in those magical scissors of Dave's but my hair looks amazing, it's true. Apparently even after sitting on planes for eight hours!Anyway, since my mom now wants to come to CA just for a haircut, I thought it was appropriate to update my yelp review.
<review# 2223,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2009,7/19/2009,702,960,8,11,12>Came here kind of "early" like around 6:00. Had a charming server with curly hair and a British accent to boot. I made it just in time for happy hour prices, which means $1 off pints. I had a locally brewed hefeweizen (don't know if that is spelled right) and it was pretty darn good! Especially on a hot early evening when you've been driving in the crazy Sacramento heat. Had just your basic burger and paid extra for onion rings. Thanks Khan S. for the tip! They are very light and airy (if you can imagine onion rings being like that) with a beer batter. You can bite into them and not have the onion part slide out. Personal pet peeve of mine - feels like I'm eating worms or something when the onion comes out of its deep fried tube. They have an impressive wine list, but my mind was not set on wine - especially when I see the word "brew" in their name. Overall, a good experience! The burger was tasty and grilled just right, the onion rings were fantastic and plentiful. The brewsky was cold and served up with a lemon.
<review# 2224,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2008,7/18/2009,194,575,2,2,3>This was a fun find the other day as I was wandering around in the hours preceeding Second Saturday Artwalk. I found a copy of "War and Peace", the exact edition I wanted, in very good condition for $8.95 - score! The man who runs the place was great, helpful, and as I was making my purchase, commented (in regards to Tolstoy) that he suggested I start with "Anna Karenina". I replied, "I already did!" :-) He said  this one dragged a bit in spots but was still good. Good customer service. Seems like a great little used book store!
<review# 2225,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2008,7/17/2009,109,241,3,4,5>So after driving past this place hundreds of times, I finally decided to try it out last Friday.  In the week since then, I've been back three times.  Needless to say, my roommate and I are fans.  The staff is really nice, but I didn't find them to be over the top like other reviewers.  Maybe they've toned it down a bit.  It is pretty clear that there's one employee (the manager, I presume) that totally runs the show.  He's my favorite sandwich maker.  My roommate wanted a strange combination the other day and he actually warned me that it might not be very good.  He volunteered to put the sauce on the side so that if it was bad, it wouldn't ruin the entire sandwich.  Turns out, my roommate liked it but I thought it was nice of him to make the suggestion.On to the food...I really love the crunch bread.  I'm always a fan of Dutch Crunch but I think this might be my favorite.  It is soft yet still crunchy.  Sometimes places make it too hard and it hurts my mouth a little bit.  The toppings are always fresh and they're very good about getting my order correct (I tend to be complicated).  I like the fact that the sandwiches are full but not overly stuffed.  I feel like I'm getting my money's worth without spilling food all over the place.  I like the special sauce and the bomb sauce a lot.  The bomb sauce sounds spicy but it really isn't.  I have zero tolerance for spicy food and it has good flavor but I've never found it to be too spicy.  So far we've had the "turkey club", "the governor" and the "one and only".  We've been satisfied with all of our selections.  All in all, The Sandwich Spot has found a loyal customer in me...especially because I've already filled up my Frequent Buyer Card so my next one will be free.  Wooooo hoooo!!!!
<review# 2226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2008,7/16/2009,6,2,4,9,9>I found Magic Salon on Yelp, when I was desperate for a haircut and needed a change from the stylist I'd been seeing for quite some time. I was eight months pregnant and HAD to have a change. Magic was able to get me on the schedule really quickly, and Mason gave me a haircut that I LOVE. It has been so easy to take care of -- and looked good through my last month of pregnancy, labor and birth! Now that I'm starting to get back to everyday life I will go back and see what Mason can do next for me. This haircut has made me feel sexy and pulled together despite all the post partum hormones!The salon was hip and urban, tucked away in a little building off of Franklin Blvd. and Freeport/12th Avenue. There's a lot of original art and decor, and the funky, comfortable vibe was welcoming and relaxing. Not as relaxing as Mason's head massage, though! If I won the lottery, I'd book Mason to wash my hair every day. Something I really like about the salon is that Magic and Mason are open on Sundays -- really rare for a salon of this quality. In short, I'm a loyal Magic Salon client now, and can't wait to go back for my next cut.
<review# 2227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/26/2008,7/15/2009,18,25,3,9,4>If money is no object, then shop at Bel Air.  Hey, it's the Pocket, not Meadowview, what do you expect - RALEYS?  They may share the same company, but they aren't the same - at least not from a customer-employee point of view.   I live around the corner from the Pocket Bel Air and it's been very convenient being able to stop by and pick up a few things we may need - from ice to kitty litter.Although the prices are slightly higher on a few items, overall, the prices are decent.  Milk, eggs, vegetables, cereal and meats are priced competitively with other local grocery stores.  For example, a head of lettuce is 99 cents.  The price hasn't fluctuated in I don't know how long, unlike Safeway, where it may be $1.50 one day and .65 the next.The Bel Air staff are very friendly and helpful.  I've gotten to know a few of the managers and it's always a delight to say hello to them when I stop by.  They're never too busy to return the greeting and make small talk.  However... I do have a gripe about the pharmacy staff.  I don't know if they are Bel Air employees, but for starters, there is way too many of them and most aren't very friendly at all.  Like the other day I stop by to pick up a prescription (and it's not like they haven't seen me before) and there was three of them standing back there "discussing" something.  A couple of them look up and me, but don't say anything.  I made eye contact; I wasn't standing there like I was comparing the differences of the various prophylactics, I was standing there like a man that need to pick up his medicine and I was getting a little perturbed.  After a while, another employee comes out of nowhere to be of assistance.  That was cool, but those other "older" employees, damn them.... :^| Rrrrrrrrrr   Let's see, 3 people standing there, two others counting the bottles on the shelf and then another person appears out of nowhere to help me.  6 people in that little-ass pharmacy?  Way too many people.I'm a chicken hawk.  I love me some chicken.  Gotsta have it and Bel Air has some dee-lish-ous chicken.  I like their big juicy chicken strips.  They are perfect with lettuce to make a chicken salad.  I usually eat that combination at least twice a week.  This Bel Air has a Sizzling Wok (Chinese food) and their brandy-wine chicken is very good, too.  However, it's best to get that chicken when it's super fresh (not just fresh) as the meat will still be hot and juicy.  Don't get the chicken if it's been sitting there more than an hour as It'll be dry and shriveled.  You'll know when it's been there a while and when it's super fresh by the size of the chicken pile and color.  Also, sometimes the drumsticks can run a bit small, as well as the thighs?  I mean, what's up with that BS?  If I wanted an appetizer, I'd get some wingettes.Bel Air has an excellent bakery, too, however, I try and stay away (a little hard to since it's right next to the chicken) and I've been good about that recently, but in another lifetime, yes, I used to indulge in their bakery items.  Their coffee cakes and cinnamon rolls are off the hizzle for shizzle my nizzle.  Their donuts are a bit small, but the price is small, too.  Around 60 cents for a donut.  They also have cakes to order, but I haven't tried that service and doubt I ever will (LOL) as I don't have a need for that.As for parking... it's never hard to find a good spot to park when shopping here.   The store can get busy on holidays, but what do you expect? LOL

And who the heck serves food after 10pm on a Monday night besides fast food or Denny's? Well, Burgers and Brew does! I was SUPER excited, and my brother and I hightailed it down right away! I ordered a Turkey Burger added avocado, and had a fuji side salad. DELICIOUS! I mean, you know a meal was delicious when you're still thinking about it the next day, right?Well, that set the bar really high for me, and each time since it hasn't been that fantastic.

Even better, it's closer to some loves of mine.  The veal on the pre-fixe sounds like something I would put together at home, Blue cheese butter on Fava beans.  MMMMM!!!I'll leave it at this:  Every time Amazing and I come here, within the first 10 minutes we both get the feeling that we should go back more often.If that doesn't tell you all you need to know, I don't know what else would.

Also her website is very informative when it comes to information on prep work, what to wear, etc.I wasn't too sure what to expect, but Meri is a warm & friendly woman who put me at ease which is a good thing as I was about to be butt naked in front of her after just minutes of meeting her!The process itself it pretty simple and fast.  She gave me a prep gel to put on to help the spray tan absorb and then it was my turn to be front & center of attention!  The spray itself is cool which is welcome on a hot summer day.  She does get every nook & cranny...even the crease under your bum!  After she's done, she has big fans to stand under for a few minutes before you dress.I loved the instant color that I ended up buying a package of 3.  I have my last custom spray tan coming up next week before my Vegas trip.Meri is the best at what she does and is super nice!  I will definitely be back next spring.
<review# 2234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2012,7/5/2012,61,167,7,11,8>I suppose I can understand why this bar isn't for everybody, but the rest of us don't care about you nay-sayers.  If you like beer, than this is a place you need to check out once in a while.  Their selection is varied and extensive, and I've never had any problems with service.  In fact, on multiple I've gone in wanting to try something new, and just tell them.  They have always been helpful and I've definitely expanded my beer pallet here.If you want a place with a lot of space or a spot to watch big sports events, you should probably go to Bro-West or the P.O.S. known as MVPs.  This place is much better-suited for you and a few pals who want to have a few pints, maybe shoot some darts, and just hang out.  Their prices are reasonable.  No, you won't be able to get a $2 pint of PBR, and they don't have pitchers (my one request is that this change someday!!).  But you can have a few real beers with some kick to them, most for no more than $5 or $6.  You get what you pay for! 2 or 3 beers here is easily worth the money when you consider the higher alcohol content compared to tasteless light American beers (not that I don't enjoy one on occasion).I suspect for most people this is a Love It or Hate It type of place, but give it a chance!
<review# 2235,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/2/2012,7/4/2012,347,219,3,10,6>With the Yelp Deal, I paid only $10 for a plate of ravioli, salad, a turkey sandwich, clam chowder, and zuppa toscano soup. PLUS foccacia bread. REALLY. Such a good deal!You can ask the workers for a sample of all the pastas so you can make up your mind. I liked the ravioli the best, but it would have been tastier if it was served piping hot. You can order one pasta, two pastas, three...even four! The plates comes with a huge salad and they don't skimp on anything...cubes of ham and turkey along with lots of fresh veggies and garbanzo beans and croutons. The soups were decent, nothing spectacular.This is one of the gems in Elk Grove...no other place like it!Bonus: You can order sauce and pasta to-go for parties or just to serve at home.
<review# 2236,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2012,7/3/2012,210,713,3,8,2>There didn't seem to be any grand opening deals like I was hoping to find. Shoppers did get a free canvas bag when they checked out. The store partially reminds me of Whole Foods but on a much smaller scale. The store itself isn't that big and the aisles are not wide enough. I felt like I was in people's way or people were in my way. I liked how their advertisements give customers easy meal ideas. It also had a coupon to entice customers to visit their new store- $5 off $20. About half of the products are house brands. Ready-to-cook meals are one of their selling points. There is a variety of soups, salads, pastas, etc. that one can grab to go. There is a fresh bakery that included breads and pastries from Il Fornaio and a great selection of cheese. In general, a lot of the food looked yummy. I don't like the self-check out service. When I dropped the $5 coupon into the compartment, the machine didn't register it. I had to wait for an employee to rectify the problem. If my parents were to shop here, they would have a hard time.The grocery store was not built at the best location, especially with Walgreens and Raley's right next door. I'm thinking one of these stores will go out of business. I most likely wouldn't visit this store often. The prices are a bit on the high end. Maybe if I wanted to treat myself to something FRESH and EASY.FYI- Manufacture's coupons are not accepted here.        Sign up for a Friend's card to earn points.

<review# 2238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/4/2012,7/1/2012,239,263,6,22,9>This was the first move I've made in which I did not ask friends to help me. At this point in my life, I figured it was best to hire professionals. I have some heavy furniture and I know my friends have better things to do. I chose Two Men and a Truck for my recent move because I'd seen their trucks around town and they had such great reviews on Yelp. I was THRILLED with my decision. From the day I made my reservation, the Two Men and a Truck company would send me periodic emails to see how I was doing with packing and providing me tips about moving and about the fact that their company provides boxes and will even pack everything for you if you don't want to or cannot yourself. The week before my move, I received a call to confirm my reservation. Days before my move, I was watching the weather and it looked like it was going to rain on my initial reservation day, so I called and was able to move my move one day ahead. You MUST provide the company with 48 hours notice of any changes or cancellations. On the day of my move, the truck pulled up during the 4 hour window they provided and 2 guys padded, wrapped, and loaded up my stuff in 2 hours flat. Of course, I had already moved most of the boxes and they were primarily in charge of furniture and my washer & dryer. Jerry and Robert did an outstanding job packing everything up and unloading it at my new home. The entire job took 3 hours @ $117 per hour with a 3 hour minimum. I gave them each a tip and they were on their way.Overall, I was extremely happy with this company, their professionalism, the fact that they continuously checked up on me prior to the move, and that the movers did a great job. I would recommend Two Men and a Truck to everyone.
<review# 2239,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2012,11/11/2012,570,275,11,29,25>What a peaceful way to spend a Tuesday evening.Tucked away in a quaint shopping center, Fabian's offers a delicious retreat to a stressful day. With its very calming interior, their patio dinning area offers a greater extension of that peace. There are quaint tables, white lights and a mood set for romance. But don't let that fool you! This place also has a ton of potential for large parties and group gatherings. The polenta fries are served on a hot bed of marinara sauce that, accompanied by the side of bread, could have been enough to satisfy my appetite. These generously large fries were thick and not overwhelmingly greasy. With the sauce, it was almost like a healthier version of mozzarella sticks!Yet of course, I had to order more. I ordered the salmon entree that may sound and be described as a salad, but is not quite that. It's more of a giant serving of salmon, with some salad on the side. This grilled and juice portion of salmon is served over a bed of arugula with a light vinaigrette dressing, next to a generous serving of asparagus. The entree was under $20 and enough for two to eat. But did I share? No way, no how. This was all mine.My friend and I finished the evening with an order of gelato, that comes with two scoops of whatever flavor(s) you'd like. Plus, the gelato is served in a chocolate covered cone bowl! Both the gelato and the bowl were delicious and refreshing!As Keith L mentioned,  and nailed it, this place is Cal-Italian. They serve staple Italian meals with a bit of a contemporary California flare. Don't know what that means? Go and try it out yourself!And yes, their table service staff topped my evening off with a smile!
<review# 2240,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/15/2012,11/10/2012,476,248,8,17,12>I was definitely struggling on whether or not to give H&L 4 or 5 stars. It's true that I went to this swanky restaurant and bar on back to back nights....and it's true that I got all starry eyed when my pumpkin risotto reached my table...but there's always pluses and minuses with any soft opening. Thus, 4 stars is a fair assessment in my book. Plus, I'm leaving some room for improvement! The highlights for me were the food and atmosphere. I really enjoyed the sound of most of their menu items. Especially the pumpkin risotto, as said earlier. I'm very excited to try some of the entrees and smaller plates (prosciutto and duck egg...yum). As for some that claimed the menu was unoriginal, I gasp!As for the atmosphere, it couldn't have been more inviting. I understand that most people were upset that they didn't get seated for the soft opening - but seriously, you're mad that a new restaurant was packed? That doesn't make sense to me. My friend and I were seated in a very awkward area at the end of the bar, but scoped out an adult level seat later in the evening. I'm not sure how it is to sit in a different area, as I've been at the bar both times I've been here. But frankly, I could care less. The bar staff is attentive and like to shake things up - awesome cocktails! H&L is definitely my go to for a drink in Midtown. It really impressed me, I'll be coming back soon...like tonight?!?
<review# 2241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2012,11/9/2012,244,170,9,14,11>So my ma's been telling me about this new cupcake place that she'd been seeing.  Well, we happened to be carpooling, so we stopped by.  The first thing that I noticed upon entering was that the place isn't filled with the usual frilly, overly- girly decorations.  The second thing and most important was the size of the cupcakes.  Monique isn't down with the teeny tiny cupcakes!  Her cupcakes are the size of muffins.  She can do the mini's and standard sizes, for any pansies out there, but unless you're getting some for a kiddie party, go big or go home.  The Pancake 'n Bacon cupcake is a mainstay here.  It's not like some of these other places that just slap a piece of soggy bacon on the top of a cupcake.  Mo has pieces of bacon INSIDE the cupcake with a piece of caramelized maple bacon perched on top of her maple butter cream frosting.  Then she drizzles it with maple syrup.  Whew, she could've stopped right there, but nope she didn't...She has the best Red Velvet I've had, ever.  The cake is moist and the cream cheese isn't overly sweet.  It's the perfect blend of sweet, but still some tang of cream cheese.  She's an artist when it comes to blending flavors.  She creates a perfect balance when combining flavors that contrast (Blackberry 'n Brie cupcakes, Strawberry Lemonade, and so many more) with sweet frosting.  But it's not teeth-aching sweet.  And if you think all these cupcakes are giving off too much femininity, Daniel, the Cake Master, gives off enough testosterone to balance things out.  Have you seen his BBQ grill cake?!  Everyone in Sassy is super nice and helpful when trying to decide between flavors or lunch options.  I haven't tried any of the sandwiches yet, but I plan to soon.  There are also other sweets like the Quesito (puff pastry filled with sweet cream and dusted with powdered sugar), cinnamon rolls, cookies, and several drink options to wash it all down.

They'll be tall (duh.) and have wild hair and kickass names like Magnus and Thor. But someday is not today. And today I don't have children.I have a dog.My pup is my baby, and I spoil her like none other. Pricey dog food, unlimited bones and treats, lots of walks and trips, and recently, a first birthday party complete with party hats and a carrot wheat cake. I love her to pieces, and when we head out of town, I want to make sure she's in the best hands possible. Enter Wag Hotels, or as we call it, "The Wag." My coworkers make fun of me for how shamelessly yuppie we are when it comes to our dog. Overnight private room? Yes, please. All day play with other pups so that when we get her back, she's completely tuckered out? Of course. Midday Kong snack with organic free-range chicken?  You know it. Puppy summer camp? Absolutely. Report cards detailing her stay and her behavior? Wouldn't have it any other way. The Wag is the closest thing to puppy private school that you can get. Yes, it's a little more expensive, and yes, it's a little more extravagant than your local kennel. But when your dog isn't like your child, but in fact, IS your only daughter, you want to treat her like the little princess she is. And in the Sacramento area, the Wag is the only choice for a girl like her.

I know this is a Thai place, but it was the closest I could find to fulfill the craving.Service here is really good! Their water is filled with cucumbers and apples for a refreshing taste. When I was seated for dinner they immediately gave us a small peanut salad to munch on even before ordering.My waitress was really really NICE! Super friendly and nice to talk to. I ordered their BBQ Chicken, Papaya Salad- lightly spiced for the BF, rice and Pad Thai.The BBQ chicken was tasty and plentiful but was boneless and tasty but not the chicken I expected. The papaya salad was made Laos style and was made with housemade fish sauce, straight from the fish! Really fishy but super super good. The Pad Thai had good flavor but the noodles were a little undercooked. Apparently the yellow curry and coconut soup is to die for here (as told by my boyfriend's family) but I haven't had it.I was offered a spice condiment plate (since I like spicy) with vinegar red and green chili peppers, pepper flakes, pepper powder and vinegar jalapeno peppers.Super delicious.

<review# 2247,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2012,11/3/2012,274,226,11,17,12>I had a really good experience here with Marlowe.  Let me begin by getting a few things out of the way:I bought a Groupon for the balayage color/highlights deal ($75, regularly $180).  I usually get my color done with a renowned Bay Area colorist down in SF or Oakland.  I love her to death but it gets expensive to see her regularly (every 6-12 weeks, depending) because of her prices as well as the gas.  I've been getting balayage done on my hair for a few years now and it seems fairly new to this area.  The couple times I've tried getting it done in Sac. I've been thoroughly disappointed.  Seriously, my hair looked like an absolute hot shit mess after  Enough of those horror stories.  Fast forward to summer 2012 when GS offered this Groupon.  $75 is a great deal for highlights so I decided to give it a try.  The receptionist recommended Marlowe to me and I am glad she did.  I had my hair highlighted twice this year already so I had a good base going on.  What I wanted was to get my color touched up on the roots and get some more face framing highlights and then tone it all down so that my darker roots flowed into my sparkling highlights.  Marlowe did just that and he was very nice throughout the whole experience.  He also gave me a gorgeous blow out to show what my highlights looked like while my hair was straight and then curled it to really show the highlights.  Also, I left the salon with 4 samples of product and a 25% off coupon for my next visit.  WOW!  That is going above and beyond.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I did have some nice highlights upon entering the salon and I'm not sure what my hair would've looked like if Marlowe had done a head full of highlights on virgin hair.  Unlike most traditional balayage-ists, he doesn't use the paddle board.  I think the advantage of using that board is that you can concentrate more color towards the ends of your hair and have more control with your brush strokes.  Some of my highlights appear to be a little brighter up top but not particularly noticeable because he did a good job using toner to blend it all together.  The salon itself is beautiful.  I was skeptical of going there because I'm kind of a midtown snob and I rarely leave the Grid.  The location in a strip mall is also a little off-putting but once you walk in it's like you're in a totally different world.  It's spacious and serene.  They also offer you beverages and even wine while you're there.  The owner, Greg, takes a lot of pride in his salon.  While I was there he was walking around, checking up and encouraging the other stylists.  All-in-all, with the pleasant experience I had and the 25% off coupon, I would most likely go back... if I'm not too lazy to leave the Grid.

I know, for a pseudo, self-prescribed, foodie...I'm laggin! Thanks to Becky S. she opened my eyes to bulgogi and Bi Bim Pop...All that being said, I've been hearing about this new Korean taco spot. After a quick peek at the co-op's deli options, I decided I was going to be wild and find the elusive Korean tacos! Lo and behold, its two seconds away.Cutest little restored gas station. Fairly simple in design, but cute and an old school vibe. People were sitting on all sides of this little eatery. Seats and tables surround almost every square footage of this place.Super simple menu, not much too choose from. With no friend recommendations, I relied on my cashier. Sweetest gal ever, she chatted with me for a bit and I finally decided on a bulgogi taco and a chicken taco. They have a 3 taco meal, which is more baller-on-a-budget price wise, but not calories wise :/I was rolling solo, so I took it home. As I unwrapped my little green (not color, but recycled) takeout box I was greeted with two lovely, yet very supple tacos. They definitely don't scrimp on their meat offerings, they make them with a heavy hand. They also put a purple-ish sauce on top too, whatever it was it was great!  Surprisingly, I actually enjoyed the chicken taco more than the bulgogi taco. The chicken was savory and delish, without being overly salty. Don't get me wrong, the bulgogi was good, but my preference is the savory chicken option.I love everything about this place, although I've only been once and only tried two tacos. I can't wait to get back here and support a great local, grid newbie!Although you spelled it wrong, I dig your taCo's ;)
<review# 2249,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/8/2014,5/22/2014,97,128,5,22,7>First crawfish place in Elk Grove! This location has switched owners several times already; this use to be Wings and Rings, or Sheldon Bar and Grill.Came today for their soft opening and it's okay. Don't come with extremely high expectations because they're new and problems do come up. I was a little disappointed with my shrimp because the majority of it was overcooked and the shrimp became mushy and sandy. I got the mild sweet Cajun, but it wasn't too sweet. My boyfriend got the salty Cajun and it tasted similar to boiling crab's flavor but less salty. My friends got the crawfish and it was extremely small. For appetizers, we got the garlic Cajun fries. Nice garlic/Parmesan taste, but no Cajun at all. The garlic noodles were recommended to us so we got that as well. Pretty yummy! Noodles weren't too soggy and it has a sweet kick to it. Crab jalapeño poppers were pretty spicy but it tastes average. They top it off with some teriyaki sauce though so it makes it a little unique. Prices are a little more expensive than your typical south sac crawfish places but location makes a difference. They have entrees as well, but we didn't get a chance to try it tonight. Won't be coming back soon but willing to come in a few more months once they settle and maybe then, food might be better.
<review# 2250,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2014,5/21/2014,121,82,9,13,12>In my opinion this is the best Thai food in Elk Grove. Their service is quick and friendly. They even give you your own tumbler of water so you can refill your own glass instead of having to wait around for someone to do it for you. We always order the red curry with chicken. It's got tons of flavor. The chicken comes out a bit dry though. It's probably because they use white meat but it's still an awesome dish. Today I wanted to try something new so we got the drunken noodles with calamari. It had a nice kick of spice without being overwhelming.  The calamari was cooked perfectly. It wasn't chewy and the slices were thick.You HAVE to try the bread. I don't know how they make it but it's delicious. It's super flaky and a bit sweet. It's awesome to dip into curry. I order it every time I go.I don't crave Thai food often but if I do I make the 15 minute drive out to this place because it's so good!!!

Since I currently live in Indiana, the idea of a Japanese grocery store sounds super exciting and awesome since we don't have large Asian grocery stores where I currently live, let alone ones that emphasize Japanese foods.I liked that they had a large selection of mushrooms and different kinds of Asian vegetables right when you walk in the front of the store. I ended up also buying some tofu stir fry and soup mixes that were affordably priced. They also have a large prepared foods section in the store and I bought a veggie bento box with tofu for lunch to eat at the few tables located inside.Today I parked in the 30 minute street parking out front, but found out that they have a smallish parking lot in the back that I will use next time.I really liked Oto's and plan to return.
<review# 2253,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,5/18/2014,899,839,14,17,14>Where can you buy two weeks worth of groceries for under $20? This place. Food: Let me start by saying that I can't even remember a time when I haven't been regularly going to a Ranch 99 (or 99 Ranch or whatever you want to call it). This Buena Park-based market chain is my lifeblood. Strangely enough, it was the first thing I saw and stopped at when I moved to Sacramento. Coincidence ... or destiny? Anyway, this location is pretty freaking sweet because it has everything I might want in a Chinese market. First off, the produce section is hands down amazing. The apples are like the size of my face and taste like someone injected honey into the flesh. They have napa cabbage in pretty much every shape and size you can think of, bundles of snow pea leaves, enoki mushrooms, and bags of ripe bananas for a dollar (you either need a huge family or would have to peel and freeze them right away for this to make any sense). You name it they got it. They have all the normal stuff you'd expect like Calpis, frozen jiaozi/gyoza/mandu, spices, instant ramen, halo halo and ube ice cream bars, and live seafood tanks. What makes this place special is the fact that it has an Asian bakery, an insanely good milk tea place, a BBQ joint with roasted duck and pork, and a delicious dim sum bar right in the store. The milk tea joint is called Brown Sugar Milk Tea and is situated right behind the registers. It's easy to miss. I must have passed it by while visiting the market three or four times, only to discover it through Yelp. And somebody order a drug test because these dim sum look like they're on steroids (yelp.com/biz_photos/99-r, yelp.com/biz_photos/99-r). Seriously, look at the size of those siumai relative to that takeout box. Massive. My favorites are the unnaturally large sesame balls (yelp.com/biz_photos/99-r). You can get 3 normal sized pieces for $2.40 (yelp.com/biz_photos/99-r) or one large sized piece for the same price. The large sized pieces include either Cantonese or Taiwanese lo mai gai, that sticky rice wrapped in a leaf, some of the baos, and the plates with chicken feet. I also tried the wonton soup (yelp.com/biz_photos/99-r), but wasn't impressed. The broth is pretty tasteless, but at least they give you a lot and the wontons aren't half bad. Atmosphere: This is probably the cleanest 99 Ranch I have ever seen. Of course, it still smells like durian and my grandma's closet, so you know it's legit. Service: Double check your receipt. I was once charged twice for a particularly pricey item and had a heck of a time trying to get a refund. I also wouldn't expect to have an extended conversation with anyone who works here unless you know Cantonese  or Mandarin. Synopsis: Everything is reasonably priced, the dim sum are gargantuan, and the milk tea keeps flowing. Life is good.
<review# 2254,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,5/17/2014,83,3,14,22,16>This has to be one of the best European Bakeries in downtown Sacramento.Estelle Patisserie is located on the corner of K and 9th street, very easy to spot with it's blue curtains. The variety of food served, is minimally Americanized stating it's  European authenticity. This French cafe has croinuts, the latest pastry craze that consist in a hybrid of croissant and donut. Estelle is great for breakfast, lunch, dessert or simply for a coffee or tea date. For the sweet tooth crowd  this bakery offers fresh croissants, madelines, macaroons, cookies, tarts, cakes, cheesecake, eclaires, and many more in a multi-variety of flavors. A great place to have lunch as they offer different sandwiches, salads, soups and savory.I was here just this past Tuesday and I was very satisfied with the food and service. I ordered a Prosciutto and Brie sandwich with argula, butter, home made French mustard and garlic infused oil. For dessert, I had a vanilla tart and my friend ordered a raspberry mousse, both delicious.Make sure to come at least two hours prior their closing time if you want to find a good selection of food. I am from Italy and recently moved here, I assure you that Estelle is a great place to have European/French pastries. Very happy that this cafe is in Sacramento!
<review# 2255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,5/16/2014,257,251,9,15,13>My boss has brought in variety boxes from this bakery several times now and every time I can't help but eat something, even if I've already eaten.  I will state for the record that I am not a doughnut fan at all, not that I'd classify these as doughnuts anyhow.  I'm not sure of the names for everything I've tried, but judging from the pictures I've had Kobe Creams a few times.  Everything I've eaten has been pillow-y soft and super delicious.  So, so good.I'll be visiting this place soon and treating friends to a variety box.  Goodies like these need to be shared!
<review# 2256,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2014,5/15/2014,263,136,38,40,34>Never again will you have to sit around with your friends contemplating on where to eat.Jensai offers an extensive menu with different options that can accommodate everyone in your party.  The restaurant is conveniently located right off the freeway on 16th street.  There are a few parking spaces right in front of the restaurant, which is a huge plus in the Dowtown/Midtown area.  No need to circle around and around for a parking spot.  I've tried a few different things on the menu and I have liked every single one of them.  My favorites so far are the Mama's chicken wings, Oysters, and Jensai Blue Fire.  You can tell them to add jalapenos to the chicken wings for extra spice.  The oysters are super fresh.  I can probably eat a whole dozen by myself.  And the Jensai Blue Fire comes out on fire, and is super delicious.  They also have different cocktail drinks specials.  I tried their Lychee Martini and it was so refreshing.  Everyone here is so nice.  I like how the owners come out and make sure everything is okay.  Being a newer establishment, they want to hear all the feedback and they actually listen to you.So what are you waiting for?  GO TO JENSAI!
<review# 2257,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,5/14/2014,184,59,14,18,15>So, there really isn't anything like a really good restaurant to get you back on the reviewing wagon, am I right or am I right?My partner and I dropped into this lovely modern bistro after receiving a groupon from my pops that expires today. Boy, am I glad he passed it onto us. The food was...how do I put this...divine. Balanced, tasty and presented to utter perfection. On this lovely hump day we sampled the mussels, whiskey burger and the beat salad. Not quite sure where to being with my description of these three beauties. Can I just say my mouth is watering just thinking about it? And I feel like I didn't even get to try the really awesome things, like the fish stew or the pork chops....must....return...The mussels were coupled with a coconut-curry broth that was absolute heaven. It made for a great dipping sauce with the complementary sourdough bread (low rent of me to do, maybe, but I couldn't let that sauce go to waste). The portions were extremely generous and I had zero issue with the $14 price tag. I highly recommend. As for my whiskey burger...oh, my sweet sweet whiskey burger. I have to say it's probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. Not so much because of the fixins but because the meat was cooked to medium rare godliness. Very few places cook medium rare right and the chef did right by me. I'm sure this was aided by the fact that the beef is 5 dot ranch beef..."melt in your mouth tenderness, freshness you can taste, flavor you can savor.." Yes. All of it. Forever. And such taste for a meager $13 dollars? Honey, check me in FOREVER. As for Jason's shaved fennel and beet salad, I can't really describe its flavor because I spent the vast majority of my time shut down and enamored by my burger, but I can certainly comment on the presentation. The arugula leaves were drizzled with a nice tarragon vinaigrette and topped with some lovely toasted brie. I've got to say, the part I loved the most were the wonderfully red and gold beets. I love beets. I had to have them and I almost tried to act a fool and snatch them off Jason's plate with my dainty and precision like fingers, but had to catch myself. NO, I can't be that racheta in this classy restaurant with all these fine east sacramento people. No GODT. (I've lost my marbles over a $9 salad -- well played chef, well played). Our server Ryan was super. Very friendly, knowledgable and diligent. I think over the course of the hour we were there we had at least a handful of table touches and my water was always filled. No complaints, fully stars in that department. Now for the ambiance of the restaurant..I'm not sure if I'm the only person in Sacramento who hasn't heard of this little gem, but I wasn't expecting it to be as nice/quaint as it was. It's definitely got a modern feel to it and the food doesn't hold to any one particular European cuisine (tho it clearly incorporates some Spanish, some Italian, some French). Immediately upon entering I realized I was underdressed. I'm no coxcomb, but let's be real, if you're gonna stop in at Formoli, go ahead and make it a special occasion and dress up a bit. I would have loved to take some cute selfies and hash tagged #classycat if I dressed up a little more. you catch my drift. Alright I've droned on long enough. Loved this spot, loved the price, loved the service and most importantly, LOVED the food. Thank you Formoli Bistro team for bringing all of your amazingness to the Sacramento dining scene.
<review# 2258,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2014,5/13/2014,387,268,19,24,19>Oz, how I love thee!!!!We have been anticipating the Elk Grove location's opening, finally last month it occurred!  After reading the reviews, we decided to 1st go during an off time.  Elk Grove loves new restaurants lol which means busy busy busy! So we went on a Saturday afternoon around 2 pm.  Funny thing, there was several doors on this building, all the windows and doors are blacked out so we had no clue where the entrance was, we walked around the whole building until we figured it out LOL!Since we arrived mid-day, the lunch crowd was leaving and there was more staff then there was customers.  This location is clean and more modern then the Bradshaw location.  We had already read "the rules" so we were ready to jump in!  Started with fries (for hubby) and sweet chili wings (for me).  We tried almost all the meats listed on the menu.  We both agreed the marinated meats are the best, especially the bone in short ribs. The only meat option we thought was purely gross was the pork belly, yes I had a sad face after trying it because I am a huge fan of pork belly and bacon but this was not on point!  Other than that no complaints!  I think we sat there for 2 hours, munching away.  Service was GREAT, my apologies I cannot remember our servers name but she was wonderful! She checked on us often, they changed our grill out, monitored the heat levels and kept the food flowing.Fast forward to last night.  Since we wanted to go for dinner, Hubby made reservations for six at 5:30.  This time there are hours posted on the door so you know which door to go in.  Though they said we all needed to arrive together, with only four of us there they did seat us.  This time we had a plan of action, we knew the meats we definitely wanted to order.  I have to say I felt bad for our server, Grace, the six of us were some hungry folks LOL but hey it's AYE right???  They added the lettuce wrap option like the other location, I was very glad to see. Once again we parked in those seats for around two hours and service was great again.  While we were there, we watched the restaurant fill up.  And when I say it filled it, I mean it, I was amazed with the amount of people!  People even sat at the bar, and they only serve beer and wine at this time.Reasons for dining at Oz:-Fun atmosphere-AYE Koren BBQ-Great Service-Great experience-Lots of options-Birthday wheel (which I spin and won a $5 gift card)-Those rules really did not matter once the food starts flowing!Once they have a full bar license it's going to beyond packed!Oz, how I love thee. . . .
<review# 2259,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/4/2010,9/3/2010,86,101,6,4,6>Ok, so I admit I'm a bit of a nut-bar.  I went here on Wednesday with my two-year-old and a friend...in costume.I know they have docents and actors to do that, but it seemed like it would be fun for my daughter to dress up, and when I was a kid, my parents would drag me to places like this in costumes, but they didn't bother.  How fair is that?  So I donned my Dicken's Faire dress (the time period is close enough) and so did my friend, and then we went down and wandered around for a while.The demonstrations and stuff to look at change depending on what volunteers they have ready, and all we had was a trapper and the cannon (which was super cool) but it was still neat to look at everything.  It was crawling with school kids who stopped and asked us questions, thinking we worked there, and that was fun too.  We made up silly stories about who we were and babbled a lot.What a cool way to relive history!  I'm glad that it's still standing and glad that kids still get dragged there.  I remember going as a kid, and I think I even learned something.So take your kids there, though don't feel the need to dress up, that's really only for the truly insane.
<review# 2260,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2010,9/2/2010,71,64,6,7,5>I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet considering the ungodly amount of time and money I've bled onto the benches and stools, and into the outlets.  Firstly, I'm not one of those coffee shop scenesters or socializers.  I don't have a posse I meet up with, not a coffee snob cuz I'm more of a tea drinker, don't even have convos with the baristas.  Most of the time I come on in, find a seat with an outlet or a good place to read, and sit down for hours of silent mental exercises (thanks for the headaches UC Davis).  Luckily for me, Weatherstone doesn't have a pretentious vibe for a nerdy nerdmonger like me.Besides providing an apt setting for completing my arduous tasks at hand (aka paper writing, stats hw, people watching) they have a menu full of good caffeinated and non-caffeinated drinks, excellent beer and wine selection, fresh-baked goods, snacks, and tasty full on meals.  My recommendation is the good ol' grilled cheese.  The bread they use is sooooo good, salty and thick, just how I like it.  So if you are a jock, a dweeb, a spazzzzz, a boozer, a yuppie, a socialite, a pauper, a princess; whatever social group you can think of, you can find your own space here.  Whether you just want to grab a drink and run, talk with people for hours, or sit quietly alone it's all very possible up in da Weatherstone.  Worrrrd.

<review# 2262,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2010,8/31/2010,180,228,3,10,7>Last year, we used the 'Red Bud' picnic area for the location of our annual Gemini birthday party. For $200, we acquired the location, which included an alcohol permit. For an additional $25, we grabbed the amplified sound permit so our DJ friends could wreck shop. The Red Bud location is a great location for amplified sound, as it's near the freeway, has plenty of shaded parking, a large canopy, BBQs, and tons of space, and is right near the river. All of our guests had a great time and complimented us on the location. Of course, when you bring liquor to the park (even with a permit), you're asking for the Rangers to harass you. This location was no different, as we had one come by several times to make sure we weren't being unruly. I'm happy to report, though, that this year the park is notifying the rangers which picnic sites are permitted the day of the event. It's great news for us, as we're looking forward to using this location again.
<review# 2263,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/11/2010,8/30/2010,209,356,28,17,16>If John Wayne or Chuck Norris ambled up and asked me where to eat, I would recommend Bud's. Bud's Buffet, which is actually not a buffet in the traditional sense of the word, is a manly man joint. Are you on a diet? Are you trying to keep your cholesterol down? Do you have a small appetite? Are you vegetarian? Get the hell out now and go to La Bou. I'm particularly fond of their roast beef, meatloaf, lasagna, and mashed potatoes. Bud's isn't particularly cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for - and you get a free afternoon food coma with every order! As if Bud's weren't already testosterone incarnate, you can choose from a small selection of bottled beers. I feel like eating there more than once a week counts as some kind of female to male sex change hormone therapy. One star off because I hate actually going into Bud's. The air is humid and sweaty and...yugh...I usually stop in, grab my food to go, and eat at my desk or on a bench somewhere. I feel like when I leave, my hair and clothes smell like steak and potato stew. Grab yourself a real man (or woman), bring your appetites, and I'll see you at Bud's.
<review# 2264,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/30/2010,8/29/2010,193,552,6,8,6>We stumbled upon the back patio of this place during the Jazz Festival (the fair-style food within the festival did not catch our fancy... can somebody explain to me what pupula is? Doesn't sound tasty). The patio had a great ambiance to it, almost like that restaurant at Disneyland that's inside Pirates of the Caribbean. Coupled with a talented live band, this seemed very promising.The waiter attending to us- possibly the owner- insisted we try the raw beet ravioli and the raw vegetable lasagna. He seemed so happy about them that we couldn't say no. He said both were "healthy" portions, and that "we will fill you up". Ok, let's do it.When they came out, my friends and I had to glance at each other to make sure we were all seeing the same thing. The portions were surprisingly small, especially given the build-up they had. They would have been too small if we had ordered them for appetizers. And at $10 each, we were wondering if we made the right dining decision.That being said, I must say the food was fantastic. I'm not a huge fan of vegan food, but this was easily the best I've ever tasted. The ravioli wasn't what I expected... I thought it would be beet-stuffed ravioli, but rather the beets were used AS the ravioli. I'm not a huge beet fan either, but these really were excellent. And the lasagna was surprisingly flavorful. Really, just excellent food.The waiter brought us a little extra after we noted that the portions were a little smaller than anticipated, so props for that. Overall, I was really surprised at how much I loved the food. But there was so little of it, it just seemed like a tease.Despite this, I'm still willing to hit them with 4 stars. If they could make those "healthy" portions a little healthier, I could see myself giving them 5. Just don't go there if you are hungry.
<review# 2265,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2010,8/28/2010,554,328,,6,6>Wow - this is a hidden gem in Davis.The location is small so it is one of those places you need to make reservations. I was having dinner with clients and the restaurants in Davis are pretty limited. I needed a place that was not too expensive, not too loud and affordable. Tuco's fit this bill.I loved the fact that it had fresh, organic ingredients - very high quality food. They have a small wine list - but it was a great selection of wines.Very attentive service, everything was presented will and not too expensive. I will defiantly be bringing clients back here again.

Happy because I know I'm going to save a bunch of money on groceries and sad because I'm going to have to subject myself to a ruthless crowd of EBT card holders.  This is not a store you browse through like at The Nugget or Whole Foods. The mission is to get in and get out! ASAP!Open 24hrs and cheaper than most grocery stores. A jar of Classico pasta sauce is less than $2 and at Bel-Air it's $4...Hmm...where should I go? Never come here on the 1st of the month. Everyone and their momma flocks here. So I'd suggest you come early in the morning or in the middle of the night. I took away a star because they don't have any express lanes. If you're only getting a couple of items, forget it!

It was his night to choose what to eat.  We ate like children and drank another couple of cocktails.  Overall it was pretty good (too much fried food for me in one sitting though).  I'm certain we will be back because it's close to home and there is this hummus plate on happy hour I am dying to try!
<review# 2268,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2010,8/25/2010,48,81,10,7,6>When I'm doing the morning shuffle to the Wayne Hultgren RT station to catch the train downtown, sometimes I drag my feet. Sometimes it's because it's Monday. Sometimes it's because my body aches. Sometimes I'm just late rolling outta bed. But I wonder if there is some alterior, subliminal reason, buried deep inside my cerebral cortex or medulla oblangota, why I miss that 6:47 train with regularity. I'm begining to think that it's because missing that train comes with the added benefit of having to cross the street to Marie's for a donut fix. If I don't give in to temptation, then I have to wait on the bench at the station for 15 minutes before the next train comes, tortured by the aroma of fresh donuts wafting across the street and that's really just waaay too much to bear. So usually, I just give in, saunter across Freeport, like it's just happenstance that I'm walking that way, and drop the high-calorie stomach bomb at Marie's. For $2.25 I get a large coffee and two cakey old-fashioned donuts (chocolate and glazed). That's right. Two twenty-five!!! Where in the hell can you go and get a tasty brekkie for $2.25?? McD's across the street doesn't even come close to matching that price. Sometimes I mix it up and get an apple fritter which really tides me over until lunch; I can just feel the lipids accumulating on my arterial walls with each bite. I've tried Yum Yum and the donut place on Broadway and they just don't stack up to Marie's. Sure, sometimes there's a wait, especially if you get there before McClatchy H.S. is in session, after school or on Sat or Sun morning, but daaaaang, it's totally worth standing in line and salivating through the window at the bevy of doughy beauties that will be coming home with you in that crisp white bag or (better yet) that pink box sealed tight with a piece of celophane tape, just waiting to pop open like a stripper in a giant birthday cake.So, maybe for some reason unbeknownst to me at this time,  I'll be late for my train tomorrow...
<review# 2269,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2008,2/27/2008,91,74,6,4,4>Vinny is the best. Seriously a genuine and funny guy. When I ordered a bowl of Pho (which was pretty good), he told my friend and I that he only makes Pho just to show that he could make better Pho than the establishment a couple of doors down. Which in my opinion was an easy feat because one time I was there I found like three ants just hanging out in the broth. The old guy that always talks to me in Vietnamese and is always sure to mess up my order, I don't even mind. How he can deliver that hot ass bowl of Pho barehanded always amazes me and gives him a pass to do whatever he wants. I touched the side of it once on accident and I almost cried. Almost. I don't think I have to hype the Banh Mi anymore, as other Yelpers have gone on and done that. The grilled pork is where it's at. They grill the onions too, which I think is a definite step up. The bread is top notch, and they always have NBA TV on, which makes it more than an ideal hangout spot for me and my fantasy basketball nerd brethren. Everything I've had here has been spot on, and the prices are not bad either. You can get full REAL easily for under $10. My favorite place on Stockton Blvd. hands down,  alongside the seedy video store that sells Korean VCD's near SF Supermarket.

My arteries will repay me someday for this abuse...Not the best but not the worst of the McDonald's franchises. It gets a passing grade.

A couple of friends and I took a seat at the tables facing the windows while we waited for the rest of our party. Immediately, we were greeted by a woman coming to take our drink order, *ding* I liked that.As soon as the rest of the girls showed up, our party of 10 was taken to our table.  A little background, when dining with my friends, its usually a party of about 6 or more, and I sometimes feel like an inconvenience for some restaurants because of all the accommodating that they have to do. But not here, we were seated at huge table that seated 12 perfectly. No one was "stuck in the cracks" and we had none of that uneven table trouble that bugs the crap outta me.Service was prompt, we had water almost immediately and drink orders taken.  I ordered from the Dine Downtown menu. I had the potato soup, deliciously creamy and tasty. Second I had the hand cut pasta, fresh and al dente. Last, the brownie with ice cream, very good, loved the little raspberry garnish.  One of my friends ordered the grilled New York strip from the regular menu, now, I am not a fan of eating meat that looks like it could still "moo" at you, but I had a bite and loved it. Very tender, melt in your mouth type meat.Few things that I especially liked about Ella, its loud. I know a lot of people don't like that ,but one thing I hate when dining in groups is having to feel like we need to whisper, or "keep it down" for the sake of the people around us. I love to be able to laugh and talk in an outside voice.  Another thing, my friend asked a server where the restroom was and he didn't just point her in the general direction, he actually took her and showed her to the hallway. Also, the table we were at was in front of the open kitchen which allowed us to take in all the delicious smells of food that they were cooking up.Overall I had a great experience at Ella. I want to give it 5 stars but don't think it's completely fair til I have tried more from their usual menu. Can't wait to go back!
<review# 2272,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/21/2007,2/22/2008,95,282,5,12,8>ohmygoodness!!!!!!!!!!!  I ordered one lemon cupcake with lemon buttercream frosting and lemon curd hidden in the centre.  That cute little cupcake didn't even stand a chance.  I don't think I've eaten anything that fast in my life.  The cupcake tasted like it had just been made -pillowy soft with just the right amount of tart lemon and sweetness.  There are 14 cupcakes to choose from and it was nice to see that there weren't too many left in the case.  That makes me think that they never let them sit out for more than a day...although I don't think that will be an issue once the word gets out about this place.Cupcakes cost $2.00 to $2.50 or if you stop in during their grand opening you can buy 5 and get one free.  There isn't anywhere inside to sit and eat, which is just as well because if you spend too much time there you'll want to try one of everything.UPDATE February 2008:  There's no day like ROTD to update your review!  I've been here twice since my initial review and both times the cupcakes I chose were nowhere near as delicious and soft as the first one I tried here.  I tried a peanut butter one and a cherry one and while the icing was delicious, the cupcake was a little dry.  Maybe they should change their name to Icing Craving.  I am downgrading my initial review from 5 stars to 3 stars.

You have kids running around the store acting crazy, ghetto ladies trying to oogle your cart, and the occasional semi-not-quite-there person trying to hang out with you. But I love it. There are good days and bad days... On the good days I walk away with some cool retro furniture, vintage clothing, & maybe a couple pair of shoes. Even on the bad days, I walk out with a good book & a nerdy board game. I can't complain.My favorite part is the random stuff they stash behind the counter because (I'm assuming) it's "Extra Valuable." Really Thriftown, the picture of scary Jesus in a handmade/brightly decorated frame? I mean, scary-Jesus-in-tacky-frame is cool & all... but I think he'd be okay on the shelves.
<review# 2274,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/27/2008,2/20/2008,457,1081,,17,22>Today was a really hard day for me but JD Acres made it roughly 10,000 times easier than it could have been.Recently, and under the advice of many professionals, I made the excruciatingly painful decision to rehome my horse, Dali.  I desperately wanted to take him with me to Hawaii but his issues with transit (he was abused in a trailer) were so monumental as to be a serious issue both to himself and others.  Had I subjected him to the trauma of being either flown or brought in by barge he would have most likely been, best case scenario, scarred psychologically for life.With his best interest in mind I placed ads in several reputable locations as well as put the word out amongst friends involved with horses.I waited.The responses I got from random strangers were less than encouraging and bordered on downright rude and supercilious.  It's a FREE horse!  A FREE horse that, although he has a couple of issues, is sound, young, excellent under saddle and extremely loving.Enter JD Acres.Founders, Jessica and Jenni, personally called me and listened to my plight.  They didn't judge me and were prompt and timely in arriving to pick up Dali.  They took great care with socializing him first with his trailering buddy and my horse that took 4 HOURS to load into a trailer previously walked right in after 10 minutes.  I was shocked, but ultimately grateful.  I took it as a sign that Dali was on to a good life.Jenni and Jessica assured me that they had 4 potential candidates that had been prescreened and were interested in providing Dali with the kind of home I had been giving him.  They told me that until Dali had been trained out of his trailering difficulties he would not be placed so that I felt secure in the knowledge that someone wouldn't mishandle or bully him into a trailer in the future.As a nonprofit horse rescue, they are exceptional.  I also donated a running vehicle I was planning on donating to a randomly selected charity to them.  Their gratitude was overwhelming.In truth, it is I who is grateful.  I know they will treat Dali with the same compassion and care that I have and I know that when it comes time to select his new "forever home" they will be as choosy as I would be.JD acres made me realize that I had performed a final selfless act of love for Dali.  It may not have stopped the tears of today but it will prevent tears tomorrow.
<review# 2275,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/29/2008,2/18/2008,22,39,2,13,5>This is a good vet clinic, but perhaps the biggest reason we bring our dog here is because it has an emergency hospital open all the time.  I hope I never have to rush my dog over there, but it is nice knowing it's always open.  I appreciate this all the more after seeing someone mistakenly bring their injured dog to Petsmart when the clinic was not open.  The vets have done a great job helping keep our dog's arthritis and hip dysplasia under control.  Mueller is also well organized and alerts us to necessary appointments. The grooming services at Mueller are pretty lousy though.  The last time our dog got a bath and brush there, she came back with giant clumps of matted hair and it cost a lot of money.
<review# 2276,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2008,2/17/2008,27,17,4,7,4>"Its the bomb."Those words were uttered a couple times during my first meal at Tuli Bistro. The phrase is not one heard often these days and truly when it is spoken, it is often with a smirk. However, that night at Tuli Bistro, they were said with complete reverence by two different wait staff regarding the food me and my dinner companion were about to partake.If cooking has a stage, Tuli Bistro is the theatre. The open nature of the kitchen allows, nay demands(!), that the those with a front seat interact with the chefs. Think Jim Denny's counter minus the grease and with lots of expensive cooking equipment, with players dressed the part of chefs.Beyond the counter, there are a few tables to seat cozy couples inside and more tables outside. It's a small theatre to be sure.The work that is produced however, is encore worthy. Indeed, I've already been back once again and plan on returning many more times. Like the good theatre that it is, Tuli Bistro promises a changing menu. While I enjoy variety, the items I've sampled deserve an extended run.Take the Tuli Sliders. Sliders are miniature burgers -- think White Castle. As these smallish burgers were placed in front of us, I was told they were "the bomb". Indeed they were. Two fat juicy mini burgers on soft pillowy bread, topped with thick bacon and blue cheese, accompanied by an aioli. They were gorgeous morsels of burger love that I admired for a few moments before taking my first bite.Ahhhh. Lovely.Although smallish in size, I took the time to savor these odes to all that is romantic in a burger. Succulent, complex, flavorful, juicy, textured. Dear God, what a burger.While the Tuli Sliders are a highlight to be sure, the rest of what I have enjoyed at Tuli Bistro has also reached a higher standard of culinary delight. I will recommend everything I've sampled: The shrimp scampi pizza, The Sleeping Ninja (ahi tuna), and the mushroom risotto. Their wine menu is quite extensive and well organized. As a bonus, many of the wines are offered by the glass.I hope you have the chance to catch one of these offerings given the menu's ever altering nature. However, I have no doubt that whatever is offered by the artists at Tuli Bistro, you will agree that "It's the bomb".
<review# 2277,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/14/2008,2/15/2008,177,474,3,6,5>3.5 stars for the yummy belly full of vegetarian delights that are boosting my failing immune system right now.4 stars for the lovely softspoken southern Indian waitstaff who filled my glass, brought me complimentary dosai, and warned me my tea needed sugar.  You were so friendly!  I am going to make this a regular stop for lunch.I was secretly headed to Round Table for my first buffet lunch ever there, but they are next door to a big banner proclaiming "Health Vegetarian Indian Food" and I remembered I had missed a planned dinner trip with some friends to this exact spot.  So, I wiped my conscience clean with a healthy meal instead of a Round Table escapade into calorie hell.Seeing as how I'm actually doing WW and have had really bad luck with virus attacks lately (seriously.  One bug after another.  I need some vitamins or something.) I decided to hit the healthy place, and filled up on good food.It was in my budget: $8.61 with tea and tax, and I gave them a tip for being so great.What did I get?  A really hearty vegetarian buffet lunch.  I tried a little of everything until I ran out of room on the plate.  I was too stuffed from one round to go back for rice pudding or soup.  One normal dinner plate holds about a scoop of each.  I tried tomato rice, a variety of curries, some cold potatoes, some hot spicy chutneys, and on and on.  It was a very large buffet. Nilesh is right, they use onions and garlic, and that works for me.  It's also quite spicy from chilis if you like them.To top it off, they brought me a dosai (dose-uh) which was a giant crepe.  It was stuffed with mild yellow mashed potatoes and a spicy pepper.  I picked the pepper out.  I couldn't eat the whole thing, I used it to mop up my plate full of chutneys.  Very surprising and delectable treat, like what they have STUFFED AND PACKED to a sickening amount at Vic's Chaat house, only this was easy to eat and not messy.  The rice flour crepe was pretty great.  I'm sure my blood sugar topped out at 400 after it though.I picked up the To Go menu, and will probably stop there for To Go dinner one of these nights.  It's packed full of Dosai items and lots of gobi dishes, so that's very exciting.If you are interested, they let me know that tonight is going to be a crazy packed buffet full of veggie delights for Valentine's day.  Apparently they never do dinner buffets, but this is special.  So, if you haven't figured out what you're doing tonight, that might be a heart-healthy option.Also noticed: quite a few single, cute young 20 something Asian and Indian vegetarian guys eating lunch alone.  Make a note of that if you need that info for your personal future use.
<review# 2278,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2008,2/14/2008,86,115,2,6,6>I've been here several times over the last few years.  And all I have to say is that their customer service is outstanding.  I tried to get an alignment for my old Honda here, and even though they worked on it for about 45 minutes, they still didn't charge as my alignment was not off (it was something else).Fast forward to today.  I stop in to get a tire with a very slow leak patched.  I'm out in 20 minutes, and they didn't even charge for it.  And my tires are not from there either.  That's just awesome.  This isn't the first time that good ol Les Schwab has saved my ass, i.e. wallet and tires.  10 years ago a Les Schwab on HW 1 in Oregon did the same thing, patched my very flat tire for free.  Although it was cool today, it was a life saving event back then for some poor, sobriety challenged kids from California.  Thanks for always being there Les.
<review# 2279,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/16/2012,8/21/2012,65,799,10,15,9>Yesterday, my friends from Folsom offered their favorite downtown Sacramento foodies (that's me and my fiancé)  an invitation to wine and dine amongst their other suburbanite friends.  We happily agreed to Italian food since we were too cranky to cook and too tired to grocery shop.  Given that we eventually want to make Folsom our home, we were more than happy to check out the food around town.  Our friends settled on one of their favorite Italian restaurants in Folsom, Sergio Steak and Seafood.  Since I had never been, I was uber excited to try their food and most importantly, Yelp about it!Our friends warned us that Sergio was oddly located in a strip mall like center (right next to a Western store that oddly enough sold authentic cowboy boots, flashy vests and country dresses to suit your fancy).  Anyway I digress! Don't let the exterior of Sergio restaurant fool you though, the moment we went in I felt like we flew thousands of miles away from the heart land to Florence, Italy.  We heard classical Italian singing (live) and were warmly by the owner, Sergio, himself.  Chris was our server and did an excellent job with our party of eight.  He allowed us to sample a few wines before we made our selections.  The bread that they served were baked daily (although not as warm served as I would have liked) but the olive tapenade was absolutely amazing.  I think I ate the whole thing and asked for seconds.  I was a savage!For appetizers, we did family style and ordered two plates of the grilled eggplant with gorgonzola, escargots, crab cakes and prosciutto e melone.  I have had amazing escargot in France and I did not particularly taste anything spectacular with Sergio's escargot.  I crab cakes and prosciutto were decent but I was most surprised with the tastiness of the eggplant gorgonzola.  Sweet Jesus, that tasted amazing and I recommend that everyone and anyone who comes to this restaurant order this delicious appetizer.  Warm upon arrival with the perfect glaze of heaven topped with sprinkles of gorgonzola cheese oozing in your mouth of flavor.  For soup, I had the ginger carrot soup which was very flavorful and light.  Some of the other people in my party ordered house salads and I know they were secretly eyeing my soup after realizing that they made a mistake ordering an average salad.  Hehe, suckas! For my main course, I had the scallops with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables.  The moment I took a bite of my scallops I knew I made the right decision (WINNING!!!) and they were HUGE and MOIST (That's what she said).  Every bite made me want more and every mouthful I was thinking about the next. My friends other selections including the risotto (with salmon) and the pumpkin tortellini.  I had a few of them sample my scallops and they definitely agreed that my dish was by far the best!   The server Chris was splendid and the food pretty good.   I feel like some dishes that were there were either hit or miss.  You just have to know what to order.  My friends who had the risotto thought it was not very flavorful and would have ordered something different had they known.   The crab cakes were decent, but nothing to write home about.  Chris did a great job with checking on us frequently and I never felt like I was waiting too long for my food.  For dessert we all ordered something different including the double chocolate cake, the orange tiramisu and the bread pudding.  Hands down the bread pudding was the best with the warm goodness of the bread mixed with the cold touch of the ice cream on top.  I think I stole about 3-4 extra bites of the bread pudding.  Try it with coffee, it will blow your mind. CONS:1) Bread needs to be warmer upon arrival. Risotto needs more flavor, crab cakes and escargot were decent but feel like it left us with something to be desired. PROS:1) Eggplant gorgonzola, olive tapenade, carrot ginger soup, scallops and bread pudding--- you rocked my world!!! 2) Loved the live classically trained Italian singing between three or four men in  (although this happens rarely says Sergio himself)3) Chris allowing us to sample the wine before making our orders (terrific)4)  Atmosphere: casual but quaint 5) Sergio coming by throughout dinner to check on us and at the end when he spoke to the entire table.  An experiential  dining adventure!
<review# 2280,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2012,8/20/2012,317,342,5,19,8>My girlfriend bought the Groupon for a new way to get us into shape.  When we did the sign up and looked at the website, I really wasn't sure what to expect.  You are required to have hand wraps, boxing gloves, and a jump rope, all of which you can buy on your own, or buy at the facility.  It's in the improving area of Del Paso near the old ice rink.I walked in for my introductory session and I was honestly scurrred for what the class was going to do to me.  A regular session was just finishing up and the group was drenched, and looked completely spent after moving from pushups to some other ab work, and ended with a run outside somewhere.  The introductory session wasn't that bad.  It was a good little warm up, they teach you how to put on your hand wraps, and how to throw a punch the right way along with footwork.  I went home and felt better.  After my first regular 45 minutes session, I can say it was the hardest work out of my life.  It doesn't compare to other things I've done.  Each session and trainer is different, but it is tough because trying to box is something I've never done before.  You don't actually spar, but it's everything else you would probably do to train for a fight fitness wise.  You always start with jumping rope (which I am absolutely horrible at!) or on the treadmill or bike to get your feet and heart rate going.  Then you do a variety of ab work and legs, move on to the heavy bag, speed bag, back to the heavy bag, and more ab work and legs.  I was sore for three days, and yet I keep coming back.  The music is blasting and keeps you going because its heavy beats with some top 40 mixed in (no country or techno music here) and you just move to it naturally.I recommend this gym to anyone that is looking for something different than your regular chain.  But my only beef is it is a little pricey.  If it wasn't for the Groupon, I would've thought twice of going.

<review# 2282,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2012,8/18/2012,156,217,7,17,11>A year ago, a hapless Chinese fast food place was permanently shuttered after a brief stint here, and its faded grand opening sign remains next to the shiny new grand opening banner signifying the resurrection of Suite 100 in this 95% empty commercial plaza as Stevie Boy Burger. But Stevie isn't betting that two grand opening banners and its new professional backlit sign is enough to catch the eyes of passing motorists on southbound Stockton Blvd just north of Lemon Hill. New business on Stockton Blvd provides new hope, but even with two best feet forward, there's two janky feet forward, too. What a strange beast!The newest eyesore on the boulevard isn't a bundle of discarded tires or a march of miserable pockmark-faced hookers. It's a humongous hapazardly hand-painted hackwork on plywood which proclaims a superior burger bargain: "Stevieboy Burgers 1/3 Pound Cheeseburger + Fries + Coke $6.99 Hand-Patted [sic] patties 100% Angus Beef". That did strike me as a good deal. The very next thing that struck me about this was that the professional sign and the hand-painted sign offered two different spellings. I wasn't in the mood to be pedantic for long 'cos I was hungry and in the mood for a burger.Despite all the window panes and glass door being fogged with grease and perma-smudged (blame the previous tenant), the spartan interior was clean, and you can peer deep into the their very well-outfitted kitchen and feel assured that this place is safe. On four panels hangs a hand-painted menu bearing the same sketchy strokes and bristly brushwork of the screaming sign by the sidewalk. The menu's pretty simple: six burgers including a chili burger plus fish & chips. The prices are fair. The smell in the air is fresh and mouthwatering. I chose the crown jewel of the menu, the "Stevieboy Burger" with bacon, avocado, and jalapeño. You can make it a combo for $7.99 with fries and a fountain drink which is refillable to your heart's content, and surely beyond.Stevie Boy must've idealized Five Guys as his benchmark burger, because the burgers and fries looked and tasted remarkably similar to theirs. Pretty good. Maybe even very good. But what stands out the most about it besides its quality-to-quantity-to-dollar value is its impeccable composure. I've never seen a burger this girthy--with its thick patty, layers of thick bacon, avocado, grilled jalapeño, plus lettuce and tomato--stay together with so little fuss. No, Carl's Jr. ...It really doesn't hafta get all over the place! The grilled pepper was one hulking jalapeño, splayed open, and de-seeded. So, it wasn't very hot, and it didn't taste like much. It might as well have been a bell pepper. I might suggest splaying open a pasilla pepper for more flavor. The hand-cut fries had their skins intact and just a judicious dash of seasoning. No short and stubbies! They were flaky inside, but coulda been crisper on the outside. Stevie Boy has met or exceeded the Five Guys benchmark for burgers, but there's still a little ways to go with these fries.Service was sprightly and courteous, if not a little too courteous. The young grillmeister who delivered my burger basket apologized for the wait. But what wait? It was quite prompt.Because I live nearby, I will definitely be back to take advantage of this bargain.
<review# 2283,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2012,8/17/2012,466,199,11,20,21>If I could give them 6 stars I would! See what I did there?I feel like this restaurant was made just for me. I've had fantastic food, cocktails and service every time. I love that they don't have a minimum requirement when you order oysters. Most places in town force you to order 1/2 dozen or a dozen at a time. There are 4 types of oysters available each day and I've been having fun mixing and matching to find my favorite. Unfortunately, I've been mixing and matching cocktails at the same time so I don't recall which oysters I liked best. I need to start writing things down...The mix masters behind the bar are creative and have put together an awesome drink menu. One night when it was winding down and not so busy, they made us some great custom drinks. I wouldn't recommend this when it's rush hour, since a lot of TLC goes into those cocktails. The Moscow Mule is one of my favorites on the menu - a refreshing gingery vodka-based drink served in a copper ice-packed mug.  Delicious!If I can recommend one item on the menu, it's got to be the seafood chowder. This is hands down the best chowder I've had in Sacramento. I welcome any challengers but you're going to want to head down to Blackbird first, try theirs and then let me know what you've got.

The parking it crazy in the lot, so stick to the streets. The misters are maybe a little much, there was a constant drip of water off of the umbrella.  However the use of the old gas station is great and the outside seating area is comfortable and shaded. It's a nice addition to the great food.I would only complain about their efficiency, I know it'll get better with time and that I went on a weekend, the first Sunday that they've ever been open, but there was still a long wait. Overall though, if you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing out!  This is the best place to eat in all of Sacramento on a budget.
<review# 2285,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2012,8/15/2012,1070,429,9,11,10>I've had Picnic Day scheduled in my calendar for quite some time. I liked the idea of drinking all day and pretending to be an undergrad. I wanted to compare it to my alma mater's day-long bacchanalia known as Sungod (UCSD, woo!). But alas, I'm growing up. And instead of getting obliterated at 7 am in Davis, I will be heading out of town to attend a baby shower. Because that's what happens when twenty-somethings move out to the suburbs - we give up our crazy boozy pasts and take up benign activities like bicycle rides, running clubs, and house-hunting on Zillow. Is Davis a suburb? Or is it a college town? It fluctuates both ways, to be sure, and nowhere is that more evident than at a place like The Habit.Good, greasy burgers and crisp fries. Fast service, and enough drink options to satisfy the pangs of dehydration caused by long stretches of drinking. And yet, no booze. No beer, no wine, no nothing. I've been to other Habit locations in other suburbs/college towns (Santa Barbara, anyone?) that have served alcoholic drinks, so it bums me that the one in town does not. In a place like Davis where there are so many burger options, not being able to enjoy a beer with my cheeseburger definitely knocks it down a notch. The prices are attractive, and I will never completely ignore a place that serves up chocolate milkshakes, but it's an improvement that this location would be wise to make.On the other hand, when I asked for their beer selection, the cashier told me, "We don't serve alcohol, this is a PG-13 restaurant."I'm pretty sure that knocks 8 years off the drinking age, but with my beer-soaked youth rapidly disappearing behind me, I'll gladly continue to patronize a spot where I can take my (gulp) future children.

It is right out of an interior design magazine that we often see and covet.The venue is a smart blend of 1920's and 2012 style. The second you walk in your problems are left at the door. Hell, there's even a huge R&R logo on the wall, so RELAX already.The drinks here are still a work in progress, but have a very good trend. The Old Cuban is dynamite! I will steal that recipe for home mixology. Overall some great potential in the line up of drinks and the style/quality is keeping with the resurgent speakeasy style.The animals on a stick is a cool concept, and makes for great anticipation, but much was left to be desired. Too bland for my liking.The roasted beet carpaccio was a grand slam for a guy that never really gave beets a try. I would revisit this surprisingly. The sandwiches here are all good, but messy overall. You may want to knife and fork them.There is a nice Sunday brunch and they offer a daily happy hour.Overall this is a fantastic venue for drinks, ambience and nibbles. It makes for a great place to have good conversation with friends or significant others.  It gets to 4 stars for the first impression and upside.  The food is inconsistent, but has major potential if they take feedback well... Spice it up! Nobody wants a dull bunny.
<review# 2287,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2012,8/12/2012,910,555,17,20,18>Hungry on a Tuesday night, a couple friends invited me to Cafe M for some food and drinks..and I'm always down for some food and drinks!  Ready to go in my oversized pajama tee, university pullover sweatshirt, jeans and flats, I was ready to eat good and eat comfortably!!Upon arrival, I realized what I got myself into -_-  Windows were tinted and gated, strobe lights were on, music was playing.  I was at a Vietnamese Quan Nhau!!!  I've been to a couple in San Jose and Orange County but I don't frequent them at all.  We figured, since we were there, we'll have a few drinks and head out elsewhere for food.  However, the music was pretty crackinnnn!  After a weekend filled with EDM, I was feelin the hip hop playing at Cafe M.  Therefore, we decided to stay.We ordered some beers; me a Blue Moon and the homies some Heinekens and Coronas..then we looked at the food menu and dayummm..definitely quan nhau prices.  Now, if you're not Vietnamese, you might be asking wth a quan nhau is.  I guess you can call it a Vietnamese lounge/karaoke bar/restaurant?  Hot waitresses, overpriced beers and beer food all inclusive.  The beers weren't too bad, though..I believe it was $3 a bottle.  The food ranged about $12-18 a dish...We ordered:-Chicken wings w/ fish sauce: 7 pieces for $12.99..they were pretty bomb!  Don't order this expecting Wing Stop, my friend.  These wings are drenched in an Asian-inspired sauce that complements the fish sauce quite well.  They sit on a bed of cucumbers and lettuce, which I loved!-Fried rice: not sure exactly which type of fried rice but that dish was delicious, too!  I couldn't really see what was in it because it was dark but I know it was full of flavor and texture.-Bo Tai Chanh (beef carpaccio, Vietnamese style) - my pick!  My favorite dish of the night!  Lemon cured, thinly sliced pieces of beef sirloin...mixed with assorted veggies such as mint and onions.  Fairly easy to make at home but also makes for great beer food.-Muc Kho (dried squid) dipped with hoisin sauce and sriracha!  This was the last item we ordered.  It's more like snack food to munch on..you can't go wrong with dried squid.-Also, when they came out with our beers, they brought out edamame.  My friend mentioned it's similar to Mikuni's "freaky edamame".  It was still warm and it was coated with a spicy seasoning..I wanna say cayenne pepper?  That was a nice treat.They have 10 flat screen TV's which displayed sports channels and karaoke videos.  They have quite a wide variety of English and Vietnamese songs, too!  Although, I did prefer the hip hop they played in the beginning.  If this was my scene, I'd have given Cafe M 5 stars.  It's the epitome of a quan nhau, food is good, music is good, people are friendly, girls are hot. But considering I saw my dad's homie and had to dip because "it isn't proper for a lady to be at such an establishment", I probably won't be back.  Maaaaybeeee in the day time for their food, though!!P.S. CASH ONLY RIGHT NOW!
<review# 2288,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2012,8/11/2012,354,195,8,9,10>I dont know how many times I will end up saying this in my Yelp reviews, but, once again I will say, I am not a fan of sweets. I very rarely find myself wanting a sugary sweet confection. But when I do, Ettores is a place I think of to cure the rare desire. The beauty of their creations is the first thing I appreciate when coming in and staring into the cases. So many different items to choose from. From simple croissants and granola to beautiful cupcakes and layered confections. It all looks good. I have been here twice for other peoples desires but can never resist a bite of my own. On my first visit I was buying my Nana, who has a very strong sweet tooth, a little something to surprise her with. I knew from all the great reviews that Ettores was the place to go for something special. I choose a caramel and walnut cheesecake for her and the white chocolate strawberry cake for my sister and I to split. The slices were like $3.95 and very good sized slices. The cake was delicious. It was so light and not heavy with over the top, sugar sweetness. I'm not even a fan of strawberry flovored sweets and I ended up eating more than my share. My Nana didnt even offer to share hers, which is a sure sign that she enjoyed it! The second time I visited the bakery, was for my dad's birthday. He also has a sweet tooth and ever so picky to buy presents for, so I knew buying him a sinfully delicious birthday cake would suffice. I bought a small chocolate mousse cake that fed 5 people with pleanty left over and only cost $23. I very much enjoyed this cake. Once again it, the cake was moist and light with devilishly chocolate frosting. Nothing like the sugar crystal infestation that other store bought cakes carry. I will continue to buy my confections from Ettores for a few simple reasons; They have a variety of treats, they are affordable in price and most importantly, they are not laiden with heavy, belly aching, sugar overloaded, frostings. Do I recommend?....Uh YEAH!
<review# 2289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2006,4/1/2007,5,12,8,5,1>I have called Corti Brothers "The Offical Home of Good Food" for quite some time.  If you prefer low price, homogeneity, and 100,000 square foot superstores, then Raley's and Safeway are for you.  If not, then you choose between Whole Foods, Taylor's and Corti.  For me, Taylor's is stellar for ordering specific things but a bit too small and boutique, and Whole Foods, while it has a killer cheese section and the organic choices can't be beat, fails to deliver on a few key fronts.  They are:1.  Employees - Corti's employees, each and every one of them, are helpful, knowledgeable, considerate, and seem to generally enjoy their work (there is one kind of dour lady at the deli counter, but I've been trying to warm her up a bit).  You can tell that the management treats them very well and they enjoy working there.2.  Meat Counter - If God has created a better meat counter, tell me right now and I will go in conquer it in my name, even if it means fighting a land war in Asia.  The meat selection is robust, the cuts prime, and to no surprise, the service friendly, intelligent, and swift.  Try the Shitake marinated steaks there before you die.  The coulotte steaks are a great buy for the price.3.  Little Italian Touches - If you only shop at big supermarkets, you would never know that Golden Grain and Barilla have competition.  Their selection of imported pasta and pasta sauces (although you really should get the Corti meat sauce located in the cheese cooler at the far end of the store) is eye-opening.  The Olive Oil selection and spice selections are the best I've ever seen.4.  The Wine Guy - This guy is a freaking pimp.  If you're unsure about pairing wines with certain dishes, or generally looking to get wine recommendations, he'll set you straight.  Don't be afraid to tell him what you're willing to spend; you'd be surprised the quality of wine that you can get there for under $20.5.  (Most Important)  The Wonderful World of Italian Cured Pork - Italian Cured Porks are near the top of the food pyramid for me, right above Zebra but below the elusive but unbeatable Sea Otter.  I'm talking about bacons, cappicolas, coppas, toscanos, soppresatas, hams, pancettas, and prosciuttos.  The deli counter is proof that we have a benevolent and loving God who wants his children to be happy and die of heart disease before they have to suffer the indignity of old age.As you can tell, I'm quite excited about this place.  As I've told the charming cashiers, the way fashionistas feel about Milan and Rodeo Drive, is the way I feel when I go to Corti Brothers.
<review# 2290,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/15/2006,3/31/2007,19,16,2,5,3>I'm new to the Sacramento area, but this has to be one of the places that I find myself frequenting often. The place is cozy and comfortable, and one has the feeling that they're in an authentic Ethiopian restaurant, assuming that all Ethiopian restaurants have travel posters hung on their walls. The owner ( I'm assuming it's the owner, it's the only person I've seen work there, and she's got her stack of textbooks in the back booth ) is very nice, although her command of the English is limited. She's very eager to please, although I've seen her having problems with overly demanding and unappreciative customers. This place appears to be popular with the Ethiopian locals. And what I mean by that, is that there's often a large contingent of people who aren't speaking English, who go in the 'back room' and become loud, boisterious, and are looking like they're having an exceptionally good time. In fact, they often look like they're having a much better time than I am, although the food keeps me from becoming overly jealous.

<review# 2295,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2007,3/25/2007,43,95,2,6,7>I wish I could give the Crest ten stars; that's how much I love it.  A quick disclaimer:  I'm part of the volunteer staff of the Trash Film Orgy (I'm Wednesday the photographer) so I've been at the Crest when it's closed to the public.  I've seen the storage areas, the green rooms and the dressing rooms.  You'd think seeing the inner workings of a business would destroy the fantasy that's presented to the public, but it just makes me love the Crest even more.  Where do I start?  How about with the sheer BEAUTY of the place?  It's utterly gorgeous.  The concession stand, lobby, bar and main theater have been lovingly restored to their art deco splendor.  The carpet and theater curtains are beautiful.  The seats aren't state-of-the-art (sorry, no cup holders) but they were reupholstered a few years back and they're comfortable.  The ladies' powder room, with its curved wall of mirrors, is a bit run-down but still harkens to a glamorous past.  The antique urinals in the men's room are downright sculptural in their elegance.  Two small theaters as well as a concession stand and restrooms were recently added to the basement.  Happily, they were designed to discreetly complement the fabulous main theater so they don't look like glaring modern additions. The Crest strives to feature entertainment you won't find elsewhere, from first-run indie flicks to classic films.  I'd seen Metropolis and La Belle et la Bete before, but seeing them on the enormous million-dollar Crest screen was amazing.  I've only attended one concert at the Crest (Dick Dale and the Del-Tones), but I thought the sound quality was great.  As for the annual midnight Trash Film Orgy, held for six weeks every summer, it's become a Sacramento institution and it makes full use of the Crest's unique features.  The lobby is filled with insane carnival games, the bar becomes the RetroTrash Lounge (bands have even managed to play down there), and the stage always ends up splattered with fake blood.  Despite all that craziness, the performers and theater staff manage to clean it all up quickly afterward.  The audience, for the most part, respects the theater as much as the performers do.  As far as I know, there's never been any damage or vandalism to the theater by TFO patrons.  The Crest is a treasure, and everyone seems to recognize that fact.The concession stand features traditional movie theater snacks, but the popcorn beats any other theater's popcorn by a landslide.  The employees behind the counter and out in the vintage ticket booth are always friendly.  Honestly, I can't think of a single complaint about the Crest, except that it's not next door to my house.  That would make it absolutely perfect.  I'd probably put a cot in the back and live there.
<review# 2296,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/31/2007,3/24/2007,32,69,2,9,6>Why do I love the library?  Reading for free!  Belle Cooledge is the branch most convenient to where I live.  I love the library system where you can request materials from other libraries and have it delivered to the location closest to you.  Also, the library system is almost like Netflix.  I can build a list of materials I want to check out online, and then request them whenever I want.  The downside to Belle Cooledge is it's hours.  Not opening until noon three days out of the week kind of sucks.  Especially because after school lets out, this place is packed with kids.  Whatever happened to libraries being quiet?  I guess it's better for kids to be at a library than somewhere worse.  On the positive side, I also like the magazine and newspaper selection.  You can sit there for hours reading periodicals!  And, the library has more than books.  I've checked out music CD's and videos, too.  Libraries are a great benefit and should always be supported!

Well, maybe the farmer's market and their ridiculously cool co-op will do the trick. For me, it's the solid, eco-friendly community that draws me to Davis. Their Farmer's Market is a great representation of such. Beautiful produce, beautiful days, beautiful people. I agree with Dane O. on expanding the market, but otherwise, I love it.
<review# 2299,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2012,9/1/2012,1059,313,11,15,14>It had been a while since I visited The Firehouse Restaurant and I have to say that I was just as impressed with their food, service and presentation as I remember from past experiences.  Other times I had been there for dinner but this time I was in there for lunch.   We sat outside, I love it outside. It's so peaceful and so beautiful out there.  Our waiter was on top of everything and very friendly.  We ordered a chicken dish with thick noodles, I believe it was part of the lunch specials. I may be wrong but it was on a separate piece of paper and not on the menu. The chicken was delicious, the pasta was cooked to perfection. Even their bread is delicious and I love the little detail of shaping the butter into a flower. The part I am dying to get to is the dessert. I am never one to order dessert so I didn't really know what to order but reading the menu the Gianduja Mousse Bombe seemed like something worth trying. OH MY HOLY GOODNESS!!! This dessert was the BOMB! The presentation is unbelievable and the taste was out of this world. All of those different flavors just coming together in my mouth was an experience on its own.  I had to write down what it was made with because I just had to come on here and tell you. Chocolate mousse cake, hazelnut royaltine crust, raspberry-zinfandel sorbet and cocoa nib crème fraîche.  It was so good, I would go in just to eat dessert.I was in there on a Wednesday I believe. We stopped a moment to talk to the bartender on the way out and he let us know they had some sort of happy hour that day where beers were $2.00 and wine was $3.00.  We didn't come back for the happy hour but that's a pretty darn good happy hour for The Firehouse. I'm in love...
<review# 2300,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2012,8/30/2012,474,133,26,21,24>Ever feel like God is just looking down on you with a smile?  I don't get that feeling very often, but today was a definite exception. So there I was walking down Sutter Street hungry and thinking how boring the all of the antique and tourist trap shops are.  That's when I saw a bright light gleaming down from the clouds above, highlighting a sidewalk sign that read Beach Hut Deli now open. It's as if sandwich Jesus smiled and said here have a sandwich and while you're at it, how about a first to review as well. Not just any sandwich that is, a superior Jesus approved Beach Hut sandwich. There was a thought of having something other than the norm from the wide selection on the menu board, but I still cannot seem to talk myself into anything other than my usual.  Beach Hut trip #108 and BLT #108. No scratch that, it was BLT #109; there was that time April of '07 when I thought I was absolutely starving and went for two. Today's sandwich did not disappoint. The bread is so magnificent that I could almost eat it just by itself. Then let us not forget the small mountain of perfectly cooked and flavorful bacon overflowing from the sides and ends. Combine this with fresh and ripe tomato slices and in The Shack fashion, added pickles, and you've got yourself an incredible sandwich. As far as I am concerned there can never be too many Beach Hut Deli's. This newest location, located with the Lockdown Brewery, is another welcome addition.  Oh and sandwich Jesus has already gone on record as stating "Mr. Pickles need not bother as the king known as BHD shall rule whatever jungle it chooses to step into." Thank you sandwich Jesus and now let us break bread.

Do check as some produce is not organic. The "certified organic" logo is trustworthy; the "USDA Organic" is really a worthless certification but you'll see it too.Did I mention, GO EARLY. C'mon, you can do it. Just get out of bed and get down there before 9. Otherwise, prepare to get squeezed & jostled. Bummer, no dogs allowed for health code reasons, but when you see how busy this place is, you'll understand.And, you'll feel good about what you're buying because it didn't get flown in from Chile, Equador, or somewhere else ridiculously distant.Better yet, leave the car at home and bike here. Or walk. The park's just across the street.Live way out in the burbs? Sell that cavernous two-story, buy an overpriced condo downtown, ditch the Escalade, buy an old-school 10-speed and bike to work.

Asked me that before today, I would've said NO WAY, not even close!Groupon kindly reminded me to use my groupons before they expired. Sabaidee was going to expire at the end of this month so today was the day I finally used it and I could not have been happier with my experience. I used my $30 dinner groupon and ordered:*Thai Iced Tea-Delicious. *Papaya Salad:Lao style- One of the BEST papaya salad I've ever had at a restaurant! We had the 3rd level of spicyness (on a scale of 1-10) and it was too spicy for me but still enough to be enjoyable! It was accompanied with cabbage and noodles. * Pad See Ew w/ chicken-My sisters favorite thing to order at Thai restaurants and she said it was the best she's ever had. (her taste buds goes only back to Charlotte, NC). I tried it for the first time and it was really flavorful! *Pad Thai w/ Chicken and Prawn-Delicious! This pad thai was really flavorful. The color was lighter than what I'm use to at restaurants so I had my doubts but it was so good! I sprinkled a little lime on each bite and it was really tasty. I added prawns for an extra 2 bucks to my pad thai. It only came with 3 pieces but I was willing to forgive because the waitress was so sweet. When she first brought it out she kept staring at it to make sure there were prawns in it. I told her that the male server said there was. She came back to refill our drinks and looked at it again and said to let her know if there wasn't any in there so she can deduct it from our bill. After she left I dug 3 up, so I let it go. especially since I also had a groupon. Our waitress was so  friendly and personable! she made conversations to the customers that came in and was really attentive to us. She offered us suggestions and was really patient. I'm excited to go back and try other things! Btw their menu goes beyond Thai. They also offer Lao food and Pho!

Came back for a banquet last night and was pleasantly surprised. Not only was the place looking good but the food was better than I remembered. I'm not a huge Chinese wedding food fan but I was killin the chicken, beef broccoli plate, and the fried rice. Oh the fried rice. Ok what am I saying, I killed everything else that came out too.

This is one of my regular spots, much to the detriment of my wallet. Last February I think I racked up about $500 in bar tabs just at Shady alone, but I was feeling particularly lushy that month, so whatever.I live about a block away, so I spend a lot of time here when I want to enjoy a quality drink and a nice cigar while reading. Mondays thru Wednesdays are my favorite nights as the crowd tends to be more low-key and you're much more likely to start a friendly conversation with the people around you. I've met several people at this bar over the years who have just been totally awesome. Professions range from nurses, actors, whitewater rafting instructors, musicians, etc. This place attracts a diverse crowd of hipsters, white collar stiffs, and the people that fall between (like me). At one point in time, I would have recommended this place for the food, as well as the drinks, but after several iterations of their menu, I'd say you're better off eating next door at Magpie's then going to Shady for the drinks. Don't get me wrong, they've got some tasty little dishes, but the prices are a bit too high for what you're getting. Perhaps if they brought back their pork belly and quail egg brunch dish I'd change my mind.As far as drinks go, this is one of the best places in Sacramento to get an artisan cocktail. The drink recipes have been created by quality mixologists who have a keen sense on what flavors work together. When I'm not drinking a Suntory Yamazaki neat, I like to drink the White Linen, Aviation, Horse's Neck, and Jameson and the Giant Peach. White Linen = Cucumbers, lime, and gin. The most refreshing drink you can imagine and aptly named. This is perfect for day drinking during the summer.Aviation = Another gin concoction. Watching them make this drink will make you thirsty for it. Looks pretty fancy, so you should drink this with your pinky up.Horse's Neck = A whisky drink typically made with bourbon, but I like to have them use scotch instead. I think the finish is a bit smoother when scotch is substituted. Jameson and the Giant Peach = I buy this for my friends who don't  enjoy drinking. I like how it preys on their childhood memories and then f@&#s them up, hahaha. Basically a default tasty drink for girls.Other reasons why I like this place are the staff and the live music. The bartenders and bouncers are pretty good at remembering faces, so once you've stopped by a few times they make you feel like you're a regular. On many days you'll find a small band playing on their stage, or even the one and only Lee Diamond. There's no reason to not like this place, unless you're under 25 years of age on a weekend, you're an obnoxious douche, and you hate having a fun time.

I needed to get back downtown pronto and yellow cab was super backed up. After a quick yelp search I found this cab service and Abie? Abey? Avey? arrived within 20 minutes in a very good mood. He was probably the coolest cab driver I've ever had. We laughed, we cried. I was grateful he was such a great conversationalist as it distracted my from my hangover. There is nothing worse than silently rocking in the back of a cab at 8am with a pounding headache, trying not to vomit and knowing the driver is grumpy and silently judging your smeared eyeliner and the fact that you smell like vodka and candy and only have one shoe. Right? Am I right? Anybody? Uh, yeaa...Anyway the cab was super clean and it all felt very friendly, like I was just riding in the back of a friend's car. It was also pretty cheap at under $20. Definitely using these guys again.

It's the perfect little place for a fresh, fulfilling, delicious brunch. As we walked in I noticed the place had already been busy prior to our private party, there is small clean kitchen to the right so you can watch as the chefs prepare meals and everyone was drinking something that looked really good. After grabbing a seat I made my way to the bar and ordered the special drink of the morning- a blood orange mimosa ($3). This was hands down the best mimosa I have ever had. The blood orange juice was fresh squeezed and mixed with the champagne.To start off we had some Housemade Pastries served with preserves and Irish Butter compliments of Alex L. The pastry that stood out to me was the chocolate cupcake. It was so chocolaty, warm and fluffy with crisp a muffin top. Alone the cupcake was already so good but with the added Irish butter it was irresistible. My boyfriend and I decided to order the veggie burritos ($8) with a side of chicken apple sausage ($3). The server asked if we wanted to have the sausage chopped and put in the burrito- that was a great idea! We both agreed the burritos were really good and filling. The spinach, mushrooms, peppers and onions were all freshly sautéed and mixed with scrambled eggs, black beans, potatoes and cheese. This burrito was not lacking in anyway. It also came with sour cream and fresh salsa as well as 2 kinds of hot sauce. The service was really good. The bartenders had mimosas ready to go servers were quick and attentive. There were so many great items on the menu I can't wait to return and try everything else.

I couldn't stop.  Refills for only $1!  I was borderline spinning out and decided to grab some fodder.  Well, I really wanted one of everything, but I ended up choosing.... you guessed it... grilled cheese.  Airy foccacia, with swiss and fontina cheese, sauteéd spinach and cooked to a golden brown.  I ordered a side salad of crisp mixed greens with just enough vinaigrette to not be overpowering.  It was spectacular.  It's also nice not to have to go alllllllll the way to mid-town....I think I have a new hang out place.  Check it out and thanks for reading!
<review# 2313,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2010,5/18/2010,61,271,3,13,9>This nice little noodle factory is located right next to the fortune cookie bakery on 10th Street just down the street from the Fox 'n Goose.   There isn't much outside to mark this place but a small "noodle factory" sign inside the screen door.According to the business cards inside, their name is now the Mei Mei Noodle Factory.I stopped in to see what kind of freshly-made noodles were available.  There isn't much of a showroom front.   Most of the space is devoted to noodle making.  In front is just a counter and a sign on the wall with a list of the products that they make:1. Udon Noodle2.Stir Fry Noodle3.Thin Noodle4. Deep Fry Noodle5. Wonton Wraps For Fry6. Wonton Wraps For Soup7. Dumpling Wraps8. Pot-Sticker WrapsNothing is prepacked.   I asked the people working there to weigh out what I wanted.I bought 1-lb of thin noodles and 1-lb of stir fry noodles. They were only $.99 per lb.Tonight, I boiled up 1/2 lb of the stir fry noodles.   They are fairly thick, so it took about 6-7 minutes in a full boil to get them to "al dente".After straining and rinsing them in cold water, I tossed the noodles  into a pan of stir fried baby bok choy, sliced carrots and onions, and then I added some hoisin sauce and pieces of oven-baked pork ribs,tossed around everything in a pan for several minutes, then served up enough for 2 hungry people..(or for 3 not-so hungry ones)The noodles were delicious!  I can't wait to try the thin noodles in a broth soup.  Or some of the wonton wraps to make dumplings.Nothing beats freshly-made noodles.  They are so good and so inexpensive when purchased here!(note: the thin noodles cook much quicker!  I had these tonight with a bit of canned beef broth for soup.  Delicious!)

It features a historical and impressive bar, as well as some lovely stained glass work throughout the premises. The food is decent and the portions are very large. I usually order the burger - a big, garlicky, dependable menu choice. For an informal, sit-down meal in Old Sac, I would generally choose Fat City over the competition.

Whenever I go to a restaurant for another visit I hate to order the same thing over and over again. I ditch that rule whenever I come here.I always get a small black raspberry marble milkshake: static1.px.yelp.com/phot Anyone who comes with me and tries my milkshake always ends up getting the same thing. I can't blame them so don't hate.I know Gunther's has a ton of other flavors that are great but I'm always happy with this. If you're on a budget there are also frozen chocolate dipped bananas, cherries, and slices of cheesecake. I've never had any of these but they are tempting.I could end this review with my milkshakes bring all the boys to the yard, but then no one would go to Gunther's because of me and we can't have that.

It was an experience I shall never forget.First, I was very pleased by the ambiance of the place. There is a really nice outdoor seating area which I imagine would be ideal during the summertime when there isn't death weather surrounding us. The interior definitely has that southern feel to it. We opted to sit at the bar because my stomach yelled at me when I considered waiting 30 minutes for a table. When we sat down they immediately brought over some biscuits and apple butter. I was in the mood to tear meat off a bone and get sauce-hands that night so I ordered the baby back ribs. My boyfriend ordered the beef ribs, which of course arrived in the normal gargantuan Fred Flintstone fashion. We sat at the table gazing into each other's eyes and he fed me said beef ribs while I delicately tore the meat off, getting sauce all over the side of my face. The food was very tasty and my stomach was happy. It was the most romantic date ever.

I love the choices that were present, but was sad they didn't have alligator, since it wasn't in season. And their kangaroo was missing too. But I had the Llama Burger. I have never had llama, and despite the cute pictures in my head from Dinsey's "Emperor's New Groove" , It was really good. The meat itself was hard to taste with all the sauce (which was bomb!),  but I also tasted it seperatly.  It had a firm burger texture, was well cooked and tasted like a cross between a gamey bird like ostrich and vennison.  My friend had the Elk Burger, which was gamey and tasted like vennsion. We also had the garlic fries and potato sald. The garlic fries were in a pool of oil, but amazingly crispy and good, beautiful golden color and smothered in garlic!!  The potato salad was cold and refreshing and tasted like cold smashed potatoes, like they might have had ranch in them. I am so excited to come back here and try other menu items like their ahi andwich, carne asada fries, milkshakes, and their regular sirloin burgers. The flavors here are really good  Pros: Lotsa meat choices             delicious fries              big tall beers for only $4.00!!!!!              plenty of beer choices              great food and service!Cons:  napkins are flimsy and you will use plenty             outdoor seating can be cold if not near a heater *Ask for the sauce on the side if you are trying a new meat!!
<review# 2319,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2014,11/20/2014,450,173,16,25,20>At first glance this place doesn't look very impressive, but I have definitely become a fan.Their selection is very eclectic.  Walk through the sliding doors with your awkwardly oversized shopping cart and you are immediate met by pay-as-you-go cell phones, quarter machines with watches, a generic off brand Red Box DVD station and, wait for it, an eyebrow threading station?  Yep!  That's all at the entrance!They have a pretty decent looking deli with everything from Chinese food to freshly made salsa of just about every variety.  They have an entire section of freshly baked tortillas of all kinds as well as several of the most popular Mexican style pastries.  They also have just about every other item a typical grocery store would offer.  Being Vegan, I really can't say much about the quality of the options listed above, only second hand knowledge tells me that they are all pretty amazing.  And, this is no Raley's/Safeway/Nugget, so you will not see any of the specialty items found in those stores.  However, one thing I absolutely love about this store is the selection and quality of produce.  They have so many unique fruits and veggies at reasonable prices and they are always fresh.  There are staple items like onions, garlic, avocados and such that are always available and a few stations that rotate whatever seasonal variety they have sale prices on.  When I say sale prices, I mean sale prices!  I have found some crazy good deals in here and often.As far as the standards of canned goods, frozen veggies, pastas, oil, etc. etc. etc., I wouldn't recommend Viva.  They must make up for the great produce prices in these areas because most of the products are equal or higher than the products in Raley's up the street.Lastly, everyone that works here is friendly and helpful.  The checkers are quick and efficient and your purchase is always bagged for you.  A couple hints:  They have a $5 minimum charge for debitThey also have a rewards card for extra discounts, but you must fill out the form and bring it back and then remember to bring your card/info with you every visit.

We got here right around 4:00 and grabbed seats at the bar. I ordered the Basil Cocktail from the $7 drink menu and an order of Fried Green Tomato Sliders. The drink was wonderful, and the bartender was funny, engaging, fun to watch, and answered all of our questions. The sliders were really tasty, and worth the $8 considering they came with crispy, skinny-cut fries. My friends' drinks were delicious and actually pretty, and all the food was fresh, well-presented, and really good. The menu had a nice variety of dishes for all diets, allergies, and moods.We left around 6:00, just as it was starting to get busy. I try to avoid the crowds, so I probably won't be here to party it up until the wee hours anytime soon, but the happy hour was really fun. I'd love to come back and try their breakfast.

(forgot the name) with feta puff pastry was like yum! and it came with two dipping sauces - yogurt and garlic something.  My entree came with a flavorful cup of soup.  Veggies in broth, simple but good.  I had the Chicken Sumac:  marinated grilled chicken and creamy garlic sauce drizzled atop a pita....oh so creamy hummus.  Our conversation halted as our eyes took in the feast before us.  We sat and ate for 20 minutes of total silence.  Now I understand why this is a popular dish.  I get it.  I wanted more......2nd visit: Chicken Sumac (she was craving it) and Garlic Chicken Kabob over a bed of rice, tomatoes, onions, garlic, roasted peppers and drizzled w/sauce.  Service again was great.My taste buds have been aroused, transported, by exotic spices and scents.Is this what you might call Americanized Moroccan food?  If so, it's a great option to ease your palate into the flavors of Moroccan food.
<review# 2322,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/6/2014,11/17/2014,266,332,26,37,35>Hey! If you don't like the way your steaks are cooked elsewhere, go here! The only person you have to blame is, "You!" Personally, this has happened to us when we've dined at some finer steakhouses in Sacramento. Arthur Henry's leaves no room for disappointment. I cooked it, and I had no complaints. Damn, I'm a good grill master! From the outside, Arthur Henry's is a little run down, but once inside, it feels as if you are in another era. Sure, hubby complained the whole way, I was driving, and if you use the map that's provided by Yelp, it looks as if there's a 2nd Ave exit. Well, hubs said there isn't and I said there is! Boy, was I wrong! So, we were a bit lost, took a scenic route of the neighborhood.  So the homebody won, there is no 2nd Ave exit! At least he got out of the house! He complained about how uncertain he was by looking at the exterior, but once inside, he shut his mouth! He felt as if he was in those lounge/restaurants in a mafia movie. Upon entering the red door, you walk into this swanky, dark, hipster bar area with a restaurant immediately adjacent to it. With comfy cozy booths all around and a communal grill in the center of the dining area, it really sets off a level of comfort. We were immediately greeted and seated by a friendly hostess. We were told that our server would be with us shortly and "Harmony" greeted us. She was dressed in black like all the other employees with a cool "sleeve." She went over the details thoroughly and effortlessly! We informed her that we had a Groupon and she was ever so cool about it. Now I'm saying this because I love Groupons and there are some businesses who give you the "brush off," because you have a Groupon. Not here! Matter of fact, most of the diners had a Groupon, The fact about Groupon is, they introduce you to places like Arthur Henry's, hidden gems, which we may have never known. With that said, Groupon via Yelp! Yeah, some of my Yelp friends dined here and loved it as well. We placed our order and immediately received our cuts of meat. Hubby ordered the filet mignon and I ordered the ribeye with a garlic teriyaki marinade. Be forewarned, you are the cook, they bring your choice wrapped in parchment paper. Harmony went over in fine detail the instructions and tips about getting your perfect steak. They offer different assortments in seasonings and sauces for you to use. My ribeye didn't need any since it was already marinated. Hubby put a wide assortments of seasoning and sauce on his. He would have liked his steak better if there was A-1 sauce. What d'ya do? You can't please everyone, ha! I loved my ribeye, perfectly seasoned with no care for any other sauce or seasoning, and I didn't have to send it back! It was extremely tender with little fat, I think most of the fat was burned off! We loved the ambience with music constantly playing from the free jukebox. I played several songs and would've loved to just hang out here after dinner. On the night we dined, there was a pretty live crowd dining in the bar area, which made it quite entertaining. We loved this place so much, we'll be back! Insider's note:Cash onlyATM available with no fees21 and over onlyNo A-1 steak sauce!

My bf and I came in around 10 pm on a Friday night, and it was pretty busy. Nonetheless, the customer service was ridiculously good. Our waiter was very accommodating and helpful. We took awhile to order because I wanted honey-toast but my bf wanted shaved snow. Upon hearing this, our waiter offered to give us shaved snow for free. He called it a "sample," but it was a legitimate serving (see photo). We had the mango snow, and it was delicious -- fluffy, creamy, light.. Way better than Vampire Penguin. The honey-toast took 25-30 minutes because it's made fresh. Not a huge deal to me, but I wanted to make note of it. We had the Green Heaven (matcha green tea ice cream, chocolate wafer sticks, blueberries, and whipped cream on a tower of honey-toast). This was the best honey-toast I've ever had. Everything about this was perfect lol. DEFINITELY DEFINITELY DEFINITELY recommend this place. I can't wait to go back (:

My first time here i remember walking in with no appointment. the place is very welcoming, the front receptionist was very nice. For first timers, they offer a discount of maybe half the price i believe because i didn't pay the $42 it normally was. Actually i was there the other day and the brazillian is now $47. So i was introduced to vanessa. Honestly at first i was terrified, they tell you to take off your clothes from the waste down. i was thinking are you serious right now, while you're still in the room with me and no towel to cover myself. She looks at me and goes this is what you wanted to do right, and i'm like yes, so she tells me again. This time i did it. So i'm laying down my legs are in butterfly position. It hurts. i don't care what anyone says it hurts. after 3 years it still hurts. The price of beauty right. But i can honestly say that All of the Employees there make the experience more pleasant because they talk to you. If you're as consistent as i am and you have a particular person you go to, you tend to grow attach and talk about everything. I recommend this place for anyone, Men, Women... It's fast and easy. They offer wax services for anywhere that has hair. I mean i have been coming here for 3 years.
<review# 2325,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2014,11/14/2014,288,404,10,14,11>My first experience with Morton's was weeknight happy hour with a good friend. The digs looks old school yet classy at the same time. I ordered the red velvet not because it was on the HH menu, but because it was only 200 calories. I knew I was going to overdo it with the food so I had to count my calories somewhere! This cocktail did not really remind of the classic cake we all know and love, but it was still very good. It was more crisp than indulgent. From the apps menu, we ordered parmesan truffle fries, steak tacos, filet sandwiches and the filet trio. If that doesn't sound like a lot of food for two people, trust me, it was. I ended up taking at least a third of it home. I loved the sauces they used on the trio (the bleu cheese, au poivre, and bechamel) and the fries were crisp and plentiful. I could have eaten those all night! I recommend the steak tacos. The meat tasted more like braised beef but the tacos are stuffed with the filling and delicious. The food and drinks were great, but the extra star goes to their service. At the end of our already gluttonous meal, we decided to share their hot chocolate cake (their take on the molten lava cake). This dessert usually takes about 20 min to prepare and we didn't mind waiting. But, there was an accident when taking our dessert out (I think the chef burned himself and it fell on the floor) so they had to make another one. The servers apologized profusely. While it wasn't the most ideal situation, what can you do? Ish happens. While we were waiting, the manager brought a creme brulee to our table to make up for the first dessert. I thought that was awesome! Although not really for my hips because we ended up eating the creme brulee (one of the best i've had) and half of the hot chocolate cake! They comped both desserts as well. Now that's service. Stay classy Morton's.

Upon first walking in, you can't help but notice how much they changed the inside of this place!!  The bar is, obviously, the main focus now, whereas before it was more of an intimate, quiet place with a minimal bar.  Not that that's a bad thing but it is noisier than before. We were there just after happy hour ended and baseball & basketball games were on the tvs.  Cool.  OH!  When the Giants play, they have a special on hot dogs and Hamms beer for $4!!  Go Giants!They have some nice selections on tap and a full array of everything else, including a number of wine varieties.  Remember, the bar is definitely the focus in this place.  I ordered the big minis slider trio and tried one of each; grilled chicken, pastrami and tri tip.  My guy had the tri tip sandwich.  The menu is rather limited which is fine by me.  Appetizers, sandwiches, burgers, a couple soups and salads.  Poof, done. The big minis were decent.  I would have preferred a bit more of the sauces/dressings they put on them; a tad bit dry for me.  The bread overshadowed the meat so I only ate either the top or bottom bun. On the other hand, the tri tip sandwich was huge!  My guy  ordered the house chips with his sandwich but I think I would have liked to have had the fries.It's a nice little neighborhood place and I have the feeling we will end up there again at some point.

I have no idea why I waited so long to eat here because Lou's clearly needs to be in my life! I was very impressed with the food, atmosphere and service. Lou's Sushi is walking distance from my house, which is deliciously dangerous. An even more delicious fact is that they have happy hour all day on Tuesdays and Sundays . Their happy hour is from 3pm to 6pm every other day. Holy smokes, I will and CAN eat sushi every day!!! The restaurant itself is small, intimate and tastefully decorated. They have a small sushi bar, a few tables with nice window seats and some nice shade screens for the Windows in case it gets too sunny. The art in the restaurant is all done by local artists and is totally rad! It can get a bit cramped if you are sitting in the middle of the restaurant at the smaller tables, but honestly if you give me good sushi I don't really care where I'm seated. The food is fantastic! I have been there twice now and still have yet to try everything on the menu. I took my friend to Lou's after a wild Bachelorette party night and we were definitely in need of some sustenance. We ordered a lot of food and it was all delectable. I highly recommend the seafood nachos or the Daniel, my brother roll. Did I mention $1.99 sake bombs?! To conclude my review, I want to mention that I am so happy with this new edition to my neighborhood. The restaurant rocks and I'm so glad to see they are doing well. Keep it up Lou's!!!

I used to think the $22 Full Service Wash was a good value because they were so thorough. After my last couple of visits I started noticing more and more dog hair left behind, a ton of dirt still sitting on the seats, side mirrors weren't cleaned, etc. May as well save a few bucks and do it at a self service station.If you have the extra cash, it is still worth a visit if your car is just too filthy to tackle yourself. The staff are always friendly and organized, and they offer plenty of extra services like detailing and oil changes. Sometimes there's a guy there who will repair the chips in your windshield. He even got on the phone with my insurance company so there was no out of pocket cost to me!Here's a tip - avoid the weekend rush and drop in after work. I've been stuck in long lines on Saturday afternoons, but barely had to wait at all when I went on a Monday at 5:30.
<review# 2329,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/21/2013,3/13/2014,317,342,12,19,16>My family has been coming here ever since my sister and brother-in-law moved out to Elk Grove.  Alas, we have not been attending as much because they moved another exit away, and has not been as easy to bring kids to a fine establishment as this.I returned with an expired groupon, which they honored my paid value, and the food is still outstanding!  It can get busy on weekends, but we were seated quickly on a Wednesday night.  We ordered the Ojima roll which had fried shrimp, tuna, sprouts, rolled in soy wrap instead of seaweed so it had a bright yellow outside, topped with fried softshell crab, and a couple sauces drizzled over the top.  I was surprised it came so quickly with my beef teriyaki/sesame chicken combination dinner since on the menu it noted the roll may take longer due to the preperation needed for it.  Very very good roll, the soft shell crab just makes it so good!  If you want the traditional stuff, and want the more raw offerings, maybe this isn't for you, but I do like both.Osaka does Japanese food right, and the ambiance is great.  They don't try to wow you with bright lights and loud music like a bar scene, but they do have a large menu of rolls with sauces and unique names.  Osaka has quite possibly the BEST sesame chicken in Sacramento!  Large portion, cooked to perfection without being greasy or overly battered or breaded depending on what style other restaurants do.  My dad misses coming here for that.Plenty of room at a number of tables and the sushi bar, but you do have to battle in the parking lot with the 24 hour fitness patrons.

I for one have been a life long fan and would put the Original with it's grandiose sourdough bun, three meats, three melted cheeses, lettuce, tomatoes, mustard and secret original sauce, up against any sandwich anywhere. For all of the praise I have for the sandwich, I do have have a complaint about this particular location due to their automated ordering process. I realize that automation is becoming another part of our world everyday, but I am not ready to order my sandwich by touchscreen. Especially not when the automation becomes a 20 step, five minute process to order a #1, medium sized, everything on it for dine it. I think the launch sequence for Apollo 11 took less steps than ordering a #1. On that note, I'm really not a fan of the Futurama coke machine either. The 52 flavor options for a simple coke completely consumed the two teenage boys in front of me on my last visit and provided a great test to my impatient personality that was already well worn from the ordering process. I just finished visit four, the second of the day, and I am ever so thankful that I will probably never have another reason for an ever so joyous trip to the fabulous Bakersfield mall. Between the sandwiches and the drawn out ordering and soda process, this place seems to stay packed.

Tried both the IPA and the American Wheat, each were exactly what I look for in that type of brew. IPA was not overly hopped to death, but smooth and extremely drinkable with the perfect amount of bitterness. While I generally don't drink a lot of wheat beers, I found the Bike Dog variety to be one that I actually enjoy quite a bit (not sweet at all). The space itself is fantastic, albeit in a bit of a weird location. They definitely need some more prominent signage off the road. We had a handful of people meeting up there and nearly everyone had the same experience of almost missing the parking lot while trying to find the tasting room. Other than that, it's an awesome start for what I can only imagine will continue to be an excellent beverage destination in West Sac for years to come.

I was impressed with everything and immediately looked up the business on Yelp and was shocked to find there weren't more reviews for this wonderful business!We had a box of 9 of these mini cookies shipped to us and they arrived in a packing box but once you opened the box, they were wrapped in purple tissue paper and packed in a nice gift box with ribbon and gift card. Super cute and looked really fancy! Everyone in the office LOVED the cookies/chocolates! My favorite was the Salted Caramel bite but the Mmmoreo and Fleur de Sel Chocolate Chip were amazing as well!We are going to start giving these as gifts to our clients, because we love supporting local business and were impressed when we received them. For a box of 9 delivered is only $24 which is cheaper then other treats we have found. They also offer smaller boxes and different assortments.Perfect place for client gifts and they can brand the treats with your personal logo!
<review# 2333,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2013,3/9/2014,903,380,17,23,18>Ruchi is a tremendous Indian buffet lunch value.   Thanks for being 5 minutes from work.  Probably 4.5 stars.  ***lunch review*** Today I really enjoyed tandoori chicken, yellow lentils, and tamarind tomato soup.  That soup could turn out to be a craving.  I don't remember what I ate the times before, but I've liked enough items to be satisfied.  The tandoori chicken is always good, not dry like often at other buffets.  The naan is nice.  The veggie items tend to be the fried stuff other than the mini salad bar though.  (That last line was for Danielle O.)  I'm sure Yelps got some punjabi pros that will tell you what region the food is from and what the actual names of dishes are so read other reviews for that stuff.  The dining area looks great, the buffet looks appetizing and immaculate, and the owners always talk to want to know if you've enjoyed your meal.  I did, thanks for asking.  Great lunch under $10. Ruchi 2nd best Indian buffet I know of, good enough to keep me from making that extra 10 min drive to Pooja most of the time.    Now that's something to Singh about.
<review# 2334,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/22/2014,3/8/2014,168,144,8,13,11>Gone are the days of trekking out to Lincoln, to an alley on a Friday evening to fill a growler, because now we have a great taproom to enjoy a pint while filling said growler. The beer from Knee Deep is amazing in a way I can not describe. Wonderful hoppiness, dank and piney.  Who here likes Pliny the Elder from Russian River?  Please raise your hand.  If you raised your hand, then you need, and I mean NEED to check out the lovely goodness that is Knee Deep.  Simtra, Hoptologist, Belgo Hoptologist, Midnight Hoppiness, Chuffed and the list goes on because all and I mean ALL of their beers are AHHH-MAZING!  The tap room is located near the airport in Auburn. Living in West Roseville like I do does make it a bit of a cruise, but a Saturday afternoon with the worlds best husband in tow makes it an awesome way to kill some time and celebrate the weekend. Hungry you say??? You are in luck, because they almost always have an awesome food truck out front to satisfy the rumble in the tummy.  Coming with a few friends?? Well, then there are Cornhole games available to enjoy. Service at the bar is always knowledgeable and friendly. You can try a 2oz taste for a couple bucks or a pint. I myself can never decide what I want so I grab a flight so I don't have to choose.Bottom line:  If you like GOOD beer and are in the area, check out Knee Deep Tap Room. If not, pick up a 22 at the local liquor store. Do yourself a favor!
<review# 2335,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2013,3/7/2014,280,194,9,15,13>The second largest store behind Vallejo, in California. Slotted in a warehouse that used to house Circuit City, and then Toys R Us. It's large inside with space to spare with independent vendor booths inside. I describe it as an inside flea market. With listings of everything household, you can find deals depending on the colors of the price tag. Colors change on Mondays. Furniture and household items are located in the back with clothing and knick knacks behind counters in front. Some prices for counter items are grossly overpriced so buyer beware. Also there is a no return policy so know what your buying and use the testing stations to plug up your electronics. Service is actually friendly and helpful. Parking is a breeze and plenty of shopping carts and baskets. They even play satellite music. If your sugar is running low, there's a vendor with sodas and snacks. Great place for precamping stops.
<review# 2336,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2013,3/6/2014,71,127,5,24,18>I'm pretty sure this is the closest you can get to authentic Chinese (Sichuan specifically) just about anywhere in Greater Sacramento. I am ABC, having spent my first 40 years in the Bay Area. So, I've been pretty deprived of legit Chinese eats since moving to Fair Oaks over two years ago. Feel free to take the 5 stars with a grain of salt, haha... I definitely want to see them stay in business and thrive, so I'm handicapping accordingly.After several visits, I've gotten my fix every time. I can confidently say this place is the real deal, IF you know what to order. It's definitely hit and miss and all depends what you are looking for--Americanized Chinese vs. authentic Sichuan cuisine. My focus is on the latter.The first promising sign is most of the spicy dishes have real sichuan peppercorns* vs. just chili peppers or hot sauce/oil. Overall, the quality, freshness and flavors are on point. Since the place is less than a year old, it's clean and bright with friendly service--a plus all by itself. Portions are generous for the price, so be prepared for leftovers.HITS:- Plump, handmade potstickers with dipping sauce.- Spicy Wonton appetizer. I notice a few reviewers give this a thumbs down, but it is an authentic dish. The wonton sits in a bowl of orange-colored chili oil, which I can understand being a turnoff but that's the way it should be. Not as spicy as it looks/sounds but flavorful and I'd order again. - A good Ma Po Tofu can be hard to come by, often not spicy at all or too saucy. This has just the right balance of flavor and spiciness, while the tofu is velvety. I can eat the leftovers over rice for close to a week and not get tired of it. - Spicy Seafood Noodle Soup. I usually go for a spicy beef noodle soup (which I plan to try) but one day this dish was calling out to me for lunch. I wasn't disappointed and glad I got it. Again, a great balance of flavor and spice all in a rich seafood-tinged broth. Huge portion, and I had to stop myself from finishing the whole thing in one sitting. - Beef Tripe and Flank appetizer; mild spice. This was served cold as is traditional. Very tasty and a huge portion for $6.50. This is another dish I had to save and ate the leftovers for days after. I'm sure this is not good for cholesterol levels, so I'll consider it a once or twice a year treat. ;)- They have broth down, so I don't think you can miss with any of the soups. The Pickled Cabbage & Fish Fillet and the West Sichuan Style Spicy Fish Fillet Soup are really authentic, and the latter isn't as spicy as it looks (comes with a bunch of whole dried chili peppers floating on top). The only other place I've seen this soup is at China Village (near Berkeley) where it's called "Thousand Chili Pepper Fish Fillet Soup." So good... Did I say this one's authentic? MISSES:- Beef chow fun. Usually hard to mess up, but I just found it bland. Won't order again.- Agree with one of the other reviewers who said avoid anything battered and fried. Just too much batter for my taste. There are a couple fried dishes that aren't as heavily battered which are a little better, like the Chongqing Style Spicy Chicken. Tasty but still a bit oily.OK BUT NEEDS WORK:- The Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings. All good but it seems like they drizzle (chili?) oil on after the fact and not necessary. Takes them from dry and crispy to slightly soggy.- On the only visit with my parents (I was half trying to impress them), they ordered the Shredded Pork with Flavored Dry Tofu. This is authentic and one of their favorite comfort foods; you won't find everywhere. The main problem was the ingredients weren't shredded fine enough. The flavor and "wok hay" was good but the texture should be more like julienned vs. thick cut. That was the only downfall but my mom couldn't get past it LOL.- The Taiwan Style Rice Noodles are a nice gluten-free option. It's basically a combo chow mein made with thin rice noodles. Good flavor but sometimes the meat and veggies can be chopped too thick (like the aforementioned shredded pork above). Also, a friend of mine who's family is Taiwanese says the dish is traditionally finished with Chinese black vinegar. I'm sure that would make it awesome.This may seem like a lot but there's a lot more I want to sample. I'm so stoked!!* This place definitely uses the authentic sichuan peppercorns in many dishes. You can tell when your tongue feels slightly tingly. From Wikipedia: "Sichuan pepper has a unique aroma and flavour that is not hot or pungent like black, white or chili peppers. Instead, it has slight lemony overtones and creates a tingly numbness in the mouth (caused by its 3% of hydroxy alpha sanshool) that sets the stage for hot spices."
<review# 2337,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2013,3/5/2014,200,122,13,16,10>This was my first time, and I loved it! I'm obsessed with Indian food; I may not know the names of a lot of the dishes but I know it's delicious.Me, Michel, and Diana stopped by for dinner on a Saturday night around 7pm. We did the buffet which is offered on Friday and Saturday only for $13.99! It wasn't busy; we were able to sit down once we got there. They have a great selection for vegetarians and meat eaters alike. Naan for days!!! We ordered the garlic naan as well - YUM. They even had a couple dessert options to end, maybe even begin, your meal. TIP of the NIGHT (TOTN): Don't go to a buffet style restaurant STARVING! I had 3 full plates AND dessert. I left so uncomfortable. I didn't have to ask for any refills, the service was just on it. Even though it was buffet style, they checked on us to make sure we were doing okay.I can't wait to eat here again, but I'll make sure I don't over do it again....gotta set my alarm for the gym tomorrow morning.
<review# 2338,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2013,3/4/2014,122,117,11,16,12>On my suggestion I came in for brunch this past Sunday with fellow Yelper Carol P.  We had never been before I was full of anticipation. My assessment is on the following categories, Ambience, Service, and Food. Ambience: 5 starsI totally loved the ambience of this place. Sort of SoHo, modern look to the place. Open and spacious, long and small wood tables closely clustered together, lots of natural light and a nice outdoor patio. The best part of this place was the live band that arrived shortly after 11am. They were awesome.  They played lots of top forty songs that we all are familiar with but were not too loud that it was overbearing. The Seeing Eye dog for one of the band members  just chilled and slept while they performed. Those guide dogs are so special to me. I just love watching them and marvel how wonderful they are for their owners. Plenty of close parking as well. Service: 4 starsOnly down side was Carol asked for lemon slices for her glass of water. It must have taken them 15 minutes and two reminders to waiter to bring to her. The first time she was even told the bartender hadn't sliced up the lemons yet? Huh? Is slicing lemons above your pay scale? Service was also very slow for our food to arrive. Place didn't seem very busy, so would wonder what  the wait would be like if  it were busy? Since we were enjoying our conversation, and the live music it wasn't too bad for me but definitely don't go if you are starving or in a hurry. This is a place to go when you just want to enjoy a nice leisurely meal. Besides the lemon issue the server was friendly and attentive and even brought Carol out her phone that was left on the table. Food: 2.5 stars. Started with the sangria $7.  Now on an empty stomach any alcohol should give me a nice buzz or least feeling very relaxed. Didn't notice any warm fuzzies so probably not much wine in this sangria most likely more juice and fruit. I had the French toast $12which was more like a bread pudding baked in a small ceramic deep dish bowl topped with whip cream, fresh strawberries,  and caramel drizzle. Good thing is it satisfied my sweet tooth but definitely not your typical French toast. I ordered a side of bacon $4. Either 3 or 4 slices arrived really undercooked. Now I don't like my bacon super crispy but this was definitely under cooked. It was my mistake not to send it back, and I nibbled on the cooked parts and mentioned to Carol if I ended up the ER that night we probably know why.So when I put the three categories together I see my average is probably a 3.5 but since no half star ratings I will round up to a 4 star rating. We both agreed it would be a great place to bring an out of town family or friends, a nice alternative to downtown or a greasy spoon diner. But since my meal came to $28 with a $3 tip to waiter, and $2 for musicians it is a not a  "regular go to" place for brunch, least not on my budget.  Better to save for special occasions.
<review# 2339,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2011,11/19/2011,154,26,9,9,7>Best bulgogi I've had. Ever. Yummy barley water refilled constantly. The kimchi tofu stew was served piping hot, tasted like heaven in a bowl. I've been back just for the stew four times now. Perfect balance of kimchi tart, spice and flavor. I need to try the spicy chicken next time, heard it's amazing.I'd describe this place as a tiny old Korean hole in the wall drinking spot with excellent food. It's not at all fancy, not pretty, but it has it's own "worn"  charm. The wooden booths are super tall making you feel that you're in your own little private "room". The booth in the back corner is covered in graffiti. Bring a sharpie! Oh and it gets loud in here. The later it gets it starts to resemble a bar more and more.Some people I know have commented that the service here is rude. I MUST completely disagree. On each of my 10+ visits I've been helped by the same woman. She treats me as a welcomed guest and never was I left without water or beer ever, on any of my 10+ visits. I always have questions so she gives her advice, takes my order and goes back to working hard. I don't expect her to kiss my ass and fake smile. She's efficient and gets down to business, something I admire in a lady. My food came quick and hot, my kimchi dish was never empty. I will come back, over and over and over again. Doesn't open until 5pm each night (my only complaint) but stays open past bar closing. (Side note- seriously, you can get bulgogi until 2am!) In this sense, Sarang Bang needs exactly this type of lady to make it run smooth and while keeping the drunk patrons in check.Plus it's just fun to say "Sarang Bang".
<review# 2340,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2011,11/18/2011,356,378,6,11,8>Wow, this is like Asian supermarket heaven! I haven't been to a 99 Ranch Market in a long time and visiting the relatively new Sacramento location was definitely a treat. I was suckered by the dim lighting and the cleanliness of the place because I really had a good time grocery shopping!I was on a mission to buy some ingredients to make dumplings and stir-fries and was able to find everything except fresh mung bean sprouts? That's strange; even Safeway carries it, but on the other hand, I got myself some snow pea shoots, the luxurious stuff. Aww yeah. It's not everyday you can get it for $1.79 a pound! I failed miserably at making my own XO sauce and was hoping to find it at the Asian Food Center on Broadway but had no luck. At 99 Ranch, I found 7 or 8 varieties! And Korean sweet potato noodles? 4 brands to choose from.  And can I say that their customer service was great? Mr. Butcher was so nice, allowing me to pick the smallest piece of pork loin and even asked if I wanted anything else. This is so atypical for an Asian supermarket. Even the checkers helped me with a smile on their faces!By coming here on a Friday night, I didn't have to fight the crowds and was able to peruse the aisles at slow speed, examining the selection of goodies they had to offer. I can't wait to come here again to fill up  my shopping cart!

Fat Face is now open in Sacramento!Fat Face shares the space with Bows and Arrows vintage retail shop and is located toward the back. The interior can be described as retro cool while the outside seating can be described as whimsical.The food!Beer Poached Fig Sammie ($9)- Caramelized onion, arugula, and goat cheese. At first glance I was not too impressed. It looked like a lot of bread, but everything balanced out nicely. The sandwich has more of a sweet rather than savory taste. It was also light because there is no meat in it.  Eggplant Meatball Sammie ($9)- Tomato sauce, mozzarella, and arugula. A more filling sandwich but I preferred my other sandwich choice.You get a choice of greens or sweet potato chips as a side. Get the chips! Green Tea Mango Popsicle ($3)- Kind of expensive... Both flavors were equally represented in the popsicle. It was good but I wish it was juicy!I will come back in order to try their unique flavor combos!FYI- Street parking, so it is best to park across the street in the Safeway shopping plaza and walk over.

And I'm neutral.Everybody seemed to be having a good time, lots of dancing and drinking. But the thing that struck me most is the feeling of hunting that I got so overpoweringly as soon as I walked in.You know how you can see that guys are thirsty for female attention, well this was the pinnacle. I just felt like all the dudes in here were just moments away from humping a leg or two. And while thats funny to watch, it puts the ladies on the defensive and makes it harder than usual to start conversations.Super sucky for a social butterfly like meself. But nonetheless I had a fun time and I saw the Cha Cha Slide performed for the first time...Ladies bring your dancing shoes, fellas leave some testosterone at home and come out and have a good time with me, because i'm going back...
<review# 2344,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2011,11/13/2011,702,960,17,23,18>So happy to find this place, however my waistline isn't. Or should I say my thighs. On the same strip as Ginger Elizabeth (my other addiction) is the latest and greatest bakery/cafe. Featuring locally made gelato - from Folsom, nonetheless! - a small bowl will only set you back $2.80. Flavors that I can recall from memory:* Honey lavender* Zabaglione (however their spelling is a bit different)* Chocolate* Stracciatella* Vanilla* Other yummy ones that I can't recall...But that's not all! Yes, you have CUPCAKES. I had to have the strawberry shortcake one as it was beckoning me from behind the glass. Topped with a strawberry and piles of whipped cream frosting with strawberries blended in, it was decadent, fresh-tasting and addictive.The cake reminiscent of pound cake with a creme filling tucked inside. At $2.75, this is an affordable indulgence. Others were a German chocolate, a Ding Dong looking one (that is next on my hit list), and red velvet. They just rolled out palmiers today - crispy, buttery swirls with a hint of sugary glaze. I think they were around $1.75 or so. Espresso drinks also feature here, but have not had the pleasure...yet. You can also grab breakfast as well - they pride themselves on their sausages - and lunch. Vegetarians fear not, there are salads and quiches! As Yoda would say: "Five stars this place may be, the other goodies tasted I have not." Will come back to try more. that's for sure!

(and again and again).... and again.....because of who it's STAR RESIDENTS are:  Kitties & Doggies.  You can't go wrong with associating and setting up meetings with this group of fuzzy tykes.THE SHELTERI have to give full on props to the staff of the shelter for having a very clean, humane, and spacious center in which to house these needy cats and dogs looking for homes.  SPECIALRight now there is a Summer Cat Adoption Special going on that I have NO PROBLEM shilling for.  These little guys lives are the line, and they are looking for a good home that will accept them, play with them, and love them.  I am a big big believer in this cause, and have myself adopted my two pocket-panthers JACK & BOBBY from such an earlier promotion from 2008.  Depending on when you may glance at this review, for more updated information, check back to this linked-flyer which has the websites that will give updated information on the services provided by this organization.  yelp.com/events/sacramenADOPTIONIf you decide you want to adopt a cat or kitten, as point of clarification on the process, the animals at this service must be spayed or neutered before they go home with an adopter.  The surgery is performed the next available business day from when you adopt.  The adopter will then need to return to the shelter at the end of the day of the surgery to pick up their newly adopted pet.The only problem I have with this service/place is that it pains my heart to leave without having one new little furry tyke with me to take home.  But that's why I mention this so that those of you who are looking to adopt, will be aware of this service now and then maybe make the decision that the time is right for you to adopt.  And for that, I am truly grateful to you in spirit....THE LOWDOWNA wonderful service, looking for people like you to adopt the very precious little creatures that reside here.  Please do so...

<review# 2347,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2011,11/10/2011,268,316,3,7,9>We finally chased down the MBT and had a nice lunch in the parking lot of some generic furniture store. There was a lot of hype built up over the past few months, and I was not disappointed. We were able to try this month's special, the Lil' Shorty (short rib burger), and it was sweet and tasty! There was one problem I had, which was gustatory overload. I was juggling too many rich flavors by ordering the 3 pack, all different. I ate the Lil Shorty first, which kind of overpowered the Philly I had 2nd. I ate the Ninja third. They were all good, but I think they could've been better if I had focused on eating 2 of the same flavor. So next time, I'm gonna get a 2 pack of the same thing. I think I was expecting the burger meat to be more flavorful too, but it had a good taste but more subdued than I had anticipated. The meat was cooked fairly well done, with a crunch to the outer sear. The short ribs were cooked perfectly and tasty. (Again, maybe it was the order of what I ate?)The portions are small but very filling. The sweet potato tots were awesome, but very heavy, so one order combined with a 3 pack can leave you very full. I also wanted to try the fries and they were very much like In-N-Out hand cut fries, but with a better doneness (kinda halfway between In-N-Out regular and fry well). They tasted like they needed more salt, but it was because the saltiness of the burger overpowered them. I ate some leftover fries later and they did seem well salted. I'm glad they are here and really hope Sac city council will let go of the draconian anti-truck mentality. I'm eager to go back to do more gustatory research, and will kick it up a star when I confirm my hypothesis.

I think the cannolis were the dead giveaway. This last trip made it my third time entering the unassuming door, the third time I've tasted brilliance off of F Street. I've eaten the le rustique, the meatball and now, I've become the best girlfriend ever and served the mushroom risotto and the chicken marsala for dinner. I'm that awesome.Each visit has offered me better than expected results. The meatball is no joke, just enough sauce, an enormous amount of flavor. Le Rustique is subtle, with a kick of tobasco that will keep you guessing. And the risotto...oh my dear lord. The was the best thing I've reheated in my life! The owner's son even gave me the needed cream to reheat the scrumptious risotto in a skillet. I told him I was moving, and the only thing I had in my fridge was water and beer. He didn't even flinch, he just said, here's some cream, this batch turned out really well. He even threw in some bread sticks and almond cookies.This is simply the place to go in Sacramento for authentic Italian food. The owners offer kindness, genuine passion for their products and the best sandwiches since Daniel Pont left La Bonne. Mr. Sampino is in good company!I adore this place, and it's quickly becoming my favorite place to go in Sacramento.
<review# 2349,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/22/2008,12/4/2008,45,5,3,11,9>Ok, check it. I've almost graduated culinary school, and I'm pretty knowledgeable about my sushi. So there's two reasons to listen to me. Let me just say, hands down, Kru is one of the best things going in Sacramento for sushi. Billy, the chef/owner is doing some things with his sushi nobody else is. And rightly so - his mentor and trainer was none other than Taka Watanabe, a veritable pillar in Sacramento's sushi history. Heck, Taka for that matter, hails from old school, Shige Sushi. If you want traditional sushi, great knife cuts, and fresh fish, you go see old man Shige. Anyway, so there's your history lesson. As for the fish at Kru? Outside of San Francisco, you simply can NOT get fresher fish. The taste on your tongue - you know, that nice bite, and almost creamy texture of really, REALLY good tuna, the kind you'd well, write about? Yeah, it's a staple here. And the portions are great. I'm a big guy, and I don't think I've ever left Kru wanting something more. So, here's the deal. If you want great Mexican food, eat where the local Mexicans do in town. You'll probably get a pretty good meal most of the time. Kru is, and has been since it opened, THE place local chefs go when they want sushi. Even Randall Selland of The Kitchen hangs out here. So, if you're a chef, and you could make damn near any sushi you wanted just as easy as most of the glut of sushi places Sacramento has, but Kru is where you go to get your wasabi on...chances are you know something about Kru others don't. And, chances are I want to find out what that is because I'm about to have the best darn sushi in town. To recap: Great Prices. The FRESHEST choice of ingredients in town, & almost celebrity status among his peers due solely to the ingenuity of his cuisine. Did I mention Kru recently got a Zagat Rating? Yeah. So, go grab yourself some katsuo and call it a night.
<review# 2350,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/22/2008,12/3/2008,97,97,3,7,6>I too succumbed to the McKinley Park Hair experience after reading the plethora of positive Yelp reviews Dave got.  I am a relocatee from the Bay Area and had problems finding the right salon, and even getting calls back! All I have to say is I entered the salon and felt "hair zen" immediately.  I was stressed because I was running 5 minutes late and I appreciated Dave squeezing me in at 5:30.  I went in with an overfrizzed, dry mop of hair that desperately needed root touch up and lots TLC. Dave, bless his heart worked on me for 2 1/2 hours, chatting away the whole time and left me with a beautiful, silky crown of blonde hair that I could run my fingers through! WOW Dave you're a miracle worker!! I rebooked him on the spot to touch me up again a week before my wedding in March.  Including my crown highlight, cut, shampoo, blow dry, style, purchase of two styling products, and gratuity....I STILL spent $60 less than the last salon visit I had to a pretty pricy place in Walnut Creek. I have to say how much I appreciated the detail Dave went into also when showing me how to style my new do.  I have found my Holy Grail of hair salons and I will not look any further!!!4/14/08 update:I went to Dave in mid March for my pre-wedding color and trim, and then again 4/12 for him to style my hair for my wedding reception.  It was about 2 hours until guests were to arrive and I brought my sister with me so she could put a quick bun in her hair while I was being styled since we were running short on time.  Dave, once again did a fabulous job. When my style was complete, Dave asked if my sister would like her hair touched up, and it was just SUCH a sweet gesture..it really meant a lot to us. We just can't say enough about how great Dave is. :)5/20 update:I had an appointment for color last week and Dave did a fabulous job...I'm blonde blonde blonde! I took several inches off too for the summer, and the style is super cute and I've had lots of compliments on it. Plus, Dave called me prior to my appointment due to someone cancelling(gasp, why would anyone cancel DAVE..I mean wtf?!), to let me know he could squeeze me in earlier. The timing was perfect and I *just* beat the rush hour coming home! Whoo hooo!!!!9/8:Dave makes me feel pretty. Can't wait for my Oct 8th appointment. Am having withdrawals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1/18/10:And just when you all thought I was finished reviewing...I have more!! :) I decided I wanted to go dark so 11/11/09  I did it! I'd been blonde since birth and wanted a change.  I had talked to Dave about it for months and he gradually was darkening my low lights, making me not quite as blonde.  Then I told him I was ready to take the plunge and go all CHOCOLATE brown.  I am absolutely thrilled with the results! It's been 2 months now and I have no regrets.  This just goes to show the full spectrum of talent Dave has.  To go from blonde to brunette, and I mean really DARK, not just a few shades..I mean like day and night, is a huge step and you must have confidence in your colorist that they're not going to make you look like a Joan Jett groupie.  I feel like whatever I could dream Dave to do to my hair, he'd make me look and feel like a million bucks!
<review# 2351,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2008,11/30/2008,19,16,7,3,4>My son is an avid tic-tac-toe player. Even though he's only six, he's studied the game inside and out, favoring such opening moves as 'left upper corner,' or 'right upper corner.' He intimidates his opponents with a large 'O'; sometimes including a sly nose and eyes in the crayola circle.The wait staff at Nara aren't fooled by such wizardry, however. The waiter nonchalantly walked up to my son, challenged him to a game, and promptly displayed such tic-tac-toe prowess that I haven't seen since Czechoslovakia in '72. My son was devastated, wiped the sweat off his brow, and with mouth still open wide, reached for a gyoza and brought it to his lips.At least I think it was gyoza. I still haven't mastered the difference between gyoza and pot stickers. I could have been a pot sticker for all I know. For some reason still unknown to me, my son only likes the wrappers, discarding the meaty flesh with a resounding 'ew.' (I should note that before he turned three, the reverse was true; he would only eat the middle and discard the wrappers).I, on the other hand, prefer the wide variety of sushi, orange chicken, and saki. Actually, after I split a chilled version of saki with my dining companions (sans the six year old of course, he doesn't like saki), everything tastes good at that point, and I have a much deeper fondness for my companions.Not that the food isn't good without saki, it's just that saki really brings out.. well, everything.Even tic-tac-toe, and the second runner up, hangman.Here's a hint - if you ever happen to be challenged by my six year old to a game of hangman? The answer is "LEGO."

<review# 2353,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/31/2008,11/28/2008,95,282,3,11,9>Since the small sign appeared in the corner window of this restaraunt a few weeks ago my husband and I have been wanting to stop in.  Boon boon is kind of hard to see from the street if you're not looking for it - it's behind the Subway at the corner of Broadway and Stockton in the same strip mall that has a nail salon and a hair place.When we came in on a Saturday night at 8 there was another customer who was finishing up his meal.  The place is quite large and the music was barely audible and I could hear him say that the food was great and he's be back for lunch again.  That was a good sign.We ordered one appetizer and two dishes to share:Samosas - 2 small samosas cut in half and placed on some shredded carrots on top of drizzled chili and sweet sauce.  They were tasty but not outstanding.Spicy basil beef - minced beef and peppers with basil in a spicy brown garlic sauce and a serving of rice.  It was delicious and a nice change to the usual beef strips used in Asian dishes.  You can specify how mild or hot you'd like the dish.Crab fried rice - it's one of their feature dishes and the most expensive at $12.95, which is still reasonable for a tasty pile of eggy, crabby [lump crab], rice.  It wasn't greasy at all and came with a few slices of tomato and cucumber.The menu items vary from Asian to American to Danish according to the little bio on the back of the menu.  Prices range from $2.95 for soup to $12.95 for the specialty items.  Average entree prices are $7.95.Service was exceptional.  Our server was very friendly, knowledgeable and genuinely interested in what we thought of the restaurant and the food.  I'm super excited to have found this place.  Now I won't have to drive very far down Stockton to get some tasty Asian food.
<review# 2354,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/17/2008,11/27/2008,97,43,2,8,8>Zanzibar is one of my favorite places to shop for a gift.  They have a lot of unique and beautiful items.  I love that they support Fair Trade which is why I checked it out in the first place.  The beaded jewelry is beautiful and affordable.  The silver jewelry, textiles, masks, and Dia De Los Muertos folk art are some of my favorites.  All the items are of good quality and seem to be hand crafted.  The owner is very knowledgeable about the different products, and the regions they hail from.  I'm always amazed at the variety of different treasures housed in such a small shop. I always find something, which I usually end up keeping for myself.

The wine list was extraordinary. I sat at the bar, which was well kept, lively and clean. I ate the award winning paella. It was excellent. I indulged in a chocolate soup for desert. This is one of the most incredible restaurant experiences that I have had in Sacramento (It was like dining in Spain!) I frequent 4 and 5 star restaurants, and I am so impressed with this place in comparison to the other places I've had dinner. I am recommending it to all of my friends and family. You must go.
<review# 2356,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/17/2008,11/24/2008,53,209,,5,3>The reviews below, which are all over the map in their esteem of this joint, reflect what appeared to be a truth about Sweetwater: it has its heart in the right place, but there is much room for improvement.    Housed in the hallowed ground of the old Shakey's Pizza, Sweetwater offers cozy, casual, but elegant decor in the main dining room.  The menu is mostly comfortable standards, with some thoughtful additions, modifications, and sides.  I should state right off that the food itself merited 3-3 1/2 stars, but the service fouled up on several fronts, rendering the entire dining experience less fulfilling than the sum of its parts.  We were greeted warmly and seated promptly.  We were informed that on Sundays, all bottles on the wine list are 1/2 off with the purchase of 2 entrees.  Whether this is a promotion to encourage Sunday traffic or a guilty attempt at atonement for their anemic and pricey wine list, I dunno.  Nonetheless, it's a nice touch that might lure us back some Sunday.  Our orders were taken after some delay (we were told some 10 minutes after ordering a sparkling wine that they were out of ALL sparkling wine), with appetizers arriving in good time.  Unfortunately, around the time that most restaurants would be serving the entree, our waitress returned to tell me that he lamb I ordered was sold out.  She offered to replace it with another entree at the same price; I went with the ribeye.  Such snags were literally omnipresent: a table to one side received their entrees without having gotten the appetizers they ordered, while a table on the other side of us got their entrees without having received one of their appetizers.  Turbulent service aside, the food as a whole was pretty good.  An iceberg wedge salad was well-constructed, though the cold, limp bacon garnish was unappetizing.  A chicken pasta dish had good overall flavor, but was somewhat underseasoned and swam in an abundance of thin sauce.  My ribeye was rare, as ordered, and accompanied by a tasty bread salad, with chunks of buttery, toasty bread; the bread salad would make a good dish on its own.  The steak's sauce, though, was a starch-thickened, insipid brown sauce with little to recommend it.  Ultimately, the positives of Sweetwater outweighed the negatives for us.  This truly local joint really seems to try, but some logistical and service issues hold it back in the minor leagues for the time being.  With their friendly staff, attractive decor, decent menu concept, and prime location, they ought to be able to tune it up into a real upper-eschelon destination along the lines of Roxy or Lucca.
<review# 2357,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2008,11/22/2008,242,141,4,15,11>A romantic modern boutique with a unique, eclectic aesthetic and vision.My interest was piqued as I watched the transformation of this store. Until now, driving past the former X21 spot has always made me a little sad.At Fringe, you will feel as if you walked into a feminine boudoir/curiosity shoppe with an interesting edge. This store carries goodies such as cool estate jewelry, recycled and new fashion, gift  items, new and vintage decor, and random antiques.See my pictures for a better view of this wonderful shop which almost defies description. The displays are tastefully and artfully prepared, with an emphasis on the juxtaposition of old and new.Fringe is nothing at all like X21, though Fringe's friendly proprietress, Audrey Wells, is still able to acquire anything that X21 carried -- just ask.I'm quite happy to add this to my list of non cookie-cutter independent boutiques in our city.Open Monday through Saturday, 11AM - 6PM.
<review# 2358,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2008,11/21/2008,122,320,,13,7>so now i know the reason why akebono is one of my favorites for more authentic sushi and japanese cuisine in sacramento.i was talking to jimmy-san, the head itamae there.  he is chinese raised in saigon.  he learned sushi from his master chef, who is from laos but spent 20 years training in japan.  this chef taught jimmy-san everything he knows, including true japanese chef skills.  jimmy-san and his sensei really do defeat the proposition that only a person of that culture can make that culture's authentic cuisine.he spoke about how he makes his own shimesaba (one of the ways i check to see a chef's skill...and actually to taste whether the chef/restaurant flavors his own saba or buys store bought, which most sac places do).  he also talked about how he makes his tamagoyaki (another way to check a chef's skill).  he talked lovingly about the steps he takes to make these items, among others, and had great hokori (pride) in what he does.  he talked about fish selection and japanese flavoring techniques.  he's always learning and always asks us questions, as he knows we are from japan.  THAT is what makes akebono more authentic than most any other sushi/japanese restaurant in the sacramento area.  his desire to learn, gaining of knowledge, the constant practice, and the pride he takes in japanese cuisine.

Its a peaceful inner soul that only one can feel when they enter this place.Spacious and zen-ful, you can't but view all the details of this place.The stage area is fitted for size good enough for an entourage or two. Pillows staged in one area of the seating area and dim lights along the way up. The seating is enough to view the stage floor. The stage area is quite an area for drum circles (James!) and other people inspired activities. Imagine yourself dancing in the circle with about twenty other people; you would have a blast!Amazingly interesting place. I just wish I knew about this place sooner. I look forward in seeing some events hosted here!
<review# 2360,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/1/2012,2/26/2013,474,133,11,28,24>Donkey Kong and Dorrito's Mac and cheese?  Say no more because I'm in. I was out in old Roseville when I stumbled upon this little gem that isn't quite like anything I've ever seen before. The Union is a touch of a smaller scale Dave and Busters with a hipper atmosphere and a lot more night life potential. With an expansive and open layout, two bars, two skee ball machines, two basketball games, a handful of arcade games, good music, TVs throughout and a unique and exciting menu, there just isn't anything not to like about this place. I found myself very intrigued with menu options. Though I did not try it, I will definitely be back for a crack at the homemade four cheese sauce Dorrito Mac and cheese. I did give the loaded tator tots (drowning in homemade four cheese sauce, bacon, sour cream and jalapeños) shot and it was one of the more items I've had in awhile.This place really has me excited and I am definitely looking forward to coming back.
<review# 2361,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2012,2/25/2013,116,75,6,10,9>I've been to Hook & Ladder twice in the first week they've been open. This first night I was amongst a party of 4. By and large, the service was swift, friendly, and helpful. ohmahgawd the food!!! Well first, I had a hard time deciding what I wanted (or really- facing the fact that I would not be able to try all that I wanted that night). Finally, I pulled a classic Eva move: order a couple appetizers and check with my dinner buddies so no one doubled up. In the end, I got the hot cauliflower soup and the seared ahi banh mi sliders. I loved both, ate the soup first, and the banh mi sliders as my "dessert." In fact, I loved these so much that I forced myself to save one of the three banh mi sliders for a coworker that I have been bribing in a big way to cover for me next week while I'm out of town. Let's just say it sealed the deal. Oh, and my drink: the Whistle Blower, was so tasty I wanted everyone at my table to have a sip. A sip! And that's it! The rest for me!!My dinner peeps were silent as they devoured their chow. I did manage to get a few bites from these delighted but transfixed diners: bacon-wrapped pork with gnocchi and chard, pizza of the day featuring lamb sausage, and... I have to admit- I didn't stray from my food long enough to get all the way across the table to sample my other pal's burger of the day, but it was gone before I could weasel over for a nibble.My second night: an amiga smartly reserved the back patio for a party. Despite being the first night they were open to the public, these people rocked!  The appetizers that were preordered flowed well: cracker, bread, cheeses, dried fruits, arugula, mustard, and sliced strawberries; assorted pizzas. I must mention the decor. Using many reclaimed materials from the previous business and other sources (smart! and thanks from Planet Earth!), along with designers Whitney's & Tina's expertise, the place is fresh/familiar/tangible/raw/gently colored. I love the framed birdies in the hallway.With such a delicious menu, varied price points, and original atmosphere (both inside, front, and back), it is worth a peek for sure.
<review# 2362,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2012,2/24/2013,398,256,6,11,13>I love this place! This tiny mom and pop Japanese restaurant is run by a very sweet Japanese couple. And finding it in an Elk Grove strip mall is even better.The portions are great, and the presentation of the food is lovely. The sushi chef/owner takes real pride in his work and it shows. The fish is fresh, and at a decent price. The server/owner is always friendly. Hamachi is one of my favorite fishes, and I never fail on ordering it here. I love how everything is always fresh tasting. That scores MAJOR points with me.Overall, I am so glad I discovered this place. I enjoy the freshness and knowing that I am supporting this small family business.
<review# 2363,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/28/2013,2/23/2013,3557,369,14,30,24>I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place I been coming here a few years now, I absolutely love farmers wife. Their located at the corner of Winding way and Hackberry. I believe they're only open during the months of April through October. The produce is so fresh and most they grown themselves. The prices are excellent! The German woman in my opinion is the most helpful and make really good recommends dishes I should try with some of the seasonal veggies that I normally wouldn't try. If you bring your kids they give them a free bag of fruit while you shop. I highly recommend giving them a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. They also have samples of fruit, vegetables and sometimes nuts. They accept cash only!
<review# 2364,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/17/2013,2/22/2013,433,220,15,19,15>I will be keeping this place on my once-in-a-while list because I like them, but I find $5 and $6 for a pint of beer to be too expensive. So far I have only ordered the Hoffbrau Dunkel in a liter glass for $10 because, seeing how I am probably going to drink more than one pint, it is more cost efficient when you consider the tip, and holding a mammoth mug of dark beer makes me feel like more of a man. The acoustics are loud as all hell but that doesn't bother me. I tried the Dirty Duck Fries (fried in duck fat, covered with onions, garlic and bier cheese) for $5 and THAT is totally worth it; it's a tasty appetizer that can be shared. I'm hoping they will offer a Happy Hour menu in the future, but it doesn't seem like they really need to because they are already slammed during that time. I will return approximately every three weeks until I have tried every sausage and bratwurst they have, then I will try them all again.
<review# 2365,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2012,2/21/2013,299,309,6,9,7>Very impressed.  The Pour House knows what it takes to make a successful bar/restaurant.  Teamed up with Coast to Coast for an expanded food menu, along with a bar that has a stunning collection of beers and whiskies, there's so much going on here you just can't take it all in with just one visit!  They've also brought Sacramento the wonderful invention of intelligent "table-taps" that offer two beer selections and one hard liquor, and then measure how much of what you've poured, charging you accordingly.  Adds a bit of fun as you can pour your own drinks, and also a great option on a busy night because you don't have to wait on a waitress to bring you your drinks, you just pour away.  I was in a group of six, and among the things ordered where a Salmon BLT, a BBQ Tri-Tip sandwich, a Rueben, a Pastrami sandwich, a Burger, and a Shrimp PoBoy.  Yes, that's right, everyone at the table ordered something different.  I didn't get to try it all, but it all looked very good, and I heard no complaints.  The drinks on the table-tap were an IPA and a creamy wheat flavored beer (both names escape me) along with Jameson for the hard liquor option.  Everyone enjoyed the table-tap, and the ladies even enjoyed a Whiskey Fig or two (or three), the Pour House's signature drink a friend of ours told us.  It was a very nice dinner, the kind that you make sure to try and repeat in the near future.The decor of the place looked nice, and the table/seating felt good.  I loved the lighting and the overall atmosphere that all showed an incredible attention to detail.  The whiskey lockers were all lit up and served as a very nice highlight to the bar area, with the cool orange backlighting adding more depth to the place.The staff was very nice, and very helpful, and the manager Jon was an especially pleasant person who was quick to impress not only with his charismatic personality, but also with his vast knowledge of beers of all kinds.  Well I salute you Jon, this place is something to be proud of.  It's a testament of your ability to run a thriving success of a business, by keeping your customers happy, and coming back.I'll be back for sure.

Pastries galore!  I went in for breakfast and had an egg and bacon croissant. That thing was huge. It looked like the equivalent of two croissants.  It was so good and there was bacon in every bite.My cappuccino was not only delicious but the presentation was almost too gorgeous to drink. It almost got cold before I decided that I had to mess it up by drinking it.  Cute little tables everywhere. Looked very clean and the environment was so welcoming.  I love businesses like this one and I will definitely be a regular.*see pictures

Yes, their food is better than other uber-high rated breakfast places in Sacramento. Limited menu (somewhat), but all VERY good, and well prepared.Why not 5 stars? Ill get this off my chest now... Service is slow. It's the weekend; I don't have anything else to do except dress my dog up and take him to the park to show off his new sweater so what's it matter? Just don't come here and expect to  jump in and out like Clark Kent in a phonebooth. Also, this is the best place to go with large groups. They serve family style which works great since everyone contributes equally. With family style, you get bacon and potatoes automatically served with 2 entrees. It's priced per person, and it is pricey for breakfast. We had 12 people and it came to $340 with tip. Ouch!Oh, and it seems our mayor Kevin Johnson is a frequenter here. Good to know if you're in the habit of stalking celebrity politicians. TIP: Make reservations if you have a large group!
<review# 2368,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/26/2012,2/18/2013,574,469,12,13,13>This review is for their ITALIAN wild cherry ice cream. Holy mother of God is it good. You gotta try this. Three dollars seemed like a pittance for such a WONDERFUL cup of ice cream. I love ice cream. But I am 100 percent SNOB about it. I will shun your bad ice cream. On the menu it has in italics "Italian" wild cherry which made [my] Mommy and I wonder what the hell is so "Italian" about their wild cherries compared with everyone else's wild cherries. We were blown away. Momses wanted chocolate with hers but she also wants chocolate with a fish sandwich. Chocolate anytime all the time for Mom. For me? Italian wild cherry ice cream. Come to mama.You may notice that I am avoiding the pizza subject. This is because they ran out of dough. Not money, but actual pizza dough. However the entire time we were there we saw people before and after us on the waitlist order and get pizzas. I was confused, and poor Mom was upset about it, so I asked four people why we couldn't order a pizza. Never got a good answer from anyone, but we did get a present. I'll tell you about that some other day when it is more appropriate. The pasta was good, The ice cream was 100% knock-my-socks-off good, and the service was outstanding. But why we didn't get pizza and the people after us on the waitlist did we will never know. It is a Masullo mystery. The people after us were admittedly better dressed and also seemed to have a ravenous eating style. I'd like to point out that we were better dressed for pizza night, but we were less ravenous looking... until the ice cream came, anyway... Uh, right.Earlier this week they ran out of dough as well when I tried to go with the baby. Maybe they don't like making smaller pizzas? If that's the case I hope they know I will order a big one.Whatever-just get the ice cream and be really, really happy. It's good!! The staff is pleasant and generous and kind. It's a good place. Since I can't think of a good reason why mom and I were denied the pizza and others were not [apparent pizza discrimination], who even cares. Honestly my Mom cared more about this issue than I did and the only reason it bothered me was because it bothered her. Just another reason I am the favorite. But really, I do not care about their pizza, what I want is their Italian wild cherry ice cream. I will be back for the ice cream-pizza or no pizza-with Italian bells on.

IMO they have the best chai latte in town. Pair that with a choco chip walnut cookie and you've just sampled a taste of heaven for less than $5. Some other high points include; they are the only place in town I know of carrying Blue Sky energy drinks, they consistently stock Spicy Thai kettle chips, and Lemon Ginger Echinachea RW Knudsen is typically on sale.

Regardless, it's clean, well-lit and welcoming.BF and I shared a vegetable soup.  Because I was sick, he ate his half first and gave me the rest.  It was good and hearty with a rich broth.  I couldn't taste it very well, but my nose has been stuffed all week.I wanted to go classic, so I went for the Gatsby Burger, 8 oz. of well seasoned goodness with a side of we-won't-let-you-forget-these-are-potatoes fries.  While fast food chains have somehow convinced us that fries are supposed to be these thin, gleaming yellow spires of oil-drenched Americana, Gatsby's brings you back to reality with their skin-on, browned, almost gritty (in personality, not texture) goodness.  We had good grillside seats and watched as a fine haystack of shredded cheddar cheese liquefied onto a 3/4 inch patty.  My burger was ordered medium well, but came out medium rare, but I so feared the waste of gooey cheese goodness that I ate it without complaint.  Knowing that even a 1/4 lb. with a side of fries is too much for me, I cut it in half and left the rest for leftovers.  The burger came on a light, almost fluffy white bun with tasty tomatoes and some of the freshest looking (butter?) lettuce I've seen at a restaurant in years.BF got the chipotle chicken something or other, also drenched in the gooey cheese wonderment mine was.  It also had some kind of chipotle sauce, which BF said added some smokiness.  He didn't share any with me because I am tainted with illness.With two burgers, a cup of soup, and two sodas, our total came out to about $30, which if you're thinking in terms of a burger place is kind of steep.  However, if you consider that this is about how much you would pay to eat the same thing at Applebee's, plus the fact that it's embarrassing to be seen at Applebee's, Gatsby's is a good deal.
<review# 2372,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2009,3/14/2010,137,68,5,8,5>HANDS DOWN, BEST BAR IN SACRAMENTO. Ok, so let me start off by saying that I am an liquor connoisseur (of some sorts) and alcoholic consumption is pretty much my other part-time job. With that being said, it is a correct assumption to assume that I have been to most bars in Sacramento and surrounding areas. I would also like to say that my concentration is within midtown and East Sac. Of all "dive bars" I have been to, Round Corner is the absolute best! So great that I even celebrated my 21st birthday there years ago, with the assistance of George (best bartender in Sac). The vibe at this bar is unlike any other in this city. Sure you can go to a nightclub or lounge where a vodka tonic lacks 3 pours short of a real vodka tonic or comes to you filled to the brim with ice and a 9 dollar price tag. And all around you there are complete dirtbags who are solely at the bar to check out the skeezies, or the skeezies themselves who are just looking for their future ex-boyfriends. Its not anything like this at RC. Here, you just have locals and old-timers, sitting around minding their own business. The best pool players in town just hanging out shooting a few unpretentiously with friends. No one cares what you're wearing, who you're with, or what you're doing. People here have a certain level of respect for the bar-goers, the bartenders, and most importantly the BAR. You can find me on any random day of the week here. It can be a monday night at 10 or a friday evening at 7...either way, you'll always have the respect and good feeling from the other patrons and the air inside the Round Corner.  OOOO but just a reminder, its a cash only bar but there's an ATM inside that charges $2.
<review# 2373,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2010,3/13/2010,472,178,13,11,8>Come on people, it isn't that effing difficult to make yourself a bowl. To the person who said "SALT IN A BOWL" howabout don't pour 75 little cups of soy sauce in your bowl to begin with. How are vegetables and meat salty without adding salt? The meat is frozen and the vegetables are all fresh, and you add all the sauce yourself. I have been having Mongolian BBQ style food for a LONG time and I am pretty confident that I can't fuck it up. I am a vegetarian now and I like this place because it has tofu. Granted sometimes it looks kind of like a slop hole, the people working there could be more attentive to the haphazard customer's style of throwing all the crap in the bowl and having it jump off the sides and into whatever vegetable troph is down below.One drawback is the lame parking lot, it's right next to a busy movie theater so there will pretty much NOT be parking anywhere close if you go in the evening on a weekend. If you don't mind walking then that shouldn't really be a problem. Usual vegetables here are carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, sprouts, zucchini, spinach, green onions... and my favorite are the thick noodles. There is also a semi-decent ginger sauce to put on it (does NOT compare to Mongolian BBQ up in Yuba City, though.)I generally enjoy this place. White Swan closed down a while back so it's either here or Great Wall, and I always end up leaving the Great Wall smelling like everyone else's food. Overall, this place is decent. If you aren't familiar with how a place like this operates, it can get kind of messy, but you basically just create your own meal. So if you get a "BOWL OF SALT," then that's your fault.
<review# 2374,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2010,3/12/2010,398,256,4,4,3>I used to haunt this place when my boyfriend used to work at the Safeway across the street. While we don't come here as often, we still try to make an appearance. We go when the crowd isn't too "Sac State-ish". Mainly, weeknights when everyone is at home studying. The bartenders are all really cool ((but for some reason they HATE it when I take out my iPhone and go to my drink app......)) LoL.The prices are nice, and they have drink specials on a black board on the bar wall. The fries are great! And of course, a back patio where I can watch some boob tube and smoke.The card room I haven't used much, only a few hands at Blackjack, but the poker room is always full of people. They also have something called a 'Breakfast Tournament' with an affordable buy-in and it includes breakfast! If I can only drag myself out of bed to loose some of my hard earned cash ((or double it???)).I like it here on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. I tend not to go at all Thursday-Saturday.
<review# 2375,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/16/2010,3/11/2010,564,42,4,14,8>I lived in Philadelphia for five years. I generally avoid cheese steak places that suggest that they serve a "Philadelphia" style cheese steak sandwich. Usually the "sandwich" is nothing like anything served at even the worst steak and sandwich joint in Trenton, NJ, let alone a cheesesteak from Pat's yelp.com/biz/pats-king-o, Geno's yelp.com/biz/genos-steak or Jim's yelp.com/biz/jims-steaks.  Wild Bill has a smattering of Philadelphia memorabilia and photos paying homage to Philadelphia's big three of cheese steak lore.  He seems to take some pride in fostering a gruff, supposed south Philadelphia like attitude. A few big, flat panel screens kind of make up for it. (Hey - lots of places in Philadelphia have awesome customer service! AND, we're not in Philadelphia)The sandwiches are better than most any I've tried.  They could use a bit more cheese and the amount of meat seemed a bit stingy for the price ($23 for two orders: 7" cheesesteak, fries and sodas).  You can get provolone or cheese wiz - which makes them as authentic as their special Philadelphia style rolls - a BIG miss by most spots that say they're authentic.  Nice job on the imported rolls!Some advice?  If this place lowered the PMPS (THAT's profit margin per sandwich - just made that up) and uped the beef weight  - I bet they'd be Sacramento's answer to a meal on Passyunk Ave with destination restaurant volume.  BTW - Tastycake pastries on the counter - a made in Philadelphia hostess cupcake alternative and a cool touch.
<review# 2376,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/11/2009,3/9/2010,13,111,2,5,5>Holy balls, getting a hot chocolate is like some sort of mental zen competition....You want to drink it fast, but you can't drink it fast because it's too hot and just that damn rich. Mentally you want to down it, but you just can't, so the end result is some sort of small sipping contest.  Even in only 8 oz, I wonder what sort of physical side effects would occur from trying to chug one of these drinks. Open late, that's a perk, since I can now create a massive chocolate rush at 10pm.  I wonder what would happen if I tried to drink 5 of these things really quickly...Anyways, this is it.  This is the end all for hot chocolate in the city of Sacramento.  You don't go anywhere else when you want one, you go here, no excuses.  Oh yeah, they also have really good chocolate delectables here.  You know, if you're into that sort of thing.  That stuff is really good too, it's just not hot chocolate drinks, so it's kinda a side note in my mind.  It's a small place, quaint, not really cheap, but for small amounts of chocolate and their hot drinks the prices are good.  Definitely yet another stop in spot for me.  I'm afraid that with more nice places dotting the area my "routine stop offs" is becoming very expensive each week.
<review# 2377,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/15/2010,3/8/2010,448,416,3,12,7>This place is a diner - you know - has plastic water glasses and sugar that comes out of a glass jar with a hinged metal spout.  $73 for four folks eating too much food - two appetizer plates, four dinners, five desserts, miscellaneous nonalcoholic drinks and a healthy tip. It was worth the money. The ups: Very good falafel and baklava.  Free cake for my birthday boy.  Super nice  service - but could have checked in a couple more times.  Nice job on the presentation of the hummus.  The Egyptian coffee was tasty.The downs: The beef shewarma plate was okay, not great.  My wife's salad had way too much onion.  The shewarma rolls were medium sized with about a pound of fries on the side. Comparable to Maalouf's, if you've been there - Habibi/Egyptian is a little more relaxing and fun, and a little more of a diner and not a restaurant.  And the food wasn't quite as good - but it wasn't bad at all. Really want to go back and try the back patio hookah thing sometime - but that's boy's night out type of fun, and we don't usually head towards the suburbs for "fun".  On the other hand - if I'm out looking for cheap non-Mexican food in that area for some reason, I'd probably give them another shot.

You know-I used to walk here with every guest I had at that place. Memories. I'd give them each about one star but I digress. Except for one occasion that got 5 bright yellow stars. Anyway, about the actual restaurant.When you get in the bistro, it is probable that you will not be able to get a seat at the bar unless you're alone. The bar is really not to scale with the rest of the restaurant. Aren't there some industry-wide accepted proportions/ratios of diners to drinkers or drinkers to diners? There are about 6 seats at the bar (minus the one some random employee is forever sitting in, closest to the door, where I always want to be, with the least number of people I don't know sitting by me as possible.) There are about 21 tables that seat an average of 4 people. (allow a 5-table margin of error). 21 x 4 is 84 which gives us a 6 drinker to 84 regular diner ratio. These numbers make it likely that I solely will make an ass out of myself in front of at least 50 people that are sober. As a side note to that major point, there is a weird sidebar that I would never sit at. You'll see it when you get there. It is probably the choice seating of freaky weirdos and/or writers of fiction. No likey. Remodel that and make more money-guaranteed. Whatever.Aside from the weird half bar, a disgusting (albeit intermittent) fly problem when the sun is out, and a select few bad-attitude-driven career servers; the food is good, the help is helpful, and ... my dad likes it (automatic two-stars). If you don't like your food, BTW, the service staff will fix it with no issue in the most efficient manner possible, even when the server is a total bitch otherwise.So in short, this place  is good enough for all of your judgmental family members, co-workers, and friends: It has a nice hum that drowns out all you don't want to hear, satisfying fare, and there's always something to bitch about. It's human, (and my dad likes it)! 4 stars!

The decor is great, everything looks so nice and new, and very clean. Nothing too complicated, which is the same as the menu.And that brings me to the food... I usually go for the #3, half chicken with pork lumpia. The portions are generous, and the food is delicious. I can never finish the half, but I order it anyway, so I can eat the leftovers for later. =) The skin on the chicken is fried and flavored to perfection, and the gravy is an added bonus, which I usually use to dip the white meat in, or even the lumpias (though the sweet and sour sauce they provide in the store is pretty good too). Rice, you can order steamed or fried... although their fried rice is good, I usually prefer the steamed. As for dessert, if you still have room, I love Halo Halo, and it's so hard to find a good one around the San Jose area. The one they serve is very generous, and definitely hits the spot on a hot day. Their Taho with Sago is also pretty good.... talking about it makes me want more!!Anyway, definitely recommended for some great Filipino style chicken. Parking is plentiful, and the place is relatively easy to find right on the corner of Laguna and Franklin.
<review# 2382,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2008,7/26/2008,79,258,1,6,6>Smoke signals on Stockton Blvd. in the Capital City of Cali sent we 2 1/2 passengers into the gravel lot of Cafe Au Creme. That right hand turn at the end of a two-week odessey West from Chi-Town was one of the best decisions we made. Full disclosure. Driving from Sac-Town's Old Town to see Mr. Barbecue Bobby was on a recommendation from a local Bee biz reporter. Outside, BBQ Bobby was at a meat smoker the likes I used to see my great-uncle cooking ribs, chicken and even venison (Bambi) in the backyard. But it's the inside of Cafe Au Creme that made the biggest impact on me: a plush couch, a living room table, several raised stands covered in leather tablecloths and a menu that includes various coffees including Bobby's caramel macchiato.  We ate everything that we could put in our mouths by ordering the 3-way: barbeque ribs, chicken and hot links. (There is a 4-way, but the tri-tip wasn't ready yet, Bobby told us. And when it comes to BBQ, we learned to trust Bobby.)Everything tasted incredible. Talking with the chef/owner, a fellow Chicago South Sider, it was apparent why the food was so wonderful. Bobby cares that you enjoy your dining experience. I would recommend this place to anyone wanting barbecue.

The coworker and I somehow drifted onto the subject of particle physics of which I knew little and he knew quite a bit from his days back in college. I was asking lots of questions in an effort to get my head around the concept and was assisted by the bartender in my quest who was something of an armchair expert herself. That my friends is an example of the community one can find at a great neighborhood pub. You walk in sit down and launch into entertaining (time waisting) conversation only to be joined in by someone you don't know that adds to the fun. The Bonn Lair will remain my go to spot when the cubicle walls begin to close in and I need to escape this job.
<review# 2385,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2008,7/23/2008,28,66,6,6,5>It had been a few years since my last trip to Kru, and after my dining experience Saturday night I wondered why I had waited so long. This is by far the best sushi in Sacramento, as far as quality of fish and presentation. You feel like you are at Nobu with the care and meticulous detail the chefs put into the presentation. To start off, we sat at the bar and enjoyed our draft Kirin and Sapporo with our complimentary edamame as we browsed the menu. The small plates all looked very inventive and enticing, but my dining companion says he rates a sushi restaurant on the quality of their albacore, so we went with that, and it was pretty damn tasty. Definitely had my eye on the lobster tempura, spicy tuna tartare, poke trio, kobe beef sashmi, among many other items and will be trying those in the future.I have noticed that not too many yelpers have gave a shout out to the Cindy roll. This this is AMAZING and HUGE, so you are getting your $15 worth for sure. It looks simple on the menu with crab, tuna, and jalapenos slices lightly deep fried but it is just too die for. We saw probably 15 of these rolls (at least) go out to other  diners while sitting at the sushi bar. We then ordered the Spicy d which was good, but nothing compared to the Cindy roll. I was a little disappointed that there were not more speciality rolls but from what I have read (and stated on the menu) the sushi chefs are more than happy to create whatever you want. After the rolls, we were piglets and decided to get the deep fried cheesecake, which was delicious, and of course presentation was beautiful. Kru is just pheonmenal. The next time you are in Midtown and are considering dining at the shit show that is Mikuni, you should really think twice and come here!

You have to get these especially on trivia night because what is hotter or more fun than everyone whispering answers to each other across the wooden tables, slightly blowing a small whiff of extreme garlic every few seconds?? ha ha Their calamari with the lemon aioli is also a must order appetizer wise. Their fish and chips are a brewery favorite for a reason and that is probably because the british know how it is done with drinking and eating and what could go better with beer or cider than deep fried fish and some french fries, eh????And their ribs put my friend Sarah in rib heaven. I haven't seen anyone eat ribs that quickly except for my brother and he has quite a lot of experience eating ribs!! She said that the sauce which is made with the red horse ale is to die for, so if you are hungry you should check this one out! I will have to send my brother here to give it the real rib test though!All in all a nice little place, and trivia night fills up quickly so be sure to get there early!!

This year I turn 40, and when I walked into the Cliff House tonight, I felt as youthful as a spring flower. Seriously, My date and I were probably the youngest people there. Most of the crowd appeared to be in their 40's with some 50-somethings thrown in. The DJ started the evening with 70s and 80s music, and as the evening progressed, he worked his way up to the 90s and early 2000s. I requested a little Nelly Furtado at the beginning of the evening, and he told me I would have to wait. Sure enough, he finally played my song 2 hours later.  Anyway, there was no cover charge, a clean bathroom, and a nice crowd. I will go back.

It came with rice, beans and a salad with avocado.Service was very friendly and attentive even though it was pretty busy with customers picking up take-out orders.  With the coupon [from restaurant.com - 10$ off your purchase of 15$ or more] we paid less than 10$ [without the tip] for our meal.

Prices are reasonable. They're not carrying as many clothes as they used to, possibly because their designated clothing area is smaller plus they just opened so I'm sure they're getting situated. If you get tired of shopping or come with a companion that doesn't want to shop, walk a little further, order a drink, maybe some food, and enjoy their café area.I do miss their designated parking lot at their old location though. This new one only has street parking which makes for a little frustration when there aren't any available spots but that's life and I got over it. It's really beautiful location and they've definitely upgraded.

If possible please box the box in another box so that coworkers will not eat. I don't like cupcakes. Really, I don't. The frosting is usually too sweet and too much. And whoever invented cupcakes obviously did not include functionality in the equation. Cupcakes are too small to cut up in slices and eat classily with a fork but they are also too big to simply pop in your mouth conveniently. To top it all off, it is a chore to even get a bite of the cake part since the frosting covers the whole top of the cake while the wrapper blocks any attempt to approach it from the bottom. It's like a hot girl at the club... difficult to approach and just pretty to look at.BUT despite all of this, I must say that Vanilla Bean has turned me into a fan of their cupcakes. They offer mess free mini cupcakes made with quality ingredients (ie real vanilla bean vanilla flavoring) and not your run of the mill sugary frosting.Once again, accepting deliveries.

Capital Athletic Club is a dying breed that a loyal few are resuscitating with their patronage; it is, in the classical sense, a full-service, member-oriented health club, with all the bells and whistles that one should expect by shelling out the extra money to distinguish their experience from that of an insufferable CalFit or 24-Hour. No longer are my workouts preceded and followed by waits: wait for a machine, wait for another machine, wait for a mat to stretch out; a girl only has so much patience a remaining at the tail-end of her tolling day, y'know. Also, the month-to-month honor system approach to collecting membership dues is a very welcome change from the 5th-on-the-button EFT system my checking account was once--and for too long--violated by.

The owners also run Lucky Dog Ranch, and the quality of the ingredients shone today.We started with the doughnut holes, which come with 3 dipping sauces: caramel, chocolate and lemon. They were pretty good. Our entrees, we thought, were even better. My husband loved his buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, and we both agreed that his garlic fries were what garlic fries should taste like!As for my entree, I have been thinking about it all day. I can't stop thinking about the glorious sumptuousness of crispy biscuit topped with pork belly, aged cheddar, and a poached egg. Together. Have you ever cut open a delicate poached egg and watched the yellow yolk ooze over a braised piece of pork belly so tender it falls apart when you cut into it? I highly recommend it if you haven't. Don't forget the side serving of chili spiced fried potatoes and veggies, bursting with flavor.In conclusion: Pork Belly. I love you. I miss you. I will return for you soon.
<review# 2394,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2011,10/12/2011,193,552,5,15,17>Quick disclaimer: I didn't eat here. Well, I didn't eat their food. Here's the story... My coworker and I were in the area for work and stopped next door for pizza. The pizza place (New York Pizza) doesn't have anywhere to eat in the restaurant, so we ate out in the parking lot. Country Gables owner Sukhi came outside and invited us to eat our pizza at a table in his restaurant. We tried to refuse, but he wouldn't have it. So we took him up on his offer. We ate ate at a table on their lovely patio, and he insisted on bringing us plates and cold glasses for our canned soda. He chatted with us about his restaurant and family, without ever trying to get us to buy something. He just asked that if we were ever in the area again, to stop by and say hi (and perhaps try some of his "amazing" chicken). Normally people yell at you for sitting at their tables or using their bathroom without being a customer. Sukhi was much more friendly than he needed to be, so I feel he deserves a solid recommendation for his restaurant (voted "best breakfast in Roseville", I hear...). If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely stop here for lunch.

No wait -a day or two, at least.Why the sudden (slight) change of heart? I thank Netflix and their showing of "Forks Over Knives" a couple nights ago. I also thank my gf for dragging my carnivorous self to the light. Trust me I didn't go without a fight.Hesitant, yet curious we arrive. Key word: hesitant, for me at least. We both hadn't been, so we peered through the menu quite a bit: "Vegeken," "vegepork," "vegebeef," "vegefish," "TOFU?!" !@#$%^&; I was already thinking of places to eat after this joint. Menu pictures weren't to my avail, and I ALWAYS need pictures when ordering so I had to direct my attention to my trusty Yelp app on my Android.We ended up with Lemongrass Vegeken, Bun Bo Hue, and Golden Rolls. Each item was DELICIOUS. I was pleasantly surprised. Not a hint in my head asked "where's the meat?" Instead I kept thinking, "I could really eat this all day." And that's saying A LOT.In an ideal world I'd be able to cut out meat completely and live off a plant-based and whole grain diet, but FORTUNATELY I don't live in an ideal world; I'm still an omni-yet-mostly-carni-vore at heart. However, Noble Vegetarian has proved to me that idealism is attainable in the consuming sense.
<review# 2396,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/28/2010,10/10/2011,274,226,8,5,6>I guess it's about time I wrote a ravishing review for this place, considering I've been there about 4 times since it's opened (that's 2 months, fyi).For people who think this restaurant is in a sketchy neighborhood, get over it.  It's BROADWAY, not south sac.  The interior to the place is nice: chic, and somewhat trendy.  Not a whole lot of tables or two tops, so it's best to dine here with a group.  I like the table in the back that has half bench and half chairs.Foodwise, the menu is pretty limited and there's no chicken offerings for the shabu, so that may turn you off if you don't eat beef, lamb, or straight up veggies.   I usually get the lemon and pepper wings and the wagyu shabu.  The wings are delicious!  One of the owners, Young, said it was his dad's recipe.  Well, big ups to Young's dad!   The wagyu is fantastic!  I usually eat about half of it raw, that's how good it is!   And their spicy broths are just that-- spicy!  How I like it ;)  I just wish they offered udon along with ramen.  The other appetizers are pretty standard, hard to eff up, Chinese cuisine type appetizers (pot stickers, cream cheese wontons).  Each time we've been in here, the service was exceptional.  Usually the owners will come by and chat with you for a few and check up on you during your meal.  At times, they've even brought us out a bottle of wine or two to show their appreciation.  Basically, he got us drunk.  Now that's customer service!
<review# 2397,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2011,10/9/2011,244,170,4,7,7>Ok, I just had THEE best sandwich in quite some time. Hemi, oh how I adore you! I was so torn between The Special (shout out to Jessica T)and The Hemi, but I ended up going with The Hemi. And boy was it yummy! The sauce the pulled pork was in wasn't too sweet or tangy, but just right. And it didn't make my bread soggy with sauce. There was a decent amount of meat on the sandwich. The balance of pork, mac n cheese, and onions was perfect. The clarified garlic butter was great on the bread; not too garlicky or overwhelming. It was great meeting Mr. Drewski himself, too; as well as, momma Drewski and big sis Drewski. He's really personable (and easy on the eyes!). It was nice to see the man behind the truck taking a brief hiatus to mingle with us regular folk. I'm glad I got a Sweet Mint Tea to accompany my sandwich; it was extremely refreshing.  I definitely see The Special and creme brulee in my future, so I'll surely be twitter/FB stalking them until I can get my hands on another tasty creation.
<review# 2398,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2011,10/8/2011,125,189,5,8,8>The Golden Bear feels so much like THE neighborhood bar that I often forget to give the place its due propers.Cheap drinks, great front patio for mingling and people watching (if you don't mind the smokers), great bartenders, and shout outs to CrookOne for some great tunes a few nights of the week.The crowd is mixed pretty well, but undoubtedly people throw the word "hipster" out there willy nilly (a word that has lost all meaning and has become a general blanket term for something or some place that the person using it wants to describe as being not favorable).  To call this place a "hipster bar" would be a huge discredit.  All types hang out here, and any given night of the week will produce different results.  I also believe that a huge reason this place has such a great reputation amongst the locals, is that (like many local places to imbibe) there is a strong sense of loyalty to The Bear amongst its regular customers (even the four legged ones - dog friendly!).The food being great goes without saying.  On my last couple of visits, people around me have been mowing down those pork sliders, which have most definitely caught my eye.  I'll give those babies a whirl next go-round.The reason I reserved that last star is because I'm not particular to cigarette smoke, so hanging on either the front or back patio can be a drag as far as killing the fresh air.Most authentic neighborhood vibes for this neighborhood joint.  Great place to relax, and I'm glad summer is comin' round again for some GB patio action!

I missed it, huh?"  The porter looks at me and says, "I can get the bag on the flight, but let's get you on the flight, young lady!"*-*-*-(Look of SHOCK on my face.)*-*-*-He peeks over my shoulder to see the security line and says he thinks I can make it.Unbelievable, but worth a shot, so I take out my wallet and am rummaging through to find a $20 bill for his upcoming run to the plane... and he says to me, "Don't worry about it - just GO GO GO!!!!"  I manage to pull out a small wad of I-dunno-what-denomination, threw the whole thing into his hands, yelled thanks and ran off.I made it.So did my bag.Lines are always minimal compared to SFO / OAK / SJC - and parking is rather easy but amazingly expensive.  Food choices are good, coffee choices superb.  The airport is clean, efficient, and speedy. And it's only 45 minutes from me!All in all, I really love Sac Airport!

You can only take so many Grand Slams. Yummy's is a nice alternative with cheap and delicous snacks. They stay open late and always have a welcoming crowd. Most people that roll in naturally are asian but that should not deter you because its a friendly place. Tip: Try the egg puffs and fried tofu.Warning: Make sure that the fruit your ordering is in season other wise it might not be as sweet.
<review# 2401,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/6/2007,1/3/2008,133,439,4,4,4>Quite a fitting review: "TREE" point five :) Imagine: Triple Digit TemperaturesBeautiful green rolling mountainsClean, clear, mountain water and gorgeous rock formationsSlathering sunblock on a hot river guide? Priceless. ;) That, my dears, is the Middle Fork of the American River.  Enjoyed a beautiful day out there on the river with a very sweet, and not to mention good looking river guide, Wolf!  The Middle Fork tends to be for intermediate rafters, but I would highly suggest you do the intermediate run even if its your first try.  The beginner run seems like it would be wayyy too easy, and plus, its fun to have some adrenaline rushing through your body! The trip includes a nice lunch towards the end of the 18 Mile run, so be ready to eat.  They do bring a lot of food though, which is nice.  We had about 20 in our party and everyone was able to eat two sandwiches.  So, yes. BRING SUNBLOCK. I suppose the only thing that didn't live up to expectations was how hard the class III and IV rapids were...some of them were pretty weeeaaaaak.... still liked skydiving more! :D And get ready to ride the rapids! :)
<review# 2402,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/27/2007,1/2/2008,450,315,4,23,16>We moved my grandmother here a year after my grandpa died.  She was alone in her house, bored, and there was no one there in case she fell or needed help.  We felt bad about moving her into a "retirement home," but live-in nurses were too expensive and we didn't have much choice. Sob story.But not.Moving here was the best thing that could have happened to her.  At 93, my grandmother was starting to drift into quiet spells and talking to herself out of lonliness.  But here, there are so many activities and people to interact with that she is sharper than ever.She plays poker bingo, watches movies, goes on excursions to the countryside, gets massages, and gets rides to doctor's appointments.  She has friends and gossip and is fun to hang out with again. Her room is pretty spacious and there is a cleaning service that comes once a week to do her linens and general upkeep.She is allowed to have guests and has even reserved a private room for the extended family for a banquet (free of cost).  We got waiter service and had our choice of several meals.The food was not so great (hence the four stars)... I guess its all prepared beforehand and heated at meal time.  Pretty much your basic cafeteria food... edible but barely.  Reminded me of being a kid in elementary school again, except everyone was old.If you are looking for a place to be taken care of in later life, this is a great option.  I am told it's not too pricey and its located along a stream so there is the occasional deer or turkey sighting.  My grandmother is happy there, and its fun to visit her (they have billiards, poker, activities too)!
<review# 2403,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/15/2007,1/1/2008,5,11,5,10,5>Who would have thought that you could step into a taqueria in Puerto Vallarta, MX on 24th street in Sacramento?  I sure didn't.  I have been living no more than 3 blocks from this gem for about 4 years now and only this past weekend have I had the pleasure of patronizing it.  Lalo's is really not much to look at.  It's very small, the floor is uneven, and though it might be chilly outside, somehow Lalo's has been able to transport the current temp. in Mexico right to their restaurant.  None of this really mattered to me because I realized my friends and I were the only white people in the place and I knew then and there that we were about to have some wonderful authentic Mexican cuisine.  You can order and pay at the counter or there is table service as well.  Among the three of us, we ordered 4 tacos, 1 torta, and 3 drinks.  The bill totaled a mere $16 and we left full.  The tacos were very authentic- choice of meat (i highly recommend the el pastor!)  served with white onions, cilantro, and a big slice of avocado on 2 corn tortillas.  The torta was stuffed with the works and tasted fantastic.  I can't wait to go back and try their burritos, other tortas, and barbacoa that they make special on Sundays.  I am sure that they will all impress me as much as my meal did this weekend and it will solidify the fact that this place just may be the best Mexican food in Sacramento.  I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars simply because there is no alcohol in Lalo's and I am a firm believer in a cold beer or margarita with any Mexican dish.  I want to also mention that the service was great.  We were greeted with smiles and we left with well-wishings.  I can't wait to go back and since it's so cheap, I don't have to wait long!

It isn't too clean, and they get very crowded considering the tiny space they have.  They also have your typical menu at your typical price.However, one interesting aspect about this place are the two plasma tv's hanging on the walls.  Depending on who's working that day, you'll be able to watch the news, sports, or even my very favorite, Hanna Montana.  Oh what joy to be hearing her teeny bop voice while eating my food (please detect the hint of sarcasm).  Anyways, there's not other place like this in Davis, so if you're in the mood for some Hawaiian BBQ, go ahead and check it out, and take it to go while your at it.
<review# 2406,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/8/2007,12/28/2007,242,141,5,14,7>UPDATE June 2008:Docking a star because:- the fresh fruit selection has dramatically declined since last year -- only one fresh fruit during peak fruit season is pretty bleak;- sometimes the yogurt machines are fussy and the consistency of the yogurt isn't up to par;- they don't have any other water available except bottled water.We recently had our son's end-of-the-season T-ball party here. They've worked on the big room in the back and added tables/chairs. They charged $50 for use of the room and we ordered pizzas from Famous Pizza. So yay for them being friendly to the neighborhood kids!I'll have to go check out Yogurtagogo .UPDATE July 2007:We've been here several times now; I've decided the chocolate is the best flavor. They need to provide a free water/ice/cup station and better ventilation. (End update).Delicious fro-yog much closer to "urtopia" than Big Spoon.Friendly and helpful proprietors decided to have a "soft" opening yesterday and today, trying to work out the kinks and resolve "equipment issues." 4.5 stars and will probably upgrade later.I liked that:- their frozen yogurt is "probiotic" (contains live starter culture -- "good guy" bacteria for your gut);- they have fresh fruit for topping in addition to the usual crowd-pleasing candies;- their fro-yog tasted creamy and smooth, like soft serve ice cream -- no nasty grittiness;- their yogurt is made with fructose instead of white sugar, which is supposed to be a tad better for you and, according to the proprietors, lower on the glycemic index (I'll let the dieticians duke this one out).The store and equipment are brand new, so it has sort of an industrial "new" smell to it that isn't the most appetizing but I'm sure that will wear off quickly. Their floor is a bit uneven and they need shims for the tables. They have big plans for further expansion into the rest of the space they rented. Right now, a giant curtain is partitioning the space -- city ordinance regarding number of square feet and number of required bathrooms. My kids were having a Wizard of Oz moment about what was behind that curtain. Anyway...We sampled the Eurostyle flavor, which is more tangy like real yogurt. An acquired taste that might be preferred by some.The drill is self-serve, weigh and pay, then eat.Our almost 3 y.o. daughter had strawberry and vanilla; our 4.5 y.o. son had chocolate. There was peace and quiet at our table for a total of 8 minutes; which -- from them -- is a five star review.
<review# 2407,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/14/2007,12/27/2007,117,412,2,7,5>Once upon a time, a girl wanted to meet her sister, who was traveling for work, in a town called Sacramento. It was her first trip to this city and she left work at 2:45pm on a Thursday, expecting the 112m trip to take a couple of hours.  3 hrs, much rain, and one (small) panic attack later....this girl was lost somewhere downtown (thanks mapquest). I called the Voice of Reason (my older sis) and we agreed to drive towards each other - I was on L street.  I happily found a valet and got rid of my car, then stepped into a well-lit restaurant to use their restroom and get my bearings. Upon entering, I was alarmed to see a self-serve soda station and a congealed phad thai attempt on someone's plate, along with many meaty-looking dishes...not very veg-friendly for me and my veg-sister...hmm...I used the restrooms (clean) and exited quickly. Standing outside in the rain I looked around at my options and spotted, across the street, a sign barely legible through the rain...."(something)....aioli". OK, I though, If they're not afraid to throw around that word and be able to spell it correctly, I'm game. So I went in - The ambiance enveloped me like a warm blanket. I truly felt I had found refuge from the storm in both a literal and figurative sense. I had a glass of wine and a lovely conversation with the bartender and a woman at the bar (who was obviously a regular) about their selection of wines and their recommendations- both of them were very knowledgeable. My sister met me shortly thereafter and we proceeded to get a cosy table next to the window and an excellent waiter who was more than happy to point us in the direction of the many veg options. Highlights include: spinach salad with feta, portobello mushrooms sauteed in a mustard gravy, white beans with mint and other herbs, and the coup de grace: handmade cheese pasta ravs with a browned butter sage sauce. We had Tempranillo and Grenaches paired with these...and if I had had room I would have ordered another rav tapas... Dinner was $110 for two and worth every penny. I will have fond memories of this place for years to come, for providing us with attentive service and an excellent veggie meal, and for the memories I have spending precious time with my sister....I only hope that I can find it again and that it wasn't all a dream.
<review# 2408,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/18/2007,12/26/2007,23,123,3,6,3>Tokyo Fro's has been around for a while. I remember when it first opened: my family ran over there immediately, memories of a Disco Sushi place we used to frequent while living in Atlanta running through our heads. The place didn't disappoint in that regard: thumping disco music and funky paintings filled the space and young, attractive sushi chefs sliced and diced fish at the wide open sushi bar,  while rail thin CSUS students picked at decent rolls and enjoyed Happy Hour. I hadn't been in a few years, but we revisited the other night. Has it changed any?The music is still loud, but Tokyo Fro's definitely seemed to be seeing less business then it did in the old days. The menu is your standard Americanized/Fusion Sushi sort of bidness, with a lot of bizarre rolls and other vaguely Japanese and Asian inflected dishes. Almost all menu items have cutesy little nick-names, which is kind of fun if you're drunk but embarrassing to say when you are both stone sober and with your parents. We began with the wakame seaweed salad (6.50), which was essentially the same as you'd get anywhere else: tangy, crispy, and salty. I insisted on ordering the Kama Sutra (6.95), which was a grilled hamachi collar in ponzu sauce over a bed of daikon. This was actually very good, and I enjoyed picking the meat out of the fish's elaborate bone structure, while swirling it in the tangy citrus sauce that covered the plate. For god's sake though, don't order this if you have any issue whatsoever with fish bones. For the rest of us: it's like pig picking Japanese style.We also ordered a couple of rolls. The rolls here are totally overwrought, stuffed with ingredients, drenched in sauce and generally way too big to eat in one bite - but if you're into Wacky Explosions of Fish (and let's be honest, most people are,) Tokyo Fro's has some options for you. If you're into austere, simple rolls that are healthy, normal sized, and evocative of actual Japanese cuisine....uh, good luck.  We went with the Passion of Rice (13.50), which had tempura prawns, avocado, and spicy tuna on the inside, topped with salmon, jalapeno, and garlic miso sauce, then torched. This was pretty good, and I liked the spicy kick of the jalapeno - though again, why does everything have to be drenched in some kind of squeeze bottle sauce? We also tried the Captain Save-A-Fro (13.95), with spicy tuna and asparagus on the inside and hamachi, avocado, maguro, shitake mushrooms, and the ubiquitous miso sauce on the outside. The roll itself was rather ginormous for my tastes (though the aspragus was a fun touch), but the shitakes were absolutely delicious, with a garlic butter sort of flavor. It wasn't Asian, but it was tasty - I wish they offered these mushrooms as a side order. We also tried a simple 12 piece sashimi platter (20.95), which was simply okay - featuring only hamachi, salmon, and maguro, rather then the more interesting variety you usually get with samplers. The fish itself seemed fresh and tasted good, but the pieces were gigantic and cut with an obviously heavy hand. I like sashimi in manageable pieces. Anything bigger and I feel more like a vicious raw meat consuming predator then a customer in an ostensibly civilized restaurant. Still hungry, I ordered the Hawaiian Poke (8.95). The presentation was lovely: the chunks of tuna were layered with the seaweed and onion in a martini glass, along with slices of avocado on top. The spicy soy sauce it was tossed with was light and not overpowering - I really enjoyed this dish. Service was fairly quick and certainly friendly, although our waitress did seem a bit overattentive. The noise level here is very loud, and you should by no means expect to come here and have a relaxing Japanese cuisine experience - you'll end up shouting at each other over the table as college students take sake shots instead. So is Tokyo Fro's worth a visit? The place certainly lacks the luster it had when it first opened up, but the very untraditional sushi is still a decent option if you have no convictions about how Japanese food *should* taste. If you're a roll person or simply enjoy spicy mayo sauce drizzled over everything, you'll like Tokyo Fro's. (And the poke is definitely a safe bet if you're only willing to commit to a bar snack or two.) Try a few things off the menu, have some drinks, and try to relax - if you can get past the whole thumping party music thing.

No matter how many questions I asked, she didn't mind answering them patiently. I asked her about the specials and more.  She was also patient when I asked her to repeat herself.  Very nice customer service.I am a THIN CRUST person and ordered the COMBINATION X-large. I figured it would be safe for trying them out for the first time.  But I am a tough critic because I do have my favorite pizza places.I decided to pick it up. I got a coca cola 2 liter bottle for just picking it up. COOLIO!  When I went into pick up, the environment was very clean. I was surprised!    When we brought it home, we tore it up!  It was delicious.  The ingredients were tasty and fresh. I would definitely try it again.
<review# 2410,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2011,10/27/2011,147,322,5,11,6>I've literally visited Sacramento from San Francisco to "visit my mother" (eat at PK's) on multiple occasions. Every time I go I leave feeling sick from eating way too much food in one sitting but after having tried a large portion of the menu I thought I would get down to specifics. BBQ White Tuna - A very standard dish if your familiar with Mikuni's you know exactly what to expect. It comes with the red sauce, not sure if they have the white sauce, will ask next time. I always start my meals with this dish at Mikuni's, nothing's changed here. Always order at least one, maybe two. 4/5Rock Shrimp - Surprising dish. Didn't have high hopes because of artificial crab but PK does something crazy with his crab salad mix that really brings out the flavor instead of just tasting like stale fish and mayo it actually tastes like crab. The shrimp's flavor really comes out too, shows that they use good oil. Oil in the deep fryer changes everything. When you bite into it you get two distinctive flavors coming at you instead of a weird jumble of randomness. Pretty good would order it once per sitting. 3/5Jalapeño Pepper - A little too heavy for my taste. Tuna definitely doesn't taste that good deep fried (at least to me). It was just a little too greasy for something that didn't have cheese in it. Not sure if it's canned tuna or fresh tuna but after it's deep fried with some spices it's a little heavy. Good to try but I would probably save the stomach space for something else. 2/5Stuffed Mushrooms - I might be prejudiced because I love mushrooms, at home mushrooms and cheese are two of my primary grocery expenses.... Whenever I see an appetizer with mushrooms I must have it. PK uses the crab mix that I usually hate but kind of like in his hands to stuff the mushrooms. I honestly would just prefer a deep fried mushroom without any crab mix. Even with the crab mix I still end up ordering this because I got to have my mushrooms. 3/5Sea Steak - When I first started going to Mikuni's in High School I used to love this dish... until I met Pepperfin. Since then Pepperfin had displaced Sea Steak on my line-up but PK somehow managed to change my opinion. Perhaps because the Pepperfin is less spicy and a little more Sesame Oil than I usually prefer here but I think it's the size of the Sea Steak. Usually Sea Steak is an eraser sized chunk of meat flash glazed and covered in sauces. Whether it's because PK's is all you can eat or because he somehow found the secret balance between seared and raw I don't care. The effect is that the tinier pieces taste BETTER than the big chunks you usually get. I find myself, a spicy food lover, ordering Sea Steak here MORE than the glorious Pepperfin. The waitress gives me sideways glances as I order my 6th plate but I care not, for I am shameless. Somehow this old dish that I had forsaken for so long has made it back to the top of my list. This. is. my. favorite. dish. (at PK's) 5/5Creamy Scallop - I'm not usually a big fan of Scallop in general but after eating so much white tuna and salmon i had to give it a little try. So after ordering this dish I was somewhat surprised to see rice underneath my scallops and cream. It wasn't bad, but definitely didn't have room to waste on it with all the goodness on the menu. 2/5Garlic Salmon - Here we go.... This is an avocado based garlic flavored guacamole looking spread with some torched salmon on top. For some reason it really hits the spot. Maybe it's because I'm Korean and we put garlic in everything... (seriously, imagine a container about 2Liters in size filled with peeled garlic in the fridge) The glazed salmon was nice for my stomach because I'd been eating slippery goodness all night and it was nice to get a little variety from the menu. 5/5Pepper Fin - Fin Fin Fin. I used to always end my meals with this dish at Mikuni's, appropriate no? A little bit of silliness from my part but in all honesty, if you love sesame oil, white tuna, and a little bit of spice. This is your dish. Don't be scared, this is a 1/10 on the spicy scale. It's like.... the mildest sauce at taco bell. Or chipotle's tobasco sauce (honestly, i really can't gauge how NOT spicy something is because it doesn't even register on my palate anymore after all the abuse it's taken). It's at most spicy for a Scotsman who has been on a farm his whole life eating taters and mutton. Oh how I love mutton... but I digress. Pepperfin takes one of the best combination that Asia has to offer and sticks spicy and white tuna into the mix. It's simply orgasmic. 5/5Now after about 10 plates of raw fish with sauces all over it... I start feeling a little sick so I head towards the Nigiri to fill my belly with a little bit of rice to balance out the mix. Usually PK's fish quality is a little below Mikuni's but there is ONE fish that is awesome here, the White Tuna. So I load up on a few orders of White Tuna Nigiri with extra dollops of Wasabi and Ginger dipped in the Wasabi/Soy.

A little stream of taco juices runs down your hand and you're so entrenched in the meaty adoration that you don't even notice. Or care. It's all about the taco.Of the several varieties I tried, I liked the chicken the best; the pork adobada my least favorite. Picked up hints of nutmeg and cinnamon with the pineapple in the adobada and wasn't particularly fond of it. Swooned however over the moist chicken taco and birria taco. Perhaps a little heavy handed with the cilantro and I'm a lover of all things cilantro. Otherwise, the meat was moist, tortillas were fresh and filling was bursting out the sides. Over-imbibed just a bit the night before and these tacos were the perfect hangover food.Cheap! Six bucks for three tacos and a soft drink. I thought. 'no way could I eat three tacos' and yet before I knew it....they were gone. Inhaled. Right before my eyes. I'm embarrassed to admit I can put away some tacos.Next on my Chando's bucket list...the tortas!PROSKick ass tacosNice people working thereFood is fastCONSCan be a little tricky to park in the 2 small lotsQuite popular right now, so plan on a line

Well, all I  would like to say, but that would not be a substantial enoughh reason for one to try them. Ok, I have tried them a few times now, and have never been let down. I came in a long time ago for some baked goods, and was pretty happy with my purchase. For got about them and fast forward to a year later, I treid them again. For real food, brunch! A buffet too.They had some bomb ass brown rice salad, with nuts and parsley, perhaps some lemon juice to coat it. Then there was fresh fruit and real berries ( mot the frozen crap people try to serve). There wre syrups and fruit purrees, and the warm food. Soyrizo scramble that looked like and had the texture of scramby eggs. With some like peppers involved in the mix. Move further down the line to find: mini bluberry pancakes, bicuits, gravy and breakfast potaotes. A great mix and selction of breakfast eats and sooooo gooood! I had to stop myself from being, like uncomfortably stuffed. Went in a few weeks later and tried some burgers with my friend. The bbq burger, and the classic cheeseburger. Oh my freaking goodness!!!!! Crispy fake cheese, tasty burger patty...Love it! Will sooo be back for some sandwiches next, and that good ole brunch.  No need to remind you that EVERYTHING is vegan, but reminded you anyways ;)
<review# 2413,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2011,10/23/2011,202,243,8,11,11>Why I Love Taylor's Kitchen: A NovelAuthor's Note: I took my husband here for a celebratory dinner. I knew it was going to be pricey, but since it was a celebration I knew I was going to order tons and enjoy it (no matter the cost) (wee!). Prologue: I'd always known where Taylor's was, I guess. It was one of those neighborhood restaurant with a small, awkward parking lot (they probably get a lot of n'hood bikers/walkers) that just seemed  so rooted in place. Walking in, I would have known I was in tony neighborhood in CA even if I had been blindfolded.Chapter One: Luckily, we had a reservation (the neighborhood loves this one, so if you go on a Friday night you'll need one too.) and were seated promptly - a cute table by the window. We would see nearly a dozen denizens walking their dogs past our spot - adorable! Our waitress came over to take our orders. Wine? Looking over the two page wine list and gazing at the corner wine bar, I knew I had to say yes. She graciously allowed me three samples before I made my decision - the smokiest cab - and she brought my husband a wine that hadn't even been listed.Chapter Two: With my western, smoky wine, my dinner plate was an easy selection - the ribeye. My husband chose the lamb shank - perhaps, I thought, because shank is such a fun word to pronounce. Shank. Pleased by the choices, we hardly had to wait before receiving our salads (a fancy night, I told you). I got the beet salad on the rec of our waitress (mind-blowing) and the one with almonds (wondrous). Chapter #@!#: Oh, oh my, I'm sorry, I forgot where I was. The ribeye was just that good. I knew it was going to be great when I watched one of the chefs run across to Taylor's Market to grab a fresh cut and it was probably the best cut of meat I've ever had. Goddamn.Chapter 5: My husband loved his shank, although he ate plenty of my ribeye as well.  Lucky for him (and his fingers), I love him more than I loved my ribeye.Chapter 6: The desserts were oh, so tempting, but we were stuffed by our meals. We did order a pleasant meal-ender of peppermint tea. They were not sure they had any, but Taylor's Kitchen does provide and they were able to end the meal delightfully.Epilogue: The next week, we returned, but, oh fortuitous day, they were having an "open house". They weren't open for food, but they had free apps set up at stations and $3 glasses of wine (the market next-door also had oodles of samples). On the back cover:Taylor's Kitchen/Market has won my heart. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? YES. Go treat yourself! Details inside.THE END.

I was really impressed with the atmosphere of the place. Dark red walls, detailed gold ceiling, really neat place. I was also happy to see that the tables were reserved for those who were dining, as I am sure we wouldn't have been seated right away if it was just a free for all.I ordered the ever so popular cheeseburger with fries and a Horse Neck, which is a bourbon based cocktail. I was disappointed with the drink. It TASTED really sweet and gingery, which would be great if I were an 18 year old girl. I guess I was expecting more bite to this gentleman's cocktail, which they charge $8 for. I could be a little bias though because I usually like my drinks to be more like gasoline so I will let it slide, but come on, don't take a whiskey drink and give it fairy wings.The burger was great, but a bit overrated considering the hype. To me, if you want to serve a burger nobody can forget, make sure the bun is awesome. It's never about the buns anymore and that needs to change. The fries, however, were amazingly badass! My experience was definitely worth the $20 I paid, and I can say I will return to grab a happy hour special sometime.

I had a half of a roasted turkey and half of a chicken curry salad sandwich.  I loved both.  The roasted turkey was crazy decadent with brie on nicely toasted foccacia bread.  See what I mean by extra cardio? Gawddamn it was good.  The chicken curry salad sandwich was great too.  I've always loved chicken curry salads and, well, it makes a great sandwich on a terrific baguette.  This reminded me of the time I tried to reverse engineer a chicken curry salad making about a pound with $25 worth of ingredients when you can buy it for $6.99 a pound at the deli.   Economy of scale lesson learned.  So anyway, the major disclaimer is that the owner actually brought me these sandwiches to my work for free.   He thought this thread (yelp.com/topic/elk-grove)  I started was funny and actually brought me sandwiches.   Will Brett do this for you?  He's super nice, but I'm guessing not.  Gas is $4.15 a gallon and he probably has more important stuff to do, running 2 restaurants and all.  If you think that influenced my review try the sandwiches.  I dare you to tell me they suck.   I assure you, they don't.  The owner told me that Baguettes is soon to be open on weekends so, corned beef and pastrami sandwiches, I've got my eye on you guys.  Your days are numbered.  I can't wait.  This one gets the DO stamp of approval.  I'd take my mom there.
<review# 2418,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/16/2011,10/18/2011,361,68,6,21,16>Ever heard of this place? Most have not. In fact, it's not really a real restaurant, it's actually a cooking lab that's part of a culinary school! They're only open for lunch and they have rotating menus every couple of months or so, depending on enrollment. So basically, you'd have to check in to see when the Menu changes and if they're open. They're ONLY open for lunch and Mon - Wed of most weeks, when school is in session.Sound like too many hurdles? Well, the good news is, you get an experience here that you wouldn't anywhere else and you get top quality food for fast food prices, literally! All entrees/desserts are made fresh daily from scratch and for the most part, taste amazing! I've gone many times now and tried many dishes and I have to say, these fancy dinners for $5-$7 is definitely worth it. Also, if you leave a tip, all tip goes into a scholarship fund that goes to the students, so you're supporting the students as well!! The name Muse is what they call their creations that they let you sample each time you eat here. Some creations are actually pretty good. The place is somewhat small but has great ambiance for a cooking lab. So if you plan to come here, try to make a reservation! I've introduced this place to a few friends and they've loved it! If you haven't tried it, you're missing out!

<review# 2420,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/1/2010,6/21/2010,88,30,13,11,9>Bar review onlyDebo empezar en español porque el nombre de esto restaurante esta dicho como en esta idioma. Como así: ¡Vive!No Spanish? It makes absolutely NO difference. You can speak Klingon and nobody would know as long as the music was playing. Nobody will hear you, because they have the LOUDEST MARIACHIS in the ENTIRE UNIVERSE. And they make them play INSIDE instead of out on the plaza where they would sound absolutely fantastic. Someone was doubtless worried that they would not be audible, because they gave the lead vocal a microphone and an amp. If the room were six times wider, maybe playing inside would work. As it is, the sound exits the trumpets reverberates off the walls and enters your brain, where it jams all auditory processing. It doesn't do wonders for enjoying the food or drink either. And with all that bouncing off the walls, the sound gets a bit fuzzy too. The noise even caused my fourth star to explode (causing even more noise). So, down to three for great Tequila.I didn't interact much with the staff, so I can't even tell if they were nice or welcoming. Blame the Mariachis.Being a Mexican bar, they do have a nice selection of Tequilas. I had a wonderful shot of Casa Noble reposado with a slice of lime and a slice of orange. Forget margaritas, this is the way to go. Forget Patron, too - this stuff blows it away. And you can still taste it over the music.The nachos were indeed excellent. Fresh guacamole, grilled chicken, frijoles, some spice to keep things interesting. The chips in the nachos, strangely enough, seemed to be thicker and crispier than the chips they serve with salsa.Get here by bike, skateboard, light rail... anything but by car. There's no easy or cheap nearby parking solution. I had to park about eight blocks away and hoof it. Not necessarily a bad thing, since it did burn off that Tequila shot.If they weren't located in one of the most inconvenient locations for non-midtown dwellers, and they could manage to reduce the decibels to less than the deck of an aircraft carrier in full battle, I might even become a regular. As it is, getting there is too much a struggle.

Here, I get a freakin' pound of the same stuff for $3.19 on sale! They also sell a variety of baking flour (perfect for vegan baking), and offer a huge selection of rice and nuts! They even had non-dairy chocolate chips! I've never seen a place that allows you to make as much peanut or almond butter as you want, or has a fridge section dedicated to soy yogurt. This place has really opened my eyes to let me see that good natural food doesn't have to be expensive. You just have to know the right place to get it.

It is a family affair, with various brothers and kids helping with the chores and cooking. The owner is really friendly and the food is delicious. Not as good as my Lita's, but then again you can't beat that old lady. They have tostones, moros y cristianos, papas fritas & rellenas, lechon, etc. etc. etc. All fresh and housemade. Food is cheap and I'm excited that a legit Cuban restaurant has showed up in the Sacramento Metro area.  This is a must stop.P.S. "Iron Beer" is not real beer.  Hopefully they get a liquor license soon...

I see you, your pseudo-Buddhist names and your $3 per bowl of white rice, and Noble Vegetarian and I are judging you. JUDGING YOU.This place reminds me of Sundays spent at my temple, eating good vegetarian food cooked by either the nuns or the lay people that came to volunteer their services. The food is pure and simple. Their spring rolls are fresh, their vegetarian fish sauce is so close to the real thing, you'd swear that it is, and their canh chua (pineapple sweet and sour) soup isn't named 'wish fulfilling bulls---." The service is great. I notice many regulars eating here, and most are Vietnamese families. This is a good thing because this place is definitely a Vietnamese establishment, and their best tasting dishes reflect this. Oh and to the lady that treated me like I was her daughter and said, "Eat this. It's better for you": WILL YOU BE MY SACRAMENTO MOTHER? ): Tip: I highly recommend the pineapple, sweet and sour soup with the vegetarian fish claypot. It's a staple in every Vietnamese vegetarian establishment. If they do these two dishes wrong, it's game over for me. However, Noble Vegetarian does it just right.

<review# 2427,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/23/2010,6/14/2010,209,356,4,12,8>This is by far my favorite pizza place in Sacramento. It's right down the street from the Colonial Theater on Stockton Blvd, maybe not the best area but so what? If anything it keeps the yuppies away. I have friends who live down Stockton Blvd and regularly visit some of the stores and thrift stores in the area, so it seems like I'm around a lot and nothing bad has ever happened to me, my friends, or my car. I think the area LOOKS worse than it really is most of the time. Luigi's in a cozy, rather dim little restaurant with picnic style tables and some kitchy decor. There is a big screen TV, usually featuring a game of some sort, and a few arcade games in the corner. Luigi himself is usually flitting around behind the counter, seeming to simultaneously greet me, remember my name, ask if I want the usual, make recommendations, and keep his kitchen running. He employs mostly young men who are all friendly, helpful, and constantly washing their hands (something I personally like to see). I have never even come close to experiencing poor service, in person or on the phone. I've never waited more than 15 minutes for a pizza and they always arrive just how I pictured them. My stomach is growling right now just thinking about it. The crust is the perfect thickness and has a great flavor (like fresh sourdough from San Francisco) and hold up under the heaping amount of fresh toppings. I'm pretty sure Luigi's makes their own sausage and they are always cutting up fresh vegetables. The marinara sauce is rich and slightly tangy and we usually ask for a side of it whenever we get garlic bread to munch on while we eat. Pro tip: TRY THE GARLIC BREAD. It's buttery and crispy, just like your mom would have made if she had been any good at making garlic bread. The prices are beyond reasonable. Luigi's is cheaper than most other pizza places that serve you crap (cough cough DOMINO'S cough cough) and well worth the money. They also have a few beers on tap, and good pasta. Drawbacks? My major problem is that the bathroom door doesn't lock. I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation for this, but it makes me really uncomfortable knowing that I could get burst in on at any second if someone forgets to knock or doesn't hear me yell that it's occupied. I usually make my husband or a friend stand outside and guard the door. I honestly can't even bring myself to take off a star for something so stupid, but I thought I should warn you anyway.Long story short, if you are at a loss for what to get for dinner, go with Luigi's on Stockton. They don't deliver, but if you call it's usually only a 15 minute wait to come pick up your pizza, or have it ready by the time you get there.
<review# 2428,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2010,6/13/2010,87,127,2,26,8>So I like to call this my secret store. But I guess I gotta stop calling it that since I'm sharing it with y'all. Don't let the "employee store" scare you away. You enter through the gates where the security guard asks for your name. You give it, and you're granted access to their "employee store". Follow the building heading right and you'll see this little awning w/ a ramp entrance. It's tiny. If you drive too fast you'll miss it. Inside it feels like a small warehouse...concrete floors w/ boxes of canned goods. Cream of mushroom goes for 53cents each. They also carry Pepperidge Farms cookies...ranging from $1.25 or $1.85. If you head towards the very back they have some quick sale items which are about to expire. Got a HUGE box of cookies for $5. Luckily my bf is a JFJ (Junk Food Junkie) and he'll kill that box in no time. Apparently Godiva Chocolates is a part of Campbell's also. In the refrigerated section they have some boxes of chocolates...cheaper than retail but it's still pricey. An average box of truffles reg. $32 was on sale for $22. On occasion they'll have a bag of "oops" chocolates for really cheap like $8. There was none on the day I came. Waaah!!! Oh! And a flat of V8 or tomato juice is only $3 or so. The women working inside are usually quiet and don't seem friendly but you merely need to strike up a convo with them. They've very nice and helpful. Oh yeah, this place is cash only. But, if you forget, there's a credit union directly across the street if u don't mind the $2.50 fee.

I brought my cat Egon to see Dr. Bailiff after continuous respiratory problems got a "maybe this is just how it is" from my veterinarian when he was at the end of his list of possibilities. Not wanting my cat to continue to suffer, I asked for a specialist referral. I'm so glad I did. Dr. Bailiff is a walking vault of knowledge and immediately started approaching my cat's problems from angles my vet hadn't considered. I could fill an entire notebook page with information he provided in a 5-minute phone call.  Several tests, food changes and medications later, we've found a combination that has ended his respiratory attacks AND has stopped his vomiting. Yes, it was expensive, but my cats are part of the family and worth the cost to keep them well. Just hearing Egon's loud, brash, old-man meow without him deteriorating into a coughing fit reminds me that it was money well spent.

Their mimosas are huge (seriously, they serve them in wine glasses) and they are $5 all day... another reason it was hard to stop. They definitely live up to their name, as they have several delicious and creative mimosa creations along with a bottle of champagne and caraff of OJ option for only $19.95. I also saw quite a few people order their Bloody Mary, which was hard to resist bc they were huge, only $6.50 and came with a slice of bacon.Their menu was also full of options. They have everything you could ever want for brunch including a favorite of mine (and what I feel like is a hard to find option), crepes! I decided just to go with the fitness skillet (eggs, potatoes, spinach, zucchini, and tomatoes) since I was probably already drinking my daily calories in mimosas. It was pretty tasty for a "healthy" option but I kind of regretted not going for one of their crepes or benedicts.... guess I will make up for going low cal next time with my bacon bloody mary and my hollandaise covered benedict lol. My only (slight) complaint - The service was definitely on the slow side. Our waitress came right over when we were seated to take our drink orders but it took a good 20+ minutes for us to get our first drink and food took even longer. My friends and I took the time to just hang out and chat so It really wasn't a big deal but just a heads up to expect a wait.
<review# 2431,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2013,10/19/2013,213,318,10,11,10>A great neighborhood spot. Clark's Corner is on the corner (duh.) of 56 and Folsom Blvd. great location with a small parking lot, plus plenty of street parking (just watch out for the 2 hour limit during the week). It's nice place to meet friends coming from the 'surbs, they can get off HWY 50 at the Folsom Blvd exit (no getting lost in midtown!).I've been here twice now and I can honestly say I'm a huge fan. They have 2 rooms slightly separated by a very small walk way. The bar walls are filled chalk board paint, with food & beer specials, it's really cute idea and makes the room feel instantly "homie and comfortable". .. The back part of the restaurant is darker with a stone fireplace and one larger T.V. in case your into watching sports while enjoying a delicious meal...which I am!My first visit was strictly drinks at the bar, service was good even though it was really busy but we had to keep going back and forth to the bar. My second trip was this Sunday for Yelp's Elite Passport to East Sacramento event. Our Sriracha Ponzu Chicken Wings were juicy, the "sauce" was more of an Asian inspired glaze, which was different and had good flavor. Personally, I think they can take the heat up a little, but I'm crazy like that. We also had tuna tartar, hush puppies and truffle popcorn. A warning, the truffle popcorn is addictive, and is impossible to stop eating!Clarks has a really nice patio, the tarp cover has beautiful white string lights, and comfortable seating. The GM came over to introduce herself and mentioned that you can bring dogs on the patio SCORE! Brunch without Man's best friends is a brunch I don't want to sit through!To recap: great location, nice parking, great layout inside, friendly staff, good food, nice bar area and PET friendly patio? It's like they've been reading my dream journal.
<review# 2432,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2013,10/18/2013,376,118,6,13,8>Wow, this restaurant is so unique and serves such delicious entrees and pastries.  It is a small little place with such character and charm. Their staff is one of the friendliest I have ever had the pleasure of meeting and I enjoy every visit to Allez.As far as food, I have not had much...but...I am OBSESSED with their garlic green beans. I would eat them for lunch and dinner daily because they are so wonderful. They are a must have for any visit.Also, their pastries are one of a kind and you can see the heart that is put into each and every one of them. They have a delicious chocolate mousse and really fresh mini fruit custard pies. If you like desserts, Allez is perfect.
<review# 2433,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2013,10/17/2013,318,132,20,27,27>Feeling fruity? How about spritzy?Wait a minute...how does one feel spritzy?! Well, go on over to D.V. and you'll find out!Make sure you've got this tasting room on your checklist if you happen to be at the Old Sugar Mill. Or do as I do and just go around to all of them! The more wine the merrier!D.V.'s Frizzante is the reason you need to get over to this tasting room. Their Frizzante is the perfect summer wine to quench your thirst and cool you off! It's D.V.'s take on a Muscato that carries that fruit-forward style with a spritzy spunk to it, without being too sweet. You aren't going to find this unique wine just anywhere because it's produced specially by D.V. It's great for a party, a picnic, or just a night at home! Warning, it's easy to polish off a bottle, so plan accordingly! Other perks of this spot include knowledgeable and friendly staff and other tasty wines. I was able to learn about their wines and gain some wino facts the last time I was there, but sadly, my brain got frizzy with the spritzy and I forgot! Ooops! Better go back for my lesson!
<review# 2434,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/16/2013,10/16/2013,146,55,8,11,11>When you're traveling West on the Business 80 and exit on J Street, you can't help but notice Luis Jr.'s and the business' large open windows and brightly lit business sign. Every day I would take that exit and see the diners looking at me from out the window, I always wondered how this place was and made the promise to myself to try it out someday.My promise was met when I was scheduled for a training by the UC Davis Extension in the Sutter Square Galleria (the building it is located in). I was thrilled to know I had training there and was excited and ready to try some good ol' Mexican food at Luis Jr.'s.Did I just see Pancho here (from Pancho's on Broadway)?!?! No, it wasn't him...rather, it was his older brother. After talking to him, I discovered Luis Jr. and his father are related to Pancho's and Kico's...all brothers who shared a passion in the kitchen. All of the brothers, but one, opened restaurants and were able to lead successful businesses in Mexican cuisine.Lets's get to the food...The menu items are a bit pricey, and even the lunch specials will run you close to $10. Usually lunch specials are called specials for a reason: they're a bang for your buck and you can only get it during the lunch hour. Here, they offer the "lunch special" at all times of the day, but will add $1 if after a certain time. I know this is not chinese food, where you can get a true lunch special for $4.95, but I expected the lunch menu to start at about $6.50 or so. I decided to try their Carnitas enchilada lunch special. If you read my other Mexican cuisine reviews, I almost always try something with Carnitas in it because I believe in a restaurant only if they can serve me up some good Carnitas! Luis Jr.'s did not fail me in that area. The Carnitas was deliciously flavored, salted and served in big, tender chunks with very little, if any, fat. I definitely appreciate a good Carnitas! The beans and rice were ok. I liked the consistency of the rice: not too soggy or hard, and held together nicely by the lard. The beans, on the other hand, tasted like there was too much lard added. I almost tasted lard only, and really missed out on the true flavor of ther refried beans.The flour tortillas are exactly like Pancho's. I'm sure they use the same recipe, they are quite tasty and keep you wanting more.Overall, the food was good, but with the prices being as high as they are, I would much rather return to Pancho's for the same taste, same tortillas, but cheaper bill.
<review# 2435,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2013,10/15/2013,271,222,10,15,13>This place may not look the fanciest but the tasty food makes up for it!  I thought it was only known for it's exotic meats (Ostrich, Buffalo, Roo, etc...) but I love just the regular ol' burger, fries and shakes!  The menu is really large but I've tried several things and I liked them all.  It's like a mini State Fair menu.  Some of our favorites are the Mushroom burger (if you add cheese and bacon it's just that much better), Philly steak sandwich, fries, onion rings, soft serve cone and milk shakes are a must!  I've also had the deep fried burrito, "k"orn dog, tacos, chicken strip, etc...  I have always been happily satisfied.  They also have a menu for you Vegi Folks!   Something that sticks in my brain after eating at Cookies is the bun of the burgers!  DELISH!  Tip:  Perfect spot to get something to eat if you are visiting a patient at Sutter Memorial Hospital...  Eat here before you try the hospital cafeteria!
<review# 2436,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2013,10/14/2013,70,200,9,13,12>The name "Bud's Buffet" might be a bit deceiving because it's not technically a buffet. They do, however, make one helluva sandwich. My favorite is their roast beef. The sandwich itself is a good size, but it is kind of pricey for the size of the sandwich, but you're getting quality roast beef here, ladies and gentlemen. They will literally carve off the roast beef right in front of you right after you order it. Now, that's subway fresh! Ha! You can either dine in or take the sandwich to go, but during the hot summer days, I prefer to take it back to the office and eat it there because it is very warm in there. Granted, they've got a few fans running up in there, but it's still a little too warm for my liking. Come early or come a little later during lunch time because there are a bunch of state workers that flock in here which sometimes cause the lines to extend to the entrance.
<review# 2437,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/11/2013,10/13/2013,989,460,7,9,10>I found out about this place from a fellow Yelper. I couldn't stop looking at all her yummy pictures, and knew I had to check this place out for myself.I stopped by for lunch, and this place was packed! A man greeted me, and I was pleasantly surprised by his lovely, French accent. Once seated, I already knew what I wanted to order: the salmon with dill creme fraiche, and creamy brie on lightly toasted french baguette. Once my food arrived, an adorable elderly man next to me glanced over and asked what it was that I had ordered. His wife quickly snapped at him to leave me alone but without hesitation, I told him. He thanked me and it just melted my heart when he turned to his wife and said, "I'm not bothering anyone." Next thing I know, he ordered exactly what I had, too cute.The salmon with the dill creme fraiche was delicious. I wasn't expecting such a huge block of brie, but once I broke it up, it went really well with the salmon. I'm definitely coming back.
<review# 2438,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2013,10/12/2013,640,434,5,14,13>Just got back from a few hours of pampering with a few friends.  I was so lucky to find Sallie and Wind n Willow.  It was my job to plan a day for the three of us since it was a friends birthday.  I called and left a message to see if they could accommodate the three of us at the same time and Sallie called me back and said they could.  We did the ionic foot bath and a infrared sauna along with a massage so it was a really nice way to hang out with girl friends and pamper ourselves. Sallie is very knowledgable and you feel immediately at ease when you walk in.  One of my friends had never had a massage before and Sallie took great care of her. We all compared notes and decided Sallie was by far the best at the massage so if you go, request her.  I will certainly go back and have her give me the massage next time.  The ionic foot soak was different and interesting, I had never done that before and the sauna was not as overpowering as the steam ones so it was doable. I didnt get overly sweaty but did get a good cleanse going on.  I am not sure how long I was in there I think 15 min but it did the job.  I certainly felt refreshed and relaxed when we left.  We even got a parting gift of tea or bath salts, we all opted for various kinds of teas and there were many to chose from. The little shop has such a quaintness about it.  Seems like it used to be a house but the way they have it set up is very nice. You will for sure want to try them out the prices are reasonable and for the service you get it is definitely worth it. Thanks again Sallie you were awesome!
<review# 2439,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2008,1/30/2009,10,21,,14,6>Shige has been cutting fish in Sacramento for something like 25 years, and I've been going to his place (formerly at the corner of Howe and Arden) for almost that long.  Many established sushi chefs in town got their start working for him.The restaurant is quiet and traditional, as Shige is himself.  I eat a LOT of sushi - always trying a new place, and in my opinion, you will not find better quality sushi anywhere in the Sacramento area.If you want to party, yeah, maybe Mikuni is a better choice.  However, if you want the best the Sacramento area has to offer in sushi, do yourself a favor and head over to Shige Sushi.My highest recommendation.
<review# 2440,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2008,1/29/2009,8,31,11,11,6>Well I certainly wouldn't tell you to do your grocery shopping here unless you burn c-notes in your fireplace when it gets chilly out.  (And if you do that,  we need to have a little side conversation because my iPod just died and I'm looking for a replacement, and I'm pretty sure it won't be getting cold for a few months...so ya know, if you have a few lying around...)    ANYWAY, this place is pretty up front about what it is -- a specialty grocer, not your neighborhood Save Mart --  Although they do have a cute little wannabe produce section where everything is beautifully displayed and in season, but it makes Whole Foods look cheap so I have never actually purchased a vegetable there.The deli kills it every time and has to be one of the biggest lures.  The Mexicali is delicious but I don't recommend wearing white while eating because you will be wearing it on your shirt before the meal is over.  And it's nice to know that you can get lingonberry on your sandwhich here and you don't have to look at crappy swedish furniture first, so there's that.  If you are looking for a specialty ingredient they probably have it, or they can order it.  The cheese selection is delectable, and the baked goods case starts whispering sweet nothings in your ear the second you walk through the door.  During the Summer they have misters out on the patio so eating your lunch outside can still actually be enjoyable, and they sell single bottles of just about every specialty beverage you could ask for.  I basically love it there, and if I could live among the crackers and assorted bottles of wine, I could survive for EONS!David Berkley is always a treat as long as you know you are gonna be in for a little wallet violating up front.

Not only can I go on and on about how fantastic Bikram Yoga is, but I love this place. Every instructor is not only professional and helpful, but they are just really great people. You always leave feeling very centered and happy. Each instructor has their own style too, so if you are not sure the first time around check out different class times. If you have never done Bikram and are even remotely interested please go here. Your body and soul are instantly rejuvinated after only a couple classes. I went to a different place in Granite Bay for my first class and the people were stuck up and elitist...I gaurantee you will not feel that vibe here. You will not regret giving it a try. I am fully addicted at this point and have never felt so good inside and out.

I spotted no less than four varieties of bratwurst (raw, smoked, Nuernberger style, and Thueringer/Sheboygan style) and other enticing sausages that beg to be part of my future culinary adventures.

Upon walking in the normal 'please wait to be seated' sign was changed to 'please don't wait to be seated, c'mon on back' or something like that.  I love a place that is so welcoming!  We moseyed on back to the very spacious back patio and had a seat!The service was very friendly as it seems that everyone who works there is just as excited about their restaurant as the patrons who frequent them!  Our orders consisted of a burger, a couple arugula steak salads, a portabella mushroom burger & mac & cheese for the youngin' with us!Everything was quite good.  The burger was cooked just as I had asked, medium-well & they put mouth-watering brown seed mustard on it, mmmmmmm.  The steak salads were crisp & everything tasted mighty fresh!  They put fried garbanzo beans for flair on the salad, which was a nice addition!  I didn't get to try the Portobello burger, but my mom said she was very pleased with it!  Even my little niece loved her mac & cheese.  Oh, and speaking of the children's menu, it is a little lacking on the lunch menu.  This could be because they only just opened, but the ONLY option for her was the mac & cheese.  Parents take note if you have a picky kid=)  One other thing to be aware if you have youngin's, they only have the old fashioned kind of high chair, i.e. No safety belt.  If your kid can't sit up, they'll slide right out.  Just be prepared to hold them!I hear the brunch is to die for, so we made reservations for mother's day there!

Not used to walking into a small Japanese bakery? Have no fear, on the weekends you can find high school kids working the counter who are HAPPY to explain everything to you! New to mochi? Try the peanut butter kind, it's a good introduction.Ah yes...the snow cones. The ice isn't like your regular snow cone, it is shaved VERY fine. No munching on your ice here! They are also the only place I have seen to offer Kintoki. It is a shaved ice with a sugar simple syrup poured over the top with azuki beans in the middle. You might think I'm crazy, "Beans?!?"! But trust me, they are sweet and creamy. Definitely worth a try. You will be surprised.

Anytime I see an Original Pancake House, I get a little giddy and do a wiggly dance in my seat 'cause I know I'm store for hot coffee in cute china cups, fluffy itty bitty pancakes, and people who don't shy away from real butter and heavy cream. How can you not love a place that give you cream and not little half n' half containers? And dutch baby pancakes? And chotchskies? I enjoy pulling out a paper and relaxing with a short stack, an endless cup of coffee and great daytime lighting. I hadn't had the time to get a little quality time for myself in months so I carved out some desperately needed 40 minutes and some even more desperately needed Eggs Benedict. I walked in and was immediately greeted by the tall and friendly host, sat at a bench and like magic, a cup of coffee was in my hand within seconds. Poof! My server Barbara? was lightning quick, friendly and could sense my coffee levels from half a room away. She's amazing! I ordered the Eggs Michael Benedict (a version of Eggs Benedicts but substituted with sausage patties and mushroom gravy.) It was like eating breakfast and dinner all layered on top of each other. The gravy wasn't too thick and doughy like some white gravies tend to be, the mushroom pieces were generous and not your standard Button or Cremini either-a nice touch. I hesitated on telling Barbara to cancel the standard 3 pancakes that accompany the eggs, but I totally was engrossed in my magazine and forgot. I'm so glad I didn't open my big mouth because those pancakes, the whipped (not rock hard solid) butter and HOT HOT syrup was a sensation in my mouth! The involuntary noises could have put Meg Ryan's character in "When Harry Met Sally" to shame. Being a glutton right before summer's bikini season isn't the smartest idea, but every once in awhile, you've got to feed your body and your soul with good food and some quality time for smutty Maxim and Esquire magazines. I'm glad I did. :-)

Yellow on the outside, white on the inside: Gives off Asian vibe, but fairly Caucasian at heart. By no means does this mean I don't absolutely adore this place, whether blackout drunk or completely sober...it's always good. It may not be as authentic as somewhere in South Sac or on Broadway, but it gets the job done well.The freshness of their food is a huge key factor. I'm pretty sure, I hope at least, they cook all orders fresh. Simple in fashion, order at the register, take a huge number thingy, grab a seat, and people watch for days...until the waiter interrupts and brings you sizzling goodness.Beef Chow Fun is  something I hold dear to my heart, if you can get it right then you deserve five stars in my book. But not only do they make this traditional dish with stellar execution, I don't think I've ever received a bad dish :)If I'm feeling like a fatty, I also order the Cream Cheese Wontons and the Mongolian Beef. It's always a huge internal conflict between the Mongolian Beef & Beef Chow Fun, it's not fair...I should be able to have half & half...too bad I don't live in a perfect world.Just like their other restaurant, this one is connected to a club (The Park, duh), so this is epic people watching. Watching the hoochie mama's trying to sweet talk their way in for free or the drunk douche getting thrown out, it always makes for fun people watching...unless you're on the other side ;)The manager (with the hat) has always been a sweetie, as are most of the staff here. They are always accommodating and helpful. Besides the bouncers, who man entrances that go into the club - they have their "I'll-bash-your-face" look on and aren't very friendly. Oh yeah, if you have to use the bathroom and its club hours, don't forget to have your ID ready - they will keep it until you come back...just in case you try to sneak in to drop it likes its hot!Simple, tasty, and fresh...just like I like my pseudo Twinkies to be ;)

And I think the bill was something like $56.  Love that. Our server was amazing.  She was patient, offered up suggestions, and very attentive despite being seated outside at the furthest end of the patio.I have no seen the light and am excited to try their entire menu!

After months of searching, I've finally found a place that I can say does not disappoint when it comes to their ramen!I've tried the Kimchi Ramen and the Tonkatsu Ramen. The Tonkatsu Ramen is my favorite. The broth is good and the noodles are cooked the way I like it. The Kimchi ramen did have a lot of kimchi but I wasn't impressed with the spice level. I guess I should go to a Korean restaurant for that. I'm not saying Akebono has the BEST ramen I've ever had... but it does satisfy my ramen cravings. Hence, the four stars. Service is always attentive and the food comes out very quickly too.As an added bonus, how can you turn away from this place when the majority of their customers are Japanese. Then you KNOW it's legit =P Overall, I would highly recommend stopping by for some ramen, or even to try any number of their dishes on their extensive menu.

Now, being Indians ourselves, we tend to be quite picky when it comes to Indian food. This place came HIGHLY recommended from friends and from you fellow Yelpers :)When we came in, there was only one other table there, but by the time we left 5 tables had been sat. Our waiter was probably young enough to be my son, but he was totally polite, and even put up with my dad's dumb humor LOL. We ordered the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, alloo muttar, bhindi (not on the menu but order it, it's the bomb!), and the Lamb Josh (because my bro in law's name is Josh haha).The rice that comes with each dish is tasty, and you wouldn't think the, what seems small amount of food in the tiny dishes, would be enough for 9 people, we had three boxes of left overs! The vegetable sampler appetizer was huge and the dipping sauces were plentiful and spicy!I can't wait to come for their buffet someday. My favorite dish by far? The chicken tikka masala. Spicy, tons of taste, and went so well with the rice. Next time I will have a mango lassi and some raita too.I want to seriously try everything on this menu! It's huge!!!

During a stop at the cafe I was in the mood for soup. My sister ordered some noodle dish (she always orders noodles), my boyfriend got teriyaki over noodles and the kid picked chicken satay (an appetizer, but that's what he likes). We're the kind of family that likes to sample each others plates to see which we like best. So as the adorable staff brought out our dishes we took little nibbles. The noodle dishes were really good, but I was enjoying my soup the most.  It had a nice sesame flavor and the meatballs weren't the rubbery kind you get at pho shops, but more soft and gave the soup a comforting home cooked feel. My son's dish came out last and when it did we all stopped mid-bite, mid-chat, mid-slurp and stared at it.  I know each of us was thinking the same thing, "I should have got that! Luckily he's a light eater and there will be leftovers.... mwahahaha." Needless to say that when he devoured a skewer and declared he was finished the vultures swooped in and cleaned his plate. Mmm-mm!If you're in Old Sacramento and don't feel up to fish, burgers, or hot dogs I would suggest Indo Cafe. The staff are great, there is indoor and outdoor seating, and lots of yummy food to choose from. A word of warning: if you sit outdoors close to the main walkway prepare to have people stop and gawk at your food while you're eating.
<review# 2455,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2012,8/4/2012,287,110,14,16,15>I find myself at Press more and more lately. So much so that it's found its way onto my list of Top 3 Preferred Mid-Range Dining Spots in the area. All the restaurants on this list have amazing head chefs, stellar service, and great ambience, but, for some reason, I find myself at Press far more than any other restaurant in its class.Press is perfect for so many occasions: a romantic date with the lover, group dinners with your best buds, or casual drinks with friends. Hell, you can even fill up on tapas and drinks without breaking the bank if you work it right! With so many different dining/hang out options you really can't go wrong. Plus, I've always received top notch service from ALL the staff. From bartender extraordinaire, Scott, who makes a mean "Girl With the Ginger Tattoo" to Chef David English who's not afraid to set up tables and always stops by to make sure everything is splendid--trust me, these people don't miss a trick. Okay, okay, enough with all that. How about the food? Absolutely delicious every time. I usually get fish entrees and they're always flaky, succulent, and flavorful. Even the Tapas (screaming deal!), are always well-thought out and served perfectly. I'm not usually one to eat too much red meat, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Press' Hanger steak. It's been known to make grown men get all emotional and shit. Yes, it's that good!

As for their famous banh mi...even with all the rave reviews, I couldn't get myself to shell out $9.25 when I could go straight down Stockton Blvd and get 3 of those delicious authentic sandwiches for the same price!   But, darn you Juno's for making some tasty food!  I just know someday I'll have to give in and indulge in a $9 J Street banh mi.
<review# 2458,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/1/2012,8/1/2012,71,127,15,27,25>Never heard of this place until last night, meeting customers of mine from the San Juan school district. Cool vibe, excellent service and Cal-Italian* dishes were creative and tasty. I recommend checking it out. They had a wine tasting menu and good beers on tap (I couldn't resist ordering a "Five O'Clock Shadow Black Lager" based on name alone).The handful of Yelp reviews I read before I rushed out of the house mentioned that you needed to order at the counter and have the food brought to you. I thought this made the place sound more casual than it appears and could explain the 3-star average. The good news is that they now offer full service, at least at dinner, which I imagine makes all the difference.Our party of 4 shared two apps: the bruschetta with brie, pear and arugula (yum) and polenta fries (double yum). For entrees, I had the pizza special with pepperoni, mozz., aged goat cheese and chili oil drizzle. The others had: "the-most-tender-ever" pork tenderloin special; the risotto with bacon and carmelized Brussels sprouts; and a giant plate of lasagne. Entrees all priced under $20 and portions were generous. No one left disappointed!I might give this place 5-stars simply for being such a pleasant surprise -- hidden in an unassuming strip mall featuring stores like "The Moth Hole." Totally unexpected in a good way. Four stars for now, since I've only been the one time but doing my part to raise the average.The decor is on the rustic Mediterranean side: airy, vaulted ceiling, dark wood bar and booths, large-tile floors. They do have a TV playing sports but seating in the bar area is limited. The story goes that the restaurant name does come from the '50s teen idol and is run by Fabian's relatives. In fact, when I looked up at the wall next to our booth, his eternally-young mug was smiling back at me from a framed black & white photo. Our party met shortly after 5pm and by 7pm the joint was jumpin' -- with a din almost drowning out the jazzy background music.* I think I just made up "Cal-Italian," but maybe it was planted subliminally from my past. Anyway, the menu is more modern and not as heavy even though there are a lot of traditional Italian dishes. Most are pulled off with a California twist. Hence, *Cal-Italian*!
<review# 2459,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/6/2007,8/24/2007,1251,575,12,14,9>Leery and my heart full of doubts - I visited "Oz Korean BBQ".  Hunger rules, and I was hungry - and Korean food was the calling but on a day when one is in Stockton - -  one has a true dilemma.  45 minutes to Sacramento?  1.5 hours to SF?  Which to do?WHICH TO DO?By nature, I am lazy.Up to this point, I had always made the trek to SF for my Korean food kick, or cooked it myself.  But on this day - - that just wasn't an appealing option, and with gas prices (not to mention my car that would be called a house in some third world countries), it was to be one helluva pricey dinner.So off to Sacramento we go.What kind of Korean place names their restaurant OZ?No Korean I know ever THINKS of OZ never mind names a BBQ place "Oz".  This cannot be good Korean food, I think.Upon approach, I make a mental note that Oz doesn't look like any other Korean restaurant I have seen.  It could be a really dinky Outback... or even a really high-end Denny's... and big enough to be either but like I said, it didn't look like any other "Korea Garden" type of restaurant.Enter the doors.  Wowsies.... large waiting room, and big screen TVs on the wall....... I peer to my left and notice a rather HUGE dining area, with many, many tables with grills on them, and some scattered tables throughout for those not interested in grilling.  It's set up with a very western aura.... but the scent in the air is unmistakably Korean.  NICE!Hostess approaches.  Young Korean girl..... very polite, obviously bilingual, and while Korean was her first language, English is a close second.  We get seated.Now - things start to look up.  Menu looks good.... it is really crowded on this Sunday evening (this is last week) and some are groups of Korean old men who had spent all day golfing, some are young families out to dine, and others are people from other walks of life who are out for good food..... interesting.First - I'll say that one additional star is added JUST for the impeccable service that we got from our waitress.  SUPER nice, friendly, helpful - and just pleasant.  As my reviews always indicate, I am big on service.  Don't be rude.  I can be ruder right back.  I can make your life hell if you piss me off.  :-)Back to my point though - - she was really just a beautiful lady with a truly pleasant demeanor, and only enhanced the meal.Now, to the food.We ordered two varieties of meat - -  the Oz Galbi (marinated ribs) and Tokyo Pork (sam gyub sal).  Both tasted pretty darn good!  Out in the middle of Sacramento somewhere, off the 5, I was having galbi that was at least equal to many galbis in SF or SJ - - and in some cases, much better than some galbi joints! Hmm.Wow.First, Waterboy.... then Oz......... Sac is looking better and better!We also ordered the "dwaen jang jjee gae" (soybean stew).  This is one of those dishes you try just to gauge how their cooking in general is, aside from the meat.BLECH!  YUCK!  GAG GAG.... this ain't it.  WTF is that?!!?  Now, granted, my taste in this stuff is on the high end of things, IMHO haha, but I know children who can make a tastier soybean stew.  What on earth?  STICK TO THE MEAT!!!!One additional note:  OZ makes some really DELICIOUS ban-chan (side dishes).  They give you a lot of it, and almost each dish is extremely tasty.  Not only did we eat a lot of meat but we CHOWED on those side dishes, asking for many more servings of it.  They also served some of the freshest "ssam" (red leaf lettuce) I have ever had.... almost like they have a field out back.  Soft, fresh, and tender.Another ding for me, though, is that they do not have jalapeno peppers available but rather the big, fresh but utterly non-spicy Korean peppers available.  Aigo~!  One star OFF!  ;o)Would I go here again?YOU BET.But now I know - - I would go for the meat.  Forget the soups, fishes, etc.  Go somewhere else to eat that.  Go here for the MEAT.  In LA, I'd rate this place a 3-star.  It doesn't compare to most LA galbi places.... but then most places in Korea can't rate to LA galbi places!In SF, the rating would probably stay at 4 stars.But in all fairness, in the middle of Sacramento with nothing else to eat - -  Oz delivers - and then some!  I'm tempted to give it 5-stars but like I said - - the soups being all wrong, and no jalapeno peppers........... ??Next time, I will just have to ziploc a bag full of little serrano chiles and jalapenos to make myself happy while chowing.  Oi ~~~  I must be getting old.There was a time I would have rolled my eyes at someone even making such a "fobby" suggestion - - and now, it's come out of my own fingertips.....  I'm officially a US-born FOB.  Bite me!

Mix of quintessential Japanese and organic California items; just what you'd expect a Northern CA Japanese American store to be.Well-tended, extensive produce department; fresh cut flowers; large selection of rice cookers and utensils; wide array of Japanese candies, cookies, crackers, condiments, frozen items; fabulous non-odorous seafood display. I was there too early in the morning to enjoy the artworks from the sushi chef, who makes over 200 rolls a day (Tuesday through Saturday). Poi delivery is Wednesday, later morning/midday. They sell out quickly.If you like Japanese foods, or if you simply like to shop in a clean, well-organized store, you must Go, Speed Racer, Go! Looking for Power Ranger chopsticks? Here. Looking for Hello Kitty Pocky? Here. Dizzying array of shiny happy packaged goods with anthropomorphic foods and animals that make me squeal like a little schoolgirl. Can't wait to give my kids the savory/salty animal shaped crackers with the names of the animals printed in English on them. Our 4.5 y.o. son/new reader will undoubtedly be entertained by these.The building was intentionally built towards the street to create a more welcoming/aesthetic appearance. This is in contrast to the rest of the area developed in the '50's and '60's with gigantic blacktop lots and barren concrete strip malls. This can, however, create a bit of a parking dilemma when the store is busy. The Oto family bent over backwards trying to accommodate the concerns of the neighbors and community while building the store, so go in and show them some love. You'll be eating well too.

<review# 2462,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2007,8/20/2007,164,248,4,3,8>I took my kid and my Sheltie here a couple of weeks ago for some exercises and socialization. My Sheltie, typical of his breed, mostly stayed right next to me, except to sniff at a few humans, and ignored the other dogs. My son, on the other hand, had a great time petting the 20 other dogs at the park, and allowing any dog who was interested to lick his face. He seems not to have picked up any parasites or flesh eating bacteria from this exposure. Probably he has built up a resistance from letting strange dogs lick him from the time he could walk. Anyway, this park has separate areas for dogs under 20 pounds and over 20 pounds. They both have lots of room to run and agility equipment. There are chairs/benches to sit on, and poop-picker-upper bags are provided. Dog owners are a friendly group, so my son and I had a nice time socializing, even if my dog wasn't too thrilled. My only complaint is the lack of shade, so I wouldn't recommend this place on a 100 degree day.

<review# 2464,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2007,8/17/2007,45,6,7,13,10>Metro! Not just for the guys, ladies welcomed also.At many electronic shops (especially chain types like Radio Shack) somehow I turn into "Invisible Girl" and pretty much ignored for the most part, but not at Metro. When I was a PC repair tech I went there a lot. I still go there for parts and when I need A/V accessories, since in most cases they will have exactly what I need and if not will usually know where to get it. And the prices are usually pretty good if you need adapters like BNC/RCA or specialty breakout cables. The owners/employees are helpful with all ranges of what customer needs are from walking someone through "I need something to hook this thing with this other thing" to "D-SUB15 coupler female/female" (and they've always been able to tell if I'm in a hurry and pointed me right to it).  And they have never pushed on upselling/extra items I don't need.  And once when I about to head over there to replace a processor fan I ran into a problem with a stuck/stripped screw and didn't want to force it off and cause damage. So I called them for advice and they said to bring it over and we worked on it all together with gently separating the old fan from the heatsink and processor. *That's* service. I just wish it stayed open a little bit later in the day.

I couldn't pass up the opportunity to quote a line from the Styx.  For me, it's Domo Arigato, Arigato Sushi - which sounds both cheesy and geeky.  Thanks to Ed A.'s yelp.com/user_details?us suggestion, I had some good sushi at a crazy good price tonight.  For $23 bucks here's what I got:  Hamachi Nigiri, Seaweed Salad, Pacific roll, Caterpillar Roll and some Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream.  The only thing they couldn't satisfy me for was a weird craving for a roll with jalapeno in it, which is in some of the crazy rolls I get at Boss in L.A.For the price, it's a good choice for your weekday sushi fix.

Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and mini albacore donburi.  The Spicy Tuna Roll was eh.  I had to de-rice-ify all the pieces because there was so much rice on the small little roll.  And the spicy tuna flavor was almost nonexistent.  The mini albacore donburi should have been mini-er.  It was disgusting.  I tried it with some different sauces, all to no avail.  Disgusting.  The T.N.T. Roll was okay.  Pretty much tasted like a super deep-fried thick battered tempura.Train Wreck Roll.  Tasted okay.  Shrimp tempura, mixed with a spicy avocado blend and crab mix, topped with chopped unagi, sea steak, sesame seeds, and onions.  Had a little bit of a smoked flavor to it.  Other than that, tasted like a tempura roll.  Pimp My Roll.  Mmmm.  That was tasty.  Tempura Shrimp, spicy tuna inside, avocado, fresh salmon, crushed macadamia nuts with Japanese Mafia saice, lightly torched and topped with masago and onion.  This was the best of the three sushi choices we made.  I would definitely recommend ordering this one.  Lick My Chops.  Oh ish I'm in love.  Grilled lamb chops lightly glazed with spicy teriyaki sauce.  It is so hard to find good lamb, and these lambchops were great.  Comes with three pieces.  Normally, my friend or I would have told the other to eat the second piece.  We straight split the third chop.Also ordered an interesting Mochitini or something like that.  A martini with a square of mango ice cream and mochi on the toothpick.  Tasty, but on the super sweet side.  Almost too sweet, but one won't kill you.I debated what rating to give it.  The porkchop itself demands 5 stars.  But that combo plate should get 2.  Never order the combo plate.  4 stars thanks to the porkchop and pimp my roll.I was pleasantly surprised by this in the mall sushi bar........

We went on a Sunday and the place was jam-packed.  The nut meat used in tacos, etc, was far tastier than any 'neat loaf' that I have previously tasted but not as good as 'Soy Rizo'. The food was very fresh, and shockingly cured my hangover faster than greasy food (sprouts for a hangover? Yeah right!). The hot soy chai was divine, and you get a lot in a burrito for 5 bucks. So, all in all good. And a nice change of pace.
<review# 2468,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2007,8/10/2007,41,28,2,5,2>This is an excellent way to spend the day and it is near a couple great campsites so it is a perfect plan for one of your days of camping.  You basically spend the whole day on a huge raft with a bunch of friends drinking a lot and having a ton of fun.     The ride takes you down the American River on a slow to medium current with little to now waves so it is pretty safe.  But you should know how to swim if you go, especially if you choose not to wear your life vest which is usually the case from what I saw.       Along the way you may end up getting into some water wars with other rafters and even people hanging out on the shore awaiting your arrival into their territory.  It is great because the people really get into it. They have huge, what looks like homemade water guns made out of conduit piping and they drench the hell out of you.  We only had one little super soaker to fight back and it was sad but after sitting in the sun for hours it felt great.        Just make sure to bring and re-apply lots of sun screen, a lot of my friends got fried.  And wear hats and drink lots of water.  Some of my friends got sun stroke because they didn't drink enough water or wear hats; your head absorbs a lot of the sun's rays and not wearing a hat when in the sun for long periods of time is the main cause of sun stroke.       At the end of the trip down the river they have buses that take you back to the top of the river where you started and I must warn you; this part can get a little ugly.  Just imagine about 30 to 35 drunk people crammed in an old ass school bus for about 20 minutes, maybe more.  A fight almost broke out right above me on my trip so I am sure it gets a lot worse a lot of the time.       Anyways, everybody should do it, at least once in their life; it is a lot of fun.

Located in Depot Park off of Fruitridge and Florin Perkins Road, the café is run by St. John's Shelter. This local charity believes in the potential of every member of society to contribute something, and promotes hard work and productivity instead of apathy and reliance on government benefits. The Café trains formerly homeless or abused women to find work in the food  industry subsequent to graduating from their program.The Café is cafeteria-style. Hand-written daily specials don the walls, along with art painted by children at the shelter (for sale for $40 each) and resident success stories. While Plates no longer serves breakfast, they do a great job for lunch, and it's not that much further out of the way than, say, Squeeze Inn Burger. The service was pleasant and it was fairly quiet at 1pm on a Tuesday.With sandwiches such as Pulled Pork with caramelized onions (highly popular and already sold out on the day we came), Vegetable Foccacia (expect potent pesto), and Croque Monsieur, served with a side of garden or pasta salad or potato or sweet potato fries, they've got a lot to offer. Daily specials also beckon, including (today) White Bean pureed soup with smoked bacon, and a smoked turkey/bacon/cheddar sandwich. Homemade desserts looked delicious and included sweet potato pie, ginger snaps, chocolate cake, and a cinnamon streusel bundt cake called "Sock-It-To-Me Cake". But the best dish of all is the side of inspiration served with every meal.

((And btw, I sooo agree with both interpretations. Yuuuum!!)Stopped in here yesterday to see what they had since my husband and I are going to do Thanksgiving ourselves this year. The place is owned by a husband and wife and they are both very friendly. We went in just to look around and we ended up in a 20-minute conversation with the owner. Nice guy! During our talk he gave us 5 different samples - clam chowder, chili, tri-tip, bbq, and one that I now forget. The tri-tip was delicious! It was super tender. And now that I know people use them more as a lunch spot than as a butcher's I will have to show up one afternoon for a tri-tip sandwich. Orgasmic! We ended up going with their suggestion for our Thanksgiving main course. We will be picking up a rack of lamb on Wednesday. He said he will tie it for us and properly trim it. It also won't be too much of a financial blow either. He said it will only be about 10-12 dollars which is definitely cheaper than Savemart (and higher quality too)! It's going to be an awesome Thanksgiving and in large part that is due to this place which will supply us with a decadent main course. Can't wait! I'll come back to try them as a restaurant, but for now they are definitely my old-school, neighborly butcher.

So when my friends were looking for a place with a decent breakfast for some birthdays that had vegan options for me, we decided to give Orphan a try.  Now that I have experienced it myself, I feel like its safe to say that Orphan has its upsides and its downsides. Let's start with all the good things about Orphan: You walk in and the place is really nice. It's located in East Sac in a super cutesy residential neighborhood and the inside of the place is very well lit with giant windows letting in natural light and beautiful tables. The food looks amazing and they even have menu especially for vegans that basically is the regular menu with notes on substitutions/what can be made vegan. I loved that!All that being said, it took forever to give us our menus for ordering and we had to ask about getting the bill. I'll give it to them that it was a Monday morning and that they were a bit understaffed considering how busy it was in there, but still! When we all completely finished with our meals and were awaiting the check, a waitress looked at us, made eye contact, smiled, and started helping another table. Umm. That's not very nice; she could've at least asked us if we needed anymore of anything. Eye contact just isn't enough. : / And I'm sure you've heard this a million times but Orphan does not accept cards. This wasn't an issue with us because we looked on the website and were prepared but I could see how inconvenient it would be for some people. Not to mention, parking around this place is super difficult.Overall, the food was decent. I ordered the vegan tamales with black beans and tofu.  I devoured it pretty fast. I rarely get tamales! Did you guys know that they don't offer ketchup here? I thought that was really weird considering this is a breakfast place.  So even though the service isn't great, I think I'll have it give it another chance in the future. Their vegan menu is just too darn good!
<review# 2473,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2011,7/31/2011,306,513,1,16,8>I honestly had only vague ideas of what to expect when I first stepped into Paul Brown's office.  I had a bit of trouble finding parking and was embarrassed that I was going to be a few minutes late.  From what I could tell (pictures, website, etc.), he seemed like someone who would know exactly what he was doing.  The numerous five-star Yelp reviews backed this up.  He seemed like the best choice to me.As soon as I showed up for my appointment, Paul made me feel welcomed.  He asked me a few questions to get an idea of what sort of work I needed.  He provided some helpful ideas on healthy posture while using the computer.Paul started the massage by putting on some music.  I really like his music choice; it was relaxing and helped me get into the right state of mind.  It was not cheesy, new age-y music.  Paul's big hands are perfect for massaging; strong, yet measured, he knows exactly the motions to perform to achieve the best effect.  At times, he provided guidance if he needed me to do something special during the massage.  I didn't realize how much tension I was bottling up even while doing sedentary activities like lying down, but Paul made me realize that I was and made me aware of it so I could truly relax.After the massage, he gave me a bottle of water to drink and some instructions for making sure that the massage would last.  He's a really nice, sincere guy and his demeanor made the experience really pleasant.When I got home, I slept the best that I had slept in a long time.  I typically wake up very early with some spinal pain, and I have to say that when I woke up on Saturday, I found that I had been able to sleep in much later than I usually can.  In addition, the spine pain I had been experiencing was gone.  The past few nights have been very restful and I'm sure that Paul's massage is directly responsible for my ability to truly relax in bed now.I'm definitely going back to Paul Brown for my next massage and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a massage.  He's nice, personal, and truly cares; he throws his whole being into his massage work, and that is what makes all the difference in this case.
<review# 2474,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2011,7/30/2011,451,183,5,8,8>Tanning. Bed. That's the main selling point for me here. I know, sunny Cali, why do I need to fake n bake? Because I work at a soul sucking job that is m-f from 8-5. Yeah, That's why. The nice thing about this place is that even though it is near Sac State (and the students), it is not your typical meat market of a gym. The students mainly go to the gym at CSUS. So the clientele here is a mix of all sorts of East Sac residents (including Yelper Elite Dat L, whom I saw mworking out there as well).  Sure, it is a small place, with only 4 elliptical machines and 6 treadmills, but the members are pretty good about being courteous and sticking to the 30 minute limit during peak times.         The staff is here limited hours, so it is nice to just come in any time you want using a member key.  And that is the same key you use to activate the tanning bed!!! So you can go whenever and for as long as you like. If you burn, its your fault! Don't go in as long.      I am stoked cause in the next month I will be looking nice and tan, and back to fit! (and can finally snag a date again!)

Nevertheless, I took my pup out for a walk to check out the truck and grabbed a sweet tea with mint, it was so refreshing! The Sacto MoFo...... well I wasn't going to wait hours because I'm always free during lunch hours and I don't mind hunting them down... so that's what I did today!Luckily for me they were nearby my house once again. Here's what we got:The Mustang- delicious, delicious, delicious! I don't eat a lot of dairy but I had to for this one. It had Korean braised short ribs with kimchi and havarti cheese. It was the perfect combo! I don't even like kimchi but this sammich won me over.The Hemi- Mac n Cheese with pulled pork, yummy! I had a bite of it and it was awesome. I want a side of that mac n cheese! Tater tots with rosemary and garlic- I thought the rosemary and garlic were going to overpower the lil tots but it sure didn't! I have to say these tots alone are 5 stars. They were super crisp, golden lil things with just a slight note of rosemary and garlic. Creme Brule- YES PLEASE! I've only had a spoonful because after only half of my sandwhich and a handful of tots, I was barely able to move.. so yums.Good stuff at Drewski's, we're totally going back, next time to try The Special and some mac n cheese balls!
<review# 2476,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2011,7/28/2011,156,217,29,25,25>If young people who are effortlessly fashionable intimidate you--especially if you are trying so hard yourself to be fashionable like a certain reviewer here whose headline reveals herself to be the ultimate self-appointed arbiter of what is cool--then perhaps you might never become comfortable here at nü-Bows & Arrows. But if my cargo-shorts-and-athletic-ankle-socks-and-trail-­running-shoes-wearing self can get over the so-called "hipster" vibe, then so can you! (And to my fellow REI-shoppers, frumps, faux-hawked (still?) bro-dawgs, gangstas, sportos, spray-tanners, Forever 21 fiends...let's be really real for a change: calling people "hipsters" reflects way worse on us than it does them.)Speaking of being cool without even trying....I've found myself at Bows & Arrows, like, 2.3 times per week since its opening! Is this my midlife crisis? Does this seem like a pathetic cry for help to you? Beats cruising for three-fourths-my-age MILFs in a V8 roadster in the parking lot of The Fountains at Roseville, doesn't it? Pardon me if Bows is the only place I feel safe. Everywhere else I go, I get accosted by "OMG...DO PEOPLE TELL YOU THAT YOU LOOK LIKE THE GUY FROM THE HANGOVER MOVIES?!?!" But not here. Maybe this thing about "hipsters" being too cool to care...y'know...maybe it's a good thing! Or maybe these people don't own televisions or watch blockbuster movies. Jeez, really? What is wrong with these people?Seriously, though...I come here for the sandwiches. And I often linger a while because my friends don't wanna leave. Or maybe they wanna 2nd Allagash from the tap. Or maybe Oro de Calabaza isn't made for chugging or guzzling, so they wanna take their time. And while they sip their libations, I like to look around and enjoy the beautiful artistic environment. Which of Bows' whimsical lamps would I like to hang from my own ceiling? I can't decide. I like how there's a corner of the place that looks like it has an Alaskan theme. When I look more decidedly mountain man than usual, I'd like to sit there. But twice now, adorable little people who look like they walked out of an anime feature are sitting there. And back to those ceiling accessories...what an awesome idea for repurposing wrought-iron bed headboards and footboards!There's a nice patio, too, which is delightfully appointed if you don't dwell too much on the barbed wire atop the fence. (Get some creeping vines to cover that up!) It's a comfortable place to meet friends and talk except when a train passes by. But even that's not too intrusive.Back to those sandwiches which first lured me there....This is not your typical pulled pork sandwich! I alternate between that and the beer-soaked fig, which achieves a brilliant textural harmony with the creamy goat cheese and crunchy greens. I was a fan of these sandwiches when they were at Fat-Face in Davis, but due to the very limited hours of Fat-Face, I was rarely ever able to eat there. To tell the truth...I once took a day off from work just so I could eat at Fat-Face, and those uncommonly obsessive sandwich artistes make some of the best, so it's worth it. Now that I can get these sandwiches just a few blocks' walk from the office, I can be totally spoiled!So, if you've still got an outdated hipster hangup, drop your defenses and let the seductive vibes of the new Bows and Arrows sink under your skin. It will grow on you. Unless you are so hopelessly addicted to TV screens on every wall....then you can just go next door with your backwards officially-licensed major sports team all-wool cap to Sweetwater and get your fix.
<review# 2477,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2011,7/27/2011,570,275,7,12,14>My friend and I wanted to do a little wine tasting, but didn't want to travel the distance to do it.  So when he suggested we try this place, all I could say was "where?"  I had no idea this place existed, but I am so glad we found it.My friend and I found that if you do their tasting, and buy a bottle of wine in the end, your tasting was free.  So naturally we just HAD to buy some wine.  The real question was "which one?"  I stuck with the more standard tasting, while my friend choose the reserves.  Not one wine wasn't to our liking, and I found myself enjoying the wine more as we went further down the list (and no, it wasn't the wine buzz speaking).  The Syrah was pretty incredible, but we ended up choosing a lighter Port to compliment the Winemakers Platter of drool educing meats and cheeses.  It was a finger licking arrangement of diverse flavors, which was the perfect selection to split between two people.We spent some time speaking with Craig who walked us through the tasting, and graciously spend some time educating us on each wine. It was a pleasure meeting him.I hope to attend again when there aren't several large parties.  It took away from the environment a bit, which was at no fault of Revolution Wines.  I look forward to coming one quiet evening with friends to share another night of conversation and wine.
<review# 2478,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/21/2011,7/26/2011,108,373,11,12,9>My first real foray into a gay bar, ever. I had to pinch myself. I mean, I chuckled to myself when I paid a $7 cover. I felt like "what in the hell am I doing? I like women".But, gay men can party. The dance floor was never at a dearth of energy. The DJ, sequestered in a booth, happened to be both mixing and syncing with music videos, splayed across many flat screens throughout the bar. I was impressed by this. Was it pre-made or was he mixing on the spot? The mystery continues.Simply the best bar in Sacramento to dance at, regardless of orientation. "But Davey, did you get hit on?"A: Yes. But they stop after a bit of gentle persistence. Who cares honestly?The energy is high, and you're uplifted into sudden "go-mode". Friendly environment. Different levels to play on up and downstairs. Therefore, the best and, I think, the safest, bar in Sacramento to dance at regardless of your orientation.
<review# 2479,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2011,6/20/2012,648,305,26,46,20>I did it. Finally caved in and got legal. Yep...that paranoid feeling is now out the door. I went as a "walk in", but suggest you make an appointment...my schedule is just too unpredictable. So, I waltzed in here on a Thursday afternoon. Whatever you do, scan that SnR for their ad for 55 instead of 99...I think so! (you knew it would come in handy one day, right?) Oh, and make sure you walk into the door facing the street that says "push"- not into the window on the side like I did. (What? The hours of operation sign made it look like a door!) My Dad and Aunt have been "legal" for a bit, as well as a few friends- who let me know the process is much simpler than before. Bring your CA ID, fill out a couple papers- and BAM. As a walk in, you should expect a 1-2 hour wait. Bring something to read, or you're stuck with Submerge Mag and an old poinsettia on top of a tele with the worst possible day time programing on. The staff was super great, and thanked me numerous times for my patience (what? I wasn't going anywhere:) The on-site evaluator person guy was pretty cool, professional, and asked simple questions regarding health history and what not. After that room, you sit back down for a few minutes, and the aide calls you back up, presents your paperwork, answers any questions you may have, refers you to a local dispensary, then you're set. Smoke all you want until you have to re new next year. Also, I have no idea what this other reviewer is talking about...I had a pleasant experience (I wasn't even high yet) and the price was just right...in fact, they'll match anyone else in town...so good luck, and get legal!
<review# 2480,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2011,6/19/2012,192,54,7,9,11>Why the hell would I want to drive out of my way to some little dive in Old Elk Grove just to get a beer? That would have been my attitude if the DBCs hadn't arranged a meet-up at this cozy little gem. After hanging out here last week, my hard-nosed attitude towards everything south of Land Park has softened a bit. The beer selection is vast and they have a full bar to boot! I ewatched one of the Connoisseurs rock out the Missle Command/Centipede video game combo while another racked up the points on the pinball machine. Good tunes played over the bar chat as the pool tables quickly filled up.I was blessed to take in a bit of OEG history on this particular night. Greg B enlightened me with the fact that this is Elk Grove's oldest business housed in its oldest building. Amanda M informed me that this is the only bar in OEG unless you want to go to a restaurant.As mentioned in other reviews, this is a cash only establishment. They do have an ATM machine but I didn't see what kind of fees are attached.While I don't make my way to the EG very often, now I know of a place where I can relax in comfort should future paths lead me there!
<review# 2481,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/27/2011,6/18/2012,291,553,1,11,8>My boyfriend, mom and I visited Quan Nem Ninh Hoa on a Friday evening around 8:30 p.m.  The place closes at 9:00 p.m. but they were very happy to serve us.  We were quickly greeted at the door, seated and given menus.  Having eaten Brodard's pork rolls just a couple weeks prior for the first time, I was craving them (the reason we visited this restaurant).  We ordered:#2 Nem Nuong Cuon ($5.95 for four):  The pork was flavorful and I really liked the crunchy fried egg roll wrappers.  The dipping sauce was really good as well, although it's still a mystery to me what is actually in it.  The portion size is very fair for the price, as well.#9 Ban Beo ($4.95 for ten): this was my first time trying this type of dish, and I absolutely loved it.  It's steamed lunar rice cakes topped with fried onions and ground shrimp.  There is also a light, golden-clear sauce that is on the side, which tasted good as well.  This dish is really fun to eat because each is in it's own little cup/dish and you eat it with a little spoon.  #12 Ban Xeo ($5.95): this Vietnamese crepe was good, but not as good as I had hoped.  I've been spoiled because my friend occasionally makes these and fills them with delicious bacon, so unfortunately, this crepe didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped.  Still decent though- and they give you plenty of vegetables to accompany the crepe.#13 Bun Cha Ca ($7.25): We ordered this dish based on the recommendation from the waitress.  It's a fish soup with soft vermicelli noodles.  It's unlike anything that I've every had before, and I surprisingly really enjoyed it.  It was perfect for a cold night.  Overall, the food came out quickly and everything tasted great.  The prices are very fair and the portions are fair-large. The service was helpful and quick.  I'd come back every now and then whenever I'm craving Vietnamese food (it's not close to my home).Notes:-This restaurant is in it's own building, not a part of a strip mall like many other restaurants in the area.-They share a parking lot with other businesses.
<review# 2482,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2012,6/17/2012,179,181,8,8,8>I admit that I've never had the desire to visit Pizza Rock before, but I randomly ended up there - thanks to the happy hour menu sign grabbing our attention - after a bike ride to Macy's nearby. Business looked slow from the outside, but as soon as we opened the doors, we were greeted with lots of music, dark but lively decor and tables filled with customers. We wanted to take part in the happy hour goods, so we sat at the pizza bar near the front. It had only 3-4ish seats, so we it was just us and Sergio, the chef manning the cirigliano forni oven. That turned out to be a great thing because he was very informative and was great dining company. We ordered the St. Germain wings off the happy hour menu ($5 gets you 5 wings) and opted for the pizza campari ($16) despite pizza not being happy-hour priced. The campari pizza - with crushed red peppers, mozzarella, smoked pancetta, peppered goat cheese, escarole, sweet piquante peppers, and Campari Blood Orange  reduction  - was nothing short of amazing. If you like your pizza adventurous, get this! In fact, you should commit to trying it even if you don't. Bonus point for serving Sierra Nevada Ruthless Rye IPA on tap. $3 pints of that stuff would make anybody a happy camper. I wasn't able to find any information on their website, but according to Sergio and the delivery bicycles strategically parked at the front, they deliver to the grid area, which is great to know since I've lived in Sacramento almost four years and have yet to find a favorite pizza delivery joint. I will be back!One word of advice to Pizza Rock: I appreciate the integrated interface on your website, but adding autoplay rock music to your site is a circa 1997 faux pas. The information and web design say enough without it.
<review# 2483,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/29/2012,6/16/2012,35,60,2,8,4>Who is Big Joe? What makes his BBQ different? My answer to this is: Big Joe is my hero for opening a BBQ spot across the street from my work!!!The Spot: Located on the corner of 10 and I, this spot take over for the once known as Fog Mountain Cafe.  It is a good size restaurant.  It is open with good amount of seating.  It is located on the ground floor of a parking garage, so parking is easy and ample.  Food: The restaurant is set up in an assembly line of goodness.  Step 1: get your meats.  They are carved to order.  You can choose between tri-tip. chicken. ribs, turkey, etc.  Some are only offered on certain days I believe, like rib mondays, but I am not sure if this is just a special or they offer it everyday.  I got a half pound tri-tip sandwich.  Good size sandwich, good flavor as the meat really shines on top of a nice roll that wasn't too soft or too hard.  My only beef (see what I did there?) is that I did not see a good smoke ring or really taste any smoke.  Step 2: Get a side dish.  I got some BBQ baked beans to accompany my tri-tip!  Great side of beans!  I really enjoyed the sweet and savory flavors that these beans had.  Loved it!  Not sure why.. but i did.Step 3: SAUCE~!!!So after you get your food, you come up upon a BBQ sauce dispenser which allows you to experience 3 degrees of BBQ.  MILD, SPICY, or HOT are you choices.  I tried all 3 with my meat.  The mild is your typical sweet BBQ.  Good overall.  The spicy kicks up the heat a bit.  I would say this is your medium for people.  A little more acidic taste... (probably because these are vinegar based sauces? just a guess).  The Hot BBQ was a love/ hate thing for me.  I deeply appreciated the heat and the good taste, but there was a good amount of sourness that lingered behind.  I would still eat this sauce though... maybe mix it with a bit of the mild!Overall, I would come back to get my bbq fix here.  The sandwiches are decent price for downtown standards (8$ for 1/2 lbs sandwich, 2$ more to make it a meal with a side and a drink).  I totally dig the fact that you can grab yourself some bbq here and walk over to the park next door to enjoy the sun and the sauce~!!!

But, with a recent visit and 49'er beatdown, I just can't help myself. 400 reviews later, and 4 stars to this cute spot just outside of my normal stomping ground. Had to give extra credit because:- they will deliver food, just a few doors down, to Steeler Nation (where food is not available, and were I was originally posted up for gameday). - they have plantains on the menu! Wonderful, wonderful fried plantains (kinda hard to find in this area).- the nice lady who took my order gave me an awesome compliment (and I'll take em' where I can get em' - I'll give that credit to the Oil of Olay stuff I've been using lately).- free chips and tasty salsa with my to-go order (a much appreciated rarity now-a-days).- Nice lady let me take some honey from their coffee fixins' area for said plantains.The place was pretty packed for a Sunday morning; not a table unoccupied. Good thing I was only nabbing some food to go. And, I just didn't have the heart to ask for it to be delivered to the madhouse a few doors down, since they were so busy.Did I mention plantains? Delicious fried plantains with a side of crema? The Boricua in me has now set this place on my homing radar.
<review# 2485,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/26/2011,6/14/2012,125,189,6,10,11>I stopped in here last night after dinner down the block, fully intending not to eat.  I was with a friend who wanted some gelato, and I thought I'd just be a fly on the wall until I saw a plate of what appeared to be cookies and cream ice cream topped cupcakes, complete with half oreo jammed into the middle of it.  I promptly reversed my decision not to eat and tried one of these babies out.  Holy hell!  This thing is incredible!  Surprise!  Cream filling on the inside as well?? Bonus!Upon further inspection, another surprise, TreyB's serves up breakfast and lunch as well.  I'll for sure come back and test those waters.Looking at the official website today, there is no sign of that cookies and cream cupcake treat.  I sincerely hope this one isn't just a temporary menu item, as I can see myself eating a ton of these things in the future.Nice cozy space on the inside to sit down and enjoy a meal or dessert.  I'm a fan.
<review# 2486,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2012,6/13/2012,156,145,5,9,15>LOVE this place. Not only is it packed to the gills with cool antique, vintage, and retro stuff - it also has full rooms that are set up vintage style. I think that is so cool! This is the only antique mall I have ever been to that has full rooms set up like this.I really like the rooms that Vincent has set up. Pictures, stamps, and old documents. Plus he is really interesting to talk to and he has great sales!!I agree with Julie E. I want to come here with a super full wallet and plenty of time to relax and browse!! I like that there is such a wide variety of merchandise. Clothes, shows, purses, appliances, posters, books, plates, etc., etc., etc. I could come here everyday and I probably wouldn't run out of things to look at. If you are into looking at old stuff then I highly recommend you pay this place a visit=)As is the norm with most antique places some vendors are way over priced, some are priced just right, and some are underpriced. Besides the fun is in the hunt!
<review# 2487,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2012,6/12/2012,58,202,6,9,7>Came last night for the grand opening, how refreshing it is to see this space so relaxed and open! The old Dream did this space no justice, The Republic is open, large, fun, and looks like it's going to be a place to hang out for a drink. The perimeter is lined with a long bench and lots of tables and chairs on the right side of the bar. On the left of the bar are pool tables, skee ball, and darts. The center is the bar, which is really nice, I like how it flows with curves all the way around. Overall the place looks great! Especially since I really disliked the way Dream Ultra Lounge looked, the Republic is a huge upgrade! Staff was super friendly and very inviting to the new place. We sat the bar and even though it was busy our bartender never left us hanging and always made sure we had a full glass. Lastly, the food! We came only because my fiance LOVES the Drewski's Truck and he had to check out the bar they would be cooking for. Since every time we visit the truck they are out of their famous mac and cheese balls we ordered those. Unfortunately I was disappointed, they were good, but I felt like all I was tasting was the crispy batter and nothing else. Have no fear, the rest was wonderful! Tater tot nachos! Soooo good, jalepenos, cheese sauce, shredded cheese, and BACON! Between the three of us we got, the Hemi, which is my personal fav from the truck and it's just as amazing at the bar, and of course now I can't remember the names of the burgers! Oh well I had the bbq, bacon, onion string burger, which sounds a lot like a western bacon burger, but I guarantee it's 100x better. Then the fiancee got the mushroom guyer cheese burger which yummy greasy cheesey deliciousness! All burgers are served with their garlic rosemary tots, which I have to say are way better than when you order them from the truck. So overall we're excited that this has come to town and love the concept. Now we're looking forward to this being our new hangout!
<review# 2488,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2012,6/11/2012,209,356,7,8,7>The food is great but I prefer to take it to go. The tables are thrown around haphazardly and it's always crowded. It's hard to get a table and even more difficult to find a clean one. If you sit inside, there's a good chance you'll have the asses of everyone in line resting on your shoulder because the restaurant is so small.That said, the shrimp fajitas totally rock. The carnitas tacos totally rock. The shrimp tacos totally rock. Those are the only things I've tried because they're so good I have to keep ordering the same thing each time I come.Great, homemade chips and awesome salsa. Take a chance on the spicy, it's more flavorful and less fire than you might think. I think it's roasted.The prices are incredibly right. A couple tacos won't break your bank.
<review# 2489,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2011,7/25/2011,416,180,21,7,10>If I am not mistaken, they must put crack in their baked pork chops over rice because it has been a week since I first had it and I've literally been craving it every single day. Nothing appeals to me anymore and everything I eat pales in comparison to how satisfying the fried porkchops in the crusty tomato cheese sauce was. It even left me disinterested in the dessert of Egg Puffs and "Football" I ordered the same night- and I usually like sweets so much that I finish it as appetizer.Sidenote: My friend told me about how he always orders the "football" which is a fruit mix with tapioca and jelly so I had to try it. I couldn't find it on their menu so I was skeptical that the fobby asian lady would know what I was talking about. Surprisingly when I asked her for it, she understood me completely! I was stumped by why they would call it something so random as a "Football", especially when they barely knew basic words in english... I thought about it for a long long time and suddenly I reached an epiphany. They called it a "football" because they can't pronounce "fruitbowl"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!!

MY hair was in pretty bad shape and she made it look hit and stylish again. She got what I was going for a turned my semi-coherent hair talk into a chic look. I really like the vibe of the salon. It is cozy and modern. The other stylists are laid back and you can tell they have a lot of fun with their work. I served a glass of champagne with the color process and one before the cut. I love sipping champagne while being pampered!I really look forward to having Karli play with my hair in the future!

It was like a gem in the belly button of an overweight belly dancer, you have to look really close to find the diamond. Anyways, secretly hidden in a strip mall next to old hollywood video and nestled between the peverly bum smelling of urine and king cobra. FYI (peverly is a verb used to describe subtle perversion) you will find this out of this world sushi joint.Whether its their spider roll, shrimp or salmon lovers roll this place will definitely leave you with an akeboner. It did for me, with salmon eggs all over it. Once again Eduardo does not believe so with his two star rating. Shame on you, shame on you, shame on you.

<review# 2492,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2011,7/22/2011,432,335,26,14,18>So my Yelp-y friend Brian L. gave me a backhanded compliment about how he liked my review; however, I FAILED to mention the Hot Blonde.  WELL, I want you all to know that I took on Brian's challenge.  I was a hot (literally, it was hot outside) woman on a hot mission.  I walked in and was greeted by Mick (the owner) who immediately tries to convince me to buy a Chicken Salad sandwich.  But I stood firm, looked him directly in the eye, and stated "Oh no, I am here on a mission.  I need a Hot Blonde."  Tick tock, tick tock, listened to the hard rock blasting in the kitchen, drooled over the tatted guys in the back... and then he called my name, nay, beckoned.  I floated over and held it tight to my chest like a precious package as I walked back to the office.Once I settled in, I delicately peeled back the layers and took in her beauty.  She was an eyeful and a mouthful!  Grilled to perfection:  Chicken, avo, swiss, tomato, red onions, spinach, cucumber, garlic spread, brown mustard, and pepper plant sauce on sourdough.  I kept telling myself, "I'll just eat half and save the rest for later."  WRONG!  I couldn't help myself, didn't want to stop myself from immersing and rejoicing in this wonderful sandwich.  Anyway, the Hot Blonde left me a Hot Mess...avo in my hair (how did that happen?), sauce dripping down the chin, bread crumbs down the shirt.  My boss stopped by and gave me a weird look.  I know he was wondering "WTF happened to you?"  I smiled and silently replied, "I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself."
<review# 2493,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2011,7/20/2011,390,173,6,11,9>Considering it's location, prices and quality of food, I'm always surprised Hads isn't busier. I've been assured by staff members that there are nights when they're swamped, but we went on 2nd Saturday and there were two other couples. Works for me...I love having my pick of seats!Speaking of 2nd Saturdays, this is a terrific spot to stop for an early dinner. Just a few steps away from the heart of the action with the perfect ambiance for date night. They even have two bay window spots that make for some fantastic people watching.Both of our meals started with the clam chowder. Loaded with tender clams, it was rich and delicious. Couldn't believe the amount of clams versus potatoes, made for some of the best chowder I've had (sorry Jamie's!).Great value for quality on the food. Prime rib was the special (it always is on Fri. & Sat.) and for $19 the BF got a HUGE slab of mostly lean perfectly med-rare beef, plus soup, bread and some wonderful green beans. The man has a love of green beans that is unrivaled by anyone else I've ever known. These hit his spot...crisp-tender with lots of smoky bacon and caramelized onions. I tried the steamed clams for dinner (also available as an app.) Good size portion of littlenecks, steamed in a delicious wine/garlic/butter broth. Thought about getting the rice and the waitress was kind enough to tell me it's "really nothing special" :)  Appreciated her honesty and it wound up being a good tip as the crispy steak fries were a perfect complement to the clams. The one big disappoint was the bread. Great dipping bread is crucial with clams and theirs just doesn't have much flavor or crunch.Couldn't resist a slice of their banana cream pie. It was amazing!! One slice was easily twice the size of most and it was soooo good! Fresh, ultra creamy...really just incredible.Fun, cozy atmosphere with friendly servers. Definitely worth a try!
<review# 2494,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2011,7/18/2011,277,126,6,11,9>This vintage boutique is certainly not your neighborhood Goodwill.  It's clear that all the items are handpicked and inspected for quality and relevancy.  Clothing and accessories are well organized, displayed openly, and arranged in way that is complementary to the overall retro feminine feel of the store.  It's part of the art!  I spoke briefly with one of the owners, and I believe that she (Raging Hag) and her partner (Porkchop) are the only buyers for the shop; both with a very distinctive, separate sense of style.  I really appreciated that each article of clothing is tagged with the era of the item, a description of the item and priced ridiculously affordable.  I must have tried on over a dozen things.  Everywhere I turned, there was yet another one-of-a-kind fabulous piece; if only they all came in my size!  (This is the sad reality of shopping vintage.)  The dressing room is spacious enough and private. The only drawback I can think of is that the house cat roams freely.  As darling as this kitty cat is, its adorable furriness could not disarm the massive allergy attack that lurked my way and hit me as soon as I tried a few things on.  If you are like me, my advice would be to pop a Claritin before visiting Crimson and Clover.   That's what I'm gonna do next time!
<review# 2495,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/6/2010,7/17/2011,78,78,10,5,8>It all started when we were planning our friend Jen's birthday dinner. Originally, we were going to hit a wine bar and spend the night tasting wines and consuming foofy drinks. Well, Jen and my girlfriend Jody were, I was going to sit in the corner drinking the hoppiest beer I could find while the girls drank their Pink Teddy Bear Lemon Lime Vodka Bubble Gum Cosmotini Passionfruit Free-Range Syrah Freezes.Luckily for all of us (especially me) my girlfriend Jody saw Heat Shabu Baru on Hot on Yelp and took mercy on me and decided we should go there instead. That's one reason she's such a great girlfriend. She decided we should go to a place with platters of meat instead of a place where meat comes in lollipop form. Sorry, but lamb Dum-Dums need to stay in their native habitat: episodes of Top Chef where a contestant has completely run out of ideas after forgetting to turn on the ovenAlthough the other reviews of Heat point out that the decor is pretty awesome, I was still worried. Most shabu places adhere to the Asian philosophy of having really shabby decor. They do this on purpose. Many Asian people believe that a restaurant that has nice decor has spent the money on that stuff instead of putting it into the food. To them, you're there to eat, not be somewhere nice. This was beat into my head by my parents and relatives over the years. As my mother famously said during her first meal at Olive Garden, "You eat here, you pay for decor instead of food. Just go get can of Chef Boyardee and eat inside furniture store."Well, sorry mom, but I'm never taking you to Heat then. The decor is completely awesome. They have a red-themed interior that looks like an ultra lounge. In fact, if you took away the cooking tables and replaced them with couches, that's exactly what you would have.When we entered this palace of meaty goodness, Anthony walked up and said "Which one of you is the birthday girl?" Now, he's never seen us before, and we never said who we were. Jody had one phone conversation with him earlier in the week asking when the best time to come to the restaurant was. Somehow he figured out we were the people who called earlier. We pointed at Jen and said it was her birthday. He wished her a happy birthday and let out an evil chef/owner laugh and said he hoped she would have a great birthday meal.After sitting down we encountered the best waitress in Sacramento, Gloria. She gave us each a menu,"All you can shabu and drink!!!" I told her.Gloria laughed. It was probably her easiest order of the night.We ordered beer and sake and picked the tonkatsu and miso cooking broths. And Gloria went to work.I think her genes must be spliced with a bit of Mighty Mouse.In the span of five minutes she jammed our table with three beers, a bottle of sake, three sake glasses, a plate of American wagyu, a plate of New Zealand lamb, the veggie platter, three bowls of rice, six sauce bowls, eating plates, and cooking utensils. This would have taken a non-bionic waitress at least ten minutes to bring out. In addition to the speed, she managed to fit everything on the table in such a way that we could get to it all. Obviously, she has done this before. Compare this to, say, Olive Garden, where they can't even seem to fit salad and breadsticks for everyone on a table for three easily twice the size of the tables they have at Heat. Of course, none of this would mean anything if the food wasn't good. And I could hear my mother in the back of my head... "You pay for ultra lounge decor... you pay for pretty Mighty Mouse waitress... no money left for food...". Well, sorry mother, but the food was absolutely fantastic. The American wagyu was flavorful and extremely tender. The New Zealand lamb was mind blowing. Note that the lamb is a bit gamey, because it's supposed to be. Lamb is one of those meats that tastes like what it ate before it got turned into dinner. Real lambs graze on grasses and herbs which gives their meat that slightly gamey flavor. This is why you use NZ lamb. American-raised lamb is finished on corn, which erases that gamey flavor and makes the meat taste like some mild version of beef.Throughout the meal, I think the longest I waited for anything was about 90 seconds. Gloria the Bionic Waitress had to be anticipating when we were going to finish a meat plate or drink and had replacements ready every time. Gloria also accidentally brought us a plate of the Japanese Kobe. This stuff was so marbled it didn't even look like it came from a cow. Absolute melt in your mouth goodness. I can't comment on the veggie platter because I ignored it :)
<review# 2496,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/20/2011,7/15/2011,329,223,6,10,8>If there is any place I don't want to hang out, it's under a freeway. However, you can find me doing just that on any random Sunday morning. I love the fresh fruits and veggies, not to mention the baked goods and cut flowers, that are at the market. The hustle and bustle causes me to feel nostalgic as I wander through the rows scoping out the goods. It reminds me of a (very) toned down French Market. There are the usual common seasonal fruits and veggies as well as some items that you don't typically find at a regular super market (like bitter melon, quail eggs, super fancy schmancy mushrooms, etc). After I load up on long beans, squash, chard, or whatever, I always try to find a fruit or veggie that is new to me and buy it for inspiration. Before I go I get a super yummy pastry filled with custard and topped with fresh fruit from these sweet girls with a baked goods table. So so good. Then if the weather permits it's across the street for some quality time at the park. A lovely way to start the day.

<review# 2498,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2011,7/13/2011,83,392,9,13,14>Years after est. Tuli Bistro, Adam Pechal & Ulli Lesk Petersen have another recipe for success. Lucky for foodies in NW Midtown, Restaurant Thir13en is here! ... Besides upholding a commitment to showcasing fresh ingredients and meats that are sourced from local growers & ranchers, the patio seating remains one of the strongest selling points for this slightly out of the way location. (Interior is 'very quaint' in size, but earns good marks for design.)All of the salads were consistently delicious; nice pairing of ingredients and perfect complement to a FINELY grilled burger. {BTW they serve a true medium, not overlooked & overcooked like other establishments.} The food spoke for itself, not heavy-handed with sauces & other distractions... BONUS for fluffy, yet firm buns. (on the burger, that is!)They intend for THIR13EN to have a 'higher, more refined' ambiance... easily accomplished with more business crowd in the guest mix. Great choice for a power lunch, when you want to be subtle about your influence. Wait staff was solid 4-5 stars for a preview!Reason to return: to try the sous vide technique on this side of the pond... and signature cocktails (blood orange bitters + whiskey + cherries, yes please! -- who needs dessert?)** I've since returned for cocktails & small plates. SacraMINTo julep is strong like they like it in the South! I busted out my compact to make sure I didn't look like Col. Sanders. Can we agree to make the Tangerine Comet the new mimosa? Love prosecco with the rock candy in the flute!Mac & cheese w béchamel et quatre fromages was an accidental hit in the kitchen. Glad we could help with damage control and eat it! Don't miss the GNOCCHI, probably my favorite in the city! The size of each is literally a mouthful with savory diced bledsoe pork, just enough sauce and a touch of goat cheese.SUPER BONUS: This is my 21st FTR! :)
<review# 2499,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/5/2006,12/18/2006,413,298,,8,4>I'd never been to a Ruth's Chris and since the other dining options were limited at the Galleria Mall on the way back from Tahoe (FYI: Max's Cafe closes at 8pm on Sunday -- what's that all about??), we figured, "Why not?"The waitstaff is formal yet friendly, and our waiter gave us a full rundown on the history of the restaurant and the preparation of the steak. There's clearly a great pride in the establishment, or at least appears to be!My dining companion and I started by sharing the house salad with balsamic vinaigrette. It was kind of bland and average, but seemed much lighter than the other choices, since we knew that the meal would be heavy.I had the petite fillet as my main course. It was perfectly done to my request (medium), and extremely tender and flavorful. It wasn't chewy or overdone in the slightest. It was a great size for my appetite: about 5oz. or so. The price was pretty steep though: $30! We split the baked potato as a side. It was RIDICULOUSLY huge! Neither of us even finished half of our potato. I had a glass of the Shiraz which was $12 or $13 and pretty good.For dessert, we had the 'chocolate explosion.' As soon as the words 'molten chocolate cake' came out of his mouth, we decided to order it. I'm sorry to say that it was a huge disappointment. The cake literally tasted like it came out of a Duncan Hines box -- I'm not kidding. It had that from-a-mix-manufactured taste. Of course I ate it, because, come on... it's chocolate! However, when I finished, I felt like I'd just consumed one of the biggest waste of calories. Ugh!The bill for these items plus my dining companion's Guinness and New York Strip came to about $120. Pretty steep for a shared salad, side, and dessert, imo. Steak was good, though. The atmosphere was incredibly formal... almost overly so. My recommendation is to come here if someone else is footing the bill.

I always forget this place is open for lunch on Saturdays, but this weekend I had a craving for a cheese skirt, and drove out to the Fruitridge and Power Inn (it actually only took about 10 minutes). What really makes the burgers special here is the pile of shredded cheese that melts into a crispy-edged cheese skirt. Tasty crispy fries...It is a tiny space - thus the "squeeze." I felt kind of sick afterwards, but I have no one to blame but myself. Very limited seating and parking.I added some photos so you can see the making of a cheese skirt.
<review# 2503,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2006,12/13/2006,23,53,2,9,4>OMG!  The stories are true - one of the top restaurants in California.  I usually try to keep my reviews concise, however, that just won't do justice this time around.This is no ordinary restaurant.  When you walk in, you'll enter "the kitchen" - literally.  You can sit along the counter for the best view of the cooking demonstration, or you can sit on tables spread out in the intimate room.The chef presents each dish before it is cooked... yes, raw and sometimes alive.  As an example, that night he showed us the fresh New Zealand halibut that arrived 30 hours ago,  and the live Maine lobsters that were shipped to him that afternoon.  Our appetizer that evening included an organic salad, chicken terikayi and vegetable tempura with either a syrah or a sauvignon blanc.  The next course - New Zealand halibut on top of Maine lobster mash with matching chardonnay.  The main course was sirloin steak from Uruguay with finely grated potato scallops with wild mushrooms.  Of course, a cabernet to compliment the meal.There was extra halibut, so he whipped up some sashimi for us.  The best part was the fresh wasabi he made from scratch.  No paste here - instead, you can find small chunks of wasabi root... simply unbelievable.  Lastly, we had apple crepes and Tahitian vanilla gelato with an accompanying sparkling muskat.Reservations are a must.  They only seat 50 people per evening, and only serve 3-4 times per week.  It's no cheap ticket - $125 per person not including wine, tax or tip.  They do have a wine pairing option for about $55.  But nevermind the cost - once you're there it'll be worth every penny.

The prices can vary widely for the same room based on what's going on in the convention center. It's walking distance from a liquor store and several restaurants.  I used the valet, and they were pretty quick.  The club floor offers yummy snacks, try to get upgraded!  There is wi-fi in the lobby, and theoretically in the rooms.  I did have some problems with the in room Internet, and the staff is hit or miss in addressing guests' complaints.  This is one of the better properties in Sac, because they have the comfy Sheraton beds......but it's still Sac and their prices are high for the market.

<review# 2508,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/12/2006,12/8/2006,86,115,5,6,5>Hidden away out on Bradshaw and 50, this restaurant gives the outer appearance of a somewhat generic diner, but the inside is surprisingly nice for a Korean BBQ.  The inside of the place is huge, like it doesn't need to be that big huge.  The tables on the outside of the room all have a BBQ grill setup in the middle of the table along with a fan/vent above it to take away the smoke that occasionally fills the air.  With as many grills that could be used at once, the fans/vents are very necessary.  Other than that, there are two big TV's on both sides of the dining room.  In case dinner conversation slows, you can drift off into the discovery channel (that's what was on, and not very Korean BBQ'ish to me).The first thing I would mention about the food is that it is not for vegetarians.  Meat populates pretty much every part of the menu.  But in a good way.  The meat options consist of mostly sirloin steak, beef short ribs, some chicken, and some pork.  In addition to that there are numerous seafood options; calamari, cod, mackerel, octopus, and shrimp.  An interesting thing I noticed on the menu was "croaker", which we interpreted to be frog.  However, I didn't ask so I'm still not 100% sure what it is.  Our first dinner here consisted of the Sirloin Bibimbap and the Bul-Go-Gi.  The Sirloin Bibimbap consisted of strips of sirloin steak accompanied by mushrooms, spinach, carrots, bean sprouts, and eggs all over rice.  This was brought out on a piping hot metal stone skillet, and was followed up by the server adding a sriracha type sauce and then mixing all the ingredients up and finishing off with him smoothing it all out.  It was good, but I kept thinking that the mix of everything kept anything from really standing out.  Almost like there were too many flavors going on.  In my opinion, the Bul-Go-Gi was the real highlight.  The menu described it as: "sliced prime sirloin marinated in Korean traditional B.B.Q. sauce".  True, but that hardly does it justice.  Very thin slices of beef with a few green onions mixed in over a bed of noodles not unlike the noodles you'd find in a bowl of sukiyaki.  Second time around we showed up with three people, which means we got to use the grill (if you show up with only 2 people, they do the grilling for you in the back, not nearly as much fun)!  Our order this time included the Oz Galbi soup, Oz Galbi, and the Tokyo X BBQ.  The soup was good.  Really good.  Tender beef short ribs surrounded by clear noodles and a great broth.  I consider myself a quite the soup man, and the galbi soup impressed me.  Then it was time to start grilling.  First up was the Oz galbi.  A big plate of marinated beef short ribs was delivered to our table.  Supposedly they were "Diamond Hand cut", which is a thousand year old technique that tenderizes and marinates the meat.  "Only a few & most skillful chefs have this technique"; after reading this I realized how lucky we are to have such a skilled chef in the middle of sac!  OK, but really these short ribs were fantastic.  I'm sure my grilling skills just enhanced the flavor, but even a less skilled que'er could make them taste good.  This dish also came with a few fat mushrooms that were immediately thrown onto the grill.  Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that every entree is served with a bunch of panchan (little side dishes).  Most of them were spicy and vegetable based, things like kimchi, sprouts, and daikon.  By now we were getting full, but the Tokyo X was up next.  I was half expecting some kind of Japanese drifting game, but we ended up with a bunch of slabs of meat that resembled thick cut bacon.  In fact, the Tokyo X is "Marinated 'Tokyo X' style pork belly meat".  While good, it didn't come close to touching the tenderness and flavor of the galbi.  By then we were so full that I don't think we finished all of the Tokyo X.  The BBQ entree's are all around $20, but trust me, you get a LOT of food.  In conclusion, a fun place that is not your average "asian" eatery.  I think that this place is best when you have a group of people that are hungry as its fun messing with the grill (ever notice how everyone somehow has "great" advice on how exactly to grill everything) and even more fun not having to clean anything up afterwards.  So if you can pull yourself out of the grid, make this place one of your first stops.  4 grilled to a crisp stars out of 5.  And yeah, I know my reviews ramble on, I cant help it.

<review# 2513,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/28/2006,1/6/2007,5,12,4,4,5>4 stars?  Really, 4 stars, but with qualifiers.  (1) I've never actually sat down to eat, so I cannot intelligently analyze the ambiance, table service, or overall dining experience, and (2) Both times I have consumed Chita's luscious tacos, the condition my condition was in didn't resemble that of normal, sober, ambulatory human beings, so I could've easily missed something.Here is what I do know: Chita's makes good tacos.  My first trip to Chita's followed an evening out with friends and a few adult beverages that ended next door at Benny's.  After that experience, I called on Chita's to make 35 tacos for an elegant soiree that I hosted at my grandiose estate.  Safe to say they were prepared on time, with sufficient variety and taste that pleased even the most haughty of my compatriots.  The staff are dilligent, hard working, and friendly.  The younger woman working there was cute, too.In the highly competitive market for downtrown drunken eats, I would recommend Chita's just after Ink and Tapa, but higher if you haven't the time, willpower, balance, or behavioural disposition to manage a sit-down situation while the evening's libations gurgle in your guttywuts.  Although I have not yet written my review of Pieces, I will counsel you against that unless you enjoy punishing yourself for your sins.  On the taco scale, I would put them only behind Zocalo's tacos cazuela, roughly equal to Vallejo's, and above Emma's and Chipotle.  However, the savvy taco investor on-the-go will appreciate the late hours and timely preparation.  Only Chipotle is faster, but getting Tacod up at Chita's instead carries the additional benefit of shopping small and local.My four star rating is mostly attibutable to the limits imposed by the Yelp rating system.  I cannot honestly say Chita's competes with a four star sit down place.  If  Yelp had half-stars, or a separate rating system strictly for drunken eats, then I could be of more service to my fellow peeps.
<review# 2514,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/24/2006,1/5/2007,151,294,1,3,2>I love this 65th / Florin plaza and I love Huong Lan. I'm all about their less than $3 sandwiches, pho, rolls, and tapioca drinks. The service is good and fast. The place can get packed especially on weekends, so for your convenience you can easily pick up food to go-- they have fresh baked breads, hot dishes, lil' groceries, and desserts ready to go.
<review# 2515,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/17/2006,1/4/2007,118,426,1,6,1>The previous reviews are pretty on point. I would have to agree with the main points:1. The girls here are super friendly, not pretentious, not the kind who snub their noses and ignore you when they think you're not going to buy anything. I ran into one in a sandwich shop across the street and she acknowledged me with a quick "Hey!" and the most genuine smile ever, she was already off the clock too!2. The sale rack is good. My what-would-be $60 cool sweater, was only $29 and a damn good find.Their stuff can be pretty pricey, they sell brands such as Free People and Industry, but its nice just to dream about some of the pieces they have.
<review# 2516,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/23/2006,1/3/2007,58,106,1,3,1>Went there while visiting friends. Coincidentally they both work there. So I was an eager beaver to try new stuff. Had the flat bread. It was decent. We really just ended up drinking. Got a few shots, a few beers, flatbread, and a salad. It was 100 bucks? WTF? It wasn't even that great. Now to be fair I really wasn't in the mood to be a "foodie" for the night. I really just wanted to get trashed. I think I would just rather do my drinking here when in town. I mean, stop by to say hi and have a drink. I'd like to have money for the rest of the night.
<review# 2517,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/19/2006,1/2/2007,106,184,,6,1>I stopped here after spotting it on a shopping spree and was excited to try the syrian coffee.  I actually tried the turkish coffee (I am assuming it actually means the grind and way it is prepared) and it was great.  For some reason I expected it to be boiled in the pot with spices but it was straight coffee and great.  They give the coffee in the little pot and with heated milk on a metal tray.  Next time I will try the Syrian version of a frappacinno.
<review# 2518,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2006,12/31/2006,418,300,12,1,>This is the Jamba Juice I usually go to when I have a craving for a cold cold Razzmatazz. The service is prompt and friendly and the place is abuzz with blenders blaring. I usually order a "vita juice boost" but once they gave me the "femme boost" on accident which caused me to have trouble parallel parking.
<review# 2519,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2007,6/10/2007,107,151,2,2,2>Soft serve at it's finest in a variety of forms invoving cones, waffle bowls, plastic cups and those distinctive long-handled red spoons. And they have burgers. But, seriously, who goes to the DQ for their burgers?I was tempted to give it three stars just because it's fast food, but, those blizzards are just so tasty, my finger slipped to the right. If you're looking up reviews because you haven't been here, you're un-American and you were robbed of a decent childhood. I'll be out of law school in 2 years. Call me, we'll work out a way for you to be compensated. In the mean time, dig into a blizzard.
<review# 2520,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/1/2007,6/9/2007,73,142,7,4,1>I've been going to this dentist for my toofies for a while now, approaching 3 years I think.  As far as dentists go this place is pretty good.  I did have a case of the clicky-jaw after a drunken tumble and the doctor there is like an expert in the TMJ.  After my ligaments in my jaw tightened back up, I didn't have a problem, so I didn't have to go through their repair routine.The hygienists are friendly and I think some of them are recruited from Hooters (just kidding...).  I did have to remind mine that I wanted my new toothbrush after my last cleaning because I think she was jonesing to leave.  Their hours are 10 to 6 M thru Thurs and closed Fridays, convenient for me because of proximity and appointment availability after work. Minor problem in that I have to go in again this week to see the doctor and have x-rays done, why couldn't this be done during my cleaning???They recently remodeled the place a few years back with parque flooring and biege fake-leather couches.  Which I'm not too big on, I'd rather they got so LCD's up on the ceiling so they can show me trouble spots like they did at this one dentist I had in Walnut Creek.  Magazines are way on the she-she side: mostly People, and Good Housekeeping.  What's a brothah got to do get some Outdoor Magazines up in the hiz-ouse?!I wish there were a Star Trek dentist like the one in Trekkies here in Sacto!
<review# 2521,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/12/2007,6/8/2007,39,154,,6,2>Great burger:  fresh produce, grilled onions (if you like those, which I don't, so I'll ask them to hold them next time), more meat than In-N-Out, and tasty buns.Very good fries: crisp and not soggy, not over-loaded with salt.Excellent malts:  chocolate was what we tried, and it was super thick, which was wonderful.Excellent customer service:  they came around to our table twice to ask how everything was, and we watched them go out of their way to assist customers taking food outside to the outdoor dining area.Very clean:  clean tables, floors, and drink stations.  I didn't check out the bathrooms.I can't wait to go here again.  The prices are reasonable, and they really do make good sit-down quality burgers at a fast-food price and speed.
<review# 2522,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/18/2007,6/6/2007,255,791,,5,2>Ate here recently and had a large and lovely meal for under $40. The wor wonton soup was spiced with ginger, wontons, shrimp, carrots, cabage, and more. I was really impressed by the large Po Po appetizer platter, which came on a lazy susan with a small torch in the middle. My husband became full from the soup and appetizers alone, both were excellent. The decor is attractive and not overly elaborate. The beef with green beans was served in a rich oyster sauce, and the kung pao chicken was quite spicy just the way I like it. We enjoyed our meal very much and had lots of left overs. I also liked how the menu had pictures and was in a thick book format. The food was your typical chinese fair and much cheaper then I thought it would be since its so close to the galleria. A great place for group dinner, or to sit in a romantic private booth with your date. The food is very tasty, the service fast and super polite. I would eat there again.
<review# 2523,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2006,6/5/2007,19,16,2,4,4>This has to be my favorite place in Old Town. Before eating here, the only thing 'cajun' I'd ever eaten was prepared by my ex, and that was certainly unintentional. However, I was drawn in by the friendly, open atmosphere, and the good blues on the stereo was just calling my name."Charles!" it exclaimed. "Come eat here and stuff," it sung between guitar solos. The food was excellent, even though I've got nothing to compare it to.  The gator skewers tasted just like you'd think gator skewers would, namely like a rubber chicken. The waiter has been there every time I've been there; he's super nice, and super professional. He'll even bring out a sample of their fine dishes. Tip him well.I'm a sucker for the gumbo. It's good, and spicy, and hot. Add to that some top notch blues, and I'm in heaven.
<review# 2524,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2007,6/3/2007,247,159,2,9,5>WOw WOW!  Well if you are interested in a wonderful afternon or evening looking at exotic plants from round the world.  Come here.  The curator is a wonder man who will literally spend hours with you and giveyou a personal tour of the entire place.  You will get to see, touch, smell, even taste a lot of the plants in here.  A great way to spend soem time learning about the world around you.  I recomend it for any age group really! Also, this is FREE.  I love it!YEAY for BIOlOGY!
<review# 2525,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2007,6/2/2007,207,336,1,3,5>I came here last Friday because I got a $50 gift certificate for Christmas that I never spent.  I needed some new night cream so I decided that's what I would buy.  Wow, this place has EVERYTHING.  I mean talk about lotions galore.  I ended up leaving the place with Murad night cream, frosting scented body wash, self-tanner lotion, and a lavender air-freshener after being there for like an hour.  I'm surprised I didn't leave with more.  All the ladies came up to me and asked if I need help with anything, but not in that annoying way.  They were cool.  I wanted to start a party right then and there.  I also got a free sample when I checked out.  Overall, this place rocks my little get clean, cute, and comfy world!
<review# 2526,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/3/2007,6/1/2007,43,95,7,5,1>Rice Noodles is okay.  Not great, but okay.  The atmosphere is reminiscent of a 1950s strip mall cafe, with warm-toned wood paneling, western-style chandeliers and red vinyl booths.  The service is hit-or-miss.  Rice Noodles seems to have one perpetual waitress, a tiny woman whose knowledge of English is limited and who responds to every order with a loud, flat, "YEAH."  "I'd like the number 53, please.""YEAH.""And I'll have the 98, please.""YEAH.""We'd like hot tea, also, please.""YEAH."On several occasions (including tonight) the wait was interminable.  What made it worse this evening was that my friend got his food and ate half of it before my dish arrived.  The folks at the next booth who arrived AFTER us got their food and ate half of it before mine arrived, too.  Usually I order the vegetarian rice bowl, but occasionally I try one of the other veggie items.  Tonight I ordered flat rice noodles with tofu and mixed vegetables.  "Soup?" the tiny waitress asked.  I opened the menu and looked at what I'd ordered.  There was no mention of soup coming with it.  "Uh, soup?" I asked.  "Soup," she said.  "Um, is there meat in the soup?"  I asked.  "No, tofu."  "Okay, sure," I said.  Turns out I'd ordered a heaping big bowl of veggie soup with a mountain of noodles hidden deep below the surface.  I'd expected a platter of noodles and veggies with a little bowl of soup on the side, but oh well.  Like I said, Rice Noodles is okay.  Will I keep going back?  YEAH.Update 7-4-07:  My friend and I went back last night.  We've eaten here many times and if we didn't like it we wouldn't keep coming back, right?  Well, seems like the staff would be just as happy if we didn't come back.  Miss Yeah gave us her usual limited brand of service then turned and greeted the group at the next table with - surprise! - a boisterous welcome in perfectly understandable English.  Huh.  Strange, no?  My friend's meal arrived quickly but once again I was left to wait...and wait...and wait.  When my dish arrived, I turned the bowl and discovered a long black hair partially buried under vegetables.  It was draped artistically over the rim and side of the bowl, which made me wonder if it was an accident or a message.  As always, we were polite and left a tip of more than 20%.  I can't imagine why we get such nasty service, but I'm sick of it.  The food's still okay, but will we go back?  I'm tempted to say NO.
<review# 2527,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2007,5/31/2007,32,69,1,6,8>Allergy sufferers listen up... I had read that consuming locally produced honey helps build your immunity to local allergies, so I stopped in the Sacramento Beekeeping Supplies store because they sell locally produced honey.   This is a fun store with lots of crafting and candle making supplies, beeswax candles and of course, honey!  The system for buying the honey is so easy.  First you select a jar.  They have different sizes, some glass, some plastic and shaped like a bear.  They fill the jar up with honey.  That's it!  You can bring your jar back in for refills really cheaply.  My jar and honey was less than $5 and they were helpful and friendly.  It looks like some old couple run the place.  The older woman helped me and the older gentleman shuffled his feet and cleaned his glasses a lot.  I've tried my local honey in mint tea and coffee and the taste is delicious.  The only other honey I can remember having is Sue Bee, and this local stuff is far superior in taste.  They told me to use three teaspoons a day for allergies.  No problem!  They also sold other types of honey if you're interested.
<review# 2528,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2007,5/30/2007,40,133,,5,3>I love the people at Rayna's.  They are great at making you feel like you're going to get just what you want.  Their attention to detail is what made my wedding exactly what I wanted it to be.  Their food is great and they give MASSIVE amounts of it, you will indefinitely have tons leftover.  I use them a lot for events for my boss, and I always ask for Florabella.  She is a wonderful employee of theirs.  George is their awesome bartender, and he rocks, too.  By far the best part of my whole wedding (besides the whole getting married part...)!
