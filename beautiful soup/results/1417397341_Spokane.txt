<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/22/2014,10/19/2014,11,6,1,1,1>The coffee is supreme! Love the service. Im always greeted with a smile and they get me my coffee fast and efficiently .
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2012,10/18/2014,3,22,3,3,1>I love this place--a great little old-fashioned neighborhood ice cream joint. I can't believe anyone would go to nearby Cold Stone or Baskin-Robbins when we have a place like this with real character. Let's support these local businesses while they still exist.Oh, and they serve local ice cream to boot.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2014,10/17/2014,12,17,1,3,2>I recently moved to NYC from Spokane and OMG I MISS BLACK TIE! All the cafes in Williamsburg cannot compare! Friendly genuinely nice staff, DELICIOUS coffee and the best scones you will ever eat. If you come to Spokane and don't try this place at least once you are missing out big time.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2014,10/16/2014,3,29,1,1,>We purchased many items from Spokane Hardware during our recent kitchen remodel.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  The prices are competitive, great selection, and well stocked back room.They provided excellent support for both design and technical support of my LED under cabinet lighting. I highly recommend Spokane Hardware Supply.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2014,10/15/2014,0,12,1,1,1>Just had our first meal at HaHa's. We ate the chicken teriyaki which was delicious. It was not as sweet as many places make it, but my husband and I really liked it with less sweetness. Comes with a 1/2 cup of white steamed rice and a green salad with carrot slivers. There was a generous portion for the price. The food was attractively arranged on a white dinner plate. Hostess was very pleasant and courteous. The exterior is rather plain and misleading, but the interior was very clean, comfortable and inviting. We were impressed with the great reviews and so decided to try HaHa's. It was wonderful and we will definitely return often.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2014,10/14/2014,4,55,1,3,3>Love love this place! My favorite store in spokane. I could wander for hours looking at their finds. Always new items here and items you wish you have unlimited funds for.  The owners are fun and entertaining. They both have a good eye for items. Store is a large  vintage wonderland and the vault is amazing! Good prices on items, price is equal to the true value of items. If you can only go to one vintage store in spokane, pink salvage is the one!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/8/2014,10/13/2014,0,5,2,5,3>Butcher Bar continues on Sante's trend of excellence. I've been a couple times now and each time the drinks were strong, and very well crafted. The flavors of the spirits are complemented very well, and if you're someone who doesn't watch their tolerance you'll never know what hit you. The wood top on the bar is a nice touch. I do however wish they would add a foot rail to the bar. Although I haven't taken seating in the tables along the wall they look to be exceptionally comfortable. The service was friendly and prompt, my drink was never empty for long. I couldn't find a flaw there even if I was searching for one.The knocked star is due to the fact the price point on the drinks is high for the greater spokane area, and that's considering drink prices for Sante's regional competitors. The Bar menu itself is only available during the times the bar is open outside of the regular restaurant hours, and otherwise the appropriate restaurant menu is served.Overall a great experience, and I will be going back.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2014,10/12/2014,61,12,2,5,4>If you haven't had Veraci pizza then you're missing out. Go. Eat. Enjoy. Simple and excellent selection of beers. Kombucha on tap! Top of the line desserts. I'd recommend the Spicy Tony or Hot Coppa. Also the appetizers are great. I love the by the slice options! Great pairing with the walkability of the area.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2014,10/11/2014,12,21,4,3,3>I'm tempted to give this place 5 stars, but I feel as though I need to reserve that rating for the place that either changes my life from that moment, or at least makes me cry a little. All that said, this place is excellent. The pizza is exactly how I like pizza... EXACTLY!! ;) It's really amazing. They have this truffle salt that, when spread liberally over their already delicious crust, pretty much turns the crust into something I would order as an appetizer. They have French Onion soup that is also very tasty. When you mix all this with a delicious beer selection, you got yourself a weekly customer on your hands. Highly recommended!
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2014,8/21/2014,2,4,1,4,2>This place is my new favorite wing place in Spokane! They have great choices for those who don't like spicy. The meat was super tender and juicy! They gave us more than we ordered and were super friendly. We will definitely be going back. Especially on .50 boneless wings on Monday andTuesday!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/9/2014,8/20/2014,0,16,1,1,1>This place has awesome country breakfasts. I've been coming to Rustler's Roost ever since I was a kid, I remember eating there when it was in downtown Cd'A at the tiny little place hardly larger than a shack. It's now moved 3 times since then (about 25 years or so) but the food has consistently remained the same great quality. Some of the best country fried steak I've had anywhere and the gravy is amazing. It's not your typical sausage gravy, I'm not exactly sure how you'd describe as I've never tasted a gravy like it anywhere else. All I know is, it's fricking amazing, I could eat just a bowl of the gravy with a spoon. I'm not exactly sure what's wrong with the people who thinks its bland. I mean, I can understand not liking it, but not being able to taste it seems more an issue with taste buds rather than the gravy.The meal I get most often there is the Rustler's Special, which is the country fried steak, home fries, eggs, and a biscuit and gravy. I always ask for extra gravy because I dip everything in it, excluding the eggs. Maybe not the best thing for me, but it's so good, I can't help it. The service is always fast and friendly and the decor has a "rustic" charm, an old West kind of theme, if you like that kind of thing. Personally not a fan, but hey, it's tradition. All in all, I would highly recommend Rustler's to anyone.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2014,8/19/2014,8,25,1,5,2>I always love this place. The food comes out piping hot & fresh. We always get the same server & he remembers us everytime. He is terrific at meeting our dining needs without being to invasive. We come every two weeks & love the great home cooked meal & family atmosphere.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2014,8/18/2014,33,31,1,8,4>Absolutely beautiful views.  Nice easy hike - my 4 yo and 7.5 lb dog had no issues.  I can not wait until the construction in the area is complete as it has a huge play ground.  Will definitely be back.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2013,8/17/2014,0,7,1,2,1>I went here on Friday night the 16th with visiting family and my fiancé.  I used to go to this place when it was the Q all the time since I lived in Airway Heights and was eager to try out the new food as well as see the new updates.  I was not disappointed.  Some of the servers are still the same as well as the bartender.  Our server was Nicole, she was friendly and very knowledgeable about the new menu, I have had her as a server before as well and she is always great to the table I am sitting at.  I ordered the fish and chips which I liked when it was the Q and she told me it was better than before.  I couldn't have agreed more.  The rest of my party enjoyed their food as well and we had no complaints.  If your looking for a great sports bar than this is the place to go.  Sports on all TV's and great service and a fun atmosphere.
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/15/2014,8/16/2014,12,8,1,1,1>Phenomenal!!!! Great atmosphere, great service.. Had a blast glad we went to check it out! Will go back again for sure... Good prices as well.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,8/15/2014,22,5,,2,2>This place is rad. I had been three years ago and thought it was just okay... but the vibe now is so much more approachable under current ownership! Isaac is a fantastic, hands-on owner (he makes trivia night super fun!) and you can tell he wants to be sure his guests are having the best experience possible. He goes out of his way to make this so.Great food. Large wine list - now offering beer! Chill environment: cozy and inviting.Staff is generally friendly without being in your face - and service is timely and accurate. A little on the pricey side for me sometimes, but with all the improvements that have been made, and the ambiance/feel, it's pretty worth it.Will definitely recommend to friends and patrons from my work going forward.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2013,8/14/2014,4,23,1,3,2>Ate here for lunch. Great rolls, highly recommend the Bruce lee roll and the red dragon roll! Best sushi I've had in Spokane
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2014,8/13/2014,0,3,1,1,1>I stumbled upon this little jewel, tucked in the corner of a strip mall, and am so glad I did. I go there for lunch nearly weekly, because their Bahn mi have soul ( and are a killer value). There is love in the food and love in the service. If you are a regular, they'll greet you by name.I've introduced several friends to it and it is always a hit. Love this place!
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2014,8/12/2014,3,11,1,1,1>Pretty good for lunch. The service was helpful and informative. The food was great, especially for the price! All the hoagies are about $6 or $7 and come with chips too. They also have two special hot sauces to put on your sammies. I had the Italian hoagie with jalapeños added, it was delicious. I'll be back for lunch!
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,6/5/2014,37,45,,5,3>I've been wanting to stop by Morning Sun for a while.  I decided to surprise the family with cinnamon rolls for breakfast. I was warmly greeted as soon as coming through the door.  In the glass case at the counter there were several varieties of cinnamon  rolls as well as other pastries.  I opted for the rolls covered in chopped pecans.  The friendly staff got me in and out quickly so I could get home to enjoy my purchase with the family.  With about 30 seconds of microwaving the rolls were sufficiently gooey.  These were quite possibly the best cinnamon roll I've ever had.  This business doesn't look like much from the outside, but what is made inside is what we should be concerned with.  And that they do very well.My next visit will include coffee and use of their free wifi.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,6/4/2014,0,4,,3,2>I found this bistro on yelp and I thought it needed an updated thumbs up! It was pretty easy to find, the half sandwich was moderately priced for a bistro and it came out super fast! I got the bistro club panini, a delicious spin on a club. (Psst it has pineapples in it)Pretty great for a spur of the moment lunch :)
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,6/3/2014,56,31,,4,2>I love this place. Dave's has become one of my personal favorite places to meet with clients or business partners for breakfast or dinner.Great food, decent portions, and very friendly memorable servers. The bar is kept very clean and feels welcoming.Kids are welcome to eat here, however I wouldn't recommend large groups for the seating is tight.Feel free to grab a bowl of popcorn while you wait for your food.They have daily specials and I have eaten most of the menu. You can't go wrong!One of Spokane's hole in the wall places! :)
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2014,5/26/2014,11,7,4,3,3>Really delicious flavors, great spiciness scale that left my husband and I both satisfied (I'm a weenie, and he likes his food to set his face on fire). Great vegetarian option on what looked like most of the menu. And a huge menu! Cool decor, great friendly service. Neat Thai fortune rolls with the bill... Except mine said "a change in scenery is in order" and I'd prefer to keep the scenery and go back to Thai Bamboo!
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2014,5/25/2014,50,124,,3,2>Great little coffee shop that is near the courthouse and the upcoming Kendal Yards neighborhood. I love their caramel lattes. The caramel sauce is made in house and is a treat! The baristas are very knowledgeable about the coffee they serve and how they serve it. If you are in the neighborhood and looking for a fancy latte, I would recommend checking Indaba out!
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,5/24/2014,5,3,,4,3>Fantastic local joint with fresh and hearty food at a fair price!Just visited this place for the first time this past friday. I was without a car and needed a quick eat and being unable to get to chipotle speedily, I was forced to check out a new burrito joint.The restaurant was quite busy and had a long line, but the staff was efficient and served quickly.  Signs all around the restaurant (no cell phones, "'more', 'lots', 'extra' = market price", etc.) may seem rude at first, however truly serve the majority of customers who value efficiency!While I took my food to-go, I was quite impressed and even enjoyed the reheated leftovers the next day!  I'll certainly be back and probably skip Chipotle much more often.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2014,5/23/2014,0,1,2,4,2>Great appetizers: coconut shrimp and popcorn shrimp. Also tried the Spicy Miso ramen and managed to get a bite of a chicken ramen burger too! The interior of the restaurant is very clean and shouts high-design all over! Highly recommend and will go back!
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2014,5/22/2014,10,26,,2,1>I go to this place often because it's right by where I work. It is a bit spendy but to me worth it because it is local and very friendly service! Spokane needs more places like this and less corporate chains. Pros:Great ChaiFresh ingredients Fast serviceFriendly peopleGood spot to do homeworkComfortable place to socializeCons:Little pricyNo A/C during summer
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2014,5/21/2014,40,21,,4,3>fantastic flavors of ice cream... I haven't tasted one I didn't like.. that's how yummy they are. I take all my friends to the Scoop. All have enjoyed the tasty treat. Staff is very engaging to chat with.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2012,5/20/2014,17,27,,7,3>I stumbled on The Jamaican Jerk Pan (coincidentally) a few days after lamenting the lack of any Caribbean food in Spokane.  What a happy accident!   I'm pleased to report that the main dishes deliver big, balanced flavor.  The folks that own this food truck take immense pride in their product.  They are uncompromising and make a point to use authentic Jamaican ingredients in order to maintain the food's authenticity.   The menu is limited; however, the owner has indicated that he intends to expand it in the future (e.g., goat!).  I'm not going to critique each dish (Calvin L. has already hit that target), suffice it to say I have yet to walk away disappointed.  If this type of cuisine appeals to you, well... GO!  I'm giving them 5 stars because as far as food trucks in Spokane go, this is 'as good as it gets'.  Spokane, please support these good folks and get yourself a good meal in the process.
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2014,7/6/2014,11,4,,4,2>I've been here several time for dinners and can now say for the happy hour. The staff is very pleasant and knowledgeable. If you haven't been, they will bring out and explain how the different cuts of steak are cooked. The food is phenomenal, as well. From appetizers to steak, I can count on my meal to be everything I wanted. While pricey, you really so get what you pay for.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2014,7/5/2014,7,9,,3,2>This is one of those places that you are lucky to stumble upon. I got the Ruben and my wife got the philly cheese. It was a feast! Both sandwiches were amazing. Frys were made from fresh potatoes, Cole slaw was a unique pineapple slaw mix (also delish), and the corn bread came with some cranberry dipping jam. Lots of food, great price, go check it out. I will be returning many time to try all of the sandwiches the place has to offer.

<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/13/2014,7/3/2014,19,99,2,3,1>The coffee at Atticus is absolutely awesome. Dark and rich and smooth. I've never had a bad cup there. The sandwiches are also great, especially the ham and gruyere. They also carry pastries from Chaps. My favorite is the Downtowner. It's like somebody made a cinnamon roll out of croissant dough.The shop part is cool, too. Lots of interesting knick knacks, some cool books.All in all, I like it a lot, even though it CAN be a bit of a hipster haunt....
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2014,7/2/2014,30,41,,6,3>Great locally owned business! I started running with their Bloomsday program in March and ran my first Bloomsday in May. Great support, and when there was an issue, it was addressed immediately. The staff is very knowledgable and was able to find shoes and arch supports to fit my feet, and they were always willing to help roll out my muscles for me (after our runs), or give me tips on how to use their products before purchasing.
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,7/1/2014,11,32,,5,4>This place rocks!  Awesome selection of beers on tap (like 50 - no joke!)  and their menu is very creative with a lot of options.  I love their yam chips (house made) and the blackened mac & cheese.  I would say it can be tough to get in at times and sometimes the service is slow, but that's due to how busy they are.  That place is always hopping.  I also think it's cool how 'green' the building is.
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2014,6/30/2014,16,6,,4,2>Amazing ice cream! I had the metropolitan (their take on the Neapolitan) which is chocolate, vanilla and strawberry basil! My boyfriend had the salted caramel. I tried a few other flavors and I liked those too, but the strawberry basil in the metropolitan won me over. We both just got one scoop, which was a pretty large portion. I have no complaints about that and the price. I will definitely be back to try other flavors.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2014,6/29/2014,167,118,1,6,6>What I feel is one of the jewels of Spokane.  Situated in downtown along the Spokane River, it serves as a home to numerous fixed and seasonal attractions as well as one of the highlights along the Centennial Trail.  Pig Out in the Park, Hoopfest, various concerts as well as pretty much any big event in Spokane is centered around the park.  Walking, running and biking paths run throughout the park making it perfect for scenic work out or leisurely stroll.  Fixed amenities include a seasonal ice skating ring, IMAX theatre and arcade, carousel, The World's largest wagon, sculptures, monuments and many others.  With the River Park Square Mall right across the street and the many shops and restaurants within walking distance, it is truly a destination spot whether you live in Spokane or are just visiting.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2014,6/28/2014,83,76,4,5,4>Scone Ranger, I love you!I have never been a fan of scones.  The ones I've had were hard, crumbly, dry and usually flavorless.....BUT when a pal gave me a sample of his caramel apple scone, I was amazed and knew that I had to give this place a shot.A few weekends ago I was in the area and I just had to stop by to see what scones were available that day (they change on a daily basis).  The adorable gal that was running the booth greeted me with a smile and proceeded to cut up any scone flavor that I inquired about....and there were tons!!  I remember sampling the cranberry orange, mocha, huckleberry, lemon blueberry.  I sampled so many that I got full.  After much debate I selected the mocha, jalapeno cheddar, lemon blueberry and the huckleberry.  They were all delicious, but my favorite would have to be the lemon blueberry and of course, the huckleberry.They have a variety of different scone flavors, way too many for me to remember.  They also have sugar-free, gluten-free and even cheese filled scones.  Each scone is $3 or 2 for $5, or a dozen for $25.  I'm so glad that this little gem is not closer to where I live, or it would be disastrous in several ways, but whenever I'm in the area, you shall be mine, Scone Ranger!!
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2014,6/27/2014,70,32,,8,4>The Volstead Act is a small, intimate craft cocktail bar with seating for a few dozen. I have enjoyed a handful of visits here with friends and have also enjoyed a cocktail or two here when out on my own. This is the kind of place where you don't feel out of place when you are by yourself, which is quite a nice attribute.I have really enjoyed their pisco sours, which had been until the opening of the Volstead Act, only a treat that I could imbibe when in the company of my Chilean Entourage. The Ambidextrous and other highlights on their specialty menu are all worth trying. Peanuts and freshly popped popcorn also abound in this place which is great for the late night cravings...The lounge area features two large high top tables that could easily accommodate 8-12 guests a piece. There are a handful of smaller tables and around a half dozen stools at the bar for smaller groups. This is the type of place that you need to support in order to help continue to build a vibrant cultured downtown ambiance...
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2013,3/15/2014,31,76,,4,2>Authentic old school burgers served at the counter--as good as burgers get!! I like to order mine with half or no bun for a lower carb option.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2013,3/14/2014,12,26,,10,3>This place is definitely top rate and a great addition to north Spokane! The baked goods which are made from Scratch are terrific. Being one who bakes, I am very discerning when it comes to pastries and I must say that these are indeed top notch. They also serve Roast House coffee, which is the best roaster in the area in my opinion. I would highly recommend the cinnamon rolls which are gooey and fluffy! The Apple puff and Strawberry Rhubarb tart were also most excellent. If you stop in on weekdays from 2-3 or on weekends from 3-4, everything in the case is half off!
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2013,3/13/2014,2,3,,6,2>I LOVE THIS PLACE. Great place for anyone to go. Every Thursday they have a live band and $1 beers. They have a huge selection of beer and wines and cider. My favorites are the Spire cider and Blackthorn Cider. The Lamb burger is to die for, same with the Blackened chicken soft taco. Excellent service Everytime. Everyone who works their is friendly and knows how to do their job! :) I go here about once a week if not more! My favorite place in CDA for sure. If you go to Spokane I suggest trying The Elk and The Porch which is in Hayden! They are all same owners and menus are very similar.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/16/2013,3/12/2014,70,32,1,7,5>Always a great place for breakfast and dinner. Lunch is not bad either, although there are fewer of the dishes that showcase their care and talents. Several years ago, I wagered a friend and colleague that the then newly opened Santé restaurant would be around longer than he would as he doubted that Spokane would have the sophisticated palate along with the willingness to invest the budget required for food of such caliber. I won, and Santé has only gotten better since then.Recently, I decided to invest in some of their house-made bacon. It was well worth the investment and the bacon stretches out a lot longer than store-bought bacon, which is pumped full of added water and a has a lot more unpleasant fat.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/20/2013,3/11/2014,35,64,,5,3>Oh how I love all things Atticus. Owned/managed by the same wonderful people of Boo Radley's, the store offers unique gifts, home decor, oodles of tea selections, fresh roasted coffee, and delicious local pastries. This is my FAVORITE place in Spokane, hands down.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2014,3/10/2014,11,11,,6,3>A new favorite in Spokane - very warm and attentive service, excellent cocktails, and the food was fantastic. We stopped in on a Friday evening with no reservation and were lucky enough get a two-top in the bar area.So many interesting options on both the vegetarian and non-veg menus, but we decided to split a few of the smaller plates (which really weren't very small at all). The Portuguese Clams and the Spinach Arancini were delicious - I would definitely recommend both of these dishes. We ended with a cheese plate that didn't feature any selections that were out of the ordinary, but the house-made fennel cracker served with it did stand out.It's also worth mentioning that this was one of the few bartenders I've visited lately who actually knows how to make a dry martini that's well, dry.

They have a great selection of appetizers for your first course. I got the French Onion Soup, which was very good.We both had the very tasty 8oz prime rib, it came with a loaded baked potato, and a chunk of broccoli . Then desert of Red Velvet Cake . There is no way you will go home hungry from here, the portions are very generous .The restaurant is beautiful inside and I always enjoy eating here.

Hopefully you're in the mood for more than the divine appetizer I adore, because if you are, you're in for a real treat! The place doesn't skimp on class and often rotates their specials to accommodate a philosophy of "local and freshest/in season is best". Try this place!If artisanal food served in a laid back quiet atmosphere is your thing, this place will delight you!

I was a little hesitant to come here because of the mixed reviews it had here. I came here with a friend and I got the Pho Dac Biet. This is usually what I get when I try a new pho place for the first time. I wasn't disappointed at all. I got the small bowl and there was plenty of noodles, meat, and broth in it. I will definitely come back here to try other dishes on the menu. My dad makes pho for me on a regular basis and of course, nothing beats my dad's cooking. However, if I miss home, I will know where to go.
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2014,4/26/2014,20,37,2,5,2>Love, love, love the pizza! It was delicious! They always have great house made soups and the chef comes out in the restaurant when he can, asking for feedback (or fishing for well deserved compliments!) on whatever you had. Great atmosphere and friendly staff.
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2013,4/25/2014,36,16,1,6,3>I have been bringing my cats here for 7+ years & I just love the vets & techs.  After all they were the ones that saved my baby Osiris' life & figured out what the issue was. They are always available when I call for any issue, big or small. The new location is awesome & sweet. Even though I have to drive 25 miles to get there it's well worth it!
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/18/2014,4/24/2014,2,19,,7,4>Fabulous in every way. Had the meatloaf...not your mamma's. Good beer selection, full bar and deserts. The best mix of 5' diner and next century bistro. We'll be back.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2013,4/23/2014,41,69,,5,4>These guys are awesome!! Come prepared to spend money but it's money well spent. They measure your feet, watch how you walk and make sure the shoes are perfect before buying and if they become not perfect they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. I've always gone to nordstrom for my gym shoes but I won't be going back for that purpose. These guys proved to me buying from an expert matters!
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/20/2013,4/22/2014,1,2,,5,2>This location is a multitude of welcoming atmosphere all in one building. The owners, Paul and Sarah, are wonderful and have obviously created a close knit community of visitors to Forza. The house is always buzzing with laughter and small groups of friends chatting about life. They have outstanding taste in wines and beer. The food is aromatic and overwhelmingly good to the taste buds. Well worth the wait while enjoying a good drink. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a calming glass of wine or a wholesome beer after a hard days work.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2014,4/21/2014,0,6,,3,2>This is great place!  Fantastic meals that are like home-made.  My family and I always have a great time going there.  Love the clam chowder and fish!

<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2013,4/19/2014,84,3,,4,2>We took our family of five here in August 2013.  The service was great, the location was excellent and the food was fantastic.  We ordered the breakfast burrito,  a scramble and kids breakfast sandwich's.  Portions were great and everyone loved their meal.  Definitely check this place out.
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2014,10/10/2014,155,351,5,5,4>So a five star trained chef opens a hot dog truck....No, this is not the start of a bad joke, this is the basic history of the origin of some of the best grindage (thank you, Pauly Shore!) that I have ever eaten. The Big Red is the owner's nickname, but big are also the portions!  Some people might look at $6 for a hot dog and lose their mind. But the dogs are big. And they aren't crappy Ball-Park or Bar-S, they are quality high end stuff. And the flavors packed on em, just wow. I love the bacon wrapped dog...that also comes with great BBQ sauce, cream cheese sauce, and grilled onions.  One bite and...just wow. Now, they also have cheesesteaks. Chicago trained or no, I have been to cheesesteak Mecca, Philly PA. The birthplace. Where the "authentic" cheesesteak is from. Big Red's cheesesteak is not authentic...it is so much more!  Spicy garnishes and lots of juicy, dripping steak goodness. You better just get a load of extra napkins 'cuz this is messy eatin'!  Some people might complain about lack of seating, or they may find something else to knit pick. All I can say is, one bite and you will get a five star feeling in your stomach. Just wow.

<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/20/2014,10/7/2014,2,14,1,2,1>I live near this salon and have started to frequent getting my nails done here.  I am very happy with each visit to Fancy Nails.  They have a fairly attractive, clean salon with newer pedicure chairs.  Excellent pricing.  Every time I leave I'm more than happy with my nails.  Also, added perk is they keep the place super warm in the winter.  All the ladies do a great job, my only complaint is I wish they would rub my hands longer with lotion.
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/23/2014,10/6/2014,1,2,1,1,1>In preparation for my wedding I decided to get waxed and as a first timer I was terrified. I had heard nothing but horror stories of waxing and how much it hurts. Not to mention, I'm a bigger girl and getting naked in front of a stranger who is going to be that up close and personal with my nether region was not high on my bucket list. I've got to say Carole made me feel super comfortable and  confident. Her experience in waxing put me completely at ease. And my friends were wrong, it wasn't that painful. Maybe a couple notches above your eyebrows or about the same as slapping a sunburn but the pain lasted maybe 10 seconds. Carole is fantastic at waxing and even better in customer service. I will refer everybody I know to her, especially first-timers.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/23/2014,10/5/2014,5,6,,1,3>I recently started working out at The Bar Method, and it is awesome. It is such a friendly environment and I love all the instructors! Such a great workout!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2014,10/4/2014,1,10,,4,5>Great new lounge! We tried 3 of the small plates, all delicious! And two great cocktails, both great. The food was really reasonably priced but the drinks were on the pricier side so we only opted for one round. Still, great place, we will be back soon!
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2011,10/3/2014,13,17,,5,2>The grocery store has quite a selection of local, organic foods, and a nice bulk food section. The packaged items are slightly spendy but what you'd expect for organic quality foods . I am a sucker for cheeses and I think they have some of the best prices in town. They have a unique and clever cheese platter in the cheese section with smaller cheese bites you can buy so you have the chance to taste a whole variety of new cheeses. They also have a nice wine selection. My husband and I meet and eat lunch at their bistro deli several times a week because they have a lovely selection of healthy, delicious, and freshly prepared salads and entrees. They have two "soups of the day" and one is always vegetarian- Yeah! I check their facebook page daily to find out what the new soup and sandwich specials are. There are two large, glass garage doors which open to outdoor seating adding a great atmosphere. They have some nice specials for members with a 10% off everything day once a month and a "happy hour" day weekly offering a few discounted produce items for members on that day.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2014,10/2/2014,4,35,,2,2>I really enjoyed trying and ultimately bought my wedding dress here. I had no idea what I wanted and my consultant Samm gladly let me try on whatever I fancied and gave me a few great suggestions. The ambiance is significantly better than other places I visited but still could use a little updating. I would rate it 8/10 overall. I ultimately bought mine from their outlet/clearance center. It was a great experience.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,10/1/2014,4,4,1,2,2>Service: Excellent. Food: Fantastic. Environment: really good. Drinks: are you kidding me - awesome, please try the punch tasty and a fantastic value.When I was in Greece we really wanted to try sweet breads but they were out, who knew it was the table in spokane that would deliver, and they were tasty.Cheers!Brent
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/17/2014,9/30/2014,1,3,,2,1>This little eatery is in a great location....just off the main downtown street enough to get a seat. It was a weekday lunch hour, but I only had time for takeout so I stood in line. I was standing next to people at their tables who were eating, and I felt like I was interfering with their lunches...maybe if the line or the tables were moved it wouldn't feel awkward.However, that is the only complaint...the service was fast and the servers very friendly. I ordered the large Moroccan Lentil (with a hefty spoonful of Parmesan) and a wedge of Beer Bread with butter. I took it with me to the park since it was such a pretty day---that's the way to do soup in the summer. The soup was rich and perfectly seasoned, the lentils the exactly right firmness (can get mealy when soups have to simmer for awhile). The bread though...wow! I love chewy yeasty breads, and this was it. Kind of sweet, beer-y, chewy, and something else I can't quite figure out. Definitely delicious, especially when sopped in the broth.The large order lasted two lunches, and the soup was just as good the second day.
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2014,11/10/2014,2,23,2,1,1>Wow. Michelle gave an amazing facial and Rebecca gave an equally amazing massage. After being on the hunt for a place that could simultaneously give my friend and myself different services, we feel like we've found a winner, and our go-to pampering place in CDA.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2014,11/9/2014,0,10,2,2,2>Went during ironman, hostess did not explain the iPad system and hardly acknowledged us. Our server was very knowledgeable and prompt. She also explained they were short staffed and often run out of things since they are still so new and getting their bearings. Disappointed they didn't have the tacos we wanted to order, but the "Bono, because he said it was good" shrimp cakes were great. Very impressed with the quality and quantity of portions for their prices. Great summer spot for a casual or group lunch on a nice summer day!
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2014,11/8/2014,0,4,1,2,2>Glad they finally opened one in the valley! Happy Hour 2-6. Mushroom Swiss burger and fries was outstanding! My husband and I shared one and were quite satisfied and full! Staff is amazingly friendly! Great place to dine and go to a movie afterwards as it's right by the Regal cinemas.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/2/2013,11/6/2014,4,28,1,2,>Just about the most authentic Thai food I have had since visiting Thailand a few years ago. Sweet people running this restaurant. It is super casual, but clean. This is my new favorite Thai place.  They even have Mango/Rice dessert!
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/9/2014,11/5/2014,108,33,,2,1>So good! Who knew you can do so much with grilled cheese. Half a sandwich is huge. Add cup of soup and your stuffed. Had the Rooben which was fantastic. Can't wait to go back and try others.
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2014,11/4/2014,83,76,3,8,4>Cafe Carambola, I adore you.A few weeks ago my cohorts and I made the trek down here to this cute little place.  The first thing you see is a beautiful display full of salads.  As we started grabbing menus we were greeted by one of the owners.  Since this was our first time here, the lovely man started to explain all the salads, what they contained and how they were Latin influenced.  All of them looked beautiful and fresh.  Once we sat down and started to peruse the menu we were asked if we wanted anything to drink.  We each ordered an herbal tea.  His choices were either room temperature or iced and green tea lemonade or hibiscus tea.  We ordered our teas and he must have overheard me questioning what hibiscus tea tasted like because a moment later he brought out samples of it for the whole table.  After tasting the hibiscus tea I promptly switch my drink order to it.  So refreshingly good!  I ordered the Club Style Quesadilla.  Now, this can be ordered with several meat options or black beans for more of a vegetarian option.  I got the black bean option and I'm glad I did.  This was the best quesadilla that I've had eating out.  It was stuffed full of mozzarella, bacon, pico, avocado, black beans and served with a side of chipotle sour cream.  Amazing!!Cafe Carambola has so many choices to choose from; salads, sandwiches, quesadillas and wraps.  I can't wait to come back and try them all.
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2014,11/3/2014,58,13,1,2,1>They are fantastic.  I have a very shy and dog aggressive German shepherd.  So I was concerned about dropping him off initially.  They were not concerned about my dog and said he would do fine.  They took him back for a 30 minute trial, I came back 30 minutes later and they walked my back.  My dog was with 15-20 other dogs, getting along with all of them fine! I have dropped him off there numerous times now over the past two years.  I have always had a great experience with them! I have him groomed while he is there as well, they also do a great job grooming.I love my dog like a child and would never drop him off if I did not feel good about them!  Highly recommend!
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2014,11/2/2014,4,6,1,5,2>Here goes...We wanted Chinese food...good Chinese food. Turned to Yelp and, since we were already familiar with most the Chinese restaurants in the Inland Empire, we found Wah Hing. We hadn't been to Rathdrum for a while, so we decided to take a chance (and a drive).  The closer we got, the more reviews we read. Here's our story:  We were greeted and seated by friendly and courteous staff. Water and hot tea came promptly.  After reviewing the menu, we decided on Vegetarian Egg Fu Yung and the Special Combination House Lo Mein. Wow!  Generous portions of the best Chinese food I'd had in years--maybe in my lifetime!  Seriously!  And ample enough to take home some for later. (True confessions:  Yes, I did hide it in the refrigerator. I didn't want anyone else beating me to it!). Well, we paid the bill, vowing to return. (And spent the next 6 days dreaming and talking about more of that yummy food.) When we couldn't stand it any more, we took the second journey to Rathdrum (21+ miles each way) IN A WEEK!  This time we ordered Mu Shu Pork and Chicken with Black Bean Sauce.  Sooooooooooooo good!  There was such a generous portion of Mu Shu that I wished for extra pancakes and a little more hoisin. Here's the thing:  the ONLY thing bad about Wah Hing is there is not one in close proximity!  The food is great, the service is good and I can hardly wait for the next Wah Hing experience!  I'm hooked on this oh-so-yummy food!  Thanks!  We'll be back!
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2014,11/1/2014,11,48,1,2,2>I am in love with their white chocolate iced mocha.  It's got great coffee flavor.  The whole grain blueberry scone is a must try!
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/29/2014,10/31/2014,19,7,1,2,2>Had the lunch bento box with pork katsu. Pork katsu was great, but it could have used a little more sauce. The tempura was the star of the show. Really fresh and perfect in terms of size, taste, and texture. Not a huge fan of california rolls with imitation crab but the ones here were good. I was impressed with the quality of rice and I'm excited to come back and try some of their sushi.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/23/2014,3/27/2014,20,48,1,3,2>I strive to find places that are always consistent with service and food quality; Twigs is one of those places. The hummus and pita bread is one of my favorite appetizers and my favorite entree is the Thai Chicken Pizza! For dessert The Sticky Cookie is a must have. I have never left unsatisfied from here.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/27/2014,3/26/2014,17,20,3,6,2>VEGAN! ~ ORGANIC! ~SUSTAINABLE CONSCIOUS ~ and AMAZING!This is my new favorite place in spokane. the food was super yum and the juice great. everything they serve in containers that are sustainable, compostable and you can leave it in the compost bin right there in the shop. the girls behind the counter were very friendly and helpful. I was very please and cant wait to return again and again. My only qualm is that they serve *Agave in some drinks. But they can make the drink without it no problem and even substitute with dates or something. *Agave is just as bad as high fructose corn syrup when analyzed how it metabolizes in the body and functions with the mitochondria. My in depth nutritional studies woke me up even though there is a lot of otherwise marketed concept and debate out there in main stream. Also, its not as sustainable friendly and not just a plant product. the process it takes to derive the agave syrup is horrendous process and uses chemicals.Education opportunity and point. They also use neat little green tokens instead of gift cards and they can be reused again and again. I think that's really smart. Full support and prosperity! There is a METHOD to their Madness, but their is NO madness. healthy, whole and delicious....and karma clean
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2013,3/23/2014,4,4,,5,2>A great neighborhood pub. Summertime is great to sit outside on the patio. New menu items are a regular occurrence, keeping things fresh. Popular items stay the same, with my favorites being the clam appetizer, yam chips, and the lamb Philly cheese steak sandwich.My wife is gluten intolerant, and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about allergy information. A huge beer selection, with lots of local craft beers. I have two small kids, and they are always welcomed but it is not generally frequented by lots of families.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/16/2013,3/22/2014,4,8,,3,1>Ok.....I HAD to go try this place out again now that there is new owners. The smokiness is finally at a level it needs to be!!! Anyone who tried before DEFINITELY needs to come back. The new owners seriously rock & so great to work with. Great way to start out, in my opinion!  They catered our rehearsal dinner for lots of family in town from the south. Our family (true southern bbq critics) were blown away!!  Yum doesnt seem good enough!They were serving up at Green Bluff too for the fall season & they never seemed to be without customers - yet service was incredibly friendly & quick. Since you were at eye level with their service window, yoy could see inside. As a germaphobe, I was impressed by their cleanliness & sanitary efforts. Portions are plentiful & the price is right.Aside from all this, they really make you feel like family. I'm a new loyal customer that will return often :)
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2014,3/21/2014,11,32,,5,4>This location rocks and the interior is cool.  A little on the dark side, but it works with this atmosphere.  It's nice to have another Irish pub in town.  The wait staff is awesome and very friendly.  Good selection of beer and the menu is unique but plenty of choices.  Can't wait to go back!
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/11/2014,3/20/2014,12,4,,3,3>My friends and I went around 2:00 Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy so we sat at the counter, which I had actually never done before. We watched the cooks work as we browsed the menu, which had a lot of interesting options through out. It is just a diner, but I thought it was a little more creative than your average breakfast joint. I ended up ordering Eggs Lopez which I honestly have to say is my new favorite breakfast in town. Two corn tortillas (very thick, almost like an English muffin) topped with black beans, spinach, and pork, as well as a poached and a delicious spicy hollandaise. Fresh salsa and a fried jalapeño to top it off-- hash browns on the side of course. I saw someone one else at the counter order some giant mountain-like scramble that I wouldn't mind going back for.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2014,3/19/2014,1,2,2,4,4>Awesome drinks and food. We are mixing angry orchard everything from vodka Rum pineapple coffee  pretty much everything at the bar it is very wonderful tasting.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2014,3/18/2014,84,4,,6,2>The best Vietnamese place overall in the Spokane/CDA area. Definitely going back and highly recommended. The service was great- friendly, outgoing and personable which was a surprise because most Vietnamese restaurants lack service that most Americans are used to. Decor and atmosphere is very nice- updated and renovated. Unlike most places that are ridden with cheap, cheesy fake flowers. Clean! And the best part- the great food. Pho broth is robust and flavorful. We left very satisfied. Looking forward to a return trip to try something else!
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2013,3/17/2014,12,3,,6,3>Very delicious. The flavors were complex and blended well together.  I ordered the gorgonzola filet satay and the gorgonzola crumbles were fresh off the block.  The side salad with truffle dressing still has me thinking about it one week later, it was that good.  I also got the apple pork chops with goat cheese whipped potatoes.  O-M-G!  The pork tasted like it was infused with apple and the goat cheese whip was so creamy and flavorful.  My husband and I shared the bread pudding which was perfectly dense and moist and deliciously warm with some very frozen vanilla ice cream on the side.  They also give you a golden loaf of bread smothered with dill garlic butter as an appetizer.  It was so delicious my husband and I are already planning our next visit there less than 2 weeks after the first.  Don't miss this one!
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2013,3/16/2014,11,45,,5,2>Lovely classy setting!  Don't skip to the dessert, omg!  The cookie dough gooey pie, amazing, so many great choices, i wanted a sampler.  Coffee-awesome.  Dinner, manicotti & red pepper tortilini very tasty.  Husband had a pizza, homemade dough.  Ill HAVE to come back to try more dishes.  Nice, attentive wait staff & reasonably priced too!! Compared to other Italian restaurants in the area ill give this place a 5.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,11/30/2014,37,45,,1,1>This was our first visit to Gerardo's and it was excellent. The prices were cheap, the food was very good, and we'll probably start eating here more than we should. The carne asada burrito was stuffed with meat, guac, and pico.  It was about the size of my forearm. Everything about this was very tasty. My wife had the bean & cheese burrito which she said was very good. It was also huge.  Atilanos has long been my favorite Mexican food in Spokane.  I'd say the carne asada burrito at Gerardo's has the edge over Atilanos version by a very narrow margin. If your looking for very good Mexican food this place is worth a try.  Once you do you might just be hooked.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2014,11/29/2014,114,114,,,>Now this is the kind of breakfast diner I've been looking for since moving to Spokane! Just a place to get a delicious no-frills breakfast. Their food is absolutely delicious. I had the corned beef hash. It was some of the best I've had. My wife got the hot cakes. They were the most perfect little hot cakes. Tender, sweet and fluffy. Good enough on their own that you could eat them without syrup. The only issue here would be the wait for both food and seating when it's busy, but it's completely understandable. There is very limited seating and, when we went, there was only one cook. Despite the limited staff, they are very friendly and take good care of you. My biggest issue is that i don't really fit all that well at the bar, but I'm about 6'6" so I don't think most others would have that issue. Either way, the food is well worth any wait or discomfort I may have experienced.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2014,11/28/2014,18,21,,2,2>This shop is the best I have found for my Mercedes. The owners Sven and his wife are great. they really know how to treat the customer right. They are always friendly and helpful and upfront with costs, what is needed and what is not. I found them by going to the local Mercedes dealer who tried to stick me with a HUGE bill. Sven and his crew checked everything and told me I didn't need ANY of the services the dealer tried to get me to do. Wow saved me a couple of thousand $$.I will keep bringing my vehicle here and I know I can trust that they will treat me right
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2014,11/27/2014,10,13,1,4,4>I had originally given Adelo's a bad review back in 2012 at their old location. At that time they only had take and bake and the pizza wasn't that great. On par with American (not even trying to be Italian) pizza like Papa Murphy's or Dominos.  Things have changed.  Along with the new location are hot made to order pizzas that are in the Italian Neapolitan style (otherwise known as New York Style).  Thin crust, foldable, huge pieces.  And the pizza has flavor without overpowering saltiness so common with places that hide their cheap pizza under tons of salt.  And if you order extra cheese that's what you get.  Not like Dominoes where you can't tell an extra cheese pie from a regular one.  The new store has a good vibe and would be a great place to watch a game or go out with a group of friends for a beer and a pie.  I liked how when my pie was brought to me for takeout, the gentleman at the register opened the box for me to approve.  As you can see from the pictures I posted, I was not disappointed.
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,11/26/2014,22,55,2,2,2>Very great for their Thursday brewery and trivia night. Have been a few time and love it. They have a full bar for the spirits lover.

Today my color was done by Caroline Bickford and cut by Bree Benfield. They both are excellent and I can not recommend them high enough! Caroline knows how to work with those bothersome greys and Bree is amazing with long hair and layers. These stylist provide the same quality service as anything I ever received in the fashion industry. They both have had specialized training from leading hair experts such as Bumble & Bumble. Go see them today and you will not have any regrets! Tell all your friends! Caroline and Bree are the BEST!!!

Came in on a Friday night at 7:30pm seated at 8:00.Had a party of 10 guys including myself.The waitress & buser at our table where incredible. Very helpful. You can imagine splitting receipts would have been a nightmare but the waitress did it, she split ALL of us incredibly well. Great service.And the pizza? As a first timer, incredible! I split a house pizza with another guy and started with a green salad on my own with dill vinaigrette. Grand total of 14.00 plus tip.Really good experience.

The service was excellent, the prices were fair, the environment was comfortable and the food was very fresh. With what I do know about sushi, I would say this was very good. I will be going back for more.
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/31/2014,11/21/2014,7,23,1,2,2>Hands down better than Walmart for groceries. They carry some awesome local products like fresh Spokane milk. The big plus for me is there huge selection of beer.

<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2014,7/26/2014,89,25,,2,2>Anytime I think of breakfast in Coeur d'Alene (especially if I want breakfast for lunch) this is the place that always pops into my head first! Enjoying my food sometimes on the hot ...clear your sinuses...side I often order the Courageous Omelet. Can be a great cure in the morning after a local brewery pub crawl the night before :) Whether visiting town or just a local looking for some breakfast, lunch or second lunch I suggest checking this place out!
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,7/25/2014,0,5,1,1,1>Meat. Cheese. Bread. Eat. It's as simple as that... The folks at Dominis have the process down. Between the sandwich and the popcorn you will not leave hungry. Nothing but high quality ingredients.
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2014,7/24/2014,12,3,1,3,1>This little burger joint is located in one of the oddest spots, but that just adds to the charm. The burgers themselves are juicy and delicious. They come with a side of home made potato chips that are just as good. My date and I also opted for a side of fries and onion rings. Both were fantastic! The 70+ beers they offer only ensure that there's something there for everybody's taste. I have not one complaint about Wiconsinburger and highly recommend it to everyone.

I hope someday they'll open a location in the Valley so it's not such a drive.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2014,7/21/2014,6,35,1,3,1>What a great place to meet up with friends and have a relaxing casual Mexican dinner!  The service is friendly and they aim to please.  The menu is varied so everyone is sure to find something they like.  Besides, they will customize a dish to your specifications within reason, which I appreciate a great deal.  The music is relaxing and appropriate, too.  And let's not forget the taste... Very yummy!
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2013,7/20/2014,6,8,,3,1>Good little place for a quick bite to eat.  This was our first time in Couer d'Alene and we just strolled by an decided to go in. I had a decent hummus wrap with a really good crab chowder. The girlfriend had a grown up grilled cheese with apples that was pretty good if you like strong cheese. Beef selection was pretty good too for a smaller wine place. Overall good experience.
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2013,7/19/2014,5,83,1,5,3>It would be five but the interior is a bit sparse, and not fancy enough.  Having said that, let me say this is one of the finest ethnic restaurants in Spokane.Authentic.They sell dinguan cooked in real pigs blood!  White people, caution. Do not eat it.... It's an acquired taste and you are too old to acquire it.  I loved it when I was six living in Manila, but for you?  So much other good stuff on the menu. Anyway, low prices and nice people so you know you are helping out a family.Great great food. A good intro would be pancit and chicken adobo. Then ask around....the shrimp sinagong (sp.) is a very nice stew.Very good place.  Very high recommendation.
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2014,7/18/2014,8,14,,2,1>This has really blossomed into a great place to eat and have a few drinks.

<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2014,9/27/2014,73,21,1,2,4>Also like Manito, another cool park in Spokane! How many towns can say they have rapids and waterfalls in the middle of their downtown? A great legacy from the 1974 World's Fair. You have a clocktower, the unique tent-like shell of the old U.S. Pavilion, an IMAX theater,  a Victorian-era carousel, and if you walk along the paths near the river, you might see little marmots frolicking around among the rocks. Right in the middle of downtown Spokane so it's hard to miss it. A must see for the Spokane visitor.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,9/26/2014,70,32,2,5,6>I was recommended to try this place by a bartender from a downtown Spokane establishment I frequent. I made the 18.5 mile trek to Liberty Lake and found a most agreeable building, with a beautiful interior. I was thinking how inviting the place looked as I headed to the small bar area to the right of the entrance.It turned out that the place had not officially opened, but that they were hosting a few private parties until their official opening on Wednesday, June 25. My contact had misinformed me.... The bar manager (?) was kind enough to allow to stay for a drink, which was very much appreciated. I enjoyed the feel of the place and the staff were friendly. I had a look over the menu and a number of items called out to me, asking me to return soon to try them. I have been told be many other insider sources that I should expect the food to be perfectly exquisite and the service time to be well paced, allowing for the more relaxed, lengthy dining experience that people who enjoy lingering in nice restaurants seek and cannot often find.I hope to return soon and look forward to reporting on the food.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,9/25/2014,31,76,2,6,5>Best selection of interesting movies in Spokane with intimate theaters and comfortable seating. You'll see movies here not offered in any other theaters this side of the Cascades (and some main stream goodies too!)I appreciate that they serve their endless popcorn in actual bowls that get washed and reused and have a nice water station with real glasses!

I appreciated that she took time to do a good job but I was still out of there in about 10 minutes! It was a very good experience and I am defiantly going back - well worth it.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/8/2014,9/20/2014,0,3,1,2,1>Great service awesome work and honest work. Couldn't have done better work. The repairs aren't a quick slap a part on and throw paint on it, they get the car to a pre-accident shape before painting and blending that paint so that you could never tell it was ever in an accident. Lifetime warranty on paint parts and labor. Best in Spokane hands down. Why settle for less than the best?
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2014,9/19/2014,24,8,1,2,2>This place is down home food. The atmosphere is welcoming and inviting!  Their pizza is unrivaled and their beer buddies to die for!  All their food is incredible, to say the least. Whether they know you or not, you're family. Great local place with charm and charisma oozing out!  Salads are top notch, great sports on the tvs, a variety of beers on tap that is ever changing  can't beat it. I may be a broke college kid, but I can scrape together enough for some of their beer buddies. Where else can you get full for about five bucks!?!?
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/16/2014,9/18/2014,1,12,1,1,1>This is the best pizza joint in Kootenai County. We can get into fights about whether Capone'e or Wildcat's pizza is better, but Capone's is a bar that serves pizza and Wildcat is a pizza joint. Having said that, the pizza here is very good. It's not "grandpa came off the boat from Naples 150 years ago with twenty lire, a suitcase full of oven brick and a sauce recipe and we haven't changed a thing in all that time" pizza, but it's delicious and the cheese is just right.

I had the breakfast burrito, and it was delicious...and huge! My wife had the salmon Benedict and she thought it had too much sauce, but the salmon was excellent and they have generous portions. I would come again!
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2014,8/9/2014,0,13,1,2,1>Kinda tucked in along Government Way (across from the fairgrounds) and nondescript, this was worth the find!  I went because of the other Yelp reviews, with 4 teenage boys and my husband.  No one went hungry, that's for sure!The menu was wonderful, and the food was, too!  Lots to choose from including an entire page of omelets.  All the meals were enormous and yummy.  The waitress/bartender was efficient but almost hostile...could have been the table full of boys, though!  I got the feeling this is a local hangout, and we clearly are not locals.

<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/14/2014,8/1/2014,0,18,2,3,2>Diamond in the rough I tell ya. Once you navigate through the holes in the parking lot and get inside you will be delighted with the food, drinks, and atmosphere. I have been to Cheap Shots about 4 times now. They have done a great job of renovating the place inside and out from what it was before. If you are a biker, you will love the drive in gate and parking area outside. I am not, but its a great concept and layout. I know they have live music and such but I have never attended those events. I'm guessing they are worth seeing though.What I can tell you is they have great f-ing food. I've had the burgers as well as breakfast a few times. Nice to see a variety of different style burgers you won't see anywhere else. And they are all great! Me and the wife have had breakfast there a few times and we will definitely continue to go back. Their breakfast sandwiches are the best I've ever had. Even the potatoes that come with are better than most all hashbrowns. It really is that damn good and 2 people can share one sandwich easily. Also, if you're a fan of bloody mary's, its worth going just to try theirs. Also one of the best I've tried.Lastly, I'd like to comment on cleanliness of the place. They do a great job. I know it was a super dive before it became cheap shots. They've done a ton of work and they have kept up on the maintenance. Its one of the cleanest places I've seen. I definitely think getting the parking lot holes addressed would be worth looking into though. It would definitely deter a lot of hot rod and show cars from entering.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/14/2014,7/31/2014,2,57,1,1,2>The space rules, it's really easy to get some work done here. The coffee is good, but the food is just ok. Nothing to write home about. Prices are decent as well.OH, they also have beer! So when you're tired of drinking coffee, you can switch to beer and get your day really started.
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2013,7/30/2014,0,11,1,1,1>Barbara exceeded our expectations in every way! After working with two other landscape designers we contacted the WSU Master Gardeners resource line to ask who they would recommend, we'll it was Barbara. After the first couple meetings with Barbara our vision and ideas started to emerge both in her description of plant material and the feeling of space that complimented our unique house. Her knowledge of plant material is simply amazing. We also had Barbara meet with our architect so that both the structure and landscape would not conflict but compliment each other. In fact, at one point during the design phase we visited a local supplier with Barbara and her descriptions while looking at material made it sound though she was in a kitchen creating a French menu of wonderful food. Wow...it was coming to life. Then, she helped us out with the bidding process and contractor selection. To top it off, we kept here on the project by having her oversee the implementation of what she designed, all the way down to accepting plants and plant placement. We just hired her again for the backyard following the same successful process. Barbara is an amazing resource when it comes landscape design.

<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/22/2013,3/4/2014,155,351,3,11,5>I can't believe the amount of food you get here for such a small price!  WARNING:  the "small" sandwich is still big!  Smaller appetites are recommended to bring a friend and split one of these. I had the Pile Driver, a big roast beef, cheddar and pepper jack sandwich. It has mayo and horseradish, and I had mine on sourdough. And it was simply great. All sandwiches come with Tim's Cascade chips and a pickle spear. Clam chowder is apparently Ivar's, which is fairly good. Place is super clean, and seating arranged well. Shamus himself runs the show here apparently, a big friendly guy who likes to greet people and learn their names. He runs a tight ship but still has time to chat with the regulars. In addition to prearranged selections, you can build your own sandwich if you prefer. They have a small beer selection as well. You won't find THAT at Subway. So glad that this location opened up close to my house.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/10/2014,3/3/2014,88,167,5,7,7>Came here to celebrate my birfday with a bunch of kickass girls on a snowy, Friday night. The place was not busy at all, but that could've been due to the inclement weather. This dinner was one of the best times I've had in recent months. Let me tell you why.     First off, sake bombs. The girls and I (4 of us total) each ordered a sake bomb to start things off the right way. None of my friends had ever done sake bombs in the traditional way (with chopsticks, yelling "Ichi Ban Sake Bomb 1 2 3!") so, that seemed like the perfect thing to do. We made a mess but our server and a sushi chef, Charlie I think, helped us clean up. I ordered the Tiger roll and a scallop hand roll. Everyone else ordered a bento box, udon, and vegetarian bibimbap. We had lots of food, beer, and sake on our table. It was a happy sight.      The girls told the restaurant it we were here for my birthday so they pulled out some extra special shenanigans for us. There was one other guy celebrating his birthday so the whole restaurant sang us happy birthday. Charlie especially got into it. Then he came over to our table and chatted with us a bit. He proceeded to do a dance for us which involved a bottle and two spoons between his knees. That memory will live with me forever. He's a super funny guy and an awesome chef. As we were leaving, we found him outside shoveling snow and taking care of the patrons' cars. What a guy!     I originally wanted a sushi boat but it was too expensive. However, we ended up breaking the bank anyway with all our alcohol and food. One of the better sushi places I've been to in Spokane. And they have their own lot, a huge bonus with any business downtown.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2014,3/2/2014,8,23,1,6,3>Not only a sushi bar one of the best places in Spokane to have teriyaki chicken.Cozy atmosphere great place for first date.Service was timely and friendly.Please please bring back the cheesecake!
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2014,3/1/2014,5,44,1,4,3>I absolutely LOVE their coffee. The Abbey is my favorite drink, but Snickers is also a great one. Very consistent in the drink making and staff is always friendly and usually knows what I want by the time I get to the window.The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I feel they don't always do a good job at making sure both lines are helped equally. Anytime I go through the shorter line (the side that only fits 3/4 cars max) I will wait for 10+ minutes and about 3-4 cars will go through on the other side for every 1 car that is helped on the shorter side. I feel like they cater to that side more because there are more people. Anyway, great coffee and great service!
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2013,2/28/2014,50,124,,9,2>Fun place to go! I can't really say if it's a sports bar, restaurant, or club; it's more like a combination of the three. They completely revonated it and it looks so much more trendy and appealing than Ugly Bettys was. They serve Mexican food until last call which was nice on a late Friday night to help sober up. The street tacos were ok, the quesadilla was good. The drinks are pretty good, I think they used fresh squeezed oj in my screwdriver which is a plus! They do have a big selection of tequilas too if you like tequila. There's a dj that plays on the weekends, but I think they are still figuring out where the dance floor will be. Spokane is finally getting a couple of nice chill trendy "big city" like bars which is greatly appreciated. I can see myself hanging out between here and the Blind Buck across the street a lot in my future.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2013,2/27/2014,99,224,7,11,10>I feel the need to update my review since I come here so darn frequently!We've been making a weekly pilgrimage to Stella's for our carby fix, and we have no intention of slowing down. Every last time I've come to Stella's I have found the staff to be kind, cheerful, engaging, thoughtful and hilarious folks. Over the summer, we experienced some good old-fashioned bad luck when we were planning of our wedding rehearsal dinner - in true Spokane fashion, our first venue shut down with nary a word of warning, so we regrouped and formulated a backup. Then, less than a week later (THREE DAYS!) the second venue BURNED DOWN. So, by this point, I was at my wit's end and I had no idea how to move forward. Please keep in mind that all of these crises transpired inside a month of our scheduled event. So, with less than a month before my wedding, I was tasked with finding a venue to accommodate 30 of our family members on short notice, choosing a menu AND finalizing all the last minute arrangements pertaining to our ACTUAL wedding. This is not the stress-free celebration I had hoped for. I posed the dilemma on facebook in an attempt to crowdsource my solution. LO AND BEHOLD! Who should save the day but mister Jon B. himself.  I had considered Stella's briefly, but we didn't want to impose on any local businesses by asking them to remain open outside their normal hours of operation. My worries were swiftly put to rest and I was assured that it would be no trouble. I gave them the loosest of guidelines with which to create our dinner menu and a generous hard maximum budget (now is not the time to be stingy!) and cast it as far from my mind as my bridey brain allowed.  About three days before the wedding, we came here to lunch and a cram in one final last-minute logistics planning session. My fiancee stepped out for a moment to feed the meter, and I was fortunate enough to have a long chat with one of the owners; the incomparable, impeccable, Ms. Marti B., who cast all my fears by the wayside and encouraged me to move forward knowing without a shadow of a doubt that this was going to be THE most perfect day. Her comments soothed my soul, but I am positive that neither of us could know exactly how correct she would be. On the day of the event, I raced around like a madwoman and arrived at Stella's fashionably late ... The house was full, the drinks were poured, the lovely Hannah was treating us to her limitless piano skills and the dinner smelled ... OH, how the dinner smelled. In a word? DIVINE. No, that doesn't suffice. I can't be thrifty when these words, these adjectives, they're so essential!It was faaaaa-haaaaaa-bulous. Utterly, purely, tremendous. I will admit that my nervous stomach wasn't cooperating with my eyes, but once the drink of choice was thrust into my anxious grasp, I felt sure that I would find my way back to hungrytown soon enough. I forced myself to take a small plate to sample the chef's stylings in an attempt to jumpstart my appetite. Spoiler Alert: It worked. I made my way back to the table for seconds of the most succulent Coq au Vin ever to grace these lips, thirds of the brilliant Cassoulet, fourths of the Gougères.. SEVEN TIMES in total. I filled my small plate to overflowing SEVEN TIMES and ultimately gave up with the pacing and parked myself in front of the cheese plate and picked at it for the remainder of the evening. That is, until the mousse was served, at which point I promptly ate three. In case you're wondering -- the dress fit like a dream the next day and I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about the meal .. even for a moment .. on my wedding night. I would stand in front of Stella's every day for a month, waxing poetic and singing songs of undying adulation.I will continue to spend each and every Saturday night here (as is our custom) for as long as I am able, noshing on sandwiches with the love of my life, surrounded by this amazing community of wonderful friends because if ever there was a need for it ... This place; Stella's is precisely the kind of establishment that a sad, lonely world so desperately needs more of.If that's not love...

<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,4/12/2014,5,7,1,5,2>They make their dumplings fresh, from scratch. My husbands favorite restaurant in Spokane. It's not your "everything is beaded, fried and nowhere to be found in China" type restaurant. The food is prepared in a healthy way by actual chefs and there are flavors I have literally never had in my life like figs or dates paired with spicy black beans. These are not cookie cutter meals. The hot food is actually hot and the flavors are complex but they work. Something for everyone. It would be an absolute shame to go here and not get the fresh, handmade real dumplings. Not the heart attack kind. Love it here!
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,4/11/2014,6,8,,4,2>Always a pleasure to spend time in this space. Nice use of space with an area with booths for comfort, high tops and a bar area.  Located conveniently in the Downtown Spokane area and walking distance to many attractions, a great place.  In addition, the food is always wonderful and the staff have always been top notch! Good job #Saranace #Spokane
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2014,4/8/2014,76,315,,5,2>Very nice selection! I like how they have the store organized so it's very easy to find what you're looking for. They have really great clothing and shoes for affordable prices. I haven't traded anything in before but plan to!
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2014,4/7/2014,13,26,,3,2>Last night while on our way home, my wife and I had one of those, "chips, guacamole and a beer sounds really good right now" moments. We stopped in to Casa De Oro for the first time in years, and now I don't know why it's been so long! The service was prompt and friendly, the chips and salsa was standard (my wife liked them but the chips were a little too thick-cut for me), but the guacamole was awesome! We decided to order nachos too, and I must say for just your standard chips/beans/meat nachos, they were probably the best I've had in a very long time. The price was also extremely reasonable for the amount of food you receive. The chicken was delicious, like really good homemade roasted chicken that's been basting for hours. Their draft beer selection (of one) could definitely be improved, but since Dos Equis was what I wanted anyway, I shouldn't complain. All in all, it was nice to be back and see it's still a good place to enjoy a great meal. Do yourself a favor and skip Azteca, come here instead!*Side note: I remember when I was a kid and we'd just moved to the valley, my parents took me to Casa De Oro and I ordered a cheeseburger. Big mistake, the whole staff started chanting "Cheeseburger! Cheeseburger!" My wife said the same thing would happen to her little brother back in the day. Anyone know if they still do this? I think it's hilarious!
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2014,5/9/2014,89,25,,2,1>Nice fresh salad and enjoyed the coffee! Nice to see another option in Hayden. Great place to have a morning meeting or even in the afternoon :) would be a good option for anyone staying at the Holiday Inn or someone heading out for a day at the lake!
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,5/7/2014,0,18,,5,3>What a pleasant surprise this place was. Some friends suggested Boomers on a Saturday night to catch up. They said it was kind of a divey place but fun. No problem, I've been to many dive bars. Some the divyest in Spokane. This place is a diamond in the rough. We had a great time. Had amazing, friendly service. But here is the real kicker, the food was equally good, which is so rare in the bar scene. I had the 6 oz choice sirloin and fries. It was perfect. Truly choice sirloin. Very tender and delicious and whatever they do to their fries, I wish more places did as well. The fries were not overly salty, they were obviously cooked fresh as well, crispy and super hot on the plate. We shot pool and listened to a little music before leaving. We had a great time. Would definitely go back again. My only complaint would be how close the smokers hang out by the entrance doors. It was probably 10 feet or less. There was a lot of in and out from the door so the smoke followed as well. I do realize its a bar and people used to smoke in them, but an extra 10 feet from the entrance would make a world of difference. I didn't even take a star off for this as I don't know if its more-so the bars fault or just general lack of courtesy on the smokers part. Smoke stinks people, I could care less if you are rotting your lungs, but I don't want to smell it every time you go in and out.
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2012,5/6/2014,19,99,,2,1>This place is really good. The food is treated with respect. I have enjoyed my meal every time. It's all good. Everything from the popover butter to the coffee. A perfect place to dine. Love it.

<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2013,5/3/2014,2,1,,4,2>I love this place.  The acrylic nails are so fun and last such a long time.  No matter how stressed or  in a hurry I am, the experience leaves me relaxed and with a great product to show for it.  I especially love the level of professionalism shown by all the staff.   One thing I absolutely hate is constant meaningless personal chatter while I am getting a treatment.  At Brickhouse the staff is a perfect balance.   They are friendly and talkative enough yet I never have to worry about being bombarded with personal small talk.Bravo to the owner for putting together this business combination!Mary moltke

<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2013,4/30/2014,2,5,1,6,3>By far the very best peanut brittle I have ever tasted!  Great flavor, texture, and good sized peanuts as well. Davenport Hotel has made their version of Bruttle's, but there is just no comparison. Davenport Hotel does not even use real chocolate in their soft peanut chocolate brittle! Chocolate flavored coating is the first ingredient- yucky.
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,4/29/2014,1,14,1,4,3>This place is very good. Food was very fresh and flavors were on point. The service was very friendly and fast but not too fast :). Also very affordable. This will be a spot we visit often.
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2014,10/30/2014,0,12,1,2,2>I began consigning clothing and jewelry items here a few months ago and have been very happy with the customer service, store credits/money sales for my items and the selection of items they carry. The store is clean and well organized, the prices are great and I almost always leave with a few pieces of "new" clothing for myself, even when I only intended to drop items off!
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2013,10/29/2014,4,8,1,1,1>Great place, great service, great food...CONSISTENTLY. Also, you're able to order pitchers of No-Li here which is great as their food is far better than you'll get next door at the brewery. Great place to eat at prior to or after a Zag's game due to its proximity to GU.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2013,10/28/2014,0,4,,1,1>My Son & I love this place! Tasty breakfasts, plenty of food, best bacon in town. Service is always fantastic, friendly, and courteous. Always on my list for breakfast options.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/28/2012,10/27/2014,3,3,1,2,2>Charming atmosphere: there's something so quaint about eating a no-holds barred breakfast while watching an old school diner guy orchestrate a symphony of spatulas slapping on the grill while his adorable wife runs the counter and chit-chats with diners. Simple food; simple concept, and simply great.
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2014,10/26/2014,0,13,2,2,2>Most people don't know about this place because they never look beyond Sprague. It's a sports "dive" bar. Don't expect the Peacock Lounge or Bistango. There's music, food, and drinks. It's relaxing. We walked in once when I first moved here and now we are regulars. The food is a lot better than I expected for bar food, I am constantly finding new favorites. They have tons of options and are pretty flexible - the pancakes are delicious! The drinks are well priced compared to anywhere else. The music can be a bit louder than necessary, and some of the band's aren't ones I'd listen to but most of the music played is great.Also, they do catering and to go orders! Along with karaoke, dueling pianos, more than one pool table and darts!Overall, this is my go-to spot. Always a special or something gong on. Plenty of reasons to give it a try!
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2014,10/25/2014,2,8,,1,1>Went in on a Monday night before a show. There was a small crowd watching the Monday night game but it was chill. JT the bartender was very nice and made great drinks.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2013,10/24/2014,2,10,3,4,3>My family has had a Spokane club membership for about 10 years, and I love it.There are other clubs with larger facilities, but I have to say I love the friendly feel of the Spokane Club. The weight room is rarely (if ever!) full, and the staff members are all friendly and helpful. Let's not forget the fact that the entire workout facility overlooks the Spokane Falls. I couldn't ask for a better view!I also love all the other amenities the Spokane Club has to offer. Lots of family friendly events. Don't even get me started on the food. Chef Moser is amazing, and he gets all of his ingredients locally and he changes his menu seasonally. I can eat at the Spokane Club year round without getting bored.
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2014,10/23/2014,2,4,1,6,5>This place brings me back to Sunday dinners when I was a kid, having grown up living with my German grandmother.  My favorite memories are of her and I in the kitchen. I can still see her hands as she kneaded bread dough, shaped noodles, pounded rouladen... All the aromas, sights and sounds come back to me when I walk into Das Stein Haus. I must admit, I haven't given the whole menu a try. I always end up ordering my favorite, the ultimate in comfort food, kasespatzle: Pan fried housemade egg pasta topped with Swiss cheese, crispy prosciutto, and green onion. And my God, they do it right. I have a friend stationed in Germany right now that doesn't understand the appeal of spaetzle because he's only had it done wrong. I can't wait to take him to Das Stein Haus. The service is friendly, the food is amazing , and even better for me... The memories are priceless.
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/9/2014,10/22/2014,0,17,1,2,2>A really nice eclectic mix of coffee shop, micro-brew bar and bistro. The decor is clean and inviting. No two chairs in the place  are the same which adds some casualness to the environment. I was there for coffee and it was quite good. I ordered my test drink, a Flat White which was prepared with coffee from a local micro-roaster and locally sourced milk. The waitress was very friendly and keen to know if the drink met expectations, it did. After the Flat White she topped off my cup with drip coffee. Both were well above average and very enjoyable. I would like to go back and try their breakfast, the omelets looked good.
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2013,10/21/2014,1,9,1,3,2>I attended the Bon Jovi concert this month. I did enjoy the arena, but when I was at my seat on the floor near the stage, my group and I noticed that it stunk of vomit. Once we had found our seats we decided to go find our seats where we will be sitting for the Pearl Jam concert next month. To get to them we walked across the floor and we noticed that everywhere stunk of vomit, but once we got up in the stands it stopped smelling. We tried to tell an attendant, but I do not think she was very concerned. Other than the smell which lasted the entire concert, I thought the event center was great. I am super excited to go back over Thanksgiving for Pearl Jam!
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2014,7/17/2014,0,4,2,4,1>I have been to several Mexican restaurants in Spokane and have never really been entirely impressed, until I had randomly gone out to eat with my mother and decided to check this place out. The food was delicious and authentic, and the chips and salsa was a nice addition to our meal! I am now a regular customer at Rincon and I have to say the customer service is excellent. Miguel, one of the servers always greets everyone with a smile from ear to ear, and ladies, he is "muy guapo"!!!! I definetly recommend this place to everyone in town!
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2014,7/16/2014,0,5,,2,1>Great coffee, and the best Chai I've had in town, the staff has always been very friendly, and the atmosphere is superb.I knocked off a star because the hours they list on multiple sites should have a disclaimer: "We may possibly be open during the following hours, maybe, if the stars align right." Especially the 10AM on Saturdays they claim, it's more like noon, and at least one saturday it was still closed at 12:30. This evening was a Thursday and I attempted to stop by only to find them closed around 5:30pm
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/27/2011,7/15/2014,0,6,,3,1>Great local, family owned restaurant! Very affordable. Not touristy. Daily specials are interesting and very reasonably priced. Breakfast selections come in smaller sizes in a "petite" section of the menu. A "side" of ham is big enough to share (with a group!). It's also some of the best ham I've ever had, moist and flavorful, As a real estate broker I take all my clients here. It quickly becomes one of their favorites. A favorite of locals - there's a reason. Try it - you'll LOVE It!!!!!!!

<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,7/13/2014,0,8,,4,2>This is one of my family's favorite places to go out to eat. We go at least twice a month.  I have never had a thing on the menu that we didn't enjoy. The only draw back is thay it is fairly small. So on a Friday or Saturday you can expect a fairly long wait it is always packed. The Kiernan is a family favorite. It is there cheese blend with white sauce, sausage, arugula tossed in truffle oil with an egg in the middle. It is amazingly delicious. The crust is always nice and crunchy with a little char and a nice bit of salt. We also always like to get there home made chip. So don't let the wait scare you away it is worth it.

<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/7/2013,7/11/2014,31,76,,5,2>EXCELLENT fried chicken and a biscuit that will make you cry it is so good. Unfortunately I ordered the trout. It was...good but not as amazing as what my date ordered. Drinks were decent. I enjoyed a couple of glasses of sparkling wine.One this that really stands out here aside from the food is the atmosphere. LOTS of work went into the details here--VERY cozy and authentic country/southern feel. Great lighting. They were also able to seat us as a relatively large party of 10 (with a reservation) with no problem.We enjoyed a long evening at the table talking, drinking and eating. I will definitely go back!!
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/6/2013,7/9/2014,5,18,,2,1>Can't say enough about Dr Velis and his staff.  I had a front bridge break after 20 years and was heading out of town two days later. Dr Velis provided me a temporary solution that looked great and then a beautiful replacement that work great, until my dog chewed it up! Again, going above and beyond the call of duty and got me a replacement in 2 days. My wife and I know see him and his son Nick, the other Dr. Velis in the office. Nick is young but, knows his business and is very professional.
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,7/8/2014,33,52,,3,1>Fun local brew pub. They only serve the beer they brew but the beer is pretty damn good. Norse Nector is my favorite. They don't have food just beer but this place is really worth a visit. You won't be disappointed.
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,7/7/2014,1,2,,2,1>Awesome food, bring your appetite because that servings are huge. Glenn and his crew are so helpful.

When I arrived the lobby was crowded with people waiting for tables, so I headed to the lounge. Glad I did! I relaxed at the bar while watching the servers hard at work mixing and pouring drinks. The lady who handled my order in-between drink orders was friendly and attentive, checking on me whenever she came by. I'll definitely be back to try another dish - maybe another curry? Yumm!

Amy in the floral department was excellent! She talked in depth with us and helped us put what we wanted into words.

<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,3/30/2014,35,43,,3,2>I love this place!  In my opinion, this is the best steak in town.  Service is always great and the building has a great ambiance.  This time, my wife and I came here during "restaurant week" in Spokane. They have a great 3 course menu for $28, which is a screaming deal!  We both started off with the caesar salad - which was excellent.  I love the slivers of parmesan cheese on top!  Also, they bring out a plate of garlic ciabatta bread - it's incredible!  For the main course, I had the prime rib (medium-rare, of course) which was top notch.  My wife had the salmon, which was also delicious.  Both came with garlic mashed potatoes that are outrageously fluffy and delightful!  For desert, I had chocolate mousse and my wife had the creme brulee.  Both were great, but the creme brulee was the better desert.  Definitely check out the clink.  If you've never tried it out, check it out during restaurant week!
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2013,3/29/2014,32,2,,3,2>Boo-Radley's is seriously the best place to find a random, hilarious gift for someone you love. Spokanites, Trekkies, Fangirls, and vintage toy fans will all find something to like. You have to comb over the whole store to get the full experience. They have a great book section with tons of funny and unique literature, and some amazing local art. Whenever a friend comes to visit, I always make sure to take them by Boo Radley's because its like an amazing, hilarious museum of strange toys and knickknacks. Definitely worth checking out. Plus, their staff is really cool.- Kait C

<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2014,5/17/2014,4,31,,4,1>Zola is where I go for drinks downtown when I want to feel classy. It's got a nice vibe. The interior is really nice looking despite being somewhat cluttered and busy. There is an old boat hanging from the ceiling, tilt-a-whirl cars as seats in the upper level and a number of other items that would normally not be found in the same place, much less work well together.The staff is always very friendly, though the bartender can be slow. My friends and I used to go most Sundays for their happy hour. However the prices have steadily increased to the point where the savings is non-existent, so we don't go as much anymore. The reason I'm giving Zola a four star rating mostly because I'm glad it is here. Spokane doesn't have enough places with great ambiance, live music and good drinks.

<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2013,5/15/2014,83,5,,2,1>Daanen's is one of CDA's best kept secrets. This extraordinary delicatessen slash wine slash beer haus is one of my all time favorites. Each time I goto Daanen's I wonder why I don't eat there more often. Ordering is fun and easy, you fill out your own food ticket by highlighting your desired ingredients. Today I selected French bread, turkey, bacon, provolone, cream cheese, tomato, lettuce, mayo, mustard. Customizing your sandwich is half the fun of eating at Daanen's. All the ingredients are very fresh and the bread is out of this world. I highly recommend the French, the best way to describe the bread is soft and fluffy. Other than the scrumptious sandwiches they have plenty of other homemade items such as baked mac n cheese and some killer lasagna.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2013,5/14/2014,49,9,,2,1>I really love the new menu and seating.  The entire venue is more welcoming and less like a cafeteria.  The seats are incredibly comfortable.  The booths are a nice addition to the seating options.  As always the huge TV is a major draw and I enjoy coming and watching Football or Basketball with my friends. The new menu items make the decision on what to eat so much harder but doesn't matter what you choose its all delicious. If you've never been its worth checking out.
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2014,5/13/2014,11,16,,4,2>My Mom and I stopped in for a quick glass of wine and an appetizer. Wow!  The Sweet Potato fries were to die for.  Every bite I tasted another fabulous flavor!   The dinner menu looked a little pricey but I am more than willing to come back to give the entrees a try based in what I've had so farAdditional info (was short on time last night).  This is a nice gem in a location that you would not expect.  Don't judge the restaurant based on it's location at the end of a strip mall by the railroad tracks.  The atmosphere is classy, staff was friendly and attentive.

Crunch on a donut is brilliant because of the juxtaposition of textures; the crunchy cereal and the soft donut.  The vanilla icing would usually be just a delivery system, but it was really tasty.  I will definitely be making a point of getting over to try more!
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,5/10/2014,8,25,,2,3>Even as a fully grown adult I can't get enough of this place! Everything is so fun. They have the newest & coolest along with all the old school classics everyone loves. The prices are right & all the staff are wonderful!
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/2/2014,6/25/2014,8,36,,5,1>If you're looking for an amazing hotdog...this is the place to go! My wife and I tried the Ruben Dog and shared some chili cheese fries. The all beef hotdog was delicious and fries were great! Not many places to get a great hotdog in Spokane, so this fills a much needed spot!
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2013,6/24/2014,71,50,,2,1>Carousel is perfection. The owner Jenny truly is an expert on vintage clothing and you really can find the perfect dress/coat/skirt for whatever occasion you are looking for. She is a perfectionist with the quality of her selection. You will never find clothing here with any flaws (never a stain, rip, or strange smell!), and she can look at your body and know your size! It is a fact that women are larger now then they were 50+years ago (DUH), but Carousel DOES carry all sizes. She has everything from frothy cupcake prom dresses (lots of tulle!!) to gorgeous one-of-a-kind wedding dresses. There is also cocktail dresses, psychedelic jumpsuits, tapestry bags, amazing hats, plaid cloaks, and office skirts +more! This isn't Value Village, THIS is a high quality vintage boutique. I have been in many times and found the most gorgeous pieces for my wardrobe. I have seen that her clothing has been also published in fashion magazines and websites as well. As for her personality, I've always found the owner bubbly and gracious, and can carry on quite the conversation. She always has smiling eyes and the cutest outfit! Check out Carousel for your wardrobe! It is the Saks 5th Ave. of vintage in Spokane!

<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2013,6/22/2014,0,36,,2,1>I've always been pleased with this place.  The pizza is probably the best in town.  We've also had sandwiches, smoothies and salads from here, and they've all been fantastic.It's a simple, independent joint, and the staff is always great and friendly.  I only knocked it a star because of the delivery, which really isn't their fault since they use the "Cd'A Food Delivery" service, and both times I've used them, they've been slow.  I've even spoken with the owner (I presume) about this, and he's been beyond apologetic, and I truly believe it wasn't his fault, but that of the third-party service.
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/20/2014,6/21/2014,9,21,,3,1>Great beer, great setting, run by great guys.Stop by for a tasty fresh pint or two and you will not be disappointed!Glasses are clean and filled!!!!!My favorite is the powder keg!Tom and Brian - thanks for the tasty brew and a great place to enjoy it!
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2014,6/20/2014,19,133,,2,1>This is such a cute little store in CDA. They have tons of stuff from jewelry to clothes, scarves, and room decor. The style is kind of hippy-ish, but there is a large variety!
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2011,6/19/2014,13,4,,2,1>One of Liberty Lakes best places for coffee and food. Friendly staff.  Good food and service.
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2014,6/18/2014,10,27,,3,1>Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Spokane. I've now tried most of the menu and have not been disappointed once.Favorite entree: Mac & cheese or House PieFavorite appetizer: Baked Pretzel with vegan cheese. Affordable. Awesome staff. Reasonable prices. Good beer. I will always recommend this place.
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,6/17/2014,6,5,,4,1>Some of the best pho in Spokane!  Don't let their awful decor make you walk out the door.  Besides when your head is bent over an amazing bowl of pho, you don't care what's hanging on the walls.
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,6/16/2014,12,18,,2,1>This is a great spot for lunch-- especially if you work at or near the courthouse. The selection is kind of limited to just sandwiches, but the sandwiches are really good. I especially recommend the portobello! Also their tomato soup is great and the employees are super nice.
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2014,6/15/2014,7,9,,2,1>Ambiance is a little dark, but fits the restaurant well. They have a good beer selection and good service. I used to try various things on their menu, but after having the gumbo it is now all I get when going. I love spicy and the gumbo is ass-kicking enough to make my ghost pepper eating craziness happy.
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2014,6/14/2014,13,23,,2,1>One of my wife's favorite places to eat in Spokane, and she is right on the money here.  Great food, quirky atmosphere, and a great bakery selection makes this one of our favorite breakfast spots.  Always a great to eat here.
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2013,6/13/2014,21,6,,2,1>Always amazing. Atmosphere and view are wonderful. Food is fresh ! Great cooks! Friendly service. The regular lunch cook is amazing! One of Spokane's top shelf restaurants.
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2013,6/12/2014,10,2,,3,2>I don't mind spending a little bit more money to know my clothes are getting done quicker and more efficiently. The location isn't the best...but... It is very clean inside and the clerk was extremely helpful when I walked in the door. As much as I don't like laundry mats the laundry room is the only place in spokane I trust to get my clothes clean.
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,6/11/2014,0,1,,3,2>Clean, friendly, educated, spa atmosphere. Love this spa. Returning client here. Great manicures and Pedicures. Massage a++!!
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,6/10/2014,17,22,,4,1>Went here tonight as a part of restaurant week and was pleasantly surprised.The place is intimate and charming and located in a quaint old house.The service was spectacular but not over the top uncomfortable.The food was amazing in looks and taste. Ordered the mushroom soup, wild halibut, and salted Carmel ganache dessert. The mushroom soup came out in a little cup with approx two tablespoons of mushrooms in the bottom. Then the waiter poured the soup from little individual tea pots into the cup. Super cute idea. The soup had a lot of depth and layers of flavor with a light earthy herbal aftertaste. Wonderful! The table bread is made at clover and was so moist and dense, it was almost like a pound cake. My halibut was cooked perfectly soft and flaky. The dessert was small but I'm not sure if that was because of restaurant week. What the dessert lacked in size was made up for in flavor. So rich and sweet and salty. Anymore and I would had gotten diabetes. Everything was perfect! Scoped out many other peoples food and it all looked amazing.The drink menu is overwhelming in that so many of the drinks sounded delicious. My my server was very gracious and took the time to explain many of the drinks to me and what was involved in each.My only complaint is that my stomach doesn't have the greatest capacity. I was painfully stuffed and had to take my dessert togo. Will be back soon!
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/21/2014,6/9/2014,4,13,,5,1>Go see Jessica, she is the best.  I go to her every time and the service and quality is exceptional.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2014,6/8/2014,4,34,,2,2>This place is small has a simple menu.  I wouldn't dream of changing a thing.  The burgers, and fries are great.  They have homemade buns. I am not an ice cream eater, but I hear it is great.  They have the handsomest waiter with a beard, and dreamy eyes.    I will always frequent this place.
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2014,6/7/2014,26,8,,3,1>Do it! Great time, service, and food. A must! We did the "name your price" and we were impressed! We will be back often, thanks for coming town!
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/5/2014,6/6/2014,18,6,,3,2>The ambiance is hip and unique for Spokane.  I enjoy their artwork & the live artistic videos projected on the window.  The drinks are original and delicious.  The "Spoken Word" is my cocktail of choice.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/7/2014,11/20/2014,10,26,,2,3>This bank is friendly and local which is why I support it. The online banking used to be really bad compared to other bank's websites but they just improved it and now have an app. Woohoo! They are willing to work with you and have reasonable rates. One complaint I have  is only having $200 at most if you deposit your work check through the ATM. There is a 2 day waiting period to get the rest of the funds. Other than that I do recommend this bank.
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2014,11/19/2014,20,37,,2,3>Love the pizza. Super friendly staff and great atmosphere. They're new lighting is perfect! You must try the buffalo cheese bread... And the calzones... And the salad... And the Grey Goose Melon Mule... Try it all! You'll love it all! Go on... Get a piece!
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/3/2013,11/18/2014,6,8,2,2,2>Forza has a wonderful atmosphere inside. You walk in to find a fireplace you can sit around or there are four really comfy club chairs to sit in with a Flat Screen TV to watch. Or, you can choose to sit at regular tables and plug your computer in and get some work done or study or just chat with friends or family.  Towards the back is a wonderful wine & been bar with great Happy Hours.  Food is great, and inexpensive should you want to have a meal. Drive through makes for convenient should you live in the area and want to jet in and out for coffee.  Staff is extremely friendly.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,11/17/2014,2,33,1,2,2>We've been several times and it is consistently fantastic.  By far the best pho we've had in Spokane and we've been nearly everywhere.  The ambiance is much nicer than most other pho restaurants.  We went in around Christmas and the owners gave patrons a small gift thanking them for their business...a memorable touch.
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,11/16/2014,7,11,1,4,4>An amazingly awesome place! The breakfast is always on point! The older server lady has a fun energy and always makes me smile! I had the biscuits and gravy with eggs over easy... so dank
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2014,11/15/2014,2,57,1,2,3>Great place to grab a beer before going to the arena. They have what is probably the best pinball machine in all of existence there too, so bring some quarters!
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2014,11/14/2014,11,196,1,3,2>This area of Riverside State Park tends to be less busy than the Bowl and Pitcher, yet it also offers a larger concentration of hiking trails as well as some of the more difficult rock climbing routes in the Spokane area.
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2014,11/13/2014,14,36,,3,3>Nice place, however...There are only a few items I can ever find that I like at this store. I think the prices are WAY over the top for some things... $70 for a sheer t shirt is wwwaaaayyy too much for me. $120 for a pleather jacket? I went across the street and found 10 comparable jackets for less than half. It's a super cute place with trendy clothing and great staff. It's always clean and neat, I just think it's well over priced, even for a private little boutique.  Free off the street parking and I do check back every so often and have made a few small purchases.
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,11/12/2014,2,18,2,2,2>Clean, professional, friendly. I have curly/frizzy hair and had a cut, layered and style done by Brittany (used a razor/scissors). She did an amazing job!!! Used her fingers, a round brush and bumble and bumble products to blowout my hair and nothing else, most stylists like to use a straightener but Brittany didn't and she made my hair soft, voluminous and bouncy :) Thanks, Brittany!Also, they don't accept tips but you can give your stylist a gift card.
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2014,11/11/2014,7,115,,3,3>Came in on a October Sunday morning around 10:00am and were expecting a wait. It looked very crowded outside when we drove by and we turned around ready to leave dissapointed and the crowd had shrank so we parked and waited only about 20 minutes. I was excited about the Chicken and Waffles and it was so worth the wait for. Hubby got the breakfast fajitas  and they also were very good. The service was quick and the a Bloody Mary's were very very good. We both enjoyed ourselves and will eat here again soon.
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2014,9/6/2014,30,41,,2,3>Great small place.  I have a short haired dog, so we only visit once or twice a year, but they do a great job for a reasonable price.
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,8/30/2014,0,10,1,3,1>By far our favorite restaurant in Spokane.  I am the meat eater and my wife leans towards vegetarian dishes.  I had the bone in pork chop that was absolutely wonderful.  She had vegetarian pasta and meatball dish.  It too was very nice.  Carrot cake to die for.  On a very busy night, our server was extremely helpful and attentive without being a nuisance.  Highly, Highly recommend.
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2014,8/29/2014,38,184,2,2,3>Our two poochies just had a return to see groomer Frankie yesterday for cuts and baths. Both look great! Proprietress Aquila and Frankie really listened to what our needs were and followed through for the desired cuts. I have not used the self-serve tubs. There is also a good selection of pet toys, treats, and food for sale. The shop is located in a little strip mall on Newport Hwy, backed up by E Holland Ave., adjoining the south side of Rosaurs Supermarket on North Division, at the Y.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,8/28/2014,35,9,2,5,4>This is a great event. It is organized and executed exceptionally well. It's amazing how over 250,000 people descend upon downtown Spokane and it's not cluttered/clustered. It may get busy in the food vendor area, but that's to be expected. There is enough seating around each street court, plenty of bathrooms (porta potties), and a decent amount of trash/recycle containers. Hoopfest is such an awesome social sporting event with excellent people watching. I don't play basketball, but love watching my friends and and everyone else compete. If you've never been, you really ought to check it out!
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2014,8/27/2014,27,8,1,2,1>Chapala was the beginning of the Mexican(restaraunt) revolution in Spokane when Felix opened up on 29th and Regal, I remember thinking to myself "It's about time" Being from California I have been spoiled with good Mexican food and Chapala's is right there with the good ones. There are some bad reviews here and I'm not sure how much credence I can give to their experiences other than it might have been a bad day for everyone involved.. There is no velveeta cheese that I know of in any of the food they prepare, it is all fresh and authentic. Man, I think I'll eat there tonight.
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2014,8/26/2014,44,49,1,4,3>You can't go wrong with the professionalism an knowledge Mr Levi Knight. His ability to provide a valuable service is second to none. He can design recipes, provide instruction and help troubleshoot and issues with the art of craft wine and beer making. Don't bother dealing with the pompous folks in Spokane.
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2013,8/25/2014,17,44,1,1,1>We absolutely love the quaint atmosphere and the food is great. My only regret is we don't make it there enough.I had the filet and shrimp tonight. The steak was tender enough to cut with a fork. The creme brulee cheesecake was a nice finisher, but the key lime pie/cheesecake stole the late show. The owner is always engaging and makes it feel almost like you are eating at home.The decor is an interesting mix, but thankfully lacks the pretentiousness found at a few other south hill fine dining restaurants. The prices aren't cheap but they match what is being served. Cost-sensative foodies should come for happy hour...4-6. Half price beer, wine and apps.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2014,8/24/2014,2,28,1,2,2>Always neet clean. Well taken care of. Good lighting. Hardly ever see any equipment that is out of order. Friendly staff. (Not always staffed) Very affordable. It only takes one quarter to start the car wash or the vacuums. Not two bucks like most of the other car washes.

<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2013,9/16/2014,50,124,,5,2>They have awesome beer! I think the time you go here can affect your stay. I have been here all different times and days, and Monday nights are a good time. Good service, awesome food with huge portions, and weekend hustle is nonexistant. Service on the weekends can vary, and food isn't as well presented. But the beer is good no matter when you go. During the summer they have a nice patio right next to the river.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2014,9/15/2014,56,31,2,4,3>I have to say that for as long as I have lived in Spokane, I am really mad at myself that it took till last summer (2013) for me to actually eat at this wonderful place!This is the type of quality Spokane needs more of! :DThat said, I was on my way home from a business trip with a bunch of co-workers. I was looking at Yelp, and saw this little gem. (How I had missed this place while driving past it on my way to school most mornings for 2 years I have not the slightest clue!) We decided to stop and order an assortment of sandwiches and pastas! I was blown away by how fresh and delicious the taste was of most of the items we ordered. (I say most because I only tried a few from those that offered to share, but i'm sure they were all amazing.) After recently coming back to eat here with my grandma, she too was impressed by the balance of unique flavor in her sandwich. I will definitely be hanging out here for lunch a lot more! I am guilty of falling in love with Caruso's pasta bowl. Pictures to come on my next visit! Thanks Caruso's for such wonderful food!Want to know something absolutely positively AWESOME? If this is your first chek-in with Yelp to Caruso's Sandwich & Pizza Co. You will receive 10% off your first order. Give this place a try!5 of 5 stars well deserved for friendly services, amazing taste, clean tables and floors, and a smile that greets every customer at the door. =]
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2012,9/14/2014,1,24,1,3,2>This has to be the best sushi in the valley.  Very high quality, excellent portion sizes, and awesome service.  I can't agree with the negative reviews that are posted.  We're from 'the big city' and are used to good sushi...this is a good place.We were there for lunch on a Wednesday.  I had a teriyaki Bento box that rocked and finished off some sashimi from my Son's plate.  Very fresh fish.  They have a special hot tea that's not only free but definately worth trying.  The rolls were large and packed with the good stuff.  The accompanyments like seaweed salad were spot on and delicious.The tempura was very nicely done and again, very good portions and variety.  My plate had 2 large pieces of eggplant, squash, broccoli, onion ring, and two shrimps.I saw beer and wine; not sure about a full bar.The service was very good and helpful, polite and knowledgeable.Check the hours; they're closed Monday/Tuesday.Two thumbs way up!(The men's room needed some work, though.)

<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2014,9/8/2014,30,23,,1,2>These guys are everything you're looking for in a mechanic. They've got decades of combined experience and approach their work with an honest, educational mentality for customers who aren't gear heads. For those of you who like to talk shop in there, they know their S. Make sure you call them in advance if possible. It's not a big shop so they appreciate the heads up. Wait time has been my biggest complaint in the past but in my opinion it's worth waiting an extra day for the quality of service and affordability that Supertek provides. Solid 5 stars.
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,9/7/2014,6,9,,2,3>This place is AMAZING!!  It has been my new favorite spot in town for almost a year now.  It started out as a Taco Truck but now has a very nice restaurant.  They are family owned and operated and I Highly recommend eating there.  You will be hooked.  All my friends and family I have brought there are now loyal customers because of the food quality and customer service.
