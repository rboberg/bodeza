<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/20/2014,11/24/2014,22,68,2,3,2>Exceeding my expectations. Made fresh popcorn and let me sample others while I waited. I ended up buying the Mac n Cheese popcorn and Toffee popcorn. Got 15% off my first check-in on Yelp too!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2014,11/23/2014,1,14,3,3,3>Food was great all 3 times I have been there. Wish it wasn't quite as pricey, but I guess freshness weighs out the cost. Service was VERY friendly and prompt.
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/26/2013,11/22/2014,7,15,4,5,4>Finally, a reason to eat out.  Tonight was busy for a Thursday I guess because its the day after Christmas.  Parking lot is big enough to accommodate everyone.  We walked in and got a buzzer and were told we'd have a 50 min wait, and then poof 5 min later we were hailed.  Sat down an immediately were given out drinks and all the delicious hot rolls with cinnamon butter we wanted.  We didn't even have to ask, all the ought the dinner we were checked on by 5 different people including our server, to top off our rolls and drinks.  Appetizer was the snake bites.  Delicious cheese and jalapeño fried balls with a thin crispy corn bread type casing.  Salad was fresh plain lettuce tomato egg and cheese and croutons.  The ranch is good not too cheap or weird or buttermilk tasting.  I ordered the 14.99 12oz ribeye medium and my husband ordered the 18.99 8oz fillet medium rare.  Our steak and potato came out 15-20 minutes after we ordered...on time.I should have ordered medium rare because my ribeye was a little too tough and more well done than I wanted. Still was pink in the center though.  It was very flavorful and tasty.  My husbands fillet was the best.  It was juicy and melt in your mouth.  It was red and pink and thick perfection.  We could not eat our potatoes we were so full.  We got the loaded baked potato and its pretty good.  Coated with sea salt.  Burning hot.  Sour cream, cheddar, butter, and bacon. We miss home so much and we loved the Texas themed everything.  This place was lively and fun.  Good ambient country music.  All of the people who work there have a giddy up in their step and are very cheerful.  No one appeared to be moving at a leisurely pace. I could not finish my steak, but I saved room for our fourth roll basket.  I packed up our food and we paid our server.  The bill was 38.00 for two drinks, one appetizer, two salads, and two dinners.  Not bad and a good amount of food.  We tipped our server well and we vamoosed.  Our server was Dawn, the sweetest girl ever.  Very sincere and accommodating.  I hope everyone there is like her.  I will definitely we returning!  Oh and free peanuts y'all!!!

There are times that I place orders for delivery to my office(Fort Gordon). My only suggestion is that you place your order an hour in advance. This will ensure that you eat on time. Remember that everything is cooked to order. No complaints from me.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2012,11/20/2014,10,18,3,4,3>My favorite place in town, hands down! Never had anything I didn't love from this gem.  The servers are super nice. And the Pad Thai, oh, don't get me started on it.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2014,11/18/2014,4,33,3,2,2>Probably one of my favorite pizza restaurants in the Augusta area.  Has a good atmosphere, and there large selections of beer on tap is great.  It's a good place to go alone to enjoy the bar atmosphere and enjoy the many sporting events they have on there many TVs.  Or, to take the family for dinner.  For anyone visiting this area for the first time...I highly recommend this place.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/22/2014,11/17/2014,1,4,4,5,3>Nice bright clean store with lots of choices like sandwiches, hot dogs, breakfast foods, pastries, in addition to the usual stuff you find at a convenience store. It puts a different twist on it though because it also has places to eat and drink both inside and out and they serve alcohol  (beer and wine) that you can drink on premises or take with you. The staff is very friendly and even took my complaints about the prices in stride, which brings me to my next point. The only downside is that the prices at this store are considerably higher than the company's other stores just a few miles away. Example: A 32 ounce fountain drink that currently sells for 69 cents (on sale for now, usually 79 cents and the 44 ounce is 99 cents) at their other stores is $1.99 at this one. Another example: My biscuit was about a dollar more than their other stores. I could understand a little higher price because it is a somewhat different market being downtown and all and there not being as much competition for this specific thing, but this is too much of a disparity when all I have to do is hop on my bike and ride five minutes to pay the lower price. I work about 100 feet away from the place and had hoped to frequent it, but with these prices, I will probably only shop there when I forgot something at home or don't have time to go to a cheaper option. Though, depending on how lunch goes, I will likely add them as a once a week option for lunch. I noticed pulled pork sandwiches on the menu as well as a cuban and I want to try those.Some more examples: I can get a fresh made bacon egg and cheese croissant at Coffee Break which is less than a block away for $4.27 including tax and it is delicious and covered in bacon. I couldn't find that exact option at Metro Market, but they did have a ham egg and cheese croissant already cooked and in a display cabinet for sale for $3.89. With tax that would be about $4.20 here. The bacon and "just made while you wait goodness" of the one at Coffee Break is well worth the extra 7 cents. Silla Cafe, next door, has a two egg bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich for $2.89 and it is also very good. I think Metro Market needs to figure out the this metro's market. They have pre-made sandwiches sitting in a cooler for about $7.00, but you can walk a block and get fresh made ones at Quiznos for that price or less. To be fair though, they do also offer lunch items made-to-order and they have some selections that are otherwise not available nearby(as in easy walking distance), like the aforementioned pulled pork and cuban sandwiches, gourmet hot dogs, crepes, etc. Lots of choices and I will probably try most of them eventually, but if I want Mexican I'll just walk over to Mi Rancho and other than the sandwiches that only they have, I will head to Quiznos for those, while my go-to breakfast places will remain Coffee Break and Silla Cafe unless something changes. We'll see.I will revisit this review after having lunch there today. For now, the nice people and the great design of the store and the large number of choices and the fact that there is nothing else like it in walking distance manages to make this just barely a 4 star review. I almost gave it three because of the prices so it is more like a 3.5 star review, but I need to try lunch first and see how that turns out both in taste and cost.I hope they succeed, because it is convenient (no pun intended) to have them there when you need them, but unless they adjust their prices on some of these things, I fear they may not fit in. maybe it's because they are both a convenience store and a restaurant and that somehow cheapens it in my eyes. I am not sure. I could be wrong about all this. I frequently am. Just ask my wife.Update: Had lunch and I now understand the concept a little better as well as the pricing. They are a restaurant with some convenience items for their customers on the way home, etc. The drinks are so much more than their other stores because you get free refills while you are dining there. The way it saves you money is part of what makes it unique. You can buy a 6 pack or 12 pack of beer for a price a little more than what you would pay at another convenience store because you can take that 6 or 12 pack and drink some in their dining area and take the rest home. Decent domestic beer singles are $2, which is cheap to me for a restaurant especially.I got the cuban and it was pretty good. A little pricey at $9.72 including tax with chips, but I don't know where else I can walk around downtown and get a cuban, so...Key things to keep in mind that aren't 100% clear or weren't today during the lunch rush. Once you place your order using the kiosks, you must then go pay before they will begin to prepare your order. This caused tons of confusion and consternation today, but they are trying to make it clearer. So, remember that and you should be good.

<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2014,11/15/2014,3,120,4,4,3>My honey and I met up with friends for dinner!! It was lovely and the few tapas that was ordered such as the chicken quesadilla and crab cakes were delicious. Our waitress was sweet and helpful. My sweetie ordered a ginger it was good but strong as the taste of ginger lingers in your throat. We both ordered the chicken and waffle entree and lets just say that piece of poultry was out of this world. The waffle was alright not crispy and too soft for the pairing of crunchy chicken. By the time we ordered dessert I was extremely stuffed. I am sometimes a glutton so I did eat a piece of the beignet with strawberry sauce, peach, pecan and lavender icecream and some lavender creme brulee;) We both had an amazing night at bees knees with our friends and we will be back to taste their other delights on the menu!!!!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/30/2014,11/14/2014,39,24,3,6,5>Upon the advice of a friend, I went to Thumb's. I've been getting Brazilians for years but found myself hard-pressed to find a really good/quick waxing place here in Augusta.  While living in Statesboro I kept The Wax Strip in business with both their efficiency and price, being hard to beat.  At Thumb's on a Saturday, I had an appointment for 1pm. I signed in and had a seat. About 10 mins. later, Thumb was giving me a survey on my skin-type to be careful on what to expect.  About 5 mins later, I was on her table. When I mentioned my friend, she would not say yay or nay if she knew her, as this is a "privacy" issue. No worries--totally understand. After we were done and I had shared some things about myself, I was fresh and clean with a side of therapy! Cost about $90.I would definitely say I'll go back again. She's a sweetheart and very thorough.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/3/2014,11/13/2014,3,24,4,5,5>One of my favorite places in town! They don't serve food, which is totally fine, because their drinks are delicious enough to compensate. Ask for some Chex Mix if you're hungry though! They make cocktails fresh, which is really unique for a bar in Augusta. The bartenders are really friendly and accommodating. Clean bathrooms, an excellent porch with comfortable seating, indoor balcony, and a fireplace for cold winter nights. I think they have a daily Happy Hour until 7PM--$1 off everything. Definitely recommended!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2014,11/12/2014,50,66,4,6,3>Friendly staff and decent food.  The ribs  fall off the bone!! The wings are decent as well.  They are always running good lunch/dinner specials on food and drinks.  The staff is friendly and helpful.   Nice place to hang out to grab a drink and watch a game too.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2014,11/11/2014,7,29,3,5,2>This is my first choice for fine dining in Augusta.  The crowds are small the tables are close, the bar is small but the atmosphere is off the chart.  Reservations are recommended but I have dropped in and was able to get a table.  The menu is always fresh.  I am always impressed when the staff can tell you about all of the items on the menu, and they take customer service to a new level.  If you are on a a date, with a special person, this is the place you need to take them to.  The prices are within reason for the quality of the food.   Sheehan's has never let me down.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/17/2010,11/10/2014,36,74,4,3,3>A very nice sushi restaurant in downtown Aiken's "the Alley".  I am not a huge sushi fan (so I can't go 5 stars) but they have something on the menu that everyone should be able to enjoy.  Besides the very authentic sushi,  sushi-mi, and whatever else you call it (I call it bait!); they have an interesting array of other offerings, including mexican tacos and nachos and a variety of other seafood items and other dishes.  I just had the Firecracker Shrimp today and it was awesome!  Breaded and fried shrimp tempura with a couple of zesty sauces drizzled on the plate.  The ladies I was with were both eating sushi rolls and pieces of raw fish laying on rice...they claim it's the best - I couldn't say.  (lol)It's classy enough and stays very busy during the week at lunch with the downtown crowd.  A nice selection of beers, wines and full bar too.  Outdoor seating available.  You'll have to park out on the street (Newberry, Park, Laurens, etc.) and walk into the Alley to get there but it's worth the walk!
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2010,11/9/2014,47,67,3,3,4>I love Stoplight deli if you are looking for a great basic sandwich.  It is a little loud and crowded in the restaurant, that is why I am giving it four stars.  I went in there for lunch with a friend of mine and we were able to hear the conversation of the table next to us clearly and I even made a comment about the purse the woman had and she heard it (luckily it was a complement).  We chose to sit at a two seat table, however, it was almost right in the middle of the walkway to the cash register from the door and I felt pushed against the wall when we sat down.  I loved the food though and it was great to be able to get a glass of wine in a deli surrounding.

<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/2/2014,11/7/2014,9,23,3,3,4>I've only been for lunch but they have well-priced delicious lunch options that include a meat (chicken, shrimp or steak) with or without mushrooms, rice and either soup or salad. They have a vegetable bowl option as well. The portions are generous, I almost always end up taking at least half home as leftovers. The restaurant usually seems pretty busy at lunch time due to the other businesses in the shopping center and a good location. I've never had to wait for a table, but there is a steady stream of both Eat-In and Take-Out customers.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/11/2014,11/6/2014,44,127,3,6,3>Decent for a fast food place.  They had plenty of workers.  The dining area was clean.  I really like the way they designed the inside as well.  I ordered a crispy chicken salad with ranch.  The chicken is VERY good.  Very juicy and the crispy part is is very tasty.  My husband got the grilled chicken tenders combo with fries.  The fries were really good but sadly I didn't get to taste the chicken tenders b/c he inhaled them.  Guess that means they were good!  He was a little disappointed by the sauce selection.  I think b/c he is really picky and they didn't have anything he liked.  Not even regular BBQ.  You don't have to chipolte, spice or garlic up everything.All in all, we had a great dinner,  We would go back for sure.  I like how the food is fast but it is a bit lighter/healthier than other drive thrus.The parking lot is a bit small and hard to navigate...so be prepared!P.S 50% for Military with Military ID or in uniform every first MOnday!

Awesome deal.- Friendly staff- Menu variety- Good price- Flavorful- Clean locationWhen I saw hot the cold rolls came out I wanted to get something I couldn't make at home. I order my hot pressed roll and was delighted. The texture, quality and flavor were better than expected.I ordered the hickory chicken, 12" hot pressed ($6.50). The sauce had so much flavor and didn't drip all over when I took a bite. Some places you have to change your shirt after you eat BBQ, but not here. You get flavor without the mess!

<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/8/2014,11/3/2014,17,218,3,4,3>This is the only Homebrew supply store in Augusta. The store just opened on 8/30/14 and is small in size but is definitely worth a trip to see what they have. They are limited on some of their selection but they are willing to listen to suggested products and are working on expanding what they carry. They sell ingredients for wine and beer and they have some kits for each available. Their price on hops beats what is online and everything they do have seems to be equal or just a little bit above the price that you would find online so they will probably be getting a decent amount of my business. The loss in star has to do with the selection, its not bad its just limited to a degree.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2014,11/2/2014,5,8,1,2,3>Great dog park. Big open fields for small and large dogs. Not too many other dogs during the weekday. But people seem to come a lot on weekends and after their workday. Never seen dogs fight here. The dogs and people are all friendly. Best dog park we've found near Augusta.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2014,11/1/2014,17,36,3,5,4>I like this as a nice bar to hang out on a Saturday and have drinks inside or outside. The Stilton burger rocks!  One of the best burgers in town.Beer selections are pretty decent and I like the Wells Bombardier (full English beer) in a bottle. Its my go to beer when at the Boars Head. Reminds me a bit of Molly McPherson in Savannah, but much more low key and understated.Definitely the type of relaxation bar for an early Saturday walk downtown Augusta. British and American fare on the menu.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,10/31/2014,18,286,5,5,4>Not many vegetarian options, but their homestyle bean curd (AKA tofu) is amazing.  The sauce is perfect, and the tofu comes with carrots, bamboo, broccoli, onion, and even celery!  I usually hate celery, but everything was cooked so perfectly that I actually thought it tasted great.  All of the vegetables were fresh, definitely no gross frozen veggies here. This is my new spot for Chinese takeout, especially if *nudge nudge* they add more vegetarian dishes!

However, I like many other types they make. They have samples so just go find out which ones you like. The chocolate chocolate chip are really good too! I have had them make cookies for a project for one of my class presentations at Paine and everyone loved the Purple and White discs of delight! :)  I often buy dozens to give to family and friends out of town and they all LOVE them. They make cute cookies for holidays too! I wonder if a cookie cookbook has been/or is on the way! Hmmmmm? ;)

One would get drunk just walking through the door.In my short time in the CSRA, toast wine and beverage has become my favorite liquor joint.  The place has an amazing selection of  darn near any liquor your heart may desire, and their craft beer selection is no slouch. The store has a true air of elegance, and it is only brought forward more by the incredible customer service. When I couldn't find a specific banana liquor, the guy helping me jumped up and went to look for it on his computer...and when I halfway expected him to go play candy crush or something, he didn't forget about me!To top it off he asked what I liked, and not only offered to pop open cases of beer so I could buy individual bottles, but then directed me to find local whisky and home brew clubs! Blew my mind!Come thirsty, my friends.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/27/2014,10/25/2014,8,54,4,6,3>Genghis grill is a chain restaurant. I don't really like chain restaurants, but they do a bit better of a job than most chains. The idea is simple: You pick the size of the bowl, go down the line and put stuff in your bowl, give it to a guy at the end and they'll cook it for you. For some reason first time visitors here get befuddled by this and being stuck behind them in line can be frustrating.The food is good, relatively fresh, average quality proteins and veggies. The sauces are good, but not as spicy as I would like. The nice thing is they have sriracha and they'll just give you a bottle at your table and you can mix it in to your bowl when you get back to your table. They also have a bunch of little add-ons, like eggs, sesame seeds, crunchy asian noodles, cilantro, etc, to top off your bowl. Overall, the food is good, I have eaten there twice and was happy both times.On the negative side: The pre-made food that you order off the list has been unimpressive at best. They don't let you call in and order, even if you want stuff off of the pre-made list. I wanted something from the pre-made list, I had to go, order at the bar, and sit there for 25 minutes in order to pick it up. I got home only to find out the food was bland and lacking any real flavor. After that I decided I would go back and make my own bowl and just take it to go, but for some reason that too was bland, even though it was stuff I put together. It almost seemed like they forgot to put the sauce that I chose on the veggies as they cooked, and then decided to just box it up anyway. I was very unsatisfied. The atmosphere is loud, but not terribly so. I think it's good for families. The service was acceptable. The price was reasonable.So overall, Genghis grill is good if you go, eat there, and do the build-a-bowl. I would not order off the menu, and I would not take it to go.

<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,10/23/2014,0,7,2,1,2>Has most of what we routinely buy, and at prices less than similar stores in Columbia, SC. We can also shop on base at the commissary but their Napa Cabbage and cilantro is less expensive and fresher. Their fresh ginger is $2/lb less than the commissary and significantly fresher. And no one can touch their tofu prices and unlike the commissary they always are well stocked, so it is worth a visit for vegans just to stock up on basics. Much of their Chinese desserts and packaged vegetables happen to be vegan so it is a great treat to pick up something fun and new.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/26/2014,10/22/2014,294,318,7,6,8>I come here for event tickets mostly I never actually came here and shopped or looked around, which I should have but I will next time I'm here. I use to always stop here at night and gaze at all the art and posters in the window. At times they have a mix of new and legendary artists in the window. Also you may see some upcoming events advertised in the window also. This is and has been a place where you could find and purchase hard to find or out of print music and videos. I have had friends come here and located a hard to find Diana Ross album. The price was steep but they were happy they found it. I normally find hard to find albums on Amazon or Half.com so this place would be my last resort. They also sell jewelry and clothing. Noura, the business owner's daughter, is normally here when I come in and is always pleasant and willing to help. It wouldn't hurt to take a peek in here for some of Augusta's own history.
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2014,10/21/2014,10,4,3,3,4>Hands down the best Mexican food I've had in the CSRA. I had the Fajita Jalisciense... it was incredible. My wife had a sopa that was equally as impressive. The attention to detail/quality of food was apparent, and the tortillas were excellent.This is an authentic restaurant co-located with a grocery store, so don't expect the same atmosphere that you'd get at Salsa's, Teresa's, or any other of the chain Mexican restaurants. But the food here blows those others out of the water.There's a coin-operated pool table in the back, which suited us well. The price was very reasonable. We went on a Wednesday, but were told that there are expanded menu offerings on the weekends. This place is definitely worth the visit.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2014,10/20/2014,49,77,3,5,2>I was here for a Yelp event. The restaurant provided samples of several menu items including lobster nachos, shrimp and grits, and oysters Florentine. The food was delicious! The staff was also very friendly. Chef Chris and Vince the bartender were very jovial and knowledgeable about their respective crafts. The outdoor seating is great. You get to people watch on the porch and enjoy a great dinner. I'll check this place out again soon.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2014,10/19/2014,42,322,2,5,3>Selfishly, I almost didn't write this review. However I knew the secret would get out eventually. URBN, or Urban Outfitters, the parent company of said UA, Anthropologie, BHLDN, Free People and Terrain, has opened an outlet store next to the call center on Bobby Jones. As a long time lover of the brands and knowing of the company's presence in the area I was super excited to hear of this place opening. Here are the main things you need to know:1. Final Sale2. Clothes, shoes, wedding gowns, furniture, lighting, bags, jewelry, belts, anything you would find in one of the above mentioned stores. 3. Random organization- be prepared to scour the racks, tables and boxes. They have men's and women's items- though mostly women's.  They do have dressing rooms now, (well curtains) which they did not have on my first visit. The clothes do not always have sizes. I have seen stuff that is several seasons old and I have seen items from current seasons.  The pricing is usually posted on the wall, ( $5 for tops, $15 for everything else) unless an item actually has a price tag (most furniture) then the item is priced as marked. They always have boxes stacked and waiting to be opened, so checking in regularly is the best bet. Twice I've been in and left empty handed and once I found piles of items to try on, and did leave with goodies. It's a treasure hunt, the staff is friendly and if you are familiar with the brands it is exciting! If you are an Urban Outfitters brand newbie, the place is still worth shopping if you like a bargain.

I have been here twice now and so far I have tried the buffalo chicken, philosopher's pie, mighty meaty and the funky q. chicken pizzas. The quality of the food is great. Service is quick and staff are excellent as well. I plan on trying their hoagies next time. I love how this place is decorated. Very psychedelic/hippy-ish. They also have a karaoke machine but I'm not sure what days/hours that starts.They are located right across from IHOP in Evans on Washington Rd.

<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2014,10/16/2014,3,3,2,3,3>Has quickly became my favorite place to eat.  My best friend and I dined at The Brown Bag three weekends in a row for dinner!  We love everything about this place including the food, staff, and atmosphere.  The staff are very friendly and genuine and have become almost family.  The restaurant has a nice intimate feel to it.  The prices are very affordable for both quantity and quality of food.  I try something different every time I go.  I've only been able try the lunch menu once but I was very pleased with the food then, too.  I look forward to my next visit.
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2014,10/15/2014,2,85,2,2,1>I got the lunch special from their food truck at GRU today. All I have to say is WOW!$6.99 gets you your choice of gyro/shwarma/falafel along with salad (Greek or tabouleh), hummus(four kinds)/babbaganush, rice, and pita. You don't get a whole lot of anything, but put together it is a great amount of food for lunch. More than anything, it is one of the healthier options you will find in this part of town and it all tastes GREAT. Service is reasonably fast and friendly, plus they take credit/debit.I'm a huge fan!
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2014,10/14/2014,22,13,2,3,4>We have been regulars for several years. The food quality and taste has never changed. Food is always fresh and tasty. The owner and his family are friendly and so are the staff. The interior is very modern and appealing. If you haven't checked it out yet, I highly recommend you give them a try.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2014,10/13/2014,7,3,3,2,2>Sushi has never been a favorite of mine, I used to try it here and there.  After trying the Spicy crab roll, shrimp tempura and crazy crab roll I can't go more than a day without craving sushi. This place has made any other sushi restaurant seem below par, hands down my favorite restaurant in the CSRA!Oh and the service is always great!
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/17/2013,10/12/2014,1,5,2,1,1>This place can't be judge by the looks on the outside.  From outside it's just another fast food restaurant and not very appealing.  Once you go inside it's very spacious and nice. The ladies are very nice and attentive.  I think it was a mother and daughter at the register.  I ordered takeout, the Chinese Bento lunch special, $8.95.  The General Tso's Chicken with steamed rice was very delicious, the wonton soup was not very tasty, the spring roll was o.k and salad fresh with ginger sauce.  I also ordered a side order of Gyoza which was so good except for the sauce that wasn't gyoza sauce but maybe teriyaki or oyster sauce The menu is overwhelming.  There's so much to choose from and it's a little pricey too.  I definitely want to go back and try some of the other items on the menu :)  Oh, did I mention they have a bar as well...
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/15/2013,10/11/2014,1,4,4,4,3>To say this barbecue is addictive is an understatement. The meat is amazing but the sides are average. The peach cobbler for dessert is good but not the best. Still, Shane's is by far the best barbecue place I've found in the area.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2012,10/10/2014,9,9,4,4,4>I typically don't eat bar food because my system hates me the next day. However, as far as bar food goes, this place is really good! We had chicken wings, which were big and perfectly crispy. They have a fabulous selection of beers and it's all reasonably priced. Our server was hilarious and very accommodating. This is a great place for happy hour or if you just want to drink great beer and watch a game.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2014,10/9/2014,13,1,5,5,6>I really like the atmosphere and the employees are very attentive.Realmente me gusta mucho el ambiente y las empleadas son bien atentas.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2014,10/7/2014,101,22,3,2,2>I'm glad Pizza Central is more convenient to get to now. It's a great addition to the "downtown" Evans area. The new location has plenty of seating and a friendly, helpful staff. The pizza we had tonight was delicious. The light, thin crust has a lot of character and flavor but stays out of the way of the toppings. I can't wait to come back again!
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2013,10/6/2014,0,5,2,1,2>Orange Leaf is a great frozen yogurt place. It's a nice location, and very clean inside. There are a lot of flavors and toppings, however sometimes they lack the basic flavors like chocolate or vanilla. But, it is great!
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2012,10/5/2014,31,6,2,3,3>Love this place! I tried the praline flavor yogurt last time I was there. I know, sounds a little weird but it was delicious!Great selection of frozen yogurt, and a huge selection of toppings!
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2012,10/4/2014,0,5,2,3,3>So I guess now I'm some kind of sucker for frozen yogurt, because since coming here for the first time about a week ago I've been back... repeatedly. It's very clean and kinda trendy and glowy on the inside but I never see anyone sitting in there, since there's a small amount of seating outside the place as well.But dude, it rules. My friend has tried the Taro and Pistachio flavors, which she loved, and I'm steadfastly devoted to their Guava flavor, with kiwi and coconut shavings and strawberry toppings. Oh my god the deliciousness of the combination is beyond description, I swear.Anyway! The prices are pretty reasonable and you get a good amount of frozen yogurt for what you pay... and it's quite conveniently a hop skip and a jump down the sidewalk from a natural food store that has bangin organic wine. Just sayin.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2014,10/3/2014,4,2,1,2,1>Awesome place. The best ice cream parlor and only one in Aiken county. Great service, clean and enjoyable place to have dessert.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2014,10/2/2014,19,15,2,4,3>Finally! Augusta has a Whole Foods! I was so excited about the opening of this location that I went to one of their preview tours and told all of my friends about it. Needless to say I was there when it finally opened today. I came here in the evening around 7 after work, and it took me a good five minutes to find parking. I don't ever remember having trouble finding a parking spot in Augusta, so obviously people here are excited about the new store and are checking out this place.It was pretty crowded inside the store as well. Lots of people standing by the aisles and checking out all of the available options Whole Foods has to offer. Up to one third of their produce are sourced locally, and every produce is marked with its origin. Price wise, I didn't expect them to be very competitive and I was right. You don't go to Whole Foods to find a good deal. You go there to find what you can't get at other places around the town. They have an amazing wine and cheese selection, and are the only store in Georgia to carry Manchester, a type of goat cheese from Vermont that has a nutty and earthy bite. You can ask for a sample of any kind of cheese they have available. I saw a couple of people holding glasses of beer, so I'm assuming you can get those samples too.I will definitely be back when the store is not as chaotic as today and check out more of what Whole Foods has to offer.
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2014,10/1/2014,11,4,2,2,3>Great prices and service here. Love the complimentary beverages! Timmy does an awesome job with nails and Bonita and Angela are great with pedicures!
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2014,9/30/2014,4,83,2,4,2>First time at this new restaurant,  at the old Thai Jong restaurant.  We all had the buffet. They close at 2:30, and reopen at 5, so you want to get there by 1:30. They stopped bringing out food at 2. The buffet was not very spicy.  If you want it spicy, you will probably need to order off the menu. The buffet is limited and small, but the food was good.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/3/2014,9/29/2014,30,136,2,1,2>Cute spot in Aiken. Very small and quaint. Their magnolia burger was delicious. My boyfriend didn't love his meal, said it tasted like it was drenched in lemon even though lemon wasn't in the description on the menu. But I will personally be back!
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2014,9/28/2014,12,1,3,5,3>My husband and I stopped here for a late lunch on a Saturday.  We shared a burger with sweet potato fries and a Caesar salad.The burger, made of brisket, short ribs and sirloin, and topped with provolone, was to die for. My husband and I tasted it before putting the standard ketchup, mustard or mayo on it, and honestly I didn't want to put any of those standard flavors on there and drown out the burger flavor.  What would be great is if they would serve their garlic aioli on the side, which to me would be about the right level of sophistication for that burger.The Caesar was quite good and fresh, but from my perspective, overdressed.  Our waitress happily took the plate away and added more lettuce to thin it out, which was very nice.First glass of wine I had was on the edge of turning, and again, easily replaced with a new glass from a freshly opened bottle.The sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar butter are a "must have!"  Really enjoyed them.So: service was great, food was excellent, the musical playlist was perfect.  Go!
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,9/27/2014,0,5,3,2,2>Yummy hamburgers that are cooked when you order so it is always fresh and hot! Their fried chicken salad is awesome and fresh. Locally owned and it is always good to support local businesses.
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2014,9/26/2014,15,20,2,3,3>Ever since college, I have loved the quick service and delicious subs from Jimmy John's. For people with a short lunch break, Jimmy John's is the place to go.This Jimmy John's in particular is great because of their customer service. The people at the front counter have always been courteous to me and have never messed up my order. In fact, they've always repeated it back to me to make sure they got it right. Plus the staff keeps this establishment very clean and tidy.As for the food itself, it is always made to order right in front of you. Jimmy John's doesn't hide any part of the sandwich-making process from you. You can see what's going into your food and who's handling it. This means, of course, that the sandwiches are very fresh and, because Jimmy John's has such quick turnover, the ingredients aren't left out for a long time. I love the taste of the sandwiches and the fact that you can customize them or just order them as they come.The only downside to this Jimmy John's is that they can be a bit heavy on the sauce. If you get oil, vinegar, mustard, or mayo, you should ask for a light amount so that your sandwich is not drenched in juices.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2014,9/25/2014,3,10,3,3,2>I really like ALDI stores. The prices are very low compared to other places around. A lot of people frown on the "generic" food or "copycat" brands they have there. However, most of it is as good as the name brand items, but cheaper. We also enjoy their selection of fruits and vegetables. They are very cheap compared to even Wal-Mart. It is a weekly destination for my household.
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2014,9/24/2014,5,21,2,2,1>Good burgers. Love the fact they have a drive threw and I don't have to go inside to order. Easy menu to read and great service. Pricing isn't to bad either. I'm a big bacon cheeseburger eater. They are a little slow. But that comes with burgers being cooked to order.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/15/2014,9/23/2014,36,107,2,3,3>Making the reservation for Edgar's was fast and easy through Open Table.  Upon arrival, the host was very friendly and immediately showed us to our table.  Our server was prompt in taking our water and drink order.  She was able to answer our questions about the menu and suggest her favorites.  My husband's rack of lamb was cooked perfectly and was quite tasty.  My salmon was cooked as requested, but may have gotten salted twice in the preparation process.  I do like well seasoned food, but this was overly salted.  Otherwise the risotto cake and asparagus were great sides.It's a place we'll definitely try again.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/19/2010,9/22/2014,23,45,3,11,2>As far as I am concerned, Bistro 491 is tied as the best restaurant in Augusta. Only one other shares this standing, La Maison. The two are different, so a direct comparison cannot and should not be made. Bistro 491 rocks.The restaurant has been around for 10-years and I had never been. This year, I decided to take my wife there for our 25th anniversary (a biggie). I was looking forward to trying Bistro 491 and I had very high expectations. I was not disappointed.My notes written the evening after we returned home:    Just got home from anniversary dinner at Bistro 491. Absolutely everything was outstanding, from talking to the reservation taker to make sure flowers I had delivered there were placed on the table when I wanted them to, to the wonderful waitress who got our dessert comped and had "Happy Anniversary" written on the dessert plate in chocolate and properly guided us through the menu and wine choice and conversed with us perfectly, to the incredibly excellent food, to the atmosphere. I will go back, it was incredible. I can't believe I've waited so long to try it. Note, on the waitress talking with us, my wife says we are approachable diners, never thought about that before, but we like to talk with the wait folks and perceptive ones will engage. They seem to enjoy being able to do that. I think people at a fine dining restaurant should encourage talking to wait staff, it ensures that everyone is happy, gets you good recommendations and extra care from your server, which translates to good service from the kitchenYou get the idea. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated at a nice and private (for their table layout) location. This was a Tuesday evening at 7 pm. I was surprised it was so busy, but that is always a good sign. Like all restaurants I've been to in France, the first thing one is asked is what kind of bottled water you want, sparkling or plain. It was the same here, we always get non carbonated water.Our server was Laura and she was excellent. She knew the specials, answered every question we had on menu items, and, as you will see later in this review, recommended the perfect dessert. She delivered the flowers I had ordered precisely when I had asked them to be delivered to the table. It is clear that the front and back of the houses work together very well in Bistro 491.Laura was also helpful in helping us select an appropriate wine, considering our preference for red versus white no matter what we are eating. I was surprised that there were no French wines on their list and an overabundance of California wines. For a red, I will almost always select a Rhone wine, however, we collectively decided that the Chilean Concha y Toro Casillero del Diablo Reserva Privada 2007 would be a good choice and it certainly was. The wine markup was quite fair.Except for dessert, nothing we had is on the menu on their web site, although many menu items are. I like this kind of flexibility, when a chef adjusts his menu based on seasonality and availability of good ingredients.I had an appetizer to start and my wife, Lynn, a salad. I had mussels and these were among the best I've ever had. They were in a garlic butter sauce reminiscent of the sauce for a really good escargots a la bourguignonne. The mussels, and they were very generous with the quantity, were served with a couple of crostini slices.Lynn had the beet salad. I am not sure what all was in it. I am not a beet fan and I would eat this salad anytime. Excellent.For our main course, Lynn had butternut squash gnocchi and I had the Waygu beef special. Both entrees were very good. The pureed leeks I had as a side were excellent, with a pleasing texture that allowed for some small pieces of leek to be visible. I also had frites (french fries) and these were also outstanding, obviously double fried, the only way to get crispy on the outside with cooked perfection on the inside. The waygu beef was cooked precisely to my specifications, just a hair over rare. It was served with an unpretentious red wine veal jus. No other seasoning required.Normally we don't get desserts, but it was our anniversary and I wanted a dessert. I was going to go with creme brulee, always a safe bet. Laura talked us into the Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding with chocolate ganache and crème anglais. We were glad she did. As an added touch, Laura had made sure the plate said "Happy Anniversary" in chocolate on the plate rim and did not charge for it, a very nice gesture. We  spent a lot that night and I gave Laura one of the best tips percentage wise I ever have (30%), she would have received the same even if dessert was not comped because she was so good. Anyway, that bread pudding was unbelievably good and, in some ways, had creme brulee overtones.This was a great experience and we will be back.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2012,9/21/2014,20,11,3,2,2>Hands down, RSVP my favorite place in Augusta to eat lunch. If you are in the mood for a sandwich they have awesome grilled turkey sandwiches that go great with their chicken and rice soup. They also have really tasty salads! The food alone is amazing, but their friendly staff makes the place even better!
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/25/2014,9/20/2014,22,68,3,3,2>I would consider this the best tasting Mexican food in North Augusta. Cheese dip was outstanding. Good draft beer selection to include Mexican beer. I had the steak tacos. Steak had great flavor.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2014,9/19/2014,10,18,3,2,2>Excellent coffee. The white chocolate raspberry scone was something I shouldn't have ordered but did and enjoyed very much! It's very nice to discover a place that's right on my travel path at least two or three days a week. Friendly staff, open, clean, spacious areas to relax, with large tables conducive to work if you must. They open at five AM. What's not to like? Check 'em out.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2014,9/18/2014,0,8,3,4,2>Stumbled across this place on a Sunday afternoon, was so pleased to find them open, happier yet when I saw the prices, and then to top it all off it was delicious!  There were a few chairs to sit, but this is really more of a takeout place, so I got my wrap, samosa chaat, and chicken masala to go and went to the park.  The masala was a little different from what I've had before, maybe a regional difference?, but definitely still good.  The best was the chaat, hands-down.  I got medium-spicy, but next time I'll ask for hot.  Can't wait for the next visit!
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2014,9/17/2014,7,15,2,2,3>As soon as we walked in we were greeted by whom I think was the owner who gladly introduced us to the menu. She explained where the coffee came from and that it is a custom blend that they have made for them. And that the espresso is Italian. She had a great selection of signature drinks hot and cold. The hubby chose espresso and I was turned on to the Cuban . We both opted for the 3 shot size glass of course. Prices are very reasonable $3.50 for one large size espresso cup. We didn't have to pay until after we finished our drinks. We sat in the back lounge area tucked away. Waiting for us was a chess set, a pretty diverse array of used books on shelves along the walls, and a little acoustic guitar. We chose chess. Our drinks were then escorted to us by the owner and they were filled to the brim and piping hot. I disregarded the heat and took a sip. It was perfect. Smooth, bold, aromatic, rich, and had intense flavor with a hint of sweet like I'd asked for (as normal Cubans or Cortaditos are pretty sweet). I decided to let the liquid cool so I just held the cup to my nose for a bit to take in the magnificence. So I ended up on the losing end of our game of chess, but that was okay because my Cuban was there to comfort me. We also saw that they make sandwiches and baked goods. We are definitely coming back to try everything we can. We paid at the counter before leaving and were given a cool little members hole punch card. Buy ten cups, get the 11th free.Exceptionally warm service from the owner and staff, great quality drinks, and a cozy, non traditional atmosphere really gives this place the edge here in Augusta. If you read my other reviews, you would see how negative my view of Augusta food standards are and surmise that I don't really like the food here very much. If more places were like this little coffee shop, My perception of this city would greatly change. This place is very simple and humble looking, glittered with recycled and re-used elements, very clean and chill. This is not the too cool for school, snooty-patootie, java snob fashion house or the run of the mill Starbucks production line, over priced wham bam thank you ma'am, write your name on a cup cliche. This place is the cats meow/pajamas and the bees knees. Check it out.Btw before I forget. My one cup that I drank around 3pm still has me wired up and feeling good at 11:40pm. I am not a coffee drinker, so hopefully I can go to sleep soon lol.

Cozy atmosphere, friendly and personal service, excellent coffee and yogurt, great prices, and a very walkable neighborhood. This area has real potential to expand with more shops and another eatery or two. Very cute decorations, too! Try Purple Cow! I'll definitely come back.
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2013,9/15/2014,7,15,2,2,3>I really appreciated the guys in the service department.  They were friendly and knowledgeable and didn't mind taking the extra time to explain what they were doing to my car. Also, I was unsure if I would have a ride back home when I dropped off the car and they said they could get me one if I couldn't find anyone.  Really goid experience for me

They put in a good show and made people laugh in the process. I had never heard of this place or seen it because the sign is so small and low to the ground.

<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2014,9/5/2014,29,9,3,4,3>I recently joined this bank and I am really impressed with the customer service. I have yet to receive my debit card but their hours of operation are accommodating enough that I just stop by if I need cash. Upon arrival, there is a person waiting up front to greet you and answer questions. I like this because I may not necessarily have to wait in line to talk to a teller. Although there are only four tellers available, the line moves rather quickly. If you're in search of a new credit union, I highly recommend this bank!
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2014,9/4/2014,40,11,3,2,2>AMAZING place!!! If the lime green walls were not authentic enough for you, the fact the local Hispanic community are frequent patrons...then you know this is the real deal Mexican!  Do not pass this place up!!!

<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/20/2014,8/31/2014,6,2,3,3,4>First time I went I wasn't impressed. Not disappointed - just not impressed. Seemed like basic, cheap, tacos. But I went again, and tried something different, and was amazed. Then I went again, and again, and again, and was very happy each time!(Group of friends went weekly during the summer months)I can be a picky eater and I know that, so when I first went I picked something I thought was "safe", and it was exactly as I expected. Hey, that's what a "safe" dish is for! When I branched out to try things I was unsure of, I was very happy! I've now tried a lot of their menu and can confirm it's delicious.Great atmosphere, and I love that it's a local place. For the other reviewers who gave low scores, I can agree with some points, like maybe it isn't really "authentic" and that it does need a bit of paint, but hey, it's GA, and no one can make it like they can in Mexico. And while I think it could use an update, it's not off-putting, and I think it gives it some character.PS - if you want something quick and delicious, go for the pulled pork tacos. And use the Dichicko's sauce! Also locally made and AMAZING!
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/5/2014,8/30/2014,44,127,3,4,5>Almost overwhelming!   There are NINE buffet bars, plus a hibachi bar AND a sushi bar AND an ice cream bar.  The place is massive. They have a good mix of everything. Some American & local foods...plus some standard Chinese foods. There was so much, I didn't get to try the sushi or the hibachi.  One thing I didn't like is that they didn't label the sushi.  But it did look good!   They have a lot of seafood options! The place is pretty standard though, despite all the options.   The inside is a little run down....it looks like it can use some updating.  But the staff is very nice. They kept our cups filled and our plates cleared off the table. And the price was pretty surprising.  $10 for this massive buffet!
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/3/2014,8/29/2014,188,190,4,9,4>This was my very 1st time here and they pressed a shirt and a pair of pants. $4.25 for the both and nice ;y pressed and very polite service.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,8/28/2014,17,218,3,6,2>.This place is great for your outdoor needs. I have heard people comment they feel the prices are high but I will argue that you are getting considerably more for your money. The items here are of much better quality than you will be getting from any of the other large local suppliers. I will also say that they have great customer service. You don't have to walk around aimlessly hoping you will run into a floor employee, and then hope that they wont run away once they spot you. For me they have a great selection of grilling/smoking needs with several different types of wood chunks. They also have a great selection for your camping needs. Well worth a look if you are serious about the outdoors and want to make sure you get good equipment
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/20/2014,8/27/2014,50,66,4,6,3>My son is 7 years old, entering the 3rd grade next year.  He scored real high on the school assessment and he really enjoys math problems.  I decided to check out mathnasium for him to maintain and get ahead in math.  The director explained the program in detail and made it easy to understand. You play a monthly fee and can attend as many times a week for an hour(more time is given to middle/high school students).  He is currently enrolled in the 6 month program.   Will update my review after the six months are up to see if we could see any improvement.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,8/26/2014,26,41,4,8,3>Knight's is a great place for food at lunch, dinner, and on weekends. Comedy/Poetry Night on Thursdays. Karaoke on Friday Nights. Great mix of Oldies but Goodies by LIVE BANDS on Saturday Nights. Sunday Brunch and Dinner.Comedy/Poetry Night is my favorite! Very funny commedians from all over and 50 Cent Wings too! There is a Slushie Machine with $1 Pink Lemonade and Sweet Tea Slushies available.Get there at 8 for the best seats and admission is only $5.  This is one you should tell everyone about and bring them along! Too funny! Comic CeCedric is the host.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,8/25/2014,18,286,3,10,3>Great company!  We have our own kayak (an inflatable Sea Eagle), and a month or so ago a SRKR employee saw us inflating it and offered to let us use their air pump.  I thought it was cool of them to offer help to people who obviously don't have a need for their services.  We remembered their friendliness when our family was visiting us this past weekend and wanted to go kayaking.  We rented a kayak and had a great time on the canal.  There are so many birds and turtles, and it was a really relaxing ride to Lake Olmstead.  Once we got to the lake, the SRKR employee waiting there helped us pull out our personal kayak as well as the rented one. Very impressed with this company and we'll keep them in mind for when we have family visiting again.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2014,8/24/2014,17,36,4,5,3>Tonight was our first night to this upscale tapas restaurant and bar. Upon entering your struck by the hip ambiance - kind of a California vibe in downtown Augusta.I had the Sierra Nevada and my wife had a cocktail. We devoured the pretzels and cheese. Just the right portions for two people to enjoy. Not long after that our Turkish pizza arrived. Woodfield cooked, thin crust with black olives and cheese. Not greasy like a thin pizza saturates the crust. Our bill was reasonable for two people about $30.Definitely plan to return. I like the dress code of nice shirt and slacks for men. A place where I don't have to see arm pit hair in cut off shirts, backward ball caps and flipflops. We could carry on a conversation without having to shout at each other. Servers were attentive and told us ahead of time the bar tenders take their time with the cocktails. Servers tastefully dressed and one of my favorite scotches served- laphroaig
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/5/2014,8/23/2014,126,56,3,5,4>It truly pains me to have to write a review like this. My reviews are generally based with the food quality weighed very heavily... but my last experience at Pho Bac set me off. The food is the reason this was not a one-star experience.Let me start off on a positive note. The food here is SOLID. I love to start with the summer rolls, and they are consistently fresh, with crispy jicama and shrimp wrapped in the rice paper wrap just begging to be dipped in their peanut sauce.The Pho is as good as anywhere else in the area. I haven't been to, say, california, where the vienamese population is so prevalent... but this is up there with some of the best I have had. The meat comes out on the rare side and is cooked in the broth, as it damn well should be. All the "fixin's" are there for you too. at $8 for a huge bowl, one can't go wrong. It's good for what ails ya. The Banh Mi are probably the damn best sammiches you will ever find at $3.50. The bread is always warm and crispy. The flavor is very well rounded, particularly the char broiled pork. Great flavor of cilantro, lemongrass, and a beautiful sauce...And this is what saves this place for me. I called in an order of the Char grilled pork Banh Mi. ($3.50... can't beat it), and was told that It would be ready for me in 15 minutes... after my arrival, the lady that took my order over the phone said that it was probably ready and had not been boxed up yet, and that I should have a seat. After paying... and waiting an extra 30 minutes looking like the town fool in the middle of the lobby sitting by myself, my order gets placed on a table with some other guy sitting on it. Now... this bag that my food was in... had been sitting behind the counter the ENTIRE TIME... and then is unceremoniously just left there... without a single mention. She even looked at me a number of times.  The lack of communication was absolutely awful. I WANT to love Pho Bac... but in all honesty, if the service isn't consistent and improved from this past experience (Note: that wouldn't take much) in my next few outings, my rating will remain mediocre at best.
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2014,8/22/2014,2,4,2,5,2>I've been here many times and the pizza never disappoints! I always get plain cheese, because if it's good enough, you don't need toppings. The crust is perfect, always crunchy and never soggy. I could sing praises about the pizza all day, but I'll move on. When you order anything, they bring you fresh bread and olive oil with roasted garlic to dip it in - SO good! On the few occasions that I have ordered a pasta dish, the noodles always seem to be overcooked. Besides that disappointment, the sauces and other ingredients are all very good. I must also mention the ranch dressing is sooo good. I'm pretty sure they make all of their dressings in house and they are delicious. Overall, I really love this place and the service is always great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for excellent pizza.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/17/2014,8/21/2014,6,20,2,4,3>My husband and I really enjoyed this hibachi spot. The hibachi was generally very good but the restaurant was what made it better. The staff was all very friendly and the waiting area was nice. It was all also very clean which is refreshing for hibachi. THE SUSHI THOUGH!! It was sooooooo good!!! If you are in the mood for sushi- seriously, go here.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2014,8/19/2014,6,7,2,3,3>Dropped my phone yesterday and the screen cracked. Went in to get my iPhone screen replaced. Staff was nice and friendly. Service was great and quick. Coming from Las Vegas I was worried it would be expensive since there isn't that many cell phone repair in this area. Prices were still very reasonable. If you need a repair I highly recommend dropping by their store.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2014,8/18/2014,8,54,3,9,5>I think I tend to write long winded reviews, so let's keep this one short and sweet. This is the best restaurant in Augusta. The food is spectacular. The menu tells you where the veggies/meats are coming from, mostly all locally sourced, and prepared to perfection. The atmosphere is classy yet not stiff.  The drinks are amazing, try the Frog Hollow Smoked Manhattan.  The Mac and Cheese is absolutely to die for. The service is probably top five in any restaurant I have ever been to. The owners really hit the mark when they made this place. Everything about it is right on the money.I have gone many times and each time the burger, the pork shoulder, the collards, the mac and cheese, and the steak have received rave reviews from everyone at my table. I have never had a bad experience. It's a bit pricey, but well worth it.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2014,8/17/2014,294,318,3,6,4>I was back at the James Brown Arena for an awesome event, an evening with Uncle Charlie and Fantasia. I was so excited for this event for months. I vowed to be in the place when I heard my girl Tasia would be shutting it down in Augusta again. I had been a fan of hers ever since she came out the gate with 'I Believe'. I also had been riding to her new album, The Side Effects of You, for a while, and knew she would be doing some songs off of this album. Obtaining tickets was a breeze and is always a breeze when buying them at the box office. I prefer that over ordering them online. The attendant is able to explain several details to you about the venue and the actual event. The time had come to attend this event, entering the event was easy and non complicated. But there was a snag that came unexpected. The ushers weren't allowing the concert goers into the actual arena until a certain time. The concert was suppose to start a 7:00 but they didn't let us in until later than that making it impossible to start on time. We had to stand there until they started letting people in. The waiting area got really crowded and I began to sweat because of the amount of people that was standing around. Finally they let us in and we took our seats. The show started soon after that. Fantasia came on first and killed it starting of with 'So Much to Prove' of the new album, one of my favorite songs off that album. She did several of her hits and more but they cut some of her time on stage due to the wait we had and the length of Uncle Charlie's set. I didn't find that out until after the concert. She did an amazing job!!! She did not disappoint. Next, it was Uncle Charlie's turn to bless the stage, and that he did!!!! He did an amazing job too!!! He danced and sung his ass off!!!! He mention that he recently had health problems and major surgery but you couldn't tell by the way he performed!!!! This was an awesome show and well worth the time and ticket price. I can't wait to see who will be the next performers I want to see to grace the stage at the JBA. Augusta has been great at bringing performers people really want to see and gladly pay their money for a great show. I hope this lasts for a while because I'm tired of traveling elsewhere to see entertainers I like.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,8/16/2014,70,121,3,6,2>Recently, I had to take my 12 yr. old cat here this past Saturday.  I noticed she was panting, had open mouth breathing and was frequently vomiting.  So I immediately did a search online for the nearest emergency pet hospital and Augusta Animal Emergency was the first one that popped up.I was greeted by the front desk staff and they took me into the exam room and asked if they can take my cat into the back to examine her while I filled out paperwork.  One of the vet techs came back and took my paperwork and informed me that Dr. Runnels will be in with me shortly.  After he arrived, he asked what symptoms I had noticed and I told him what had happened.  I informed him that she was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism about two years ago and he said that she might have formed a blood clot or has fluid in her lungs because hyperthyroidism eventually leads to heart disease.I was devastated.  He asked that they keep her in their facility for about 5-6 hours to do more testing and to give her oxygen therapy.  He said he'll call me with an update around 8pm and that I am more than welcomed to call for updates as well.  Sure enough, he called a little bit before 8pm and said that they gave her diuretics to flush out her system.  He wanted to keep her overnight so I told him that was fine.  We planned to speak with each other again around 8am the next morning.When he called, she was doing a lot better but her heart rate was still high so they wanted to keep her for the day to continue monitoring her.  I called every couple of hours to get updates and they assured me she was doing well and that they were making progress with everything.  They said she was ready to go home but asked if they could possibly keep her again overnight until the next morning.  Well, I really was anxious to have her home so I politely declined and asked if I can take her home.  I spoke with Dr. Peters this time and she was really friendly and informative about discharge instructions and the medications they will prescribe.  Then she offered her recommendations when I visit my regular vet.Overall, I would definitely recommend this pet hospital.  Their exam/visit fee is $90 and they do offer a military discount.  I was actually surprised with the total cost of everything.  They quoted me $700-$1000 but I ended up paying $600.  When I brought her in, they asked for a $500 deposit.  Ouch, but it needed to be done.  At the time of discharge, we paid the $100.  They also accept Care Credit and you might want to ask if there are any incentives like a no-interest offer.  Thank you Augusta Animal Emergency, you saved my little kitty and she's doing a lot better!
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2014,8/15/2014,49,77,3,3,2>Malia's is great for a working lunch or a quiet evening dinner. I've been here several times and the food, atmosphere,  and service are always impeccable.  On this occasion I had the edamame cakes over a spinach salad. The Wasabi sauce was a perfect compliment to the cakes. It's nice to have great vegetarian options available in a small town. Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the bread; it wasn't very good. It was hard, almost burned and lacked flavor. I opted for the minestrone soup for my appetizer rather than eat the bread. You can order a half bowl of soup, but it isn't mentioned on the menu. Ask your server.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2014,8/14/2014,42,322,3,3,3>Love this place. First tried it in the fall when it opened. Happy to support a former Gamecock. I like the concept of building your sandwich on the bag then handing it over. I think it leaves less room for error.  I would recommend going online and checking the whole process and menu out before you try it. There are a lot of options. :) The ease of ordering online is a huge plus too. I have done this on more than one occasion. We've done it from our phones! Food:My go to is the Cuban. I like wheat bread and I like to "skinny my wich", and have it heated. Yum. I've also tried the Monte Cristo, and that's a Yum too!  As is the Club! My husband's go to is The Wicked. Loves it. At some point I'll branch out and try some of the others, so many look good. I think this place is a great addition to the sandwich shop options in Aiken.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/25/2011,8/13/2014,4,16,2,6,1>Yay for Adventure Crossing! Fun, friendly, clean, and entertaining. As a mother I am always looking for more activities to enjoy with my son. He just turned two so there aren't a whole heaping lot of places I can take him to just let loose. We visited Adventure Crossing this past week and purchased a package deal for 20 bucks per child which included 2 go cart rides, 8 midway (roller coasters, etc.), and I believe two put put games. I thought it was a pretty good deal. I would have come out fairly cheap if I weren't a child myself at heart, we played a ton of skee ball and some other games indoors when it got too hot for outdoor play. Overall a great experience, it's always fun making memories with my little one!

It has become one of my regular stops among the TJ Maxx-Ross-Marshall's treasure hunt circuit shopping. Keeping in mind that it is a clearinghouse where you may not find the same item twice, don't think long or it's gone!
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2012,8/9/2014,25,23,4,4,3>My husband had been away for nearly two months doing Army training. He called to say he was an hour out at 5pm...We had both been wanting to try Sconyers so I thought that take out from there would be an awesome idea....I ordered the Plantation Platter,  this is a lot of food, and you get a sample of everything. I1/4 chicken, chopped pork and beef, 2 ribs, potato salad and half a plate of hash on rice. I also ordered the turkey breast. The chopped pork was kind of blah...the ribs were pretty good, the turkey breast was awesome..we had so much that we couldn't eat the chicken that night...and it did not weather so well in the fridge, it was really dry. Their sauces were ok. I fell in love with that hash, which is a miracle because i tried hash around Columbia sc and it was really gross, so i went in with a negative attitude of hash, and wow was i pleased to be wrong.  We got our moneys worth, and we will be looking forward to a dine in with Sconyers soon.

Also service department is 1st class. Just took my 2013 in for scheduled maint. Was given a loaner. I also wanted to get a small dent removed from trunk. Their price was very reasonable. The repair and touch up took through Mon.  They asked me to keep loaner over weekend.  This was not covered maint. Awesome! Thursday when I dropped my car off and given a ES 350 hybrid loaners, the service assistant asked me if I would like a cup of coffee before going! A great morning send off. Recommend them highly!

<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,8/1/2014,8,3,4,4,2>I get how looking at this place might give someone reservations about the quality of food served. After all, it is attached to a gas station. Let me assure you if you are looking for a cool and clean place to eat, that you can get your money's worth, Sand Bar Grill is the place for you. That staff is so friendly, and they great you as you walk up. They have made to order burgers, a hot bar, and dare I say the best fried chicken in Augusta. If you are into healthy, clean eating they have salads that you can eat off of for a couple meals. Great choice for lunch and breakfast.My only critique for them is this. Start making your own salad dressings the bottled stuff you serve is good but handmade dressing could put it over the top.
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/10/2014,7/31/2014,7,10,3,2,2>Much more money for a mani/pedi than what I'm used to compared to when I lived in Atlanta. It was an okay experience. The water wasn't hot enough for me but it got the job done. A teenaged boy did my mani/pedi and he did a really good job. He was sure to ask me if he was hurting me or not. He wasn't shy...I like to talk to my nail technicians if they are able to hold a bit of conversation with me. Outside of the price it was a good experience. Not sure if I'll go back though...
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2012,7/30/2014,10,19,4,7,2>Thai Kitchen is, simply, the best Thai restaurant I've had in over a decade.First, the bad: speed of service.  The owner is often the only waiter available, and when the restaurant gets full, service can get slow.Now, the good.  The food is phenomenal.  Well seasoned, well cooked.  The rice is firm but not mushy.  The satay is juicy, tender and flavorful.  The curry is perfectly spicy and mouthwatering.  There is not a Thai restaurant  in 100 miles that can compare.I mentioned the slow service.  The potential lag in celerity is the only negative that can be said about it.  The staff are polite and exceedingly kind.  They often provide my children with white rice, gratis (my kids LOVE white rice).  In fact, they will often provide endless rice to the entire party - which is a nice alternative to places that seem to charge by the gram.The accept credit cards, of course, but I get the impression that the merchant fees hurt.  We try and pay with cash whenever possible.  Delicious family owned restaurants like Thai Kitchen are like a sip of wine for a dusty throat, and I want to keep them around as long as possible.  If I thought I could afford it, I would offer to buy his recipes if he ever closes his doors -- the thought of going without that Thai Fried Rice is unbearable.Long story short (too late!): go.

<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2010,7/26/2014,11,6,3,4,2>The place was nicely decorated and clean. Seating was fast, and the tables are separated from each other by bamboo screens for privacy.  The female bathroom was tidy and spacious. We ordered seafood pancake for out appetizer, which was great.  For our entrees we ordered beef bim bim bap and the spicy seafood noodle soup (N1).  The soup is really spicy and comes with clams, oyster, shrimp, octopus, and veggies.  They give a lot but it was soooo good! They also have karaoke in a separate room.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,7/25/2014,10,30,3,3,2>Outstanding, me and the co workers decided to try this place out and couldn't have been any more satisfied. I ordered the grilled chicken Caesar wrap with chicken noodle soup and boy was it delicious, it was fresh ingredients and a nicely sized portion. I enjoyed it so much I forgot to take a picture but we will be eating this again the next day and I will upload a picture. I recommend this place it has a friendly staff and very nice clean restaurant to hang out with friends!
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2013,7/24/2014,7,5,3,2,2>Ok...I know the décor in this place is really dated and it is a little dark. However let me say that the food is great. If your looking something simple yet tasty. This is it. The daily double is the way to go. It's a turkey sandwich, sliced when ordered, on homemade sour dough bread with a cup of their "homemade" soup. The cost is $2.95...yep that's what I said...$2.95. They also have a variety of sweets to choose from. Located in downtown Augusta this place has been here since 1946.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2014,7/23/2014,59,7,3,3,2>If you have a little extra time, I'd recommend coming here. Sometimes there can be quite a wait, but the results are good. I get my eyebrows waxed here and pedicures. My eye brows ALWAYS look fierce when I leave (thx to Tina)! Pretty good service and it's pretty affordable. I don't know that the jelly pedi has made it's way to this salon yet, but the nail technicians do a great job! I would say that I wish the wait time was always predictable. Overall, I give it 4 stars.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/2/2014,7/22/2014,4,6,3,2,2>Been here twice now. Had a Shrimp Po Boy the first time and a Chicken BBQ Philly the second time. Good food. Good Coleslaw also which is one of the ways I judge a good BBQ spot. I gave 4 stars due to the small selection of beef on the menu. If you like pork then you will have no problems. Brisket on the other hand is another issue. I find Brisket is hard to come by in Georgia as it is.

<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/15/2014,7/19/2014,0,3,2,3,3>Wow! This place is great as a quick stop! They cook the food where you can see it, the bowls are HUGE (my 3 kids and I just shared 2 and we are stuffed... Bringing home left overs). Highly recommend. They do take out too.

<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,7/14/2014,15,35,2,3,2>It's great to go to a place where people remember who you are! We got there when it was closing, but they served us anyway (we got our eyebrows cleaned up)! It is a nice clean establishment and very friendly staff. They have recently remodeled the space and it looks great. They have televisions for the men and women when those pedicures are taking place and they have a private space for waxing so people don't see you crying! They do offer gift certificates for special occasions or just because!
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/14/2010,7/13/2014,9,14,3,5,3>Miyako is a 5-star restaurant when viewed in the context of its surroundings: the CSRA. I will spare you the Augusta rant today, and will leave you unfulfilled with the knowledge that Miyako is objectively good, but not great, This restaurant was previously (like months ago) called "Kobe" or something like that, and experienced a ton of new business when it opened about a year or two ago with its fancy fountain and sheek modern decor. Best of all, they offered 50% off all sushi for an indefinite amount of time. That's probably what led to them going out of business and changing their name to Miyako and smashing the fountain with a sledge hammer (witnessed by me). Maybe the fountain contained some bad Qi, I don't know.. When I first moved to Augusta, I went on a manhunt for tasty sushi, because my wife has a limited, yet discerning palatte, and I would sell my birthright for a bento box of sashimi. When you walk in the restaurant, to your immediate left is the sushi area, and straight ahead is an array of Hibachi tables. The sushi area is decorated modern-lounge style. There are clusters of tall-backed leather chairs surrounding small coffee tables, which I have never seen occupied by anyone, accompanied by an equally lonely bar. Then there are some tables and booths, the lighting is low, there's a cool globe chandelier. I feel like I want to become a tech-savvy Japanese business man, tired after a long day battling Mothra and Ghidora in the streets of Tokyo, plopping down at the sushi bar with "real Japanese sushi chefs" and sip some kirin ichiba. The sushi is decent quality but GREAT presentation. They have many different shaped dishes, and they present their food well. I recommend the Sushi Entree, because A) the jew in me is always looking for a deal, B) its a ton of bang for the buck. There is your standard fare of sushi rolls with a good selection of over-priced specialty rolls as well. The sweet potato tempura leaves what to be desired, kind of soggy and doesnt have the characteristic *crunch* that gets me all riled up, and I've seen a hair in the miso before. But I look beyond it, because of all the sushi restaurants in Augusta, it has the best ambiance, the best presentation, and the prices are midrange. The service is standard for Augusta: slow. But you're not gonna get better service elsewhere, so get over it. If you like sushi and are in the CSRA, this should be in your top 3.

<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2014,7/11/2014,2,9,2,3,2>The cottage pie was great and they had a great blackberry dessert but after ordering it and being told multiple times that they were in the oven our waitress came out to tell us that they only had one left (we had ordered 4) they were out of a couple of other things as well but it was so good that I'll still come back.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,7/10/2014,2,7,2,3,2>I went in and had a fabulous experience the first time.  The second time was a pretty awful experience.The managers and consultants jumped through hoops to make it right. They didn't take on the "Oh we lost a customer but that's okay, there will always be brides and therefore more business" approach. I went back and had a great experience the third time. Don't be afraid to tell them if something bothered you. They actually care, they will feel bad, and they will try their absolute hardest to make it right.
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2013,7/9/2014,22,68,2,6,2>More affordable, better quality, and as fresh as it gets compared to your local supermarket
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2014,7/8/2014,7,7,2,4,2>Amazing KC BBQ--if you are visiting know they just moved across the street in a month or so ago to a bigger location.  For those not familiar with KC style BBQ, it's low&slow smoked meat that takes about a day to cook, and generally sauce is applied sparingly because the meat is so tender and juicy.  Personally I prefer Carolina style BBQ sauce over KC (KC is vinegar based) but honestly I don't even add any sauce when I order from Mr. Fosters!  Definitely go for the ribs or combo sandwich!
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2013,7/7/2014,0,2,2,3,2>Great place to eat, hangout watching the game, drinking some suds, or just to eat dessert. I resisted the deep fried honey bun as long as I could. Now I know why. My wife and I shared one and after two bites I wanted my own!  Great fried pickles and down home cooking. Wedge salad sooo big I couldn't eat it all.
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2013,7/6/2014,10,18,1,4,2>Good place to bring friends. Open room atmosphere. The menu is rotating and they have a good blend of meats and fish.  Appetizer: seafood bruchetta is fantastic. Wonderful and I would recommend this to everyone coming.  Apple salad: HANDs DOWN one of the best salads i have ever had IN MY life.  great pungent cheese mixed with the gentle sweetness of the apple.  Loved it. Only salad i have ever LOVED.Muscles appetizer is not as fragrant as I'd like. The chorizo in there is good thoughHighly recommend for dinner!Specials are always great.  Fried chicken stuffed.  Pretty good meal, solid for 17$.  Pretty reliable.Lamb: very rich and delicious.  nice glazeI don't recommend Fish here.  It's not the best place in augusta for that kind of thing.  Go to SheehansBouilbase: Oh Man. i know i can't spell that.  but this is great.  Seafood mixed with rice and stewed.  Love it.  Good choice of wines.  Nice place.  I regularly rotate this place into my dining events.

At any rate, their cupcakes are beyond delicious.We tried the Coffee Toffee Blondie, Apple Walnut, and My Sweet Cherry Pie.Heavenly!We also split a peanut butter cookie, and it was like POW! peanut butter! In yo' face!It was very good, large, moist, and my peanut butter minded husband wishes he had bought more.We bought a dozen to bring home to extended family, and they couldn't have been more pleased.Will certainly be patronizing this bakery as often as we can!I can't wait to snag one of their cakes!
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/25/2014,7/2/2014,2,8,,2,1>Good old-fashioned cigar shop, that can't be beat. This is the best cigar shop in town and for at least 100 miles. Fuente, Opus X, Ashton VSG, Padron, this place has all the best names in premium cigars. To make it even better they have a smokers lounge where you can enjoy the cigars you just bought, with seating for about 12 people. This is easily the most friendliest and knowledgable staff I have ever seen in a family owned cigar shop anywhere. Poker on Mondays, which is free, and dominoes anytime of the day with one to three tables outside on a covered deck depending on how busy they are. Fells like I'm back in Miami. Love this place.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/1/2014,7/1/2014,5,8,2,3,2>Slow.Other than that, a great experience.  Cash only. Food isn't life changing but it is good and the atmosphere is really the selling point. The family is very nice, take a little time one morning.  Have a sweet tea and some pancakes and enjoy all of the horse racing history on the walls.

<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2014,6/27/2014,4,10,1,2,1>I grew up in a South Texas border town so I'm used to pretty real Mexican food. Even though Mexican food restaurants in Augusta/Evans isn't as tasty as where I used to live Salsa's is pretty darn good.  I asked if they had flautas (crispy chicken taquitos) and they said they do so that's what I ordered.  The weird thing was that the 3 people with me got their food first, I had to wait a while longer for my meal. I thought that was odd but once I got my plate I was really pleased. I could tell that they made the flautas fresh as soon as the order was put in so they were piping hot and delicious. They went great with my top shelf margarita. This is a wonderful restaurant with great service and food.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/21/2014,6/26/2014,5,4,2,5,2>My family has been enjoying authentic Italian food from Giuseppe's for over a decade. We order take-out most of the time and are always impressed at how quickly our orders are accurately prepared, hot & fresh (never soggy), generous servings - baked spaghetti w/meat sauce is enough for dinner & lunch the next day for my son and I! Our favorites are the meatball sub, pizza sub, Philly cheese steak, Lasagna, Chicken Parm, and, of course, Spaghetti! Every app we've ordered has been delicious! We especially like the deep fried ravioli! It's easy to fill up on the delicious bread .. try to avoid that or you'll ruin your dinner! :-)Also, I like the crust on my  pizza, Stromboli, calzone's "well done" and the cooks have always been more than willing to accommodate when I've asked. It's an exceptionally clean charming little place and decorated simply, but we go for the food, not the wallpaper.  Lunch and dinner time (5-7 pm 'ish) can be very busy, but short wait times otherwise. Just go! You won't be disappointed!
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/20/2014,6/25/2014,44,127,2,3,2>The lunch special is an AWESOME value.  You get a ton of food PLUS soul and salad.I went here for sushi last night,  The prices are very reasonable.  If you get the dinner special, you get 2 rolls, soup and salad.  Awesome deal.The restaurant is very clean and staff is very friendly.

<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2011,6/21/2014,1,5,3,18,6>I've been looking for a gym since I moved to the Augusta area. I'm in the Army, but the gym on post is always overcrowded and is inconvenient since I live in Martinez.   I walked into Live Fit Augusta and was immediately greeted by the front desk staff. I told them I was interested in membership, and was shown to a desk nearby. The first thing I noticed was how clean and bright the place was. All the equipment was VERY spaced out. Other gyms I visited had their equipment right on top of each other, but not here.   Austin told me a bit about the place, and got to know my needs. I'm not looking for classes, fancy locker rooms with pool tables or massage chairs, day care, or anything like that, and  Austin said thats exactly what they thought when they designed the place.    The equipment is top-notch. There's fifty pieces of cardio gear (Matrix), to include ellipticals, bikes, and tredmills. They all have touch-screen TV's with cable TV, iPod/iPhone hook up that allows you to watch downloaded vids on the screens and then track your workout via Nike+ app, and a virtual reality hike/run through Yosemite Park, downtown Chicago, and others.    The strength machines are top of the line Matrix as well, complete with automated counter and timers. They have all the machines I would normally use, and a good free-weight section as well.   The locker rooms are clean, although the lockers are a bit small and there are only three showers. (Men's side, at least). But every time I've been in there, it wasn't busy or crowded, so it never bothered me.   Like I said earlier, they don't offer group classes, but they're adjacent to The Ultimate Ride fitness which offers yoga, spinning, zumba, etc, so if thats what you're looking for, it's right there. They do offer personal training, but I didn't ask much about it.    Out the door, I paid a $99 enrollment fee and signed up for $9.99 a month, no contracts, month-to-month. The best price of any place in town, for exactly what I want.  Overall, the place is perfect for me. Top of the line gear with cool entertainment features, low price, no contract, not pretentious or loud, and friendly staff.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/27/2013,6/20/2014,2,19,2,4,2>Reading the few reviews of folks who have "given tin drum three chances" or "two chances" and so on begs the question: if you didn't have a great experience, why the heck would you go back? If it didn't appease your East Asian fix the first time, chances are you'll continue to be disappointed. Anyways, I love this place. It is fast, food is good, and people are friendly. Tin Drum curry is my favorite thing on the menu. I always add mixed veggies and get it spicy. It's delicious and filling. For around $10 I don't think you can get much better. I did find a hair in my food once, but they remade my dish and quickly and totally redeemed themselves.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2014,6/19/2014,39,24,2,3,2>I can't say enough great things about this place.  I go there approximately 2-3 times a week for lunch.  My favorite quick meal is their "Punky Monkey" smoothie.  The sweet heat chicken selections can't be beat with fresh local grown veggies.  They're very busy at lunch so expect to wait a minute for your food but not too long. I always finish my meals there but never feel stuffed due to the low fat/healthy selections. Will always recommend and keep going back! ;p
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,6/18/2014,7,15,2,10,3>Okay, this place is more like 4 stars for me, but for Augusta... This is place is 5 stars.  16.99 dinner for Adults all you can eat buffet.  You have your choice of sushi, cooked or raw fish. They had about 15 different specialty rolls to choose from, not just the plain jane stuff.  They had different onigiri, different cuts of tuna, red and white. Sea urchin, ikura and tobiko.  Oyster shooters and huge oysters on half shell.  Crab legs and shrimp cocktail. They have salad with ginger dressing too.Besides the sushi, they have fried foods like, chicken katsu, huge shrimp tempura, gyoza, vegetable tempura, and other fried goods with their respective sauces.  Next to that they had a soup station with egg drop soup, build your miso soup, and something else.  Next to thaat they have a stir fry station, build your own meats, veggies, and noodle bowl and they cook it fresh and hot.  Lastly, they have fruits and sweets and they also have an ice cream freezer with little individual ice cream cups which are cute and sanitary.  This place is very clean, beautiful lighting, cute soft music playing, comfy booths and chairs.  They have a huge staff that are constantly checking on you and clearing plates.  Bathrooms are very clean and modern.  There is a large parking lot...Thats about it.The food is not high end Sukiyabashi style serious sushi.  But, it is fresh, well put together and tasty.  I could go to Miyako on Washington and get almost the same quality food, but two rolls will cost me 20 bucks there... Which is understandable, but I'd rather have all you can eat here at Izumi for 17 bucks.  Same quality food as the other Augusta sushi joints, but different presentation.I have heard that it is best to come on weekends, I guess Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.  I will stick to that rule, I don't want to be disappointed if I come on a weekday.  We came on a Friday, Valentines day.  The place was packed, thank goodness we arrived at 5pm, after an hour or so families were coming in by the hoards, I was glad to see it busy, I do not like being the only customer at a restaurant.  I hope this place never closes down.  Thats about it.  Try this place out.  It's decent.  I will definitely come here at least once a  month.
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2014,6/17/2014,17,3,2,7,2>Not too far from Fort Gordon.  Came to eat lunch in a group.  Took a little long to get food out, but the restaurant was pretty busy so it was understandable.  Plus, the food was delicious.  I had the Chicken Teriyaki plate with macaroni salad and potato salad.  Everything was tasty and nobody in the group of 6 complained about the taste of their food.  My one complaint is that the food was served with lots of plastic and styrofoam.  It seems wasteful and I cringe just imagining the landfill...  Tip: They don't offer tap water like most American restaurants do; instead, you buy a water bottle for $1.All the common Hawaii favorites can be found here: ahi poke, spam musubi, teriyaki beef, Kailua pork, along with the Hawaiian soft drinks like Strawberry Guava and so on.Definitely would come back.

Jesus the owner is friendly and fantastic. The food is outstanding and I suggest trying something on the menu that the other local Mexican restaurants don't have. I enjoy the Chicken Taco Loco, and the Chipotle Chicken they are addictive. Two of the Jumbo Texas Margaritas is all it takes to make any day better. In addition the salsa is spicier than most and the guacamole casera is filled with lime and deliciousness. Give it a shot and I believe like is you will become a regular.

At a time where everything is advertised as Natural, Organic, and Green... It's good to find a place where the products are as pure and simple as they say they are.  Monique and staff use the best most nutrient-rich ingrdients to produce their soaps, oils lotions and such.  Think Bath and Body Works meets Carol's Daughter with a hint of a family farm. Even though Monique doesn't profess a lineage connected to the Nina, Pinta, or Santa Maria, she does share that creating thhis lovely space and the special gifts found within have been a marvelous journey for her. Well, on behalf of all who get to sample PSC wares, I say thank you for following your path and allowing yourself to be used as the vessel which brought forth the products we love!I/m thoroughly enjoying my Blu' Sea Oil. #stellar

Bartenders Vince and Theron are premier mixologists who bring energy and youth to a historic landmark of Augusta. Adjacent to the bar is a porch overlooking Walton Way complete with couches and coffee tables as well as heaters during the winter. Not to be forgotten, the food is also exquisite. I highly recommend the buffalo wings and the crab cakes.  If you're new to the area or just looking for something new and upscale, give the PI Bar and Grille a shot. You won't be disappointed.

Especially if you can get a table by the window seats with a candle. However, don't bother trying to call ahead to make a reservation. The Bees Knees has a 'no-reservation-policy' unless you show up and your name down on the list. As a vegetarian, I'm crazy for their Pad Thai Tofu (very NOM!).
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2014,6/6/2014,17,218,3,6,2>Truly one of the gems in augusta. It's one of those places unless you have been there you will miss it and have to turn around. It's small but great atmosphere. Great bartender. They allow smoking so that would be a tick against but the venue with the bartender make up for it. I mean how often does a bartender really make you feel welcome and make you feel as a valued customer.  Best drinks, best beer selection no but just give it a try when there is some love music to see if you agree.

The owner is very much in deep and has the passion for this.She said her Mother has a business and she uses family recipes. That day i was looking at her menu, small but a good amount of choices. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich to go because it was time to head back to work and it was so good and the bun was kind of sweet but the pork was infused in a sauce the my mouth never tasted. Prices are what they are- you get what you pay for- a great and wonderful taste of flavors in your mouth. Stop by.
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2014,6/1/2014,294,318,7,9,5>As I stated in my previous review of Roma's Pizza, I love them and have loved them since I was a kid. This is New York style pizza at its finest. They recently did some remodeling and hired new staff to run this business. The business facelift is really cute and quaint. It gives the restaurant a intimate, Italian feel. The new General manager, Rick Baldwin, goes beyond his job description to make sure the experience at Roma's is the absolute best. He was ringing customers up, delivering food to the tables, and I even saw him in the kitchen prepping food. Things like that makes restaurants appeal to people for years. The menu has also gotten a facelift as well. They added more Italian entrees to the menu. They even sell sub sandwiches with fries here as well.They also have new desserts. I always come for the pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni is so full of flavor and the cheese they use is an upgrade from a regular one to Bacio Exceptional Italian Pizza cheese. This cheese is made with mozzarella cheese and Buffalo milk. It brings the pizza to life and gives it a great kick. The pizza is also gluten-free now. I know this is a plus for the customers who are health conscious.Roma's Pizza really revved up its game when it came to revamping the place. I enjoy each and every change that was implemented. I can see Roma's pizza growing and becoming more successful than ever before. The staff is great, the food is great, the atmosphere is great, and the price is oh so great!!!!
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2013,5/31/2014,4,83,1,4,1>Made my first visit today. I got the pan seared steak. Very lean and tender, very good. I also had sautéed mushrooms. They were partially burnt, but i like mine like that. You may not. I also had eggplant grilled in olive oil. Very yummy, if you like olive oil. My family enjoyed their meals, and proclaimed it will be a repeat. You will have a wait for your food. Its a small place and very popular for lunch. I plan on trying the breakfast soon. - We finally made it to breakfast. They had the best bacon I have ever had. It was very smokey, and I loved it.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2014,5/30/2014,21,20,2,5,2>This place is fantastic when you are in the mood for down home southern food.  The pork is fantastic and I love the BBQ sauce and homemade honey mustard.  I tried it for the first time the other day and I would recommended it to everyone! We will be going back!
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/8/2013,5/29/2014,1,14,2,6,2>I went to this establishment on a Wednesday. I ordered ribs with pulled pork, The meat was hot and very delicious. There was 4 bbq sauces and I tried all four and they had the kick I was looking for. I really liked this place and I will be back. Also the staff was friendly!
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2014,5/28/2014,84,446,3,5,4>Sconyers is the place for real, old fashioned, oak and hickory, pit-cooked BAR-B-QUE. When your taste buds yearn for the honest taste of old- fashioned bar-b-que, Sconyers has to be your choice. - Great service- $15 platter for two-- Plenty of parking- Only open 3-days- Out of BBQ by Saturday night- Beautiful surroundings- Friendly atmosphere- Courteous staff- Dive-thru optionThey say that barbecue is popular because it combines the maximum of temptation with the maximum of opportunity. You'll have plenty of that at Sconyers. Succulent, tender ribs, lean mouth watering tenderloin and flavorful hash all cooked to perfection from a secret family recipe. My wife and I split the half sampler ($15) and some free loaf of which bread that was on the table. It proved useful when the food arrived. I found myself transported into an episode of BBQ Pit Masters. This plate came with chicken, smoked turkey, two meaty ribs, slices of beef and chopped pork. I ate every bit.The ribs were really moist, pulled pork was so delish,  smoked turkey was tasty and the hash rice was packed with flavor. The potato salad was just OK, it was too chunky. The chicken was dry and burnt. That was the only disappointment.In the end you can get more with a kind word and a barbecue than you can with a kind word alone. I am looking forward to coming back here!
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2014,5/27/2014,0,1,3,7,2>My wife and I have been here multiple times. The family that runs this business is super friendly and helpful. We took my parents (+-60) today and they loved it!Oh, and the shuttle that some complained about is not bad at all. Each vehicle has a/c and a friendly driver that wants to know how you enjoyed your trip! If you are that impatient don't pay for the shuttle and call a cab.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2013,5/26/2014,5,5,2,7,2>I grew up spoiled by my mother professionally coloring my hair.. When we to a different state I had to find my own stylist. I went through 3 different ones until I finally found a lady who lived up to my high standards! Ask for Brandi & tell her Heather Fearneyhough sent you! She is EXCELLENT !
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,5/25/2014,60,8,2,8,3>One of my favorite places to eat in Augusta. The service can be a bit slow but the food is great. Known for their burgers my favorite dishes are the far easy chicken bowl and they curry plate. Very very good. The shrimp they use in the tacos and salad are some of the best shrimp I ever had also. The place is very aesthetically pleasing. Ever since they opened it's made some of my other downtown favorites reinvest in their own establishments to keep up. When businesses compete customers win. Really wish they had that happy hour special they had when they first opened then they'd see me daily
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,5/24/2014,5,18,2,4,5>Neat idea, unique, and the service is great.My husband loves their donuts, he has tried so many of their toppings.The shop is also right next to the movies, so its pretty cute for a date night.I get my yogurt, he gets his donuts.-update to march, 2014-Now my husband comes here at least once a week. He seriously loves these guys. Lol
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,5/23/2014,33,12,3,7,6>If you havent experienced this spot, you are doing yourself a disservice! From the two person set up in the front to the large networking table in the back you can have a quiet conversation or meet a handful of new friends.The sweet woman in a cowboy hat is the owner and will whip up a drink that is designed just for YOUR tastebuds. My father always told me I had a cup of cream, light on the coffee and she made mine as well as my double expresso loving beaus drink to perfection. I've also frequented her for lunch and got hooked on the signature 903 club so I cant tell you about the other menu items. Maybe today is the day I venture out as I've gotten hungry just writing this review!
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2014,5/22/2014,15,20,2,5,5>When my fiance and I first entered this place, I was a bit skeptical of how good the food would be because there were no customers there and the inside was darkly lit. However, once we sat down and started talking to our waiter/chef, I was pleasantly surprised. The man offered recommendations of which foods to try (since we had never had German food before) and they were spot on to our tastes.I had the gulasch which is a type of gravy and meat poured on top of these noodle like things (see my picture to understand what I'm talking about). It was very heavy on the stomach which was actually a good thing because I had skipped breakfast that morning. About halfway through the meal, my fiance and I switched plates so we could get a new taste on our palates. My fiance ordered the jaegerschnitzel which is fried pork and this was also topped with gravy (though you can get it without). It came with chunks of potato too which complimented the pork. This plate is also a bit heavy on the stomach, but very delicious.Overall, I liked this place. It wasn't the most amazing food I've had, but I'd recommend others to give this place a try (especially if you're a 'meat and potatoes' type of person). We paid about $7.50 per dish during lunch. Dinner is a bit pricy at about $12 a dish.
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2013,5/21/2014,3,2,2,6,4>Great experience, food was awesome and if you have a chance ask for Mark he was one of the best servers I had XD  Yay we found a new favorite joint :)
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,5/20/2014,8,54,2,13,4>This place has been on my list for a few months now, since it opened. So upset I waited this long! The restaurant is located in the space a coffee shop used to be in, and it is great.  I have a dislike for all things related to chain restaurants, and this was as far as you could get.The decor is obviously something that someone sat down, thought about, and picked. I love it! Tables and chairs made by local craftsmen, it feels like there was someone picking everything from the chairs to the wine glasses.The food was good.  Not great, but good. The shrimp and grits were good. It's a bit strange though--they are technically a tapas restaurant, but the items were sort of in-between. I feel like my experience with tapas restaurants is that they have these tiny plates that are priced cheaply, and only have a few bites of food on them, so you order a whole bunch of plates and everyone shares. And you order a first 'wave' of plates, then maybe try some other stuff or order more of the same stuff or whatever. This was different. Their entrees are not tiny but they weren't the standard huge american restaurant size portion either. In fact, they are just right. They are the perfect portion I am looking for when I eat dinner. I don't think I would change anything if I were them, but I don't consider this a tapas restaurant. It's just a restaurant. A good restaurant, as a matter of fact. The charcuterie board is wonderful. They have a huge selection of stuff and all of it is good.The staff are excellent. The manager comes to each table and is very friendly. Our waitress was wonderful. The best part though, was the drinks. Whoever made the drinks list is a genius. The drinks are all unique, tasty, and really are phenomenal.Overall this place is awesome, and I really hope it sticks around for a long time. I hope they keep doing everything that they are doing right.
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2014,5/19/2014,42,322,2,9,5>Dined here several weeks ago with a group. There was live music, which we enjoyed. That said the acoustics could use some work. The staff was dressed in a "Speakeasy Style" and was very helpful and friendly. They easily answered all my questions about the menu.  For an appetizer we had the House made chips, and we devoured them. My husband had the pear salad and enjoyed it thoroughly. For our entrees my husband had the short ribs and the only way he could have eaten more would have been to lick his plate. Delicious! I had the pork chop with rice and broccoli. It was excellent. Others in our group had the scallops and salmon. Everyone enjoyed their meals, though we all would have liked a better balance of rice to broccoli. Less rice, more veggies! We enjoyed our dinner and would go back!
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/21/2014,5/18/2014,49,77,2,6,4>I dropped by to purchase a red velvet cake for Easter dinner. Best. Decision. Ever. The icing was the best part, but the cake was delicious, dense and moist.  I've only dinned in a few times, but they have renovated since the last time I was there. The back part of the restaurant is used solely for desserts now. This is my number 1 dessert place in downtown Augusta. The cake slices are huge! So, I knew where to go when I was told to pick up dessert for dinner.
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/13/2014,5/17/2014,70,121,2,8,4>We ordered take-out for dinner here last night.  We called to place an order, however the lady didn't specify what time it would be ready.  So when we arrived about 10 minutes after calling, there were a few people ahead of us waiting to pick up their orders.  We waited for about 10 minutes to get our food.  So my suggestion is to at least give them 15-20 minutes to prepare your food in case they don't tell you what time it will be ready.Quality of food was good.  We ordered chicken fried rice, Mongolian beef, chow mein, egg drop soup, beef teriyaki with white rice, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken and crab ragoons.  They also have party plates as well.  Their prices are inexpensive.  For everything, we paid about $42.00.  Not bad at all and they give you a lot of food too.They are located next to Bi-Lo off of Tobacco Rd.  I'll be returning here to order their party plates when we host our next weekend gathering.
<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2014,5/16/2014,11,14,2,11,4>Emilio's is fairly new, it wasn't even on yelp yet I had to add it. It replaced a Mexican restaurant previously at that location. The location is not exactly the best, it is located with a not so upscale hotel.I didn't really know what to expect from this place but was pleasantly surprised. Our waiter, Neal, was extremely eager to please us and anything he didn't know he quickly got us an answer.Even though it wasn't the norm, he let us sample our drinks before we ordered. The Italian Sangria was delicious by the way!We started off with the lobster bacon soup. The soup was incredibly delicious with one huge exception....one of the soups had a hair in it :-( It was a little hard to stay motivated after that but Neal tried really hard to make up for it. I had the Seafood Pasta Alfredo which was super yummy. The serving of seafood and plate portion was just right. My boyfriend had Grilled Salmon with broccoli. I sampled it and it was very good too. We ended the night with a cheesecake dessert that was just as delicious as the rest of the meal. All in all I would have to say this place has it going on. If it hadn't been for the hair in the soup incident I totally would have given this place a 5 star review. I would definitely recommend this place and would come back even if it's just for drinks!
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/30/2012,5/15/2014,18,78,4,4,3>I'm a big book fan and they had some neat stuff.  However, it is small and the selection isn't that big.  Probably the best used bookstore in the area though.
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2013,5/14/2014,3,10,2,4,3>This is truly a gem of a restaurant. If you want excellent Mediterranean ( Turkish ) food, this is the place to go. The staff are very helpful and friendly. They genuinely care about your experience here. My wife is Turkish and I have been to Turkey and had the food there and I can tell you that Best Bites matches the delicious tastes of that region. I had the Gyro (doner) platter and my wife had the Moussaka (sp?). Both were incredibly delicious.  We also had the falafel and it was delicious. It is a wonderful place for dinner. A person will go out of here full and happy because of the generous portion sizes. One will not be disappointed here. Afiyet Olsun!
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2014,5/13/2014,59,7,2,6,3>So, I come here for trivia on Thursday nights, but I've heard great things about the lunch served here and thought I'd stop in. The wings are great! It's quiet during the day with the exception of the televisions, but I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. And as usual, the wings are delicious. I'm trying to branch out to other items on the menu, but the famous "544 wings" have my full attention right now, lol!

<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2012,5/11/2014,15,7,2,7,3>My husband best friend and I tried Betsy's last week and were pleasantly surprised. I love American food/diners etc., and my name is Betsy so I had to try it. My friend and I each ordered cheeseburgers, while my husband got the chicken wrap with gouda. All were excellent, but I think the chicken wrap with the best, very flavorful. I also ordered the fresh lemonade, it wasn't too sweet, and actually tasted like lemon unlike a lot of places. The sweet potatoes fries were also very tasty. I regret not saving room for dessert though, because their list of ice creams is pretty substantial. My husband ordered the ice cream sandwich, with rocky road. Why didn't I leave room?? The atmosphere was fun and vintage-y. I will gladly go back with my family when they come to town.

<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2014,5/8/2014,6,7,3,8,4>It was delicious. The place is really clean. Kids loved it and now they are saying it's their new favorite pizza restaurant. It's not your regular Pizza Hut/Domino's. Wished it was a little less expensive though. That's the only downside, the reason for 4 stars.
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2012,5/7/2014,0,7,4,7,4>Very good restaurant with delicious food. It is a bit pricey, but you can eat fairly cheaply if you pick the right thing on the menu. The sushi was much better than I expected, and everything else was delicious. The service was not the greatest, but I've had a lot worse. I recommend going for lunch as it is a good bit cheaper then and it is easier to get in and out.
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2014,5/6/2014,10,18,3,5,4>One of my favorite little spots in downtown Aiken. The staff is industrious and attentive, the atmosphere is fun, and the food is always good. The chicken chili and a cappuccino were the perfect warm ups on this cold and windy winter day. Give them a try when you're in South Carolina.
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2011,5/5/2014,7,14,3,8,5>OMG! Excellent food! Looks like a dive bar, but opens at 4pm, so go early and you won't feel out of place bringing the family. It's older, but clean. The crab legs are great. The fried mushrooms are yummy! The lemon pepper grilled shrimp has just the right spiciness.  Also, the hot wings are huge and on special Monday nights for just 39 cents each.My only complaint was the sweet tea is lemony which isn't my favorite :)
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/29/2010,5/4/2014,47,67,3,5,3>I love this little sanctuary in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Whiskey Road.  I go here often when I am stressed out to just relax or go for a walk.  I always bring visitors to town here so that they can experience the uniqueness and historical facts of this place.  It is truly a beautiful escape from the realities of the world.  Wear walking shoes or shoes that you don't mind getting a little dirty because of the gravel walkways (not a place to wear heels because I twisted my ankle once on the walkway).
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2010,5/3/2014,101,22,4,10,6>I'm pretty picky about pizza. I wasn't sure about Armando's the first time I ate there, but I was extremely surprised by the overall quality of the pizza, the taste, everything. The pizza is New York style ... has a really nice unique crust... It's absolutely delicious. They serve sandwiches and other Italian dishes, but honestly, I haven't gotten around to trying them yet because the pizza is just too delicious.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2013,5/2/2014,8,26,2,6,4>I can't recommend this clinic enough! Dr. Motzkus is proficient, calm, & wonderful with both of my cats. Their first visit went about as well as I expected it to - Jake tried to cower in a corner, and Emme did nothing but hiss (unmenacingly). Neither phased Dr. Motzkus a bit, and by the second time I brought them in, they were much better behaved - he's very attentive and genuinely cares about the well being of the pets that he sees.

<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2010,4/27/2014,4,4,5,15,7>Fantastic neighborhood bar done in the tradition of an authentic British public house.  Which makes sense as the owner moved from the UK and bought the bar in the 70's.  Dark inside, with a definite air of character.  Bartender's are quite laid back and super friendly.Proprietors always carry an interesting mix of around 12 different beers on tap, usually microbrews, and of course a wide selection of widget cans and bottles of offerings from the United Kingdom.Pub food is also a favorite here.  English sausage, scotch eggs (if you've never had one, you're missing out), the highly seasonal pork pie...and of course the ubiquitous shepherd's pie.  All very delicious.No smoking inside the pub per North Augusta regulations, but a mini-biergarten outside the front door works just fine.Internet connected juke box means you can hear whatever you'd like.  A pool table and dart boards (the local league plays here regularly).Thursdays are home to Butt Naked Trivia (don't worry, people are clothed...mostly) are filled with thinking man's questions on 80's flicks, obscure bands and politics.  Winner gets free beer.  Gets rowdy but everyone is friendly.   Talk to some of the regulars, they can be characters.All in all, highly recommended.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2014,4/26/2014,24,9,2,4,3>This place is pretty good if you want something other than boring pizza hut and such. Staff is friendly and service is good. Never needed a reservation but there can be a slight wait for a table at peak times.

<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2013,4/24/2014,10,30,3,5,3>Burgers are handmade and very juicy and delicious I think they should change their fries they are just plain jane out of Kroger. I really like the wing/strip basket, the strips are lightly battered to perfection and the wings are buffalo style and really good, service has always been great and I forgot to mention their breakfast which I think is one if the best in augusta.

<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2012,4/19/2014,25,23,2,5,3>My husband and I eat here weekly! We love to go on sat or sun mornings (be prepared to wait a bit). I always get the pork chop breakfast special with scrambled eggs and cheese, and the home fries with bacon and gravy. OMG so good! I dream about those potatoes sometimes. Hubby usually gets some kind of pancake or waffle thing, he loves them! The only reason we don't clean the plate is because often we get full before the food is gone. The staff is friendly but really busy, nonetheless they keep our coffee and water glass full. I love the SG and will keep our weekly visit on the calender.

<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2014,4/16/2014,13,8,2,5,3>Must say this is the best customer service experience I have ever had in a restaurant.  There was one minor blip in my takeout order and not only did the manager comp my to go order she also gave me a free dessert.  I was not having the best day until that point and that gesture has made me a devoted customer for as long as we live in Augusta.  Everything we have ordered off the menu has been exceptional too.  It's always fresh and all homemade with the right flavors.  I highly recommend ordering the gumbo or the shrimp po boy.  And leave room for dessert because they are just as delicious, especially the peanut butter pie!!!
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/1/2013,4/15/2014,0,2,2,5,3>My son and I ate here on  Tuesday before he returned to Seattle where he is currently living.  We had a hard time finding it because it is tucked in the back of the upper level of Surrey Center behind Talbots.  There was no writing on the front door to confirm we were in the right place.  We got there about 6:00 and there were few people there.  By the time we left though most of the tables in the dining room were in use by an older crowd, my age (60's) but considerably older than my son. We had drinks to start with...he had a cucumber collins and I had the cucumber rickey.  Both drinks were really tasty.  We shared a salad and scallops (small plate) as appetizers and then he ordered the salmon and I ordered the Alaskan halibut.  The hot food came out incredibly hot  (actually almost too hot to eat immediately) but it was really good.If you are not big eaters, I recommend two small plates for your meal..a salad and another dish like the scallops we ordered.I do plan to make a return visit.
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2014,4/14/2014,2,4,2,4,3>I love this place! I will continue to come back. I've only had like three things from here but I'm never disappointed. The pho is outstanding. I usually have to doctor mine up with sriracha and hoisin sauce but not here!! I've also had the bun Bo hue here as well. It too is tasty. My boyfriend loves the virmacelli noodle bowls. He says there isn't enough noodles in it though. He is a big eater. Do yourself a favor and try this place. Just remember they are closed Tuesdays.

<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2013,4/12/2014,3,10,2,5,3>We love this place on Saturday afternoon - sitting on the patio watching football and enjoying a roastbeef panini! My husband loves the blue cheese burger. The prices are high but the food is good, and good sized portions as well. Worth stopping in for a bite to eat and relax.

<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/27/2013,4/9/2014,15,30,3,5,4>We have recently moved to Aiken and was craving some good breakfast food today. Found really good reviews for Auten's and decided to give it a try. We are not disappointed at all. I ordered the the one egg plate with sausage. Everything was absolutely delicious. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the sausage not too greasy. The atmosphere of the restaurant was really laid back and relaxing. The servers were very friendly and so were the other patrons of the restaurant. We really enjoyed our breakfast and will be back again.
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2013,4/8/2014,6,9,2,5,4>what a GEM!!!... We moved to the aiken area a little over a year ago. We have been disappointed in restaurants over and over as we tried to find a "favorite niche";.  We have found it now. A private club, pfft... not to worry, pay the 15 bucks and be happy  about that choice!!.. We have tried their steaks , prime rib, burgers and not once have we left with anything but happy faces. accommodating staff, great bartenders. Casual and comfy not pretentious .  We have gone on Friday , saturday nights, and usually stop by after a round of golf on Sunday for a burger and not once have we been disappointed. We have now found "OUR" perfect place!
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2014,4/7/2014,13,3,2,5,4>Magnolia is my top pick for dining out in Aiken, hands down!  The food is creative clean eating and mostly organic so I know I'm going to get a good meal that is good for me when I go.Personal favorites are the burgers (grass-fed local beef), chocolate avocado mousse, and anything with cowboy bacon.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2013,4/6/2014,5,1,2,5,3>I love this place for the freshness of its food. The spice quotient is awesome especially given that I am from India! Their curries taste like they made the base right that minute, very fresh and their pad thai is fabulous! The soups are a great add on. I wasnt much into the satay or other appetizers. The decor of this place is surprisingly tasteful given that its in a strip mall. We come here every 2nd week almost! Lastly I like the Asian waiter, smart and effecient and when u tell him u want 4 plus spice, he knows what u mean!!
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2013,4/5/2014,3,17,1,5,2>At first glance you would think this concept could not work, but it worked wonderfully. This was our first time in this restaurant so the waitress took hr time to explain the menu and everything that we could order. It really helped us feel comfortable even though the menu is quite large. For an appetizer we had the Tempura Asparagus which was awesome! My husband had the Pork Tacos and I had the Crazy Roll and both tasted incredible. The service was the best we have experienced in Augusta and the taste of the food was just icing on the cake. We will be back!!
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2013,4/4/2014,31,4,2,4,4>The Crum Toast is awesome!!!! I have eaten here twice and both time the toast was great!  Thanks to my fiance I had an opportunity to eat fried portabella mushrooms adn those were also good.  This place makes my list of places to go while in CSRA!
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/11/2011,4/3/2014,23,234,2,4,4>I'm a sucker for the stand alone wine shop.  And they have a good selection.  Pricier than some places, but not too bad.  Oh, and other beverages as well... very nice.
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/25/2014,4/2/2014,17,4,3,6,4>Excellent costal atmosphere that serves as an escape from the rest of Augusta. I fell in love with this place as soon as I stepped through the door. Jerk chicken is phenomenal. I absolutely recommend giving this place a chance. Very friendly owner and staff.
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/28/2011,4/1/2014,5,26,2,5,3>I was disappointed after having lunch here today.  I went in with high expectations because of the glowing reviews on Yelp, and I was met with pizza that was just........average.  As a fellow Yelper mentioned, I found the crust a bit "crackery".  I like all kinds of pizza crust whether it be the doughy NY style, the firm and flavorful Chicago style, or the crunchiness of a good woodfire.  BUT, "crackery" isn't really a crust that I'm ever going to get behind.  Anyway, I ordered the lunch special, and the portions were generous.  The chili was pretty good.  The service was great.  The decor seemed like something from the 90's.  It looked dated, like something that would fit into "Reality Bites" or "Singles".  Overall, my experience was OK, but since there is a Mellow in town and I've heard good things about Pizza Joint,  I probably won't be making Yo Pizza a regular stop.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2011,3/31/2014,24,119,2,6,3>Ben L. review is right on.  This place is not your typical service was great, but food was ok.  In fact its exactly the opposite.  However where the service lacks it makes up for it in knowing your in direct communication with the kitchen.  The husband of the dynamic duo, is in fact a physician helping his wife achieve her dreams.  How great is that?  On to the food.I have eaten at every indian establishment in South Carolina and this one is right up there.  What set it appart from the mexican staffed kitchens of the several of the others i have been to, is the love that comes through your taste buds.  You can just tell with the subtleness of spice and such that this is not food prepared by a parrot in the kitchen that was showed how to make something.  This food, albeit Indian, screams homemade.  All I can say is you should bypass the places that have an indian owner up front greeting the customers, and enjoy a meal cooked by someone who was brought up cooking the fare offered.

<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2012,3/29/2014,23,45,2,12,3>I just got back from 18-months in Afghanistan and Iraq and, when I come home from places like that where the only food is normally lousy mess hall swill, one of the first orders of business is good food. So, for my birthday, Lynn, daughter Caitie and me went to dinner at a restaurant in downtown Augusta, Frog Hollow Tavern. I hadn't heard of it before, but ran across it when looking for locally grown food. This place epitomizes the local food movement and opened just before I left.Their goal is gourmet food that supports local growers at reasonable prices and they live up to that. Almost everything on the menu is local and everything is sustainable, nothing conventionally produced here, except maybe the alcohol at the bar and wine list. The entire experience was beyond any expectations I may have had. What a find. It is going to be hard to get me to go to any other restaurant for a while.The restaurant is located on Broad Street, the main downtown thoroughfare in Augusta, Georgia. Augusta has a lovely downtown that is really a gem that the suburbanites are afraid to go to. They prefer the franchise restaurants. Really a shame, but their loss. It is a nice setting and there are some outdoor tables that are great for nice weather and smokers. Inside, there are tables and booths and a bar on the left side. There is also another dining room that you don't know is there unless you go back to the bathroom. Obviously, we sat in a booth in the main room. Tables were both private and close together. It was a Thursday night and the place was busy, always a good sign.Service was amazingly good, our waiter was superb and the front of house manager was great. They had some really cool specialty cocktails. Now, we rarely get specialty cocktails, but decided to try them here. Lynn got an apple cider based cocktail that was unbelievable, especially with it being fall. I got a gin and ginger ale drink that was also excellent.The menu is divided into small and large plates, essentially appetizers and main courses. They also have desserts that they tell you about at the end of a meal. The menu selections were very eclectic and wide-ranging, but were decidedly Southern in inspiration. That was really nice to see. This is what I would call New American at its best. Here are the small plates we ordered: *Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Titan Farms Pickled Peaches, Local Blackberry Syrup Drizzle, Georgia Olive Oil *Wild Maine Mussels, White Wine, Saffron, Shallots, Garlic, Grilled Sourdough Bread *A Tomato Bisque that was a specialAll three were wonderful, the combination of flavors in the foie gras dish was simply heavenly. Foie gras on a crostini with a bit of the peaches, blackberry syrup, and olive oil was a bite of pure bliss. My Maine mussels were not local, of course, but they were so good and the fresh sourdough bread and white wine cooking liquid was perfect. This was also a huge appetizer, it could have been a main course. The tomato bisque was incredibly fresh tasting and excellent.Our main courses were: *Wild Caught Shrimp, Vidalias, Pork Lardons, House Made Andouille, & Local Tomatoes Over Organic Anson Mills Grits *Spice Crusted Maple Leaf Farms Duck Breast, NC Roasted Sweet Potatoes & SC Benne Seeds, Sautéed Local Greens, KY Bourbon Barrel Sorghum SyrupBoth Caitie and I got the duck and I must say, this is the best duck I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, just the right amount and consistency of fat and the sorghum syrup was an incredible accent to it. In addition to breast, there was duck leg. The weakest thing about any of the dishes we had were the greens and sweet potatoes that came with the duck. There were good, but neither were cooked enough for my taste. The shrimp and grits were extremely rich, creamy and very, very good. I especially liked the lardons and the shrimp were perfectly cooked.The wine list was not huge, but the wines were selected for excellence and reasonable price and they have succeeded. You don't have to spend a fortune on a bottle of wine. We had two bottles, an '09 Shiraz, Layer Cake, South Australia, and an '08 Sangiovese, Luna, Napa. Both were very nice. We had dessert, creme brulee and cheese cake, both good.There are a few great restaurants in Augusta and Frog Hollow Tavern is my new favorite.
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/20/2014,3/26/2014,29,9,5,10,5>I had a Satuday night off so a few friends and I decided to try this restaurant out. I had heard a few things about this place and they were all good. To add to that I read the Yelp reviews and they too were good. We arrived around 8pm and only had to wait 10 minutes which is awesome for a Saturday night. The hostess was bubbly and really sweet. We were seated and our server, Rachel, promptly came to our table. She was very nice and as attentive as she could be for a pretty busy Saturday night. We ordered drinks from the bar and they came quickly. I ordered the Sangria which was the special for the night. It was really good. I would order it again. Because I am currently not eating pastas or breads I thought it would be difficult to find something to eat but I was wrong. The menu had several items that I could choose from and I went with the Skirt Steak. It was so so so good. I ordered my steak medium and it came out perfect! The presentation was also nice. If I had to complain about something, it would be that the time between placing our food order and the time that we actually ate was a tad bit long. Our meal tasting so good kind of made up for it though! I would definitely come back but next time with a date...hopefully.
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2014,3/25/2014,44,127,3,7,4>Finally a buffet I LOVE.There is something for everyone here.  I am not a huge seafood fan...but I love sushi rolls and they have lots of different choices.  You can tell the sushi is fresh, and you can see the sushi chefs replacing old stuff and making new stuff.  The hot buffet is awesome...love the chicken katsu and burbon chicken.  Everything is fresh and hot.  They also have hiabchi...I haven't tried it yet but the selections are plentiful. The dessert is off the chain!Prices are decent.  I have only ever gone for dinner which is $17 per person.  But considering you have all the sushi you can eat...I think that's a reasonable price.  I've already gone twice!  Loved it each time.The wait staff is nice and attentive...I never had an empty glass or a dirty plate on my table for too long.
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2014,3/24/2014,2,19,3,8,5>I loved this place. As far as the seating, yes, it is a little crazy but that's to be expected at a bar/restaurant. We had scotch eggs the first go around and a pint of Guinness the first go around. The second time on St. Patricks day they had fish and chips and corned beef and cabbage for their entrees. I had the fish and chips. Both times we were there the food, service, and drinks were awesome. They actually know how to properly pour Guinness which is not very common. Anyways, I highly recommend this place. It's good to see places like this in Augusta!
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2014,3/23/2014,18,286,4,8,5>It doesn't get much cuter than Hammond's Ferry.  I love strolling around the neighborhood and Greene Ways but I'd never been to Brick Pond Market.  We stopped by with our dogs for a late lunch.  It was pretty busy and we had to wait to snag one of the cute outside tables.  I had a veggie burger and it was really delicious!  You could tell it's home made and not a frozen patty.  I'm always disappointed when fries don't come on the side of a burger, but the orzo salad was actually great.  I must say though that the portion was disappointingly small.  The burger itself was only 4 or 5 bites and the orzo salad was the size of an ice cream scoop.  I'm a small girl and I was still pretty peckish when I finished. I can't wait to stop here for lunch throughout summer.  I'm sure the lighter fare will be more satisfying on hot days when I'm less hungry.
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2014,3/22/2014,188,190,2,5,3>Service has improved 110% as is the freshness of the food.Coupons are in the weekly mail flyers with lunch,dinner,and group specials. When arriving on a Saturday nite, try to come early as people going out for the night will come with large groups,but service is still strong at this time also.The grill is the spotlight here as you pick your proteins and veggies the "Wok-Masters" will cook your plates for you and serve some of the most fantastic food around! Come for lunch or dinner you will not be dissapointed.
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/17/2013,3/21/2014,21,26,3,8,4>Very nice restaurant and excellent service at reasonable prices. Highly recommend as a date restaurant. We ordered the hummus, fried green tomatoes, bourbon salmon and braised pork. All dishes were well made, served quickly and looked appetizing. The only reason I'm marking this restaurant is I feel all of the dishes could have used more spices and flavor. They were kind of bland.
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,3/20/2014,50,66,2,9,3>The place is a little hole in the wall but don't let the looks turn you away.   The place has a huge smoker in the back and you can smell the deliciousness from outside.  Anything BBQ that you can think of they have from beef brisket to catfish.   The smoked chicken wings are some of the best wings I've ever had.  The smoked turkey sandwich was a little salty but not too salty.  Mac n cheese and collard greens were both on point.  Can't forget about the sweet potato fries.  They were freshly cut with cinnamon and sugar on top.  The prices range from 5.00 for basic sandwich to 22.00 for a full slab of ribs.  The ribs will be the next thing on the menu for me to try.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2014,3/9/2014,0,11,4,9,4>Simple steak perfection! I had the filet mignon, and Hubby the rib eye. Seasoned and cooked so that the tender steaks flavors were at their peaks. Wine only--but that is ok. Good personalized service. Yummy food with no pretense, and cozy atmosphere. Will return whenever I want a great steak...

I only go for hair cuts, but I am very tempted to try out the exfoliating MicroZone treatment!
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2013,3/7/2014,33,4,4,8,5>Our group booked a party this past Sunday.  The owner was very accommodating for our needs.  Most of our group hadn't eaten there before and all were very pleased.  We were very skeptical trying something new, but it was delicious and plenty.  I highly recommend the Sampler platter (Uruva Kebab), it was $19.99 but feed two of us easily with left overs.  The service was great, they put everyone's name on the ticket so easy to figure out who's food was who.  The inside is quaint and you can even sit on the floor, the outside nothing special.  I rarely would give 5 stars but the food and staff were well worth it.
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2013,3/6/2014,4,83,1,6,2>I've been twice. The first time i had the best Latte i have every had. It blows away Starbucks. Second time I had a chocolate latte, and It was awesome! I Can't make them that good at home. One of the few places you can get a good breakfast at on Sunday in Augusta.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2013,3/5/2014,12,137,3,6,4>Really like this place.  Great BBQ from an English mans perspective.  Had the BBQ sandwich with coleslaw.  Washed down with some un-sweet tea.Was great.  Would I go again definitely.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2014,3/4/2014,17,218,3,7,3>The fresh market is what I consider a specialty grocery store in that they carry a lot of higher end products but you could never afford (literally they are a bit steep on prices) to shop there on a regular basis. They have a great coffee selection and if you want some good candies/chocolate you can find it there. They use to have the best jalapeño  pimento cheese years back when they made it in house but now its obviously mass produced and not as good. Their bakery is good but overpriced for a lot of the items. The meats look excellent and they taste excellent as well but you will pay for it. They do have wine and beer. Not bad if you want to pick up something decent but really no better choice than what you will find in a larger grocery store such as Kroger. I take away a star mainly because I find they are high on items they really shouldn't be charging as much as they are and if they are busy their checkouts are hopelessly slow.
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,3/3/2014,15,19,3,6,4>I love this place for good family Italian food.  It is one of the few locally owned restaraunts left in the world.  It is not as large as the commercial places and the wait times are a testament of the great food and service.  Lunch and dinner is great.  Try the philly cheese steak for lunch and the chicken saltimboca for dinner.
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,2/27/2014,70,121,5,10,6>I had discovered this place as I was walking into Dunkin Donuts next door and was feeling really hungry and decided to stop here for lunch. I had ordered the hard shell tacos with steak and they were delicious! Your meal comes with a side of chips and the salsa bar was fully stocked.It wasn't busy for a Saturday afternoon so there was plenty of seating available.  There's also outdoor seating as well. I would recommend sitting in the booths because they have a cell phone charging station. Sweet!They almost remind me of a Chipotle as well. You tell them what ingredients you want and pay at the very end. They also offer a military discount so be sure to flash your ID card!
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/14/2014,2/26/2014,84,446,6,10,8>If you're coming from an area where you're used to a Trader Joes, this is your next best bet. While Joes is hard to beat, Earth Fare does their best.- Constantly running promotions- Supports military- Community events- Medium-high prices- Friendly staff- Quality products- Delicious Deli- Reward program (Tomato Bank)I haven't had a bad experience here yet. I take advantage of their rewards program and double down with the military discount. This helps lessen the blow when trying to live organic and be one with the earth.The most surprising part if Earth Fare is how reasonably price and delicious their deli is. Slap an email club deal on top of that and I can't stay away. The sandwiches are so generous, even a Buda wouldn't have enough self control.I think this place is great for the community and love the promotions. I have to say that their support for emergency workers, police and military is amazing. I wish more company's acted this way for those that sacrifice so much.I would recommend Earth Fare to anyone who would like to eat healthier organic products. The staff can point you in the right direction.
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2013,2/25/2014,8,54,4,10,6>I can't understand anyone who gave this place less than a 4 or 5.THIS IS AUGUSTA. Know what to expect. This is not TriBeCa or South Beach, you aren't going to find the most awesome anything in Augusta.Except for perhaps The Bee's Knees.  In a town of mediocre restaurants, only a few of them stand out and have me actually excited to go. This is one of them. It's great. The food is great. The decor is great. The location is perfect. The drinks are spot-on. They are creative and know how to mix a cocktail.The prices are very reasonable for what you are getting. They service is fantastic.Really, I don't know how The Bee's Knees could be a better restaurant.  It's amazing.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/24/2013,2/24/2014,17,3,3,8,5>Went in a group of 6 at around 8pm on a Saturday night and were seated fairly quickly.  Atmosphere surprised me somewhat, I was expecting a dive bar from the outside and surrounding establishments around Broad Street.  Good vibe overall, warm but dim lighting and decent music.  Reclaimed brick feel akin to other nearby southern cities (i.e. Vista in Columbia, SC and Historic District in Savannah). Waitress had a good sense of humor.I'm by no means a whiskey connoisseur but it had a larger-than-usual selection of whiskeys and an OK selection of beers (I had a Hoegaarden).  Took a little long to get us our drinks once we ordered though.  Food was new American / Asian fusion.   The waffle fries with bleu cheese were tasty.  I had the Cali burger minus cucumbers (love cucumbers but didn't think it would fit with the other tastes in the burger).  Side dish was sweet potato fries, and they were pretty flavorful and had a good consistency.  The burger itself was a little messy but overall flavor combination tasted pretty good.  I would order it again.  The burger came out with a knife in it which prompted questions by my friends as to whether I stabbed it or it came like that..  Didn't hear any other complaints by the others at my table except for one guy unimpressed with the wings he ordered.I would recommend it over other places nearby and I'll probably go back.
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/27/2013,2/23/2014,294,318,6,11,9>My mother saw a commercial for this business and wanted to check them out. Weeks had past before we actually decided to check them out. She thought the business was by the Sprint store and CosmoPro but it's acutally behind CVS in the back of the strip mall in National Hills. But we did find it with no problem.You can't miss it once you turn behind the CVS. It will be directly in front of you.  The boutique is small and filled with nice things. They sell clothing as well as undergarments for ladies, even handbags and accessories. Me and my mother wanted to go in and get fitted for a bra. I have been fitted before and wanted to see what size I currently was. We were greeted immediately and the saleswoman asked were we there for bra fittings and we said, "Yes!" She directed us right into the dressing room and gave us instructions to make the fitting go smoothly. She measured us perfectly and brought in options to try on. They were beautifully made and well fitting bras. The bras she did bring in started at about $50 a bra. That's kind of expensive but a bra is an investment and should fit properly. The fitting didn't take long at all. The saleswoman was very knowledgable and knew exactly what she was talking about. Experts say that 80% of women wear the wrong size bra. The process was painless and I think ever woman should at least have one bra fitting in their life. It will make a difference in how your clothes look and feel. The bra I purchased actually makes me look slimmer and I feel a whole lot better about the way my clothes look on me. This was a great experience and I will continue to shop here.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/30/2013,2/22/2014,11,11,2,6,3>--Great experience. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, the atmosphere was friendly and quaint. As soon as we ordered and got our drinks and utensils situated the food was brought out almost immediately after we chose a seat. The food was SO good. Well seasoned and prepared on the spot. The seating is definitely limited though so I would suggest going on a weekday to get a seat. Overall, I am going back ASAP. Try it.
<review# 246,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,2/21/2014,4,38,4,8,4>Oh man, it was good stuff. If you love coffee, or espresso, this is the place for you. My husband got one of those fancy schmancy lattes in the small cups with the cream on top, and I got to try his affogato, which is a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso on top. Also tried their Southern Sunset - one shot of espresso mixed with cream, and a cinnamon latte (very good). We also tried their cookies (with chocolate and toffee), and their almond marzipan (which was more of a blondie brownie - but still so very delicious). Oh man, I shouldn't have had that much coffee. It's all good though, it was fantastic. Our friend had a large espresso-packed drink, and an affogato, and one of their hot onion quiches, which he liked very much. Bravo to the people running this place. There's just enough variety to satisfy any true coffee snob's desires, but not so much that making a decision is difficult or overwhelming - which makes it easier on them as well~. Just lovely. I only wish I lived closer. That marzipan square and that cinnamon latte would be my breakfast for ages~!
<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2014,2/20/2014,57,150,3,9,5>Wanted to add a few things:1. Get a smoothie2. Try the House Special Vermicelli.... (I think that's what it's called) if you're a fan of pork.3. The beef stew.The beef stew with bread.... what a great bang for my buck. The bowl was massive, and it's not like they were stingy on the meat either. Huge chunks of tender beef, coupled with a baguette was definitely the winning combo.
