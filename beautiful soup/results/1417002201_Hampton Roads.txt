<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,11/26/2014,22,196,,3,2>In my mind there are 3 types of sushi restaurants1) the scary, sorta dirty place where the rice is hard and the fish is rubbery, 2) the flashy kind where the rolls have names like "Super Kung Fu Panda Roll" and everything has tons of spicy mayo and decorative drizzles of sauces in the shape of hearts, and3) the kind of place where the fish on its own is so fresh, buttery soft, and flavorful that you don't even need soy sauce for dipping.Sakura is a prime example of the 3rd category.  You will not find a crazy Kung Fu Panda roll here, but you will find some amazing classics, such as a king crab roll, yellowtail roll, spicy tuna roll, salmon roll, and rainbow roll.  All of the ingredients are fresh and tasty: The rice is so soft and holds its shape while you're picking the sushi up. The fish is DELICIOUS.  The accompaniments inside the roll, like avocado and asparagus, are so green and fresh.  Yes, the rolls are plain, but I wouldn't change one thing about them because excellent fish speaks for itself.Service was fast and polite.  The place was a little on the quiet side.....needed some music :-). The decor isn't over whelming just  simple.  And the choice to eat here is simple too!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2014,11/25/2014,4,65,3,7,6>The only place in Hampton Roads I have ever found where the food is comparable (or better) than my favorite tex-mex places in Austin,TX!  Many ghent peeps have told me this is their favorite place to eat in their neighborhood, and I think it is great.We came in here a couple weeks ago on a Saturday night with party of 5, and were expecting a decent wait time, much to our surprise we were seated very quickly...I was the only person who even had time to order a drink from the bar, which was a classic mojito (i dont do all that flavored nonsense). Very good, very strong,,,if this place were in VB I would have had another, but since I was making the long trek I switched to beer. Some people who were not making the long trek, did double (or triple) up on their margaritas and jalapeno infused vodka things, and yes they were having a really great time at the point we got the check!  Is it loud in here? I didn't notice and you know what that probably means.We had absolutely no problem with the service, in fact I would say our waitress was incredibly patient as some in our party were having that whole "should I order another margarita, should i not order another margarita?" internal debate, but they were expressing this aloud over several minutes every time our server came to the table. Thank you, patient waitress. Guacamole awesome! My cousin ordered all of us the queso fundido with chicken chorizo, and it was also awesome, and not something I would have tried on my own...between that and the heavenly guac, we certainly had enough to keep us busy!!I had the Enchildas Verde with chicken, usually I will go for the shrimp but (and this is one of my only complaints) the shrimp enchiladas were $6.00 more than the chicken enchiladas....that seems a little excessive. I mean, it is not like an entire meal of shrimp vs. an entire meal of chicken, it is basically the amount of meat to fill two enchiladas which I would really doubt would justify the six dollar upcharge.  But love that they offer more side varieties than just rice and beans..although the rice was great too. Spinach, jalapeno cornbread, homemade queso etc. I would want to try so much more on the menu!!! Will def be back hereObviously it is more costly than the whole Plaza azteca/Guads/Taco Loco scene that is going on in VB, but I feel like it is a different caliber of restaurant and they really should not be compared. Very good!! Another plus~  the front door is a good work-out for your upper arms. It seems to weigh around 600 lbs.
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2014,11/24/2014,88,178,2,6,5>I have been on two cruises with Spirit of Norfolk. Based on my first one I would give it two and a half stars. The last cruise I went on definitely bumped it up!The first time I went was for a work event. It was a Christmas Party held during lunch time. It was a nice time. Nothing extremely memorable though. It was nice going up to the top and seeing the sights, however it isn't a particularly beautiful view. The food was bland. We all had a pleasant time, but we decided that we wouldn't be going out of our way to come back again. I just tried one of their midnight cruises and that was a blast! The one we did was  "Drag The Night Away with the Sea Queens Moonlight Series" it was a perfect ladies night! The food was simple, but it was much better than what I expected for midnight. The entertainment was fantastic! We had excellent service from our server, but I made a point to go to the bar for the bartender, Dennis. He was so nice! Our drinks came out perfect every single time and he was so friendly! He definitely helped make our night memorable. The positive experience I had with the midnight cruise makes me want to give a lunch or dinner cruise another shot. They have a list of events that look like they could be fun.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/15/2014,11/23/2014,74,230,4,6,5>My son's class recently had some of this pizza for their end of school year class party and everyone who tried it raved about it.  So, we were out running around on a recent Saturday and figured we'd stop in for some lunch to give it a try.  The place itself isn't huge but there are probably a dozen tables at which to sit.  We were seated and greeted right away.  We ordered some mozzarella fries with bacon and a 16" pizza.  The cheese fries were really great.  They were crinkle fries, which are my wife's favorites, and had plenty of cheese and bacon.  Quite good.  The pizza was outstanding.  It really was.  Probably as good a pie as I've had in quite some time.  The crust was light and thin with just the right amount of cheese, sauce and pepperoni.  The crust was crispy and perfect.  It's what I would consider to be classic New York style pizza and we all loved it.In reading Jennifer N.'s review, it seems the crust and quality of the pizza may depend on who makes it but on this day, we had the couple to whom she referred in her review and were pleased with the quality of the meal.  If the pizza is consistently that good, I would highly recommend you check it out.  It's worth the trip.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,11/22/2014,107,136,5,7,5>Satisfying breakfast! Lived in the area for 40 years and this was only my 2nd time here. With the reviews and word of mouth, I had to see what I was missing. Parking in the garage behind restaurant for up to 2 hours or metered parking, $2/hr up to 3 hours. Arrived at 12:40PM on a Sat. They close at 1PM..20min wait went pretty fast. Shannon, our waitress was on-point and patient.A lot of menu selections. Daughter ordered banana and pecan Belgian waffle. I ordered crab omelette w/ pancakes.Portions were huge. Everything was delicious. Happy we had leftovers to bring home! :) Bathrooms were small. Only two stalls. No TP. Wish place was bigger.. We were crammed like sardines but, ohhhh so worth it. ;) Definitely coming back...Off season!
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,11/21/2014,334,138,12,20,17>First of all the excellent customer service makes you feel so comfortable.  And the patience to tell you about all their delicious food.  Also a thing to know is that if they charge you wrong for an item you didn't purchase they discount your bill by up to half off. Also if the food takes to long to come out it's free and all you pay us your drinks. Besides the restaurant is the store which sells many different things from sweet bread, boots, sombreros, belts, soccer cleats, fresh vegetables, fresh cut meat by their own butcher, groceries, beer, sodas, and fresh natural drinks !!!With many delicious and authentic dishes to choose from your appetite will be satisfied but it's a long list so you'll definetly be back !!! Disfruta y provecho !!!
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/29/2014,11/20/2014,34,79,2,3,3>Oh yes. This right here is my spot for Mexican if I'm close to Hampton Blvd. It's in a building that used to be Pizza Hut, directly across from Navy Federal. They serve a mean lunch special and STAY busy. You'll see lots of Military, DoD and Longshoremen packed up in here for lunch. It's sparsely decorated, but I ain't there for the scenery. Well not that kind of scenery *wink* It's clean and the service is good and fast. I mean FAST!! I get the hard tacos with shredded beef, taco salad with beef tips ###you must get the beef tips in your taco salad, comprende?!### chimichangas, and fajitas. They also have a delicious burrito, similar to the San Jose burrito, for those who are familiar with it, but it's not called the San Jose. It has chicken and pork in it, with bubbling hot white cheese sauce running down the middle..... yummy!  Love this place. I'm a regular here. And the sweet tea tastes like a Southern Grandmother made it! Sweet and fresh, just like I like it!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2014,11/19/2014,152,116,6,6,4>I've been here twice so far and I must say, the food has excelled beyond expectation both times. The sausages I ordered the first visit were definitely a safe choice. They were so succulent and as good as you'd hope from a German restaurant, I wound up ordering some to go.On my second visit, I ordered the goulash. It's one of those things that I've only heard of (and don't know where from) but just had to try. Beef cubes sitting atop egg noodles? You really can't go wrong if you like that sort of thing. It was also a wonderful introduction into that uniquely European egg noodle that I had never even heard of before. The spätzle, as it is so called, reminded me of pan-fried udon noodles. So even though the dish was of an Eastern European style, my Eastern Asian palette found it to be quite familiar in both flavor and texture. I can see how this might fall into the category of acquired tastes, but overall the goulash was a very simple and tasty dish that did not fail to satisfy my appetite.My second visit was with a much larger group. I reserved a table for 10, but over the course of the evening, the number slowly and ultimately grew to 15. Thankfully, they had saved an entire section of the restaurant just for us, so we managed to squeeze the latecomers into the party by moving and adding a table. I can't thank the restaurant staff enough for being flexible and so accommodating with us, because I realize it's challenging enough to have to process separate checks for large groups such as was ours. High praise goes to their customer-oriented service.With a beer menu that's larger than the food menu, this is arguably the best place in the historic Downtown Portsmouth to bring a group of beer-connoisseurs (a.k.a. college students) or maybe just a bunch of drunkards (a.k.a. sailors). Most of the beer menu looked to be about German, but I did manage to find Murphy's Irish Stout, which I may have just discovered to be more refreshing and slightly more delicious Guinness (although I'm not prepared to dethrone my favorite beer just yet).
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2014,11/18/2014,34,46,1,7,5>Ever have a craving for a smoothie, but hate that it has a million calories. Then check out The Healthy Connection in Sentara. Their smoothies and juices are all natural, and their protein is made with tofu. And trust me, for someone who's never had tofu, I was a little nervous, but my Peachy Cream smoothie was amazing. If I hadn't read it had tofu/protein in it, I would have never known.  It's a great alternative to a vending machine snack (if you're visiting or staying here at the hospital). Plus Jeff is super friendly and knowledgeable. I'm positive you won't be disappointed in your smoothie experience!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/18/2014,11/17/2014,54,75,3,5,3>This place when I first went looked like a hole in the wall, but boy was I surprised.  Time after time I've gone and the food is freshly prepared, quick, and the service is so friendly!I usually order the noodle combo that comes with a drink, eggroll, and soup for $9.  The food comes with side condiments like limes, jalapeños, onions, chopped green onions, and cilantro to sprinkle on top with a variety of sauces.I asked the owner and he said they will be moving outside [where to idk] once the mall clears out the top side of the floor.  But I'll surely miss it, but also know you can order ramen too as well.  Definitely a repeat customer!
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2014,11/16/2014,26,77,1,5,4>You just can't get any fresher than this in an east coast eatery unless you're nibbling straight from the garden. Fruitive in it's organic bliss, has the most knowledgeable veg lovers representing them who excel at their craft. To some fruits and veggies can be somewhat of a bland chore/necessity but fruitive makes them dance on your taste buds. You will not only leave this eclectic venue sated but feeling like your consumption was productive in such a healthy way! I love the protein power salad and the green acai bowl... The Pineapple Express juice is also delish. I'm a fan of the vibe inside their shop with handcrafted tables and recycled materials in their build from historic events. This isn't an experience, it's a lifestyle, add years to your life and come aboard :) I'm working on becoming a regular and when saving those dollars I appreciate fruitive giving me inspiration for healthy meals/juice in my kitchen
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2014,11/15/2014,13,40,2,7,5>Let me just start off by saying that I bookmarked this place here on yelp for a visit long before I ever walked through the doors. I wanted to go and try the local, organic Mexican food but I just didn't want to make the trek from VB.My husband and I were in Suffolk and a colleague of his mentioned it, so being the connoisseurs of Mexican food that we are (even our three year old orders her own food!) we decided to stop in on our way home. It was a little out of the way, but soooooo worth it! At home we eat everything freshly prepared: food made from whole ingredients, not packages. We have been eating out less and less because the food just doesn't taste as good as what we can make at home. This place might just change that! Everything looked and tasted like it was just prepared, and was indeed delicious. I was impressed by the reviews I read but didn't really know what to think by the location. This place is just proof that you can't judge a book by its cover. The walls have signage letting you know the origin of the food, and anything that isn't listed on the walls is on the paper menu. The service was stellar, the staff are friendly and happy. That alone make all the difference. The restaurant was very clean and had good ambiance. Anyone who has read my other reviews can likely attest that I tend to be harsh and critical... I take my food very seriously, because hey... It is what keeps us alive [or in many cases, kills us]! I feel completely okay with eating here regularly and feeding the food to my family as well. Being the food nazi that I am, I tend to get guilt over allowing my kid to eat junk. Here it is a win-win... Healthy AND delicious.Okay, okay... /end rant. ;)Post Scriptum edit: to the few people complaining about portion sizes for price: sometimes you have to pay a little extra for quality. Let's not forget that the food is freshly prepared, organic, and almost all local. Also, even the portions served are greater than "recommended" portion sizes. There is nothing to complain about but some people just choose to look for things wrong with everything. If you want free sides, go to a franchise and get canned food.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,11/14/2014,38,130,2,4,3>THIS PLACE AWESOME!  Fresh and hot cheese steaks with lots of meat! This place specialize in cheese steaks and they have all the sides! They made my sandwich to order, it was piping hot and the service was great! You must try this place. They have two locations in Newport News!
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2014,11/13/2014,50,51,2,6,2>This is a great spot for locals and tourists alike.  It is a small little restaurant located right on Rudee Inlet, and is easily walkable from the end of the boardwalk.For an appetizer, we had a 1/2 lb of steamed strip (on happy hour for $9.99) and calamari.  The shrimp were surprisingly jumbo sized, which was great, and were perfectly steamed of course.  The serving of calamari was ample, the sauces that went with both were really good, and there was more than enough to go around (4 adults, 3 kids).My wife (and her aunt) had the crab cake sandwich, which she loved.  I had the California fish tacos, which I liked, but since I've been to San Diego a bunch, I'm a bit spoiled with fish tacos and have really high expectations for something labeled 'California Fish Tacos'.  They didn't quite meat those expectations, but they weren't a total letdown, either.The service here is great.  The waiting area can get a bit cramped, and the waits can be long at prime time because people love this place, so just grab a drink from the bar and hang out outside until your name is called. This is one of the better seafood joints in VA Beach, so be ready to wait or go earlier or later to get in and out easily.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,11/12/2014,63,152,2,5,4>Can I say WOOOOHOOOO??? I came here today because it was my big man's 12th bday. I had no idea what to do & his response when asked was "I dunno" (typical). A friend suggest that I bring him here and only described it as a bouncy house place but for older people. I checked their website and was a bit miffed when I saw that I would have to be on the trampoline with my little one because he was under 7. I had zero plans to do much this day other then be the kid taxi. As soon as I walked through the door, I changed my tune. The room is basically one H U G E trampoline. They had things hanging from the ceiling that you could touch if you were skilled enough to jump that high (I wasn't). They had an area where you could play dodge ball while you were bouncing and they had an area where you could jump off the ledge, do a flip, and then fall into the foam pit. This is the place people go to when they want to practice all those cool trick style flips and not get hurt. There was even talk of a future ninja course ala Ninja Warrior style. I will be back for that one. There is an area to electronically sign your safety waivers, a place to store your shoes and even a place to just watch and not bounce (thumbs up for not having to pay if you want to do this option). I got so into bouncing around during our 1 hour time limit, that I almost forgot I was supposed to be watching my youngest son. I will definitely be back as soon as possible to bounce around again. Next time I will be sure to wear comfortable clothes because jeans don't really let you move. Maybe boss man X will get an event at this place in the future?
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,11/11/2014,38,55,1,7,2>I came into this particular restaurant with no prior knowledge or recommendation what so ever. I was just going off of... "it's close by and it's still there, let's see what it's about."I've been to a Mongolian BBQ place before and enjoyed the stir fried goodness, so I figured it would be decent. The food here is really good and very cheap. I've only gone during dinner hours which averages about $10 a person and I've read from other Yelpers that lunch prices are even cheaper.For dinner you're given bread, rice, and a choice of egg drop or hot & sour soup. Then you can grab a bowl of noodles, add your choice of veggies, proteins, sauces, oils, and spices, then watch them stir it up to that goodness. I don't know the tradition for this style of food but really all you have are lo mein like meals but not much else. I'm not complaining though because it fills you up and tastes great. And you can go up for more. They also have desserts available if you have room for that.There's never a lot of visitors whenever I come so that could be a plus for you. Hopefully that doesn't mean they're struggling financially because the staff and owners are very kind. I plan to see how much different lunch hours are like here soon.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2014,11/10/2014,56,35,4,4,3>I absolutely love this place.  Everything on the menu is fantastic.  The ambiance is wonderful.  On Tuesday nights they have trivia, which is pretty fun.I would come in here dressed for McDonalds, though.  The attire seems a bit uppity.Another reason this place is so great is their vegetarian selection.  My wife had so many options to choose from.  On of my favorites is the beer battered asparagus.  And oh boy, if you get some bier cheese dip to go along with that, it will be a wrap for you my friend!Be prepared when you leave here for a food induced coma!  I can't get enough of this place.  The pricing isn't too terrible eitherThe beer selection and is phenomenal.  They have numerous IPAs (which I love), and a lot of them are from local breweries.I would definitely recommend this place for a weekday date or even a gathering of friends.  You can't go wrong with anything here!
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2014,11/9/2014,51,77,5,3,3>TKO! I have a sensory overload from the barbecue in this joint! It's so much to take in that they should have a complimentary nap room hidden in the back. I feel like I need to attach a strap on the back of the chair across my forehead so my face doesn't fall into the plate from the overwhelming sweet aroma of perfection. Amazing.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2014,11/8/2014,29,248,1,3,5>I don't like fried chicken. But since this place was rolling in fabulous reviews , coupled with the fact that i'm leaving HR area in 2 weeks forever, I had to try it. It was a 45 min wait and it was definitely worth it. I got the soy garlic and im not going to lie, it did not look appetizing. It kinda looked DOA when i opened it up at home ( i got it to-go). But with my first bite, i realized why people like it so much.The pieces of chicken are really big . The fat on top is crispy an the entire chicken tastes like it was marinated in soy garlic. I don't like fried chicken usually ( and im going to live under the assumption that most fried chicken isn't this yummy) I was sad not to get the side of radish that i saw in the pictures ( maybe it doesnt come with a to-go order?). My only regret is not eating it there. The condensation from the styrofoam box definitely got to my chicken and crinkle fries.. but no worries. theres always a next time!
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/13/2014,11/7/2014,39,76,3,7,5>Walk in the park....I believe Red Wing Park is another one of VB's hidden gems. There is a lot to do  here and will not disappoint. Pack the car and the dogs and head out!I love that they have a dog park here that is close enough to my house. Cali my Bassett hound loves the interaction from both people and dogs alike. She's kinda a big deal here. JK. There are "poop" bags and water provided for the dogs. Covered benches for those sunny/hot days. Rabies shots and a city license is a must to enter but that is for everyone's safety. And for heavens sake if your dog is an asshole don't bring them here! We don't want no drama.There are a ton of walking trails lined with beautiful flowers and shrubbery. This is a second option if you can't get into dog park. There are two children's playgrounds, a tennis court, restrooms and covered picnic areas with grills. Okay it's story time: one day I was walking the pup on one of the back trials and let him off the leash. He was ended up rolling in human feces ( I am assuming  it was one of the homeless people that frequent the park) This was completely my fault but none the less disgusting. LESSON LEARNED.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/7/2014,11/6/2014,298,491,7,10,10>Virginia Beach Parks strikes again! If anyone ever ask why I like to reside at the beach I will say schools first, recreation including parks, beach and pools second.The city of Virginia Beach does a wonderful job of investment in their natural resources and many places in the country cannot say the same. Take Lake Smith/Lake Lawson Natural area as an example. Nothing had to be done here, but the city decided to invest major moola to make meaningful improvements and expand. Lake Smith/Lake Lawson Natural Area has been closed for almost a year so they could unveil this masterpiece today. So what can you do? Fish, boat, canoe, kayak, picnic trail walk, bike ride and take in some incredible views... oh that's all!For most of those reading this that have no idea, or may have driven past this area a million times and not paid attention let me help you with location. The public access is off of North Hampton not far from the Norfolk/Virginia Beach line. The water way is owned by Norfolk, so their was cross over involvement in the project I assume. Lake Smith is the water way that you see off the road. Lake Lawson is farther back and access is on trail,  tiny cut thru for small boats, or the new steel bridge.Let's walk through the improvements and additions to this beautiful area. First improved parking, it's bigger and it's now paved. Plenty of room for trailer parking. The two lane boat ramp now has a concrete pad. The old dirt launch is closed off. A larger shelter with more picnic tables. A fishing deck with plenty of bench seating. This is visible from the road. Also visible from the road is the new canoe/kayak launch on a floating barge. There are other fishing decks located around the grounds. New is a playground that required a lot of major clearing of timber to install several hundred feet from the entrance on Shell Rd. Restrooms are still to come, but not installed to date.What makes me giddy are the improvement and extension of trails. Case in point the main trail that now crosses between Lake Smith and Lake Lawson. This use to be a pretty narrow path and now is a major walk way. A steel cross walk on both sides of the lake with small barge platforms was installed to pull a canoe, or kayak over. But I am saving the best for last. The huge improvement is the wood bridge installation that crosses the 5 foot wide, 4 foot deep span that separates the two lakes. Prior to this there was no access across unless you waded in the water. Small boats could get through and still can to this day underneath the structure. At one time this was not the case when a large circular tile was in this divide. I walked the entire trail network this morning and estimate it to be at least four, possibly five miles. Impressive were the amount of trash cans along the paths... Hint, hint...pick up your trash! I was stunned at what I could now see on the Lake Lawson side. A green of Cypress Point Country Club can be easily be viewed too. I was also amazed how close you get on foot to Diamond Springs Rd. The new Sajoy Farms development is visible on the path at the boundary of the park. If I can get on my soap box for a second. This new development is sad and I feel unneeded. Simon Houses Co. mowed down hundreds of acres of old growth trees to build Sajoy Farms Community.  It is difficult to view, but you can also see the very old brick mansion, one of the largest homes in the area. I could not find out any more about this home today, but want to.It is well worth checking out Lake Smith/Lake Lawson Natural Area. When the leaves change soon it will be spectacular.  Our Virginia Beach tax dollars paid for it and I think you will agree it's a special place to enjoy some clean fresh air and let your troubles be gone.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2014,11/5/2014,27,66,3,3,3>I've been here several times and each time it was amazing! Everything I've had has been perfectly seasoned and tasty. They've expanded the size of the dining area which allows larger parties to dine in. Their drink menu includes the best Mojitos in town! The employees are very friendly and helpful when I bring new people. My recommendation would have to be their fried pork with yellow rice and their chicken mofongo. Do you like bachata and salsa? Every Friday night they have a DJ for Latin night. If you haven't given this place a shot I promise you won't be disappointed.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2014,11/4/2014,19,16,6,15,5>Keep with my lengthy review- I have a point. I promise. I have had such a hard time in Hampton Roads trying to find a good salon after my awesome sauce hairstylist decided to take her craft elsewhere. Alas, I am super happy for her. I don't know if this is the drill for everyone, but whenever I go to a new salon I am placed with their new girl- which I get- because I'm the new client and they need to build up their clientele; however I always leave less than satisfied. I rather just bite the bullet with an ok cut and color, than revisit the same inexperienced chick 3 more times to have it corrected. I know stylists have a very difficult job, and with 15 salons in each shopping center, it's hard to compete, but if you can't do something, say so and give me to someone in the salon who can. The last salon I went to (I will not name drop because I believe it was a rookie mistake and I'm sure someone has had to have called her out by now) burned me by charging me $290 to retouch my partial highlights. And it wasn't the price of the highlights that jacked my total up- it was all the treatments she voluntarily put in my hair without my understanding that I was being charged for each one. I know with blonde comes toner, which is typically included in the price for highlights, but this was like every treatment and conditioner on their menu. I couldn't curl my hair for like a month. annoying. Annnnd now I review: So I scheduled my appt over the phone. Very nice receptionist who patiently worked with my extremely tight schedule. She told me the name of my stylist (whom I immediately stalked online to see if she ruled) and confirmed my date and time. When I got there, I was kindly greeted by the above referenced receptionist and introduced to my stylist, who was not who I was told on the phone- I'm thinking: oh noooo the rookie!! I wasn't prepared! but, as I was seated, I saw my original stylist. since I'm creepy and already knew what she looked like, I asked her why she wasn't doing my hair today. she said (sit down for this) SHE WAS UNFAMILIAR WITH THE STYLE AND WAS GOING TO WATCH AND LEARN HOW TO DO IT. oh my goodness... I think I heard angels singing, the choir, beyonce.... A miracle. A stylist who handed me off to someone with more experience. Glory. and props to her!! (side note: I saw her work with another client and she did a great job on their cut and color) I had Krystal. She was very nice and attentive to my requests. I showed her pictures and she totally knew what I wanted. and get this... you may want to sit back down... she told me the price for the color and cut upfront. tears of joy. And it was what I paid at the end! no funny business, sneak attack bank account sweep. Wow. I was already floored with my experience and she hadn't even touched my hair yet. Style, cut, color, everything came out perfectly. I also love their line of organic and anti-cruelty products. I will be back to purchase some once I'm out of my current supply. I was so happy with the turn out, I couldn't have booked my next appt any faster. I am practically counting down the days. bonus features! you can book online, their products smell so so so so so good, and the salon itself is absolutely gorgeous. also- unlimited sweet tea refills! I do love the south. They should definitely start serving wine though. that is a sure fire way to have everyone come back for their trim within 4-6 weeks.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/4/2014,11/3/2014,95,125,2,5,6>This tiny gem of Town Center is probably one of the finest Gelato in Virginia Beach. Every time I come here, it's always take me back to my recent travel in Florence, Italy. Sensational taste in terms of flavor and texture. It's creamy,  soft and delectable.  My favourite flavor are pistachio and amaretto biscotto. Seasonal flavor is also available. Currently, its Mexican  Hot Chocolate, Gingerbread and Pumpkin Spice.Would love to come back here to try their crepes.Overall,  thought the staff are knowledgeable and polite. Awesome customer service.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2014,11/2/2014,221,97,1,4,3>I enjoyed the food.  I like the concept of a local farm to table Asian American fusion with a rice bowl meets chipotle, Moe's, subway pile on your fav toppings component.  Their sauces seem amazing with choices of different curries and others.  I chose the sampler plate which offered chicken, pork, and beef and the coconut ginger sauce on the side. My fav topping was the onion marmalade.  Holy cow I could bath in that it was so delicious I also enjoyed a juicer smoothie.  They offer two juice selections ea day. These are preselected for you so you like the concoction or not. They only had one choice left as the other was sold out.  It was fresh and tasty. Too much ginger for my liking.  But I d get the next selection. For 3.50 and nothing added I'm a fan.  Try this gem.  It's worth it. And low cost. My bowel was filling and 6.99.  :)
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,11/1/2014,56,193,4,4,5>Loved it!! The decor is awesome and the restaurant is super clean, the selection of Craft Beers Local and from afar on tap and canned/bottled is great!! A must try is the Pretzel with cheese dip with one of those lovely craft beers helping the cheese dip flavor. Our server Haley was very nice and did a great job with special requests which has been an issue of late at other places. My burger was amazing tasty bacon  and a large pile of onion straws and the wifes chicken salad wrap was just what she wanted. The owner was present in the dining room a super plus and she was very engaging, we can see this becoming a regular spot for us on the way to pungo for fruits and veggies. Another plus is they do use Local produce when possible and I love it when Local restaurants keep it Local!!
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2014,10/31/2014,66,117,1,6,2>I started this review 5 months ago, so this info might be a little old...Friday night special: all you can eat trout. Fried, with fries, slaw and hush puppies. Sounded like a good idea for $10. And it was. It sounded like a challenge to me. All you can eat trout? How hard could that be? It's a trout. Fish.  Fish can't fill you up too much...It does.  At least from here, it does.I gave it my all; my aim was to get down at least three fillets.  I didn't realize that the fish that they cut these fillets from were monstrously huge.  It was like eating the side of a small shark.  A perfectly fried and seasoned side of a small shark.  The fries that accompanied it were also perfectly cooked and the slaw gave a good cool bite to round out the plate.  I managed to clear one and a half fillets before I gave up.  Full and happy.I liked this place a lot.  Decent beer prices to boot.  Check it out on the way to the beach.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2014,10/30/2014,21,240,1,5,4>I found a great local pizza place!  The pizza is really good, a nice light, thin crust with just the right amount of chew.  The pizza sauce is mild (not over seasoned with garlic and oregano) with the sweetness of the tomatoes coming through and really yummy cheeses.  We got a half Hawaiian and half deluxe, it was very good, great flavors and no grease and the mozzarella sticks were also very good, light crispy breading and again no grease.   The staff was very friendly and provided wonderful service.  This is mostly a take out place with a full menu with pasta, sandwiches and salads, they also deliver.  They also sell by the slice.  The Pizzeria is well worth giving it a try
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/4/2014,10/29/2014,62,168,3,6,5>I've eaten me a lot of hush puppies and onion rings in my time, but I tell you Wicker's has got them figured out.  Arguably some of the best I've ever had.  We actually went because a friend said it was the best She Crab Soup, but of course, it failed to live up to *that* claim.  That's not to say it wasn't good, just I've had some that has been more to my taste.  It's worth a cup though.  What I love about Wicker's is when you arrive you see all the crab cages in the back and people out there diligently cleaning them from the days catch.  Ambiance inside was, well, homey, since, it was a home.  But seriously, they had on Nick Toons on the TV which was seriously a little strange!  That being said, I did chuckle a few times at the gigantic purple creature thing that was on the TV.  For my meal I went with the boat, hush puppies, onion rings and scallops.  To be 100% honest, I was a little disapointed by the scallops, hence the 4 stars, but the other items lived up to and exceeded my expectations.  Staff was perky, attentive and bright, always a plus on a lunch break from work.  Overall, Wicker's is good, I'm certainly a fan and would go back.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2014,10/28/2014,84,121,5,6,3>This place is quite a bit more than just a sauce shop, though they do have way more sauces than I have time to look at.Great selection of local stuff, sauces, rubs and other condiments with few ingredients (gotta love the all-natural stuff!), plenty of spices and international ingredients. It was a bit overwhelming, but fun experience.Proved to be the perfect spot to make a gift basket for a bbq-ing friend and I will definitely return to shop for myself.  The only downside, and I hate to say it, was the saleswoman. I am not a fan of going into a retail location and feeling hounded. I appreciate the love of what you sell, but my gosh.. leave me alone!
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2014,10/27/2014,28,76,3,5,3>very unassuming little place and like others have noted, you might miss it if you're not really super focused on finding it. It is in a food co-op. The macarons are displayed in a large case with several small little serving dishes containing different varieties. When I went, the available flavors were cookies and cream, Nutella, jasmine tea, key lime, vanilla birthday cake, salted caramel, chocolate birthday cake, banana pudding, and a pumpkin spiced one. I ordered a dozen choosing Nutella, salted caramel, vanilla birthday cake, cookies and cream, and a single jasmine tea. The macarons were exceptional, texturally moist but with a crunch crispness like a macaron should be. The jasmine tea one did not give off the flavors of tea that I wanted so badly to discover...I adore jasmine. the cookie itself was still great, just void of real flavor for me. the rest of the macarons were extremely successful though. The shop lady was amazing. such a doll. will definitely be back, but not too often for fear of massive weight gain ;)
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2014,10/26/2014,25,114,3,8,4>This is one of our regulars.  Anyone that says the staff is cold should relax and understand the cultural norms are different....  Lunch menu is abbreviated from the Dinner menu of 21.95.  All the sushi, sashimi, and assorted entree dishes you care to eat.  On the dinner menu there are at least twenty different specialty rolls.  The rice, and we know rice is important to good sushi, is freshly prepared and of higher quality than many competitors.  It is by far the best value, particularly if you are hungry for a lot of great sushi.  They'll keep bringing it to you without complaint so long as you don't waste the foot.  Highlights are the BBQ squid, fried spider, white tuna cocktail, and of course many of the rolls.Recommendation:  just because it is all you can eat, don't be a cheapskate on the tips...  remember there is a crew working to bring you probably at least $50 worth of food in any other restaurant... so tip accordingly and be gracious.This is one of our favorite date night places.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/7/2014,10/25/2014,83,478,2,3,4>Show up about half hour early for food.The aisles are large and spacious and some of the tables can be moved if you need your own. I came to see Captain America: The Winter Soldier on opening weekend and it wasn't completely sold out - there was no one sitting in the two seats beside me... so that was nice.  I ordered the BBQ nachos - they were something like $18 or something... they tasted good but were nearly impossible to eat because they were heaped onto a rectangular plate and the chips had fused together with like 5 pounds of toppings and cheese.  So basically - while sitting at a small table far removed from me I was trying to chip away at enough of these chips so I could take bites without spilling it all over the tables and myself.  I ended up eating about 15% of them probably... big waste. I ordered the BBQ chicken salad and it was pretty good.They had sweet tea too so I'm pretty happy about that. The folks sitting behind us were a large party of around 5 people who ordered a ton of beer.  I was concerned they were going to be loud and rude and obnoxious but they weren't at all and hardly talked during the entire movie.  In fact, most people were very polite and respectful which was a nice change. I typically get really irritated at movies and almost never go anymore because people are so inconsiderate and rude with their children, loud noises, talking, cell phones, drinks and candy wrappers and kicking my seat.  I just get really pissed and end up usually cussing someone out so I prefer to avoid it.  Perhaps because there were other sounds in general due to the nature of this show - it wasn't as irritating.  It's also very expensive - the whole meal and movie tickets for two cost around $80 total so I figure most trashy people with kids they don't parent during movies probably didn't want to spend that.  Fine with me.  It was the most pleasant movie experience I've had since someone with a baby ruined the final Harry Potter on opening weekend.
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/28/2014,10/24/2014,280,260,1,5,5>This is officially my new favorite place to go out for a special occasion in Norfolk, maybe even all of Hampton Roads!! I organized a birthday party for a friend of mine and I had no trouble making a reservation for the large party. They were very accommodating, even when two different times I called to ask if we could add one more. No problem! :) Parking was no problem when we arrived. As I walked in I was greeted by a few very friendly hosts, and I got to meet, John, the person I spoke to when I made the reservation and he wanted to greet me personally :) As we went in we noticed that the downstairs with it's own bar and tables was very trendy and cool. Our reservation was on the rooftop so we made our way upstairs. They had another bar upstairs on the roof. The ambiance up there was absolutely awesome! You don't even feel like you're in Norfolk anymore... for all you know it could be Paris! The string of lights and trendy but laid back atmosphere is uber-cool! As the rest of my party arrived we took our seats at a long table for 17! For an appetizer I ordered handmade pork rinds with black bean dip and special deviled eggs. Both were very good. I kept waiting for the shoe to drop when I ordered my entree, a Southern fried half chicken and mac and cheese. Everything was delicious!!! Everyone around me raved about their food and what a cool place it was. I will be coming back very soon with lots more friends!! This place is very ideal for a romantic date. Just ask for the rooftop!!
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2014,10/23/2014,129,351,3,8,5>Great place to visit for run, walk, bike or spending time on the beach. If you're a mountain biker then there's not much here for you as it's all flat easy (50/50 dirt to paved) trails but still a great place to ride and enjoy nature. If you're a walker it's fantastic and for those beach lovers there are a few access points.One is  across the street from the main entrance on Shore Dr. that's used for the camping entrance. However, the best place is the dog friendly beach area southeast of there at Cape Henry Trail. The access to it might be a little hard to find if you're not familiar with it but just continue on Shore Dr. then head West on 64th St (i.e. turn toward the land) and follow 64th St to Cape Henry Trail. "Head's Up" ...You'll need a parking pass not to get a ticket so if there's no ranger in the booth you'll have to pay by the honor system. Just pick up a yellow envelope at the Ranger Station Booth. The one you drive by entering the park. Outside and in front of the station is a red pole. Put your money in one of yellow envelopes and place the pass inside your window and you'll be good to go. It's always easier to pay the $4.00 for a parking pass than the cost if a ticket. I got lucky someone told me while I was driving in and saw the Ranger writing tickets when I parked.Now go and enjoy.
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,10/22/2014,263,519,6,10,9>Some people may say "They're just wings" but au contraire mon frere these are the best darn wings in the Hampton Roads area. Hands down. No Question... Our group stopped in this evening and we had 3 types of wings. Hot, Sriracha & Garlic Parmesan. Along with that there was a Dirty Chick plate and a Philly Cheesesteak. The food was excellent all around. The wings here are the biggest you'll find in the area and the home made sauces are the best. Kudo's to Russ and the team!
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2014,10/21/2014,155,241,3,8,4>Best cake donut. Hands down.I ordered the 2 donut 1 coffee special and opted for a maple bacon and lemon icing. They have a really impressive maple icing and the bacon was nice and salty and sprinkled liberally over the whole donut.I haven't tried the lemon icing and may give it to my husband to try. We'll see.I am not the biggest supporter of the cake variety of donut but Duck Donuts had changed my mind. The dough is light and fluffy and it took 6 bites to finish the donut! That's how big they are.If I ever feel like I need a cake donut this will definitely be my go-to joint.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,10/20/2014,69,206,1,5,4>A total gem. Aside from being on the corner of a very weird intersection and only having like 4 parking spots of its own, this place is awesome! JoJack's was packed at lunchtime, so apparently it's no secret. There was still a table or two available, though and a few stools at the bar facing the parking lot. I was there with a coworker and was only going to get a coffee until I smelled whatever was cooking in the back. I opted for the mocha frappe and havarti panini. They were both great! What I loved most is the super high quality ingredients they use in everything. Really good bread, cheese and most importantly, salty delicious prosciutto. Together it was $11, $13 with tip. Totally worth it for the quality of food.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,10/19/2014,79,115,,5,5>This is one of my new favorite dessert places in Ghent! I have driven by it many times before but finally had the opportunity to try their gelato. When we walked in, the owner was actually in the process of making a batch of gelato. It took a while for the girls and I to decide what we wanted, but we all ended up getting different ones. We were also able to sample different types. I opted for the fruity pebbles one, which had actualFruity pebbles and tasted exactly like the cereal. I loved how creamy and fresh the gelato tasted. Although I only ordered a small, I was satisfied with the size because it was pretty rich. The owner said his flavors usual change every day, except for when he makes a huge batch which can last 2-3 days. The establishment itself is relatively small. There's a bench to sit inside, but it was too cold to sit there. There was one table outside in front of the restaurant. Luckily, the girls and I were able to eat quickly so the whole thing wouldn't melt on us! I definitely would like to try more flavors in the future.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/28/2014,10/18/2014,51,266,1,5,4>So I went here before when it was another restaurant...I think Home Kitchen or something like that...Anyway, this place is definitely a lot better! Total 360 from the previous breakfast joint.Firstly, the interior is snazzy, modern and clean. Tables are a tight squeeze but somehow manageable to pass through.Service is what I was most happy about. The waitress was this funky cool chick that just made me happy. She was great on reciting the specials and making the recommendations. We got asked for refills from multiple people and such. I think, but not certain one of the owners, a middle aged Asian lady was the front of the house...she was not too friendly despite the rest of her staff.Now for breakfast we had mimosa, which were nice and tart with a hint of sweetness. I ordered the usual sunny side up eggs, grits and home fries. Eggs were cooked on point,  no complaints here. The grits were very chunky and lump-close to sandpaper. The home fries were seasoned great but they were cold and I found a few raw ones in the bunch. My sister ordered the veggie omelette which came with home fries and toast. The omelette was good judging from the few bites I had. The toast was soft, not toasted...not butter or anything. She did however bring jam and butter.Overall, I think this place has great potential. When I go again I will definitely try something else like fried green tomatoes but I won't go on the weekends as I've seen it quite full.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,10/17/2014,533,177,22,35,32>I had the great pleasure of dining for the first time at Rajput Indian Cuisine this evening. (Recently opened here)  I am blown away by the nice place, food that is out of this world great and great service.Upon aproaching Rajput I noticed cool art work and a nice looking place.  Upon entering we were greeted by friendly staff.  The decor is bright and colorful and has great Indian art.  Drinks were served and the waiter helped us with choosing dishes.  Indian food is new to me and I can use the help.  Each dish was presented beautiful and delicious.  The Garlic Naan is amazing, the spicy pickle dish is very spicy and very delicious!  The Vegetable Samosa was so delicious - it will make you make funny sounds.  I had the Tandoori Mixed Grill and it was so amazing - one of the best dishes I've ever had.  The Channa Palak was amazing too.  The Tikka Masala sauce was great on the rice and tandoori.   The flavors all came together to be a slice of heaven!!  As we were finishing our food the owner, Paul, came by and asked how the food and service was and we told him amazing and wonderful and asked a few questions about the dishes and he took the time to give great and fun and interesting answers.  He and his food and staff are going to be a great success here.I think our waiter was also named Paul and he was great.I learned they have buffet at lunch but not at dinner time.I am going to return soon!  I want to return every few hours!!  This place is amazing!I've posted photos and will have more soon.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2014,10/16/2014,64,199,2,4,5>I've lived in Virginia Beach for most the last 23 years and I've never been here before. I wish I had lived next to this place. It's the best seafood I've had in the area. I had the fresh flounder. It has been alive only a short time before it hit the plate. I enjoyed the Chesapeake style they offered with Hollandaise sauce and lump crab meat. The she-crab soup was almost like lobster bisque. It had spice and was creamy. The deck is the place to sit. It looks over Rudee Inlet and all the fishing boats.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/21/2014,10/15/2014,8,39,2,9,4>After eating here three times during the past two weeks, I would like to offer my first impressions. Let me begin by saying that the service I have received here so far has been very friendly, accommodating, and even jovial.  When I walked through the door for my second visit, several of their staff members greeted me in unison with a loud "What The Pho!"  I loved that.  The very name of this place alone makes me want it to succeed.  However, I think they still have a little more work to do if they are actually going to succeed.  In the spirit of my desire to see them do so, a description and review of each of the items I have sampled so far, along with my addiional comments, appear below:GIO CUON (Menu Item #1) - These are the fresh spring rolls that are served at practically all Vietnamese restaurants.  Overall, their spring rolls were very good.  I enjoyed the dense concentration of mint and basil in their filling.  As one other reviewer noted, however, they were not wrapped as tightly as they could have been. As mentioned in one of my other reviews, I loved the crunch that was made possible by the tightly wrapped fillings of the spring rolls served at another Vietnamese resaurant, namely Vietnam Garden. Another minor concern is that I like my spring rolls to be served with a little more chill. The ones I have sampled here were served a tad too much at room temperature for my tastes.PHO TAI NAM BO (Menu Item #14) - This Pho soup contained various and assorted cuts of beef.  The broth was very flavorful, and I have no complaints about the quality of the beef cuts or any of the other ingredients.PHO GA (Menu Item #15) - This is their Chicken Pho. Once again, the broth was very flavorful. The chicken pieces were succulent and tender.  Overall, it was delicious, and I hated to see it come to an end. This one is my favorite so far.BUN BO HUE (Menu Item #26) - This is a spicy beef soup which is served with a thicker noodle than the usual rice noodles in Pho soup. This is what I ordered today. I have sampled Bun Bo Hue at three other restaurants in the area, including Miss Saigon Sandwiches and Noodles (which is located right across the street), Pho Dalat in Chesapeake, and Pho 79 in Ghent.  Unfortunately, the Bun Bo Hue served here today was the weakest of the lot. The noodles were undercooked, the beef slices were sparse, and the broth was not very spicy. I actually had a 4-star rating in mind going in today, until I sampled their Bun Bo Hue. In contrast, the Bun Bo Hue served at Pho 79 in Ghent, which includes a nice meat bone for extra flavor and depth, has been the best I have tried in the area so far.Another concern is their portion sizes. During each of my three visits, I ordered the "Small" size servings of each of their soups. However, these servings appeared to be smaller than the "Small" sized servings I have sampled in other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.. The size of their bowls seems to be a tad smaller. In addition, I found my servings to be filled a little too far below the rim of the bowls. There was simply too much empty space between the top surface of the soups and the rim of the bowls when they were brought to my table.Personally, I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing. As one who is trying to cut back on calories, I don't mind getting "a little less."  But not to the extent of walking out still feeling hungry, like I did today after finishing my Bun Bo Hue. This is a soup that is supposed to stick to your ribs.The bottom line is that the "Small" serving sizes of their soups don't seem to be competitive with the others of the "Small" sizes in this area. The "Small" serving sizes at Pho 79, for example, provide a significantly larger portion of soup than those which are served here.  If they can't switch to a larger "Small" size bowl, then I think they should at least fill them a little closer to the rim.Another thing that worries me is that they are competing with another Vietnamese restaurant located right across the street, namely Miss Saigon Sandwiches and Noodles, which is more established.  I don't think this will be an easy task.  I am rooting for this restaurant to succeed.  Accordingly, I hope this review is taken in the spirit of the constructive criticism with which it is intended.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/20/2014,10/14/2014,76,81,3,5,4>What's to say that has not been said about this place! Route 58 is definitely a restaurant that is unlike any in this area. Every time I come eat here, I leave with a food coma, due to the portion size they offer at this place. I've eaten here quite a few times, and everything that I have ordered was delicious. As far as food goes, what really stands out what was my boyfriend and I ordered the last time we came here. He ordered the philly style open faced, which is layers of corned beef, pastrami, and turkey covered with cole slaw and their special dressing. I ordered the oscars garbage bowl, which I got beef brisket with grilled onions on top of crinkled fries, smothered with gravy! Safe to say that I almost had to be carried out, with how full I was, and I did not even eat half! My advice: share! Don't order your own meal, unless you plan to have dinner/lunch for the next few days :)
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2014,10/13/2014,121,78,2,3,4>A great, elegant dining experience, Salt has excellent "Libations" (I had a tasty Sidecar) and some really good appetizers. The cheese board was a delicate mix of flavors. The bulgogi wraps were sweet and savory. For the main course, I had the Sweet and Spicy Shrimp with coconut rice and edamame. My fiancée had a delectable Pad Thai. For dessert, I had an amazing goat cheese and chocolate cheesecake that was complex and satisfying.Our waiter was attentive, but unobtrusive. The atmosphere was romantic and vibrant.My only complaint was I was expecting to try the Pork Belly when I saw it was on the online menu, but disappointed when it wasn't on the menu.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,10/12/2014,22,104,1,3,2>I have been a fan for years, since they opened in their original location.  The new locations is beautiful, bigger, and a lot more comfy than the old one was.   Booths and tables are all spaced so you don't feel cramped, or like your intruding on someone else's space.   I would invariably get a smoked item.  I mean, why wouldn't you right?  You walk up, and his outdoor smoking trailer is running all the time, creating a zone of awesome scents for miles.  Pork, Brisket, Chicken, it doesn't matter. Just follow your nose to find some of the best offerings out there...but I digress.   I stopped in here and deviated from my norm and it's been my best choice in weeks!!  I saw the owner Sean prepare the Curry Shrimp over rice on the Fox Morning show and it looked good.  Boy was I wrong!!  It seriously was an awesomely flavorful dish.  I am telling you, it immediately rose to "craving the next time I have it" level on my list of yummies!!  Shrimp were big and cooked perfectly.  The veggies were still crisp and colorful so they maintained potent flavor in the profile.  I ordered mine spicy, so I got that delicious sweet-hot taste of the habanero, and the sauce... oh, the sauce.  I could eat a flip flop if it had that sauce on it.  All of it. over light, fluffy rice.  The serving size was no joke either.  It was plenty filling.  That is saying something, because I think I would've kept eating until I simply burst if I had the opportunity.  I can not recommend highly enough for you to visit Cutlass Grille.  If Curry isn't your thing, they have Jamaican beef patties, and a menu that is just chock full of delicious food.  I have to point this out.  This is a family run business, and from the owner to his children that work there, they really do add that special element because they visit your table, make sure you are alright and converse with you.  I admit it, for me, that earns points because it goes from being a seat, to a dinner table.  Get in there, go see what I mean and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2014,10/11/2014,13,167,6,6,3>You can't ask for better customer service.  John is a super friendly guy that will be patient with you and has great suggestions for cooking methods, accompaniments, and now wine/beer pairings.  You'll be impressed as he wields that fish fillet knife like a pro to remove any unsightly bits from your selection.  After coming here, you'll be hard pressed to go to any of the nearby grocery stores for seafood.  When coming here, think quality over quantity.  He's not packed to the gills with seafood; however, it's going to be as fresh and sourced as local as possible.Keep in mind that he closes at 6PM and is quite the local favorite.  So if you're planning a special dinner, don't be last minute as the good stuff may have already swum out the door.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2014,10/10/2014,10,13,3,7,5>If you're a vegetarian/vegan I guarantee you will revert if you have their wings! Went here for the second time and had their sweet willy mays glaze and smokey mesquite wings. They were both great! I usually can't really tolerate spicy foods but these sauces were the perfect amount of spice. The bartender was friendly and constantly checked up on us, but she didn't seem to know to much about the menu when we asked her what her preferences were. Other than that though she was great. Loved the decor and set up they have here. They had a bunch of recliners and TVs which would make it a great place for big game days. They also had a bloody marry bar that I would definitely like to try out on my next visit.To sum it up.. Sidelines is a great local sports bar with a chill atmosphere and delicious food :)
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,10/9/2014,171,233,3,5,7>Came here with some friends to enjoy Downtown Norfolk Restaurant Week. I had made reservations just in case there was a frenzy in getting seats. Surprisingly it wasn't busy at all. The place itself has tons of history and charm being exactly as it says... a carriage house. What I ordered for the night was the escargot, crab cakes, and lemon soufflé. We also split a bottle of wine with table and got some freshly baked bread while we waited. The table had some paper as a cover and crayons were available thus turning all of us adults into kids. The appetizer comes in and I enjoyed my escargot. Not as good as when I went to France, but that's a pretty high standard. The escargot wasn't served in the shells, but still tasty in the sauce that included being served with tomatoes and bread.The entree was an addition to the original restaurant week menu and I loved the crab cake. It was a big portion and the cake itself had a potato crust that was nice and crispy. It was served with a pretty well seasoned pasta salad.Finally, dessert! Lemon soufflé was great. I was expecting something baked, but it looked more like gelato served in a cup as pictured. Still good and not to overwhelming in lemon for me.Overall, love the history and love the food. I'll be back to try it again!

After the reviews on yelp I had to try it out on this stormy night.Restaurant was Still packed! People was waiting for their pick up and/or waiting to be seated. The inside is just a regular plain pizza parlor, nothing fancy but has TV's and a pool tableWe Ordered the garlic knots and that was so buttery and goood! Marinara sauce that accompanied the knots was equally delicious. It wasn't tarty or tangy like  some can be. We also ordered a pepperoni cheese pizza with green peppers. The crust/dough on this pizza is AWSOME, a very balance sauce. The sauces to me is what can make or break the pizza. And the sauce between the knots and this pizza was just perfection. Can't wait to return to try their pasta dishes. Seems their Stromboli was a popular item as I saw a lot of people order that. And kudos for having friendly staffs.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2014,10/7/2014,80,30,6,6,7>I'll be the first to admit, I am a freak of nature when it comes to my hair.  Prior to going to this salon, I had never been back to see a stylist more than once (never double dipping).  I usually perform a sort of "hit and run" with beauty salons --going in for a single visit where I let the person have their way with me and then write them off due to their mediocrity in creativity.  That was until Christiano Cole started doing my hair.Pause momentarily while I show my work.When I went in for my first visit, I had no idea what I wanted.  I honestly told him, "Do whatever you want, so long that it is not the current 'dirty dishwater brown' that it is".  It was icky and I knew it.  His face lit up like Christmas morning and it was evident that it had been a bit since someone had given him total creative freedom on their locks.I told him to surprise me and that I did not want to know what he was going to do until he did the "post-blow dry turn around" --the big reveal.  He graciously obliged and offered me some coffee (a nice touch).  The salon was okay.  It had just been remodeled and while it seemed to lack any central theme, I didn't really care too much.  I'm the type of lady that would rather have Gisele Bundchen hair done in a dirty closet, than go to a salon that resembles the Taj Mahal walking out looking like a broke down version of Coolio.  Sue me.Christiano began applying the color:  briskly, thoroughly, and the entire time keeping me entertained with conversation.  When he was done, he washed me out in the shampoo bowl.  It felt INCREDIBLE, he was firm but not too firm.  Then, he gave me the most beauteous blow dry I have ever had.  I felt like a Victoria's Secret model with all of the attention.  He flipped me around aaaaand ......BAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMM!Amazeballs.  My hair looked and felt so silky, so bold, so red, so sexy.  And the best part of all was that it looked perfect for me.  It looked personalized and had a distinct style.  It screamed, "I am a sexy power banker, give me your money and watch me take over the world".  A perfect personification of the band Cake's "Short Skirt, Long Jacket".  Exactly what I was going for.  Bravo, Christiano.  You have a customer for life in me.  Now stop reading this and make an appointment with Mr. Magic Hands.  Right now.

I am here today enjoying creamy cupcakes and delicious coffee.I am listening in on a bride purchasing her wedding cakes. Clair has a great idea about presenting grooms cake right beside the 5 tier wedding cake. Why not, it is 2014 and he should be able to order a cake in his favorite flavor with a decorative Harley Davidson on top of it!The owner is so knowledgable about all things wedding. It sounds like she is giving them great advice for cost cutting with decorations. I come for the treats and cakes. Today it is packed with people looking for a sugary high.  Smiles everywhere.
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/21/2014,10/5/2014,121,268,4,6,7>Finally got the chance to try this place out. I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience! The decor is nice and it smelled like freshly baked bread! As a matter of fact, I got a hot loaf right out of the oven. Yummy!!!!! I chose a few different things to sample. My favorite was the blueberry scone and croissants. My kids loved their chocolate croissant. My husband enjoyed an apricot bear claw. We will be back to try more goodies! The apple strudel looks incredible! There is an upstairs...but I did not get the chance to check it out. Looks like a nice sitting area.
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2014,10/4/2014,196,641,3,3,5>I am reviewing their dinner service, not their buffet. It seems their buffet is consistently a 4 star rating, which I find good for buffet style....so believe me, their dinner is really pretty impressive! My husband and I try to avoid restaurants on the weekend because of crowds, and finding that we had the restaurant almost all to ourselves one Thursday night was great! I'm an Indian food freak, so I rarely have found any menu item displeasing, but of course, some are better than others. Their pakora and samosa apps are pretty standard. Flavorful but not particularly notable. I would order them again. Their curries are where the magic happens. Aside from the usual suspects, ie: vindaloo, tikka masala, korma, etc., they offer some unique, harder to find specialties. Their Pasanda is....how do I describe it without being vulgar?.......well, its $%^&*@$ amazing! Their balance of creamy soothing coconut and heat from spices is perfection. The curry is similar to a korma in that it has a nutty base but I personally think it holds way more flavor punch and dimension. Their Saffron curry is similar but that mild aromatic saffron flavor always makes me sit back and close my eyes in a curry heaven dream. I know Saag is more common but when we order the aforementioned curries, we love having saag to add some tart, earthy green to balance it all. I know I am know telling you just how piggish we are when it comes to food consumption here but....se la vie; we always order extra naan, roti and rice. I love LOVE LOVE having some mint and tamarind chutneys on the side as well. Don't forget to wash it all down with a mango lassi or a chai. Their chai is fantastic! The best part? They made me a rose lassi upon request......and were so kind and happy to do it for me! If you love floral notes- ask for it. I hope for your sake they still have their rose water syrup- it's killer!
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/25/2014,10/3/2014,121,170,4,9,4>I had a rather interesting visit to Miss Saigon last week.  I was jonesing to go since I read so many good things about their sandwiches.  Last week, I decided to make a lunchtime trek over to Shore Drive; it's not somewhere I frequently, however.The most interesting part of my visit was not the food, it was the young man behind the counter.  He could not have been older the say 11 or 12 years, but this young man was all business, all the time.  He was wearing a tie and vest and kept calling me 'sir'.  I hate being called 'sir' by the way.  He was very polite, though, and I appreciated his attention to both me as the customer and his job.  I wish I could start a consulting business and take this young man to teach some of the other restaurant employees how to treat the customer.  There are a few places, at least, that could use his help!I started with the Vietnamese pancake.  Although I did takeout and it was a bit cold, it was OMG good!  It came packed in two styroform containers - one with the pancake and with the aromatic herbs and sauce.  It was loaded with meat and veggie and wrapped in, you guessed it, egg.  I would order this one again.  Hope next to eat it hot, though.The Vietnamese meatball sandwiches was not what I thought it would be.  From the picutures on Yelp, I was sure that the meatballs were huge.  Mine looked like they were squeezed from a potsticker wrapper - they were small and a bit flat.  It was hard to determine how good they were because the bread and pickled vegetables overpowered them.  I was a bit diasppointing, but I think I'll get over it.  I want to give their banh mi another shoot.All in all, my visit went OK.  The restaurant was empty but it took around 15 minutes for my order to come out; a bit longer than I expected, but I'm sure I'll give Miss Saigon another try soon.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/13/2014,10/2/2014,48,123,4,3,4>Hampton Roads needs ramen. This is a longing I've had since eating a fantastic ramen shop in DC, Daikaya. If you haven't had ramen--and the 10 cent packages from the grocery store don't count--you should definitely give it a shot. It's quite a bit more filling than you would imagine. There is a good variety of ingredients that go in to ramen. If you want to have something different every time you go, you can do that. As far as this restaurant, I'm really impressed with the quality of the service and speed at which we got our food (spicy miss if you care). Everything I ate was great. I'll have to eat here a few more times to get a better feel for it (I can't wait til a nice chilly fall day)--but I can definitely see this becoming a regular destination for me.
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2014,10/1/2014,57,77,2,4,4>Mexican that's somewhat better than mexican is about as far as I will go with this place.  When going out to eat and thinking Mexican food you generally have a preconceived notion on what to expect.  Those things are:1.  Chips w/ salsa2.  Fast service3.  Lots of food choices that is often hard to tell the difference.If this is you then, read this review.  1.  The salsa is rather delicious.  Not too hot and has some good substance to it.  2.  The service doesn't disappoint.  As expected, yes it comes to your table with you going: "wow that was fast".3.  There is your typical blend of food choices but they also have some unique dishes accompanied with a vegetarian menu.To top all that, they do serve fresh guac, and occasionally have a roaming band that plays jokes on people and do some funny songs (nice touch).  The facility is very clean and they do have a very nice outdoor patio area that gives spots of sun such that you don't feel like you're getting beamed 100%.  The only thing I don't like about the facility is that the walking areas are very narrow.  The guac station takes up easily 4/5ths of the walkway and makes it real tight if people are trying to get around.They also have a bar here.  I haven't hung out at the bar area but from an outside perspective, it does look nice and bar-esque enough to not be trashy but a cool place to chill.  Overall if you're looking for a non-trashy Mexican place with good food and service.  Check this place out.Food taste - 4Overall Service - 4Value of food to cost - 4Facility - 4Repeat customer? - yes
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/20/2014,9/30/2014,119,199,5,4,7>Your alarm clock goes off, it's 6:35AM.  Time to get up, get showered, get dressed, get coffee, get to work.  And as the years go by, as the routine slips from routine to drudgery and back again, your hopes for The Day go from Nervous Anticipation of youth to I Just Hope To Survive Intact to Face Another Day.  And you do.  And the cycle continues.  Lather, rinse, repeat.And by and large it is a good existence.  Indeed, some days suck much less, some about average.  The entire palate of grey is in full bloom here, the comfort of the Middle of the Road a not unwelcome distraction to the Internal Biological Processes that in the composite are Human Life.Every now and then, though....Stewart Copeland was bored, or inspired or lost a bet or something.  Whatever the motivation, the end game of all of this was that he spent 3 and a half years writing an orchestral accompaniment to the Silent Film Classic Ben Hur.  For reasons that quite honestly escape me and probably make no sense at all, the world debut performance was held at Chrysler Hall, our venerable Old Lady in Downtown Norfolk, sharing the same plot of land where John Brophy used to ply his trade and throw garbage cans at opposing backup goalies.  Indeed, why here, Stewart?  Please don't get me wrong, all of us in attendance for the performance sensed that this was Something Big, that we were somehow going to be the Sow's Ear that Became the Silk Purse.  We became the Anointed, the First.  And for that, I know that I will be eternally grateful.  Allow me to attempt to put this into a bit of a perspective for a moment.  Mr. Copeland (yes, that one.  He used to sit in the back during Police Concerts and was very much the Sountrack of my Misspent Youth.  Me and Mrs. Jones?  Not hardly.  Miss Gradenko was more my speed.  But I digress) edited the original film down to 90 minutes WITHOUT sacrificing story line.  He could have stopped there and walked away with a Big Win, but no.  He decided that this needed a whole new orchestral accompaniment.  In the Old Days before Sound, Color, Twitter, and Mariam's Fil-Am Cuisine, movies had no sound.  Instead, a giant (and mighty) Wurlitzer organ raised from the floor and a guy pumped away at it during the film.  Sometimes there was a scored accompaniment, sometimes he would just wing it.  He faced the screen so that he could understand the timing and make sure that his music at least vaguely fit what was happening on the screen.  Other films had wax cylinders that made the circuit with the film, but again, timing was critical.  One second of timing drift could put the film into an entirely new and unfortunate light.The timing.  It's everything.  When Mr. Copeland composed his score, he must have edited for hours getting the timing just right.  Making sure that when the film showed herald trumpets signaling the beginning of the Chariot Race, he scored the trumpets to life at just that moment, that the drum beats signaling the rowing cadence of the Slave Driven Roman ship were in perfect sequence with Stewart's own flailing on the floor tom. And then, in the most trusting and courageous act of all time, he turned that score over to Maestro RIchard Kaufman.  He stepped off a cliff (and conveniently took a seat behind the drum kit), not knowing how the journey would progress, much less the landing at the end of the journey.It was perfect.  Every note, every nuance, every flourish.  Perfect.  This score breathed new life into a classic that still had plenty of life left on its own.  Indeed, this was a once in a lifetime opportunity, to be amongst the first to witness that true mastery of sound.  This was special.  This was that day when the alarm clock went off as before, but what lie ahead was anything but middle of the road or just getting by. And we were there.  Norfolk.  Southeast Virginia.  757.  We have a bit of a reputation.  We don't excite easily.  Go ahead, try to impress us.  Just as on the Atlantic and Chesapeake, our waves tend to be very small, very non-intrusive.  A gentle lapping on the shore.  We tend to be passive, to let the experience wash over us.But not this night.  No, this was different.  As the final notes were still reverberating and the screen showed the famed Lion silently roaring his final time of the night, we rose as one and cheered.  And didn't want to stop, calling Mr. Copeland back to the stage to bask in the glory that was truly his that night.  We cheered because it was perfect.  We cheered because we were allowed to be a part of it.It will soon be Monday, the start of another work week.  At 6:35AM, my alarm clock will once again go off.  But for the next while, I will anxiously await the dawning of the day, I will embrace the challenges and the Left and Right of the road, because that is where the life is, that is where the magic happens.Stewart Copeland, on behalf of all of us, my sincerest thanks and gratitude.  Your work here will not soon be forgotten.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2014,9/29/2014,113,101,7,5,13>I searched Yelp for places within 5 miles of the house, and Woody's Barstro came up.  The wife and I decided to give it a try.  It was a Sunday eve at 5pm, so pretty quiet on this day. They were running a "Southern food" addition to the Menu on this day, so we both had the Liver and Onions entree.  This entree was prepared excellently,   Liver and Onions, served over mashed potato with the side of long stem green beans.  -- Also, unique and pleasant surprise added to this dish was bacon --  and I am not talking regular strip-bacon, I am talking nice extra thick chunks of bacon with great smoke flavor.   Tasted Great!The service was superb.  Heather, our waitress was right on time with drinks and the check near the end of the meal.  Also, there was an interesting random thing that occurred which we found quite cool:My wife was saying "If I ever opened a restaurant, I'd have love songs playing."  I disagreed with her on this and said:  "What?  You want to listen to music like Air Supply while you dine?  I don't think so!"   --  So about 5 minutes pass...  They had been playing Led Zeppelin, then Pink Floyd while we were talking, but the very next song after that:  "All Out of Love" by Air Supply!    We both laughed when this occurred and I said "What's going on here?!  Do they have microphones in the Salt Shakers?!"   Truly one of those odd life coincidences   :-)--- I give Woody McGee's 4.5 out of 5 stars.... I will definitely visit them again to try some new entrees, a great restaurant!
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2014,9/28/2014,124,171,5,4,8>Spades!!!!!!!!!! I'm so gamed for this restaurant!!  So deserving of 5 stars!!!A friend of mine ate here about a month ago and raved about the affordable dinner and happy hour specials.  But I didn't think ...I wanna go.  I just said ummmm ok.On one of the local stations, Ive heard this spot advertised, but again it wasn't convincing.  Nevertheless, I ended up here Saturday night (process of elimination). And boy...was I pleased!!! I was surprisingly "wowed"...like totally!!!I walked up and saw people carrying in items I thought ...ummmm whats going on?  Then I saw a few people sitting (self made seats) outisde the restaurant. I was like ummmmm nevermind.  But my guest said it's cool.It was very cool!!! I was relieved to know a baby shower was in progress on one side of the restaurant.  So that explained why certain items were brought into the restuarant heheehehe. Now the people sitting on the outside, still unsure about that. But eventually they came in and joined the baby shower.Welp enough about a first impression...I had my brow raised, but as we approached the bar (another couple already dining there) the bartender, Joy greeted us cheerfully.She was cute and her soothing voice kinda eased my concerns I had upon entering.Thank you Joy!!!From 6-8 they offer happy hour $5 top shelf drinks, $3 (I think) well drinks and $2 (I think) drafts...no food deals, but the drink deal is fantastic!  I did find out- only on Thursdays they offer wings and shrimp as apart of the happy hour specials.I had my share of drinks...happy hour was very happy for us! :)Dinner time...They offer small and large portions.  Now I can't imagine what the large portion consists of, but I ordered the small curry chicken with cabbage and yellow rice, and this was plllllllllllllllenty!!  (your entre includes 2 sides)The food was filling and so so good!!!  I didn't know I would enjoy it sooooooooooooo much!!!  The meat super tender.  The meat did not have too many bones.  The cabbage seasoned just right.  The yellow rice...ummmmm it couldve used a lil help.  Nevertheless, the curry sauce helped it.  Therefore, no real complaint there!I ate dinner about 730pm and I was full for the rest of the night.My guest had the jerk chicken with cabbage and mac n cheese. Of course I tried it too...the jerk chicken tasted like BBQ chicken (just a lil bit tho).  We brought it to Joy's attention, but she said they grill the chicken so that may have been why I could taste a smoky flavoring.  But it was seasoned just right.  My nose wasnt running overwhelmingly because of the jerk so that was a good thing!!  The mac n cheese.........ummmmm it wasnt up to par to my liking, but my guest ate it all :)Overall, please try this restuarant.  I believe they have been opened a year if that.  Ample parking...it's located in a shopping center.  Therefore, if you eat too much you can walk it off.When we arrived only one couple was there, and the party was going on ...seperate from the dining area.  But after about 30minutes other patrons started coming in...ordering take out!  This is always a good sign.  An empty restuarant definitely raises a brow IMO!They play music as well.  I think they werent playing it as much because of the baby shower but we requested to hear some tunes...Joy made it happen!I did visit the restroom...super clean!!!!  That's another plus!!!!  No water was around the sink...no overflowing trashcan...and it smelled pleasant as well.  Tissue stocked and paper towels...hands free unit!Despite my concerns upon entering and a few other hiccups, this place is a definite winner!!I will be back.  I will aim to go on a Thursday to try out the wings and shrimp for happy hour!!Another gentleman kept peeking in on us to make sure we were good and we rest assured all was good.  He may of been the owner...he looked important hehehehe...Kudos...keep on keepin on!!!Have fun :)
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2014,9/27/2014,12,77,2,3,4>This place is great! They have the best Aquatic selection by far over petco and petsmart! I just wish they sold my dogs' blue buffalo basics flavor, then I wouldn't have to go to the petsmart by my house! It has a much larger selection of pet toys and saltwater fish items, as well as salt water accessories. I was blown away with the place after walking in once! The only reason why it doesn't have 5 stars is my dog food. The staff are pretty friendly and helpful also. This place has made my list and my picky husbands too!
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2014,9/26/2014,29,113,1,4,5>I have lived in the area for 2 years, and just recently visited the Nauticus for the first time. I appreciated that they gave a military discount. My husband was my own personal tour guide (he has been here before). While walking around the battleship and the museum, he found some things that he didn't see last time. There is so much to do that it will take you hours to go through it all! I really wanted to pet the sharks but they only offer petting/feedings on the odd hours (ie. 1pm, 3pm, etc.). This is definitely worth the money! Great place for a family outing.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2014,9/25/2014,163,183,6,7,8>I'm breaking my rule of visiting at least twice before making a review but I felt like I really needed to for this one. I don't understand why there are so many 1 star reviews for this place because the Big Easy is such a fantastic restaurant/bar. Yes, it's a little classier than your average t-shirt and jeans joint. But for what it's meant to be, it's really, really great!We were greeted with a friendly face right at the door and were asked if we wanted to be seated downstairs (a basement bar area) or upstairs (a brighter, classier area). Since we weren't too extremely dressed, we opt for the basement bar. The bartender was prompt with the menu and explained that they were a participating restaurant for restaurant week. We ordered the orange crush, and to be quite honest, its far superior to Watermans. We also tried their oyster shooters, our first try, which was good with the liquid but definitely different once that oyster swam down our throats. It's not something you would typically get to get the party started. Just a try was enough. My gf and best friend both had the she crab soup. Which were pretty good. Then our main course of Surf n' Turf, Seafood Jambalaya, and the Big Easy chicken. All of them came hot and fresh. The flavors were all there and my Seafood Jambalaya had just the right amount of spice. Perhaps the most memorable dish of the night, was the Bread Pudding for dessert! It came topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel syrup drizzle. It was our fave of the three options offered.My only thing weird that I would have to say was the fact that the cook (or who looked like a kitchen staff) kept coming behind the bar right in front of us just wondering around. He was out of place and was not at all friendly. He literally just loitered in front of the oysters for a good 10-15 mins at a time. We had such a great dinning experience, we will definitely come back for more! Maybe to try their happy hour, as someone suggested in the reviews below that it's pretty good.

With all the dust and pollen and summer coming around the corner it was time to treat my car out. Not to mention, the week old bird poop was the icing on top.I did the laser wash (drive-thru) bc I wasn't in the mood to get out my car. I did the gold for $7 bucks. You get everything except for the double bond Teflon sealant which you get on the platinum for $9. Drove up and parked on the platform. They carwash let's you know if you need to drive up more or back up and displays what step it's on. Probably was in there for about 10 mins. I  parked and got out to look at the results.The bird poop was off, car shiny, and I was happy. Affordable and convenient. Also has vacuums and self-wash.

When it came in, it didn't fit and I was devastated. So much so, that I thought I needed to find a different dress and start over. After trying on several more dresses the staff helped me see that the original dress I purchased was truly the dress for me and they were able to order the correct size without any cost to me. During my fitting appointments the staff was always kind and complimentary of how I looked in the dress. Even though I told them they say that to every bride, they were sure to tell me that wasn't always the case. I felt special and beautiful in my dress thanks to the ladies at this store.

". yes, I cut and pasted this from the breakfast menu.... for a good reason.  It was a dessert.  Far too sweet.  The "fresh fruit" was strawberries marinated in sugar overnight.  Oh, and it was topped with whipped cream, from a can, I think..looked like it.  I also ordered the Edward sausage links because of the nice reviews.  They were almost the size of hot dogs.... but tasted far better.  The meat was tightly packed in the casings and very smoky... delicious.You peeps who want an inexpensive but delicious breakfast, order the Viking and ask for an extra plate and fork.  This is 2 huge pancakes, one large waffle, 3 eggs, bacon, 2 Edwards sausages, delicious potato chunks and a large biscuits for 12.99.  I have to comment on the potato chunks.  They were fried but somehow they figured out how to put mashed potatoes inside... crazy delicious.There is also a nice bar with bar seating. A person commented about the half off mimosa..... get there early because it stops at 9am and only on Saturday and Sundays. I am going back when I want genuine pea soup....I will bet it is super delicious.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2014,9/19/2014,18,133,4,6,3>I love bakery stuff and donuts, but I've been a little disappointed in HR. There have been great donut places (see 'paradise donuts'), but that's about it. I stopped by Sugar Plum after a trip to Trader Joe's after my girlfriend got me some donuts once that I loved. This place is just great all around! The employees were incredibly friendly and happy and they were well-stocked (even a couple hours before closing). They have everything from cakes, to donuts, to cookies. Not only did everything I get taste perfect, but the prices were incredibly cheap and it's a non-profit establishment! I think if more people knew about Sugar Plum there would be a line out the door.Things I loved: Mini cherry cake, black and white cookie, and coconut donut. They also have seating inside if you can't wait to eat your sugar-filled food until you get home!Overall: Really great bakery in an un-expecting area of town. The price was right, service was great, and options were plentiful. Looking forward to my next visit (but I'll have to wait until I have more time to exercise the fat off...)

Disappointed in the lack of flavor in the salmon sandwich...it was plain and blah. Great happy hour prices.   We will defiantely be back for the pizza!
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/1/2014,9/17/2014,64,171,8,4,4>The Comfort Zone has AMAZING chicken wings.  I mean, I wanted to suck the bones dry, but that wouldn't have been very lady like in a 35 and up lounge like atmosphere now, would it?  Seriously.....would it?Come to think of it, I don't think my coworkers would have appreciated any bone sucking since they frequent this place.  They might have disowned me and claimed that I was raised in the rain forest with wild Orangutans - my arms are rather long though - I might be related?  Anyway, awesome wings.  Not thick nasty dipped in batter like you get at some chains but rather a nice layer of crispy skin surrounding juicy yumminess, its perfection I tell ya.  Comfort zone is just a great atmosphere for an older crowd.  Very relaxed with great music.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/6/2014,9/16/2014,40,56,2,7,2>When I saw a groupon pop up on my email for Saffron, I new I had to buy it because my wife and I love this place. But after I looked a little closer at the fine print, I recognized that they had a new location in Norfolk. We usually travel to the Va Beach town center from Hampton to eat at Saffron. So I bought the groupon for the Norfolk Saffron and we visited on Cinco de Mayo.We walked through the front door knowing exactly what we wanted to eat. My wife loves the vegetable biriyani.  I usually hang out in the curry section. But today I decided to get the matar mushroom. This is a vegetarian dish that I added chicken to in order to satisfy the carnivore in me. My meal was pretty good. It was consistent with what I'm use to getting at the Saffron in Virginia Beach. Since I added chicken to a dish that comes with mushrooms and peas, there was not a lot of room for sauce. That is my one knock on the dish. If I could have ordered some extra sauce on the side, I would have done it. I actually should have done it. There was an additional $5 charge for adding chicken to my $13 matar mushroom. My wife was happy with her biriyani and naan.My only problem with our trip to Norfolk was the parking. There were no meters open on the street for us to park so we hit the garage. We had to pay $3 to park in order to eat dinner. Not a bad price to pay for a great meal, but it may be a deal breaker for some who would rather not get taxed to eat dinner In Norfolk. The garages in Virginia Beach near the other Saffron are free.

<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/1/2014,9/14/2014,44,61,2,5,6>Originally was going to O'Connors Afro their event.  I begged off due to the parking and long line at the gate.   So we went to the next best alternative, Smartmouth, to start, the parking is easy, and there was a great crowd, nice mix between young and old.   Great crowd actually, with hipsters from the neighborhood, and an old guy like me (Navy veteran and now oil rig worker).  I got the IPA and it was very good, also the Malbons food truck was outside so beer and BBQ definitely go together.   great time, great folks and great beer, win win win.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2014,9/13/2014,48,178,1,5,4>I used to frequent the zoo quite a bunch when I was a nanny for 5 years. I had been taken here as a child & always enjoyed taking the little ones that I watched. They loved the water spouts that are in use during the summer. I hadn't been since 2007 & wow they've added some cool new stuff since my last visit, including the train & the whole "Trail of the Tiger" exhibit.I had bought the living social deal last fall & took my boyfriend for his first visit during yesterday's beautiful weather. It was definitely busier on a nice Saturday than the week days I used to go on. I was happy that I saw security & a police officer in the parking lot because I had heard of the car break-ins that were becoming an issue there. I was starting to get disappointed since it seemed like a lot of the animal exhibits were under construction or signs that the animals would be returning in the spring. I wanted to show my bf the prairie dog exhibit & the petting zoo, but oh well we'll have to return when it warms up. Luckily, as we walked through the zoo we were able to see more animals. My favs included the kangaroos, giraffes, & monkeys to name a few. We were convinced that some of the reptiles are fake though haha. It was a fun day though!!Beautiful landscape, cool animals to see, & a clean facility makes for a nice place for a family outing or date!!
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,9/12/2014,59,90,1,5,4>This is a small restaurant with a cool outside area to eat. It feels like you were in somebody's backyard just hanging out and eating some good food. The french fries were awesome fresh-cut fries with their own special seasoning on them.  The pulled pork barbecue was awesome it had great smoke flavor it wasn't overpowering and it had a good sauce and good flavor. The Philly cheesesteak was very unique and tasted really good. It was different than anything I've ever had before in a cheesesteak. It had plenty of cheese and had a nice steak sauce flavor to it also.The staff was very helpful and nice and went above and beyond to make sure our visit was special. He even came out and gave us a little taste of their smoothie that they had made a little bit extra of. Now that is service! I can't wait to come here again and try the chicken wings that I've heard so many good things about. Come here!
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/30/2014,9/11/2014,255,146,4,6,8>This is a great little sub shop. I had lunch here a couple of times. The sandwiches that I liked the most was their Italian and the Chicken Philly, the Chicken Philly was a little different than the traditional version. They use sliced chicken breast rather than the chunks, it is a "neater" version of the Chicken Philly and a good change of pace but I prefer the more common cheesier version. There are a couple of tables in the restaurant for you to sit and enjoy your meal, they have a TV too. Prices here are reasonable and they have daily featured meal combos. Service here is pleasant and quick, but I definitely recommend calling ahead to reduce your wait time.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/29/2014,9/10/2014,509,292,1,10,7>WOW, this was my favorite part of my 30th birthday celebration! Hands down, the best restaurant I have been to in Virginia Beach.Its hard to review a place that already has almost 100, 5 star reviews, without saying something new that hasn't already been touched upon, so I will just outline my experience. My dreamy husband made us a 6pm reservation and when we got there, it was not as crowded as I had envisioned for a Friday night. We were promptly seated and given our CUSTOMIZED, "Happy Birthday Nikki" menus, which I thought was pretty special. We started immediately with yummy bread, which came fresh from the oven and served with olive oil. Our server suggested the Chefs tasting with wine pairings and I think that was the perfect choice for a first timer at this restaurant. Our first course included the Raw Oysters and Heirloom baby beet salad. Both were perfectly prepared and presented beautifully. Second course, Risotto and Ahi tuna, again, mouthgasm. For our entree, he chose the duck duo and I chose the fennel pollen dusted sea scallops. HOLY MOLY. Delicious. I could eat those scallops everyday! Each dish was picture perfect, flavorful, and the wine pairing our waiter chose for us went perfectly with each dish. We topped the night off with the Chocolate love dessert with port wine and a whiskey. YUM. The portions were quite small, but this is to be expected when you order a tasting menu. Regardless, we both left fat, full and happy. The only part about this place that you need to keep in mind is that it is not cheap. But like I say with all things, you get what you pay for and Terrapin was worth every single penny. Our waiter was cool and conversational. He and my husband bonded over talk of their watch collections like they were old pals. I like a waiter that can get a good flow of conversation going. Nothing is worse than a boring wait staff. I loved the vibe, the funky decor and the open kitchen is always something I appreciate.Thank you Terrapin, for making my birthday just as amazing as you are. We will absolutely be returning and I always recommend you to anyone looking for a new place to try.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2014,9/9/2014,37,327,4,4,5>My daughter took an art camp here this summer.  It had a theme and the age ranges are broken up well each week.   They offer a drop off and pick up on Plume St since it's surrounded by construction.  I carpooled with another family, so only experienced pick up and got right outside 4 days.  One day I did go round and round the block until finding a spot.  But overall, it was easy to get to, has plenty of parking on street or garages.  The camp space seemed small, but they got to walk through the artists areas and get outside daily for lunch.  They did a lot of projects and the end of week art show was nice to see everyone's work.  She had a great time.  We enjoyed stopping by the artists booths that week as well.  Will be back to see more and perhaps do a class.  Fun place.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2014,9/8/2014,31,57,3,7,5>It's taken me a while to write a review on Bangkok Garden, since I was previously a waiter there for 3 years. However, it's been 2 years since, and everything about Bangkok Garden has changed (new location, it now has a bar, etc) except the quality of the food!I have been here to eat at least five times since it opened up. My roommate and I were going on a binge, and were going there every weekend to start our weekend. You can't fault a guy wanting his Thai food back after being used to eating it almost every day for 3 years... And it never got old.I have many recommendations, but am only go with what I have tried since the new place was established. The Som Tum is mega delicious, and they still never fail me when I tell them to make it bleeding red. Also try the Yum Woon Sen, which is still well prepared. These are both great summer salads, and what makes it better is that they have outside seating! The Kai Tom Kha (chicken coconut soup) still rocks my world. My roommate ordered Tom Kha, which is still prepared well, but trust me on the Kai Tom Kha. I'm not a fan of fried food, and it spring rolls and the fried appetizers is something hard for me to recommend. However, two items always made me look passed the fried part Wontons and Fried Calamari. Their fried calamari is different, but it's hella good. Steam rolls, is like a heavenly summer day in your mouth! Pineapple fried rice with chicken is still banging, and I admit I can only do the regular fried rice with all the meats or just chicken - on thai fried rice for me, I haven't been able to stomach other Chinese nor Japanese fried rice and haven't attempted Vietnamese. I can go on with my mouths savoring recommendations, but let's continue. I think paying a little extra for all meats is fair, especially for how much you get and how little extra you pay. I haven't attempted it, because I never substitute, but it did use to bug me as a waiter when we added veggies to the meal and would charge extra even when they asked for some veggies to be removed. I am unable to let you know if this has changed, but don't let it stop you.The ambience is nice, and I have spoken to the owner about how beautiful it is and how I am super happy that they have a bar. Luckily, the bar hasn't taking away from the dining experience, which is perfect, I would hate for patrons to look past the food. Overall, this place still cooks up a hell of a Thai meal!

<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/15/2014,9/6/2014,17,15,2,11,5>A big debate in va beach seems to be whether Iggles or Philadelphia Cold Cuts has the better cheesesteak.  I tried Iggles first And really enjoyed it.  It took me awhile to finally get around to Philadelphia Cold Cuts, but I finally did and also thoroughly enjoyed, but simply based on memory I had no idea which one I like better.SO, my husband and I finally did a side by side taste test of Iggles and Philadelphia cold cuts, both made the same way (grilled onions, white American cheese, and mayo).  Well, I'm gonna be honest, upon looking at the two cheesesteaks I thought and wanted Iggles to win.  Iggles sandwich had more filling, was a larger sandwich, and they both cost the exact same!  So, finally the taste test after the visual examination...and on first bite of each there was no debate which tasted better.  Philadelphia was hands down the winner!! I was NOT expecting it to be such an easy decision, but it was.  The debate is over.  Philadelphia Cold Cuts takes the cake on best cheesesteak!! Quality over quantity was the lesson learned tonight!And I had no idea you can get it "with whiz."  Can't wait to try it!
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/28/2014,9/5/2014,40,107,3,5,3>The Happy Hour specials here are ridiculous. From 3PM - 7PM Monday - Friday, & 8:30 AM (yep) - 7 PM on the weekends, all glasses of beer / wine / liquor are half off.Our last visit here was on a Thursday, which is half price whole pizza night, and arguably the best day of the week to visit. The bill for an entire pizza & 6 drinks came to less than $23. I'm not sure where else you can get a deal that great here in Hampton Roads.Service is excellent, provided you realize that this is primarily a bar and you don't come here starving. Your server may get distracted and end up chit chatting near the back of the establishment, so don't be afraid to chase them down if you need something.All in all, even though the clientele primarily consists of dudebros & college kids who haven't quite figured out how to hold their alcohol properly, it's still worth a visit.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/5/2014,9/4/2014,4,65,3,3,4>3.5Beer menu is good, though I would not characterize as fantastic...anyplace with flights and samples though will earn some points with me. I think they had around 30 beers on draft including one of my favorites New Belgium's Accumulation!! ...though about 6 or so of these were very basic, but you need to please the masses I guess. Clearly the draft selection is way better than your average bar. Around another 30 or so bottled selections including one of my favorites Lost Coast Tangerine Wheat and Ballast Point Sculpin....AWESOME!!!! TRY THEM!!The food was not bad, but I agree with some other posters that the menu does not make me think "Gastropub" I think of Gastropub food as basic bar food with very interesting/local twists to them, using different sorts of ingredients and flavors to enhance the experience of your run-of-the-mill traditional stuff.   While I do think that the appetizer menu may fit this description,  the actual entrees are all pretty much your average type-menu....chicken, steaks, seafood, pasta, burgers. I had the mahi sandwich and it was quite tasty, but I was hoping for something a little more interesting...We sat outside, service was good, though the outside tables were suffering from that weird giant-chairs-very-low-table phenomenon that can make it difficult to eat anything that may be potentially messy...I hope this place does well, because this is a notorious location for restaurant closures and I am glad to see a place with a nice beer menu on the VB map!!
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2014,9/3/2014,202,207,3,5,4>Continuing in my quest for great tasting pizza in the Hampton Roads Area...I just so happened to find and stop in this pizza joint after reading other good reviews on Yelp. I felt a little awkward as I was the only one here at 9pm when I walked in, as I decided to eat here over Papa John's. I checked the menu before I arrived and decided on the 12" BBQ Chicken Pizza. While waiting for the pizza I noticed the décor in this place could use some major updating.  And the space would really "POP" if they replaced all the tables and chairs with wood ones and maybe get a few high-top tables in there as well. The TV could also be bigger on the far back wall I think it was only a 32' screen; could barely see the thing. The pizza arrived shortly thereafter and looked amazing. After taking that first bite I was in aww. The pizza tasted really good. The BBQ sauce for a short period reminded me of the McDonald's sauce with a little more pepper. The only bad thing about the pizza was it was really too thin on the bottom; nothing too terrible bad though.**Overall the pizza at this location is very good don't let the area it in fool you. I will be returning and would recommend them to others.Eat Up!!!
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2014,9/2/2014,88,178,1,5,6>I really wanted to give this place five stars after having so many of my friends recommend it. They advertise having a farm to table approach which I just love! We had a large party and decided to just split up in to two groups so we would not have to wait as long. It was 6pm on a Saturday night, I expected a wait, but the other people in my part weren't feeling quite as patient. They have a great seating area inside which was great. The restaurant is layer out a little weird. I feel like they need to rearrange things to maximize the space. It was still nice to wait inside. When we were waiting I grabbed a drink from the bar, Allagash. It is one of my favorite beers, so I was really excited that they had it on tap. They have a really good tap selection and their bottle selections was awesome! I really liked the bar tender too. So much so I would come back to sit at the bar, maybe for a football game. Unfortunately I did not like our server half as much as out bartender. She didn't have much personality and her attention to detail was nonexistent. She was terrible when it came to drink refills especially. I told her it was my first time here and I asked for a recommendation of fries and her answer was so unenthusiastic I almost didn't get her recommendation. (My friends convinced me otherwise.)We had the cheese sticks as a starter and I would come back just for those. Definitely ask for alfredo on the side too! (We did, our server forgot to bring it when my friend ordered, but I was able to try it once she brought it to us just in time for the last half of my cheese stick).  They were creamy and gooey. They definitely didn't taste like the frozen ones you get from some of the chain restaurants. The batter was light and it wasn't over powering, you are definitely getting the cheese!!For my meal I had the Fun Guy burger, which is their portobello mushroom burger. It was delicious! It could have used a little more cheese and I had a hard time tasting the basil pesto. Still very good. I was really impressed with the bread actually! The border fries were great! However the batch my table got was all a little too crispy with tiny tiny fries. I loved the spice, but I left half of them on my plate, because of the size and texture. I tried a house fry from my friend's plate, definitely preferred the border.  It was good and maybe with better fry quality and better service it could have gotten 5 stars from me. I will give it another shot next time my husband is craving a burger.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,9/1/2014,91,52,2,7,6>The Cut. This is one of the best gems Chesapeake has to offer. If you haven't been, play hookie at work at go here instead. They've got great healthy options that includes paninis and salads. They've also got daily specials that are usually very impressive. They've had pork belly specials (which my friends say is amazing), salmon specials, etc. I've yet to have a sandwich there that has disappointed me. And hummus and pita for a side? That's pretty rad in my book too. They usually get pretty busy during lunch time (11:30 AM - 1:30 PM), so plan accordingly!
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2014,8/31/2014,107,136,2,5,6>Second visit...came on a Sat. for Delmonico steak special. 10oz $11.95, 12oz $13.95, 14oz $15.95, & 16oz $17.95. I started with the clam chowder. Was good. For me, it could've used a little more pepper. It had bacon and a bunch of clams so I was happy.I ordered the 10oz Delmonico w/ a side salad and baked potato. First, a hot loaf of pumpernickel bread arrived with a delicious honey butter. It was sooooooo scrumptious! There were little slits in the bread so you can pull a piece that it semi-uniform. Then, the salad came. It was nice and crisp. Simple salad w/ a pepper corn dressing. There were many options for dressing.  Last, the steak arrived. For 10 oz it was huge! I ordered medium rare and got medium rare. It was seasoned PERFECT! I didn't need to add anything to the steak at all!!! I didn't even use A-1 as it would've taken away from the flavor. Before adding salt, I suggest taste first! The dude next to me was salting it up without tasting. I'm horrible as I didn't say a word...Service was on-point. Restrooms were clean. Definitely coming back...

I didn't get there until after 5pm so they were out of few of the flavors, but there were still some good ones left. I couldn't decide between the apple pie, gingerbread, or Italian cream. I ended up going with the apple pie. I must say, this is the best cupcake I've had. The texture of the cake was so soft and moist, it was like biting into a little piece of heaven. The butter cream and apple filling made it taste just like an apple pie. I have a major sweet tooth so I was happy with it, but others may find that the frosting was too sweet. The people that work there are very nice. They acknowledge you right away and they just give off a good vibe in the cute little cafe. The cupcakes are $3 a piece and $33 for a dozen, which is a pretty good deal to me since these cakes are so good. My only suggestion is to find better holders for the dozen box. I feel the holes don't secure the cupcakes that well. Besides that, I have nothing to complain about. Next time I crave a cupcake, I'll know where to go.

<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/21/2014,8/27/2014,152,116,4,6,4>I'm really not big on Mexican food, but it was my coworker's 21st birthday party so I couldn't help being dragged 40-minutes out into Viriginia Beach just to eat and drink at Señor Fox's. Fortunately, I was particularly hungry that night, so I felt like I could eat anything. But first, I just had to munch on their tortilla chips, which I dipped in salsa and surprisingly, some kind of concoction atypical of Mexican restaurants that tasted mostly like mayonnaise.After much deliberation and 21st birthday shenanigans, I ordered Brian's Special, even though I had no idea what that was at the time. The description sounded like every other food item on the menu. It turned out to be just a sheet of beef and chicken over the usual compliment of beans and rice with a side of tortillas. I was a bit disappointed with the presentation and it tasted pretty average, too. The only difference between what I ate and a burrito or soft taco it would seem, was that I had to make it myself. Had I stopped there, my rating would have been 2 stars at most.The margaritas were pretty good. The Monster Margarita tasted a lot like a tequila version of a daquiri. I shared one with my coworker's mother and didn't think too much of it until I started feeling sick after about a cup-full. The alcohol really creeps up on you especially with sweet drinks like that, but tequila just doesn't sit well with me so the events that followed after I left the building were probably inevitable. I should have just stuck with the Negra Modellos I ordered for that night. Which, by the way, for some reason came with lemon slices. My Negra Modellos always come with lime, but then again, there was that one time at some restaurant where it didn't come with anything, so better than nothing, I guess.The saving grace for me was dessert. The Sopaipilla was a delicious if not safe choice. I was really impressed with the Deep Fried Icecream though. I ordered one at a restaurant called Cha Cha Cha's in Waikiki, but Señor Fox's one was 10 times better. Just the right crunchiness of the outer later, with just the right sweetness of the vanilla icecream encased inside. I would definitely go back just for another taste of that dessert.All in all, it's not a bad place to have a few drinks. The staff is pretty friendly. If you're coming here for food, I'd ask them for recommendations or order very carefully. Stick to the safer choices if you must. And whatever you do, do not forget to ask this important question:What does Señor Fox say?
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2014,8/26/2014,38,55,2,7,3>I believe this restaurant is fairly new, with a name that can kinda throw you off. You might think you're about to enter a pet shop. But don't let the name fool ya, the food was pretty tasty.Kinda gave me a Woody McGee's vibe. It's a small restaurant with tables and booths in the front and a bar taking up the entire back half, so it probably gets pretty busy here. Luckily, we went on a slow Tuesday afternoon just in time to catch the last 30 mins of Happy Hour (ended at 7pm). Ordered a decent sized rum & coke for $3 and their signature Hair of the Dog burger. It was pretty delicious but a lot of food to tackle. It was a good burger, one that I wouldn't mind ordering again. I tend to steer towards fried egg burgers and theirs just happens to have bacon and waffle bun to top it off! I had fries as a side while my friend substituted for their mac & cheese. He said it was really good, with a Gouda style.Their happy hour special was pretty decent as well. They have a good beer selection, but I think as of right now they only serve bottles (I could be wrong). The have pretty interesting Bloody Mary choices too, if you're into that.I plan to come back to try out more of their menu. The chicken & waffles look pretty intriguing. I imagine this place being packed during the weekend and brunch hours, so hopefully a busy visit won't take away from your experience.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2014,8/25/2014,24,113,1,8,9>I forgot how much I love this place.  Tuesdays are awesome.  Five dollar flights and five dollar glasses from 5-9.  The food is so good and they have some wonderful wines to taste. It's good for groups,  good for a date, girls night out.  You name it. Nice non-pretentious  casual atmosphere. I'm wearing shorts and a t-shirt and I fit in just fine with the other patrons here. Great place. Will be back for sure soon.
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2014,8/24/2014,31,234,3,14,8>I was prepared to love them before they even opened their doors when I saw the herb garden outside. The latest gem in NOCO, I got a chance to talk to the owner who described wanting to prepare "honest" food. Big focus on fresh, local, organic, I like to think of it as comfort food without the guilt. Every bite just made me smile, and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable.My first meal consisted of a cucumber and tomato salad with optional shrimp on top. As the plate was being handed to they mentioned the cucumbers had been picked that very morning. The plate was quite lovely and had a generous portion of shrimp. Absolutely the perfect thing on a hot summer day, light, refreshing, crisp and clean flavors. The lovely dessert followed. A buttermilk custard with crumble. It had this great citrus tang to it. If I could have licked the mason jar clean I would have. Basically, I loved it and am looking forward to my next visit.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/19/2014,8/23/2014,46,168,1,6,7>Tuesday evening 6 p.m.Had a great evening. Our party of about a dozen were the only guests for the two hours that we were there. This was unexpected but it was ideal because we didn't have to worry about being a bother to anyone else. I don't know if Norfolk Garden is always this quiet on a weeknight, but if you want a quiet date this could be the weekday spot.You cannot tell the beauty of the inside by looking at the exterior. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked over a mock-bridge to enter the main room to see beautiful etched windows and lovely Asian decor throughout. Our very long table for our party was ready before we arrived. Being that no other patrons were in the restaurant I was surprised to see less than 6 menus scattered about.There was one server working, and 12+ of us, he handled himself pretty well. I was not displeased with the service. I'd say service was pretty good. I am wholly unfamiliar with Korean cuisine. Luckily I was seated next to a friend who could explain each dish to the group in detail, especially the subtle differences in the sauces. If you too are unfamiliar with Korean dishes bring along an expert, read the descriptions in detail, ask questions, especially if you don't want anything to spicy.As far as I know, everyone in our party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. Pork and beef were the favorites.High chairs are available for toddlers and baby carriers.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2014,8/22/2014,51,77,6,7,4>I seriously thought this place was a Chuck E. Cheese type of establishment every time I drove by. I thought that I'd give it a shot since I was pretty sure my initial thought was wrong. I was way off!! This place is amazing! It has a nice laid back feel to it with even a couch and tv to just hang out. There's an ample amount of bottled craft beer handy for your enjoyment with whatever pizza that you decide to engulf. The pizza by the way, left me beyond satisfied. We had the barbecue pizza and while we waited for it to come out we tested our pinball skills on the Dr. Who pinball machine. The atmosphere, the kind people, the beer selection, and the awesome food... I could live here. Just let me live on the couch for a week. In the end, I think my Chuck E. Cheese idea was pretty dumb, yet it did make me feel like a kid again with how I was amazed that a place like this is right down the street yet I never gave it a better look.
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/25/2014,8/21/2014,74,230,3,6,3>After reading glowing review after glowing review for this place, I had to give it a try if ever in the area.  Today, I found myself nearby and after seeing Xerxes' picture of the JoJo, it was clear what I had to do.  I stopped in and sat at the bar area. It was around 2 pm, so the big lunch rush was over but there were still a few folks in there.  I ordered the JoJo with a side of fries and a drink.  The sandwich was as advertised: great.  Fresh bread with lots of steak, cheese, and some fries thrown on the sandwich.  The side of fries were good, as well.  I can tell that the folks running this place take pride in what they do. You can see everything behind the counter and the place was spotless, even after a busy lunch.  They were cleaning up after themselves constantly.  They were very nice and very attentive.  I did think that the lunch was a bit high overall, though.  The JoJo was $8.99, the fries were three bucks and the drink was two bucks. After tip it ran me about $18.    I know price is a relative concept but that's a little high for a sandwich and fries for my budget. So, I probably won't be a regular but I wish them the best of luck. The food, service, and overall experience were worthy of five stars.
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/3/2014,8/20/2014,298,491,7,9,5>Neptue's Park is the heart and soul of the Virginia Beach Ocean Front. Located beside the Hilton and off the boardwalk it is both a tourist and a locals attraction. I would consider it both safe and clean and feel it is a crowning jewel for the city.Parking is across the street in a parking garage and street parking if you can find it is metered. I would recommend the parking garage as our family has never had an issue and no worries on feeding the meter. There are also restrooms located off of Pacific. They are usually in great shape and applaud they city for their efforts.Our family is at this beach quite often. I would consider Neptune's Park to be broken down into three main parts. But as you will read I threw in kind of a forth.1. First you have the amphitheater just off Pacific which cranks out great music that is free. A nice grass lawn for throwing out a blanket and bringing a cooler of your favorite beverage on a nice evening is pretty darn awesome. Kick off your shoes and be ready to shake some booty. 2. Second you have the King Neptune Statue that people hang out around and take pics. If you have never seen this monstrosity it's HUGE!!! Great photo op place, don't miss the opportunity to pluck some random stranger off the boardwalk to take your pic so the whole  family is included.3. Third is the playground beach which is very small and designed for children 10&U. It's enough to keep the kids busy, especially the younger ages. Bring a bucket and shovel and the kids will have a ball for a long time.It is debatable I suppose if the Hilton's outdoor bar Catch 31 is part of the park. It is right off the boardwalk and a short distance from King Neptune and beside the amphitheater. It is an awesome place to hang and people watch, The fire pits are exclusive real estate. I find it  the best place to relax with a drink and listen to music with friends, or family.If there is negative it is the fact that such big crowds mob the park it can be uncomfortable at times. The bigger the crowds the less parking, the more difficult it is to move around. This is not all of the time, but most Summer and event weekends this tends to be the case. So a 1 star deduction for me.My family will continue to enjoy Neptune Park for years to come.  Whether your a tourist, or local I urge those reading this review to check this vibrant part of the beach out, it's pretty awesome!
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/3/2014,8/19/2014,23,129,,4,3>I came here for the second time ever on a lunch date back in March. The restaurant is located right across from the Greyhound bus station (a bit sketchy), but if you rotate yourself 90 degrees, it's also across from the downtown area/YMCA/metro (more safer looking).If you want authentic mediterranean/turkish food, this is the best around. The place is a small and probably fits no more than 20 people (think diner type seating). It is a simple setting, which I love because it means they are usually no frills, and their food speaks for themselves. You can order takeout or dine in. The cashier plays a double role as a server.My date ordered the grape leaves appetizer ($3.50), which were good. Warning: if you are a food adventurer who likes to order new food items with odd descriptors and foreign ingredients, avoid the ayran drink ($2.00). It deceptively looks like a regular lassi (yogurt-based drink in Indian cuisine), so you can understandably expect it to taste like one too. Nope. It is downright "OMG, what IS this?!" in a bad way where you don't want to swallow it, but spitting it back up would look rude in front of your date. I remember trying it myself the first time I came here and not being able to get past 2 swallows. My date ordered it this time around, and I watched as he cringed at its horrible taste and aftertaste. I took a small sip just to confirm that my first time wasn't a fluke...nope, it still had that horrid taste. I mean no offense to ayran drink lovers out there; I just feel that this is one of those items for people with acquired tastes.I ordered the lamb kebab wrap ($8.95) because I wanted to be able to sleep afterwards. My date ordered the lamb platter ($10.95), which was given in huge portions, and I don't know how he could have NOT slept afterwards. My lamb was cooked perfectly. My date also enjoyed his meal immensely. This is a perfect place to grab lunch during your lunch hour. You can also order it to-go on your way home from work for a full dinner meal.I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone working in the Ghent or the downtown area.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/2/2014,8/18/2014,28,86,2,3,3>I must add that this is currently my favorite bar in va beach (is that sad?) Even though they don't have any liquor, they have a crazy amount of beer (on tap and in bottles). Everytime I go here I try something new & am always impressed. The prices are crazy reasonable even if you don't make it for happy hour (we never do)  The bar itself has a trendy homey feel . When 9pm comes around I never want to leave (they need to extend their hours...or maybe I need to work there...)
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2014,8/17/2014,63,174,5,14,6>Fabio Rinaldi, one of Norfolk's premier Granby Street restaurateurs for 12+ years, has finally given up the ghost on downtown Norfolk and relocated his wonderful Sirena Cucina Italian restaurant to N Great Neck Road in Virginia Beach.  It's only called Sirena now, and resides in the much smaller space previously occupied by the iconic Beckett's Cafe, in what's referred to as the "Farm Fresh Shopping Center" by the locals.  But Mr. Rinaldi was able to keep the entire kitchen staff, and several of the waitstaff, in place for the move, and brought along just enough of the old restaurant decor to make his regulars feel quite at home, if maybe a little more cramped. The dinner menu is almost unchanged from the Norfolk restaurant, and Sirena will also make a new attempt at attracting the mid-day crowd with a new lunch menu of salads, limited pasta dishes and paninis. Rinaldi's wonderful menu samples every part of Italy except Tuscany;  a spicy, rich veal ragu served with house-made gnocchi is maybe my favorite of his pasta offerings, and the amazingly tender Saltimbocca veal dish --- prepared a la Rome, without any cheese --- is unbeatable.  And I'm never able to get away without a piece of the house-made Tiramisu, which I judge currently to be the best in Tidewater.So I think it was some time in 2011 or so that I first talked to a very frustrated Mr. Rinaldi about relocating to the Beach.  Now that he's finally made the move, he's picked a very convenient spot within a very short bicycle ride from my house.  And while my waistline and wallet may suffer a little from here on out, my palate will never have been happier.  Welcome to the neighborhood, Fabio, and you're gonna kick yourself for waiting so long!
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2014,8/16/2014,5,12,4,3,4>I don't come by often as i would like to, but this place after a long hot day on the beach and riding in on your beach cruiser to a hip and charming spot is something out of the coolest beach movies. The poke is always fresh and tasty... and the service is so friendly. I'm going to make it a point to visit often as possible this summer!
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2014,8/15/2014,34,46,1,8,5>Are you looking for the best BBQ no matter what style you like? Look no further Bubba's BBQ Bistro is the spot. Let me begin by saying this is not your typical BBQ place. You're not gonna see a pink pig welcoming you. This is a bistro. It's like BBQ and upscale dining had a baby. Don't get me wrong you're still gonna get that at home feeling, especially with the wood chip candles and mason jars. Not to mention the owners are always there making you feel like you're a regular even if it's your first time. But Bubba's can do no wrong in my books.  No matter the style you like there are plenty of options for you. This night I had the burger. Holy crap. Made from scratch, juicy and medium. Win, win, win. It was so big, I ended up taking half home. Oh, and don't even get me started on the fries. Cut from scratch fried up and delish. They even make their own sauces (ketchup and ranch included.) I wish my stomach was as big as my eyes because I'd totally have gone for the brownie sundae. But alas, I was too full. On other visits I've had their pulled pork sliders, brisket tacos and tried the ribs. I'm not joking when I say you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Def make the trip to go to Bubba's. I'm positive you won't be disappointed.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/21/2014,8/14/2014,21,28,5,9,5>FOR DAYCARE ONLY: This place is great.  I kind of want to hang out here with my dog.  The staff is genuinely interested in Roby and tell me how handsome he is (duh) every time I pick him up.  They have indoor and outdoor space, a pool, and staff who seem to give the dogs a lot of attention.Every time I pick my pup up from daycare they assure me that he is happy and well taken care of.  First, he is always exhausted.  Second, they mention something he did that day to let me know they pay attention.  For example: "he played with the big dogs today! his confidence is really improving!"  This is wonderful for me, because I always want to know how my best friend is and what he's doing.  The last time I picked my Robydog up, the owner, Jana, told me that she got some great pictures of him playing.  All I had to do was check out their facebook page and I saw my pooch in several pictures running with the other dogs and jumping with a crazy look on his face.  Nothing makes me happier.I do wish the prices were a little lower, but they are competitive with any other doggie daycare in the area.
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,8/13/2014,39,76,6,4,5>"My only worry is if the tide is gonna reach my chair."As a resident of VA Beach you learn the different atmospheres/vibe of the areas beaches. I live in the Ocean Lakes area so I have a choice of going to Sandbridge or Croatan. I personally love Sandbridge for its low key surroundings. Very clean. Families usually and no riff raff. Dogs are welcome year round as long as they play well with others and for heavens sake, scoop the poop!I travel down a bit to get away from the crowd. Usually near Pike Ln. I like this spot particularly because there is a small board walk that helps in the summer when it's 90+ degrees. Plenty of trash cans and a dog station with "poop" bags. Only complaint is that I wish it had a rinse off shower area....Plenty of free on street parking which is hit or miss. I love that I can come here with a book and just recharge my "batteries". Who can be unhappy @ the beach?!
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/1/2014,8/12/2014,66,117,8,5,4>Dive bar. Straight up,100% true blue collar dive bar. Mullets. Faded torn jeans. Tattoos. People that look like they hate life. People drinking cheap pitchers of beer. People smoking. SMOKING! Two pool tables with worn felt and warped sticks. A refrigerator behind the bar with a shelf full of jello shots. The back door propped open for some fresh air. The mens room door doesn't quite close all the way.  The urinal is placed too close for comfort to the sink without any kind of divider between them. The lighting in here is kinda dark and yet too bright in certain spots.What an awesome place. Slightly dirty, kind of questionable, but a place with character. And cheap drinks. Gotta love it.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/13/2014,8/11/2014,129,84,4,6,3>This place is great. I was working on a difficult plumbing project, got stumped, and Lowes was no help with PVC parts. I walk in, get immediate service, immediate instructions, and the parts required at better prices then the big chain hardware stores. A plumbing supply business owned & operated by plumbers. I needed a couple parts they didn't have in stock, and they gave me all the info on another business so I could finish my project. Recommended!

None of that canned stuff that leaves you wondering if  PETA is playing a trick on you because there wasn't any meat to be found. Nope, full on meat chunks in all their delicious glory. Not a drop left on the plates. I love that they offer a half plate for most things as well which is great when ordering for kids.The staff here is more than tops. Always super friendly and they are so kind with my kids. We love going here.I love supporting local businesses and the people (and food) at Hometown Diner make it easy!
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/7/2014,8/8/2014,118,112,5,7,4>I'm just going to start with... BEST PANCAKES EVER!I'm a pancake lover and the blueberry pancakes at Brandon Kitchen made me fall in love over and over with every bite.I don't know what magic they use to create such goodness but it's definitely good magic.I suppose this place is considered a diner, it is the cleanest diner I have ever been to! Really, it's the first thing my friend and I noticed when we walked in. They also have this breakfast casserole that came with my GIANT delicious omelet that was pretty stellar as well.Brandon Kitchen is a little out of the way for me and probably for most people but I highly recommend stepping out of your mile box to start your day off right with amazing breakfast.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2014,8/7/2014,99,254,1,7,3>One thing I wish I'd known before I went - Tables are shared with others and it gets loud fast. This isn't the place for a private or intimate conversation.Aside from that, it was a phenomenal experience. I ordered the bean and kale soup (vegan) and a salad. The waiter, John, who I also suspect may be one of the owners, asked if I was open to suggestions and recommended a different salad. (The green one, i think.) I'm so glad I listened to him because it was one of the best salads I've ever had. The ingredients were surprising and unexpected - arugula, fennel, mint, shredded apple, walnuts....it sounded a little weird to me. But it was spectacular with a balance of savory and sweet. The dressing was light and allowed for the flavor of each ingredient to shine through.The soup was - earthy is the best word I can think to describe it. It was hearty, savory, and delicious. They added a thick piece of grilled bread which soaked up a lot of the flavorful broth, but the way in which it was grilled allowed it to stay crisp. It was a really nice balance to the soup.One of the best aspects of the soup aside from its taste - there was a ton of it. I shared both my salad and my soup with my dinner date and still left stuffed.My date initially complained that his sandwich didn't come with a side (so it's worth mentioning for those who expect that sort of thing), but he was forced to acknowledge that the sandwich satisfied him. Sides are sold separately but they're very reasonably priced and are much more inventive than standard sides. It definitely ends up balancing out.Aside from the food being creative and delicious, the other tempting factor about this restaurant is that it's extremely affordable. I was shocked that our tab was so low. We went (accidentally) during happy hour and got a couple of beers, an appetizer, soup, salad and a sandwich for $38 (pre tip)So even though I didn't love the shared tables and the volume - the food, the price, and the overall experience are a 5.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2014,8/6/2014,62,168,4,9,5>We did this as a corproate outting with 40 people ranging from 23 to 60ish.  First, is the briefing and gear.  They did an excellent job with getting the harnesses on, fit and snug.  The part I liked was the actual demonstration portion.  They go through all the stations and explain what goes where, where hands go, etc... Plus you have to go through a little demo course to prove you heard what was said.  I felt well prepared as I started my adventure.The only small critique I had was I wish there was a sign at each station in the trees that gives reccomended tips for some of the more complex elements.  While walking across a board is pretty straight forward, placing your feet into free floating triangles can definitely cause some stress!  The obstacles were well maintained and are checked routinely for issues (courses were being closed/reopened throughout the day.  Yellow courses were reasonable for everyone that attended, green had some that required concentration, blue and black diamond is where things get real.  Oddly, the course is more punishing for people who are not average height (e.g. some obstacles are really tough for very short/very tall people!).  Double Black diamond I wouldn't reccomend for anyone but the most extreme, it looked positively terrifying haha.  All that being said, there wasn't a single moment where I didn't feel completely safe even as my foot was dangling off a slim wire.  Not only that, it was very amazing that with all the people there, there was nevery really any waiting to get onto courses!  This is definitely worth your time and one of the more unique experiences that Virginia Beach as to offer.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,8/5/2014,38,86,5,5,3>In my opinion, this restaurant is by far the best Mexican restaurant in Hampton Roads!  Plaza Azteca was great, but when they became a chain, their quality of food took a serious nose dive, which left me looking for a suitable replacement.  Enter El Rodeo.I wish I could actually explain the taste here.  *The chips and white sauce is bangin'!  They don't give you a lot, but definitely ask for more! *The food is bangin'! What do I recommend? Everything except the kids taco (didn't really like that, but 95% of the menu is on point! *The staff.. is bangin'!   They will definitely take care of you! I wish I could go into more detail, but the best thing for you to do is try it out for yourself.  Just DON'T ORDER THE KIDS TACO!  That was pretty bad!
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,8/4/2014,34,152,1,6,5>What a lovely place to go on a lovely day!  Make sure you plan ahead because it's gets busy!  Which is fine by me, I was greeted and helped tremendously by every employee and wasn't rushed when I couldn't decide between one or 21 donuts.  A friend told me you must eat them while hot, so I did, while still delish I do love them after they have cooled.  Different strokes for different folks!  My all time fave is peanut butter with peanuts omg! Then the cinnamon toast. Ducks Donuts and I are besties.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2014,8/3/2014,83,478,4,3,4>Ok. So it is time for an update. I can safely say I consider myself and my boyfriend a regular here. They know us by name, we know the servers by name, we have favorite tables, we order takeout a few times a week, etc. I've had brunch, I've had lunch, I've had dinner. It's all good. It's all fresh. It's legit.I absolutely love this place. It is my favorite restaurant in all of Hampton roads. I even like it more than Cheesecake Factory and that used to be my go to establishment for eating out. They have specials which are always changing that they allow their chefs to dream up and prepare and they are always phenomenal. They don't even have a microwave here people - that's how good it is. They make their whipped cream for dessert and lattes from scratch. How does it get better!!?  It doesn't. For brunch - their sweet potato biscuits and breakfast potatoes are delicious as are their cheesy grits. But they have yummy pancakes and waffles too. It's all good. At lunch I love their salads and like to get the half salad half sandwich combo. The half salad is a huge portion. I like the Monticello (greens, cranberries, carrots, apple slices, candied walnuts, bleu cheese and homemade balsamic dressing) or the Cuban (lettuce, chickpeas, cucumber, tomato, avocado, plantain chips for crunch and cilantro lime dressing) salads. But they're all good. For dinner - mmmmmm where do I start?  I personally love their starter BLT Naan bread pizza. I also love their BLT wedge salad which is a smaller portion as a starter/app salad but has homemade dressing and is yummy. I also very much like the veggie penne pasta dish which has tons of fresh veggies some amazing Parmesan cream sauce.  I really love the Back Bay Bistro Salad (arugula, mixed greens, tomatoes, cucumber, croutons, goat cheese and mustard vinaigrette). Their Back Bay Bistro Burger is amazing as is the Blackened Shrimp (cajun shrimp plus andouille sausage pilaf with creole sauce) Plus their brownie sundae dessert (huge brownie with caramel drizzle banana slices and ice cream) is soooo good. They bake it when you order so they warn you it takes about 10-15 minutes. Not to mention all the truffles and cupcakes and other goodies inside. Plus their coffee and lattes are the best I've had. It's probably that homemade whipped cream on top. We've also taken plenty of fresh food to go. Which is always packaged well and with care and have tried their to go frozen meals which heat up very well and taste fresh. Plus are easy to cook. The food is fresh and delicious - I've had fresh wheat bread samples at dinner with whipped butter as well as dinner special starters of sweet potato wedges with jalapeño dip (mmmmm), spring rolls, soups of the day and pulled pork dinner specials.  It's all good all the time. You can't go wrong. It's the truth. If you appreciate fresh food from an establishment that really takes pride in what they do. This is the place for you. If not - that's fine too bc that just means more for me! Shout out to my fav servers - Heather and Jordan. You two rock.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2014,8/2/2014,69,206,5,3,4>I've seen a lot of tepid reviews about the bar scene and nightlife side of this place, but I'm reviewing the service and food, both of which were stellar. We sat outside on a beautiful night and had some great people watching going on at the outdoor bar and fire pits. Our server was super friendly and immediately told us about the specials and had recommendations for us on both the food and booze sides. Both of my friends tried the mojitos, one pineapple and one mango - both were great! Not too sweet and definitely quality. I had a reliably easy vodka and soda and that's pretty hard to screw up. I will say they have an EXTENSIVE list of gins and vodkas. Love to see that. They had a good selection of oysters, so we started with a half dozen raw oysters and the calamari - both were great. The calamari is as expected, breaded and fried, but with a great breading and a good sweet chili dipping sauce to accompany it. For dinner we had the whole flounder (a special that night), the blackened mahi and the king crab legs. Entrees are pricey ($25-40 range), but you get a ton of food for the price and all of it was delicious. My favorite was by far the mahi - it was blackened with a bit of brown sugar and the sugar caramelized on it when cooked. Ermehgawd, so good. We stuck around to have dessert, I wish we could've taken it over by a firepit, but those things are choice real estate on nice nights and we couldn't seem to find an opening. So we stayed at our table and had the bread pudding and key lime pie. Both were very good - especially the bread pudding. I am already looking for excuses to drag my husband here and make him buy me that mahi.

They took sandwiches and put a Korean spin on them. The selection is great! They have everything from chicken wings to loren BBQW sandwiches to authentic meals.  Takes a while, been waiting almost 30 minutes however it was worth the wait. I will be back!
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,7/31/2014,35,98,3,5,3>Came here on a Friday evening and it was busy but luckily there was no wait.  If you ever came into this building before when it was a Chinese buffet, it has totally been transformed.  It is now modern, and very clean. At first I wasn't sure what to expect from an all you can eat sushi joint, but I'm so glad I gave it a chance.  You sit down and order anything you want off the menu for one set price.  We started with the gyoza, and seaweed salad.  Both were typical of a Japanese steakhouse. They were enjoyable but not amazing.  We then had the hibachi shrimp with white rice, which came as a small serving but it worked out since we wanted sushi after.  The veggies (broccoli, mushrooms, onions, and zucchini) were all fresh and cooked to perfection. Next onto the sushi.  One word: amazing!  I don't even remember the exact rolls we ordered, but they included soft shell crab,  shrimp tempura, something with crab and mango, and another with fried banana.  Everything was super fresh,  and flavorful.  Don't forget to not only tip your waitress, but also tip your sushi chefs.  They have a little jar on the sushi bar where they are working hard to make all of your intricate rolls.  I can't wait to go back,  especially because I can easily eat my way through a ton of sushi and for only $17, it's an amazing deal!
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2014,7/30/2014,263,519,4,9,9>My favorite new restaurant! Hands down! I stopped in here with Fred B. a couple of weeks ago. Being my first visit I had no idea they had recently moved into the location, etc... The owner Sean came out and greeted Fred and then introduced himself to me and we were quickly seated at a table. The facility is brand new and impeccably clean. When you enter you see a bar on your left and then booths, with the open kitchen in the back. Then there's another more general dining area on the other side, which is where we were seated. I decided to fully immerse myself in the culture of the meal and when it came time for drinks to be ordered I selected a Jamaican Kola Champagne which tasted like a creme soda. It was very good on a hot summer evening. After going over the menu I had a tough time narrowing things down. There are so many good looking choices here. I ended up selecting the Curry Shrimp with Rice and told them to make it hot. I have to say that I was not prepared for the steak platter of wonderful that appeared before me a short time later. There were I think 7 large butterflied shrimp on a bed of rice and vegetables. Folks this is food perfection and Sean is on top of his game. I ate every last bit of it and frankly being the glutton that I am could have had some more. You have to try this. When we were finishing things up I inquired about a lunch menu and the said that what they normally do for a lunch special is take one of there dinner entree's and make a lunch sized portion and price. That works for me. I haven't been back for lunch yet... But I will be... Soon.... Very soon...
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/5/2014,7/29/2014,29,248,4,7,6>Excellent pizza!We just went in on a saturday afternoon- they had a 10$ 14 inch pizza- any number of toppings-- SCORE! Joe patiently took our order and we chatted while Sean (?) made our pizza. Everyone was so friendly and our order was ready in under 15 min! The Pizzeria is a small location with 2 tables ( mainly a to-go/delivery place). Delivery is free with a 10$ min. Pizza- Our kitchen sink pizza ( a ridiculous amount of toppings) was AWESOME. The crust was light, cheese was enough and pizza wasn't too oily. Only thing i would change, is the crust. It was good, but could have been a bit crispier ( ill ask them to keep mine in the oven longer) :) . They sell standard pizzeria foods + local cheesecake from the caterer beside them. They've only been open 10 weeks, and i wont be surprised if this little place picks up pace, real fast.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,7/28/2014,108,140,4,7,4>Since I came from Kansas and had no idea how to deal with fresh seafood, it was necessary to find a friendly fishmonger so I could ask stupid questions that all the locals probably know. Welton's was the first place we found.We've learned how to clean the softshell crabs, how to make fried oysters, how to prepare fresh scallops, how to prepare all sorts of fish. Any question is greeted with an answer that doesn't make you feel stupid for asking. I shouldn't say this but they've done such a good job, I don't have to go there all the time to get my fish, teach a man to fish and all that. But, it is the place to go to get the best stuff.They take the time to make sure all your filets are the same size, your scallops are all perfect and the best way to prepare each fish you're purchasing. It always makes my day when my wife tells me she went out to Welton's. For my money, it's the best place to go. The product is fabulous and the service is somehow even better.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/27/2014,7/27/2014,34,86,2,7,3>My husband had never been to a hibachi restaurant. Upon discovering this, we decided to gather a group to go for his birthday, because who doesn't like dinner with a show? We were seated as soon as our entire party had arrived. When our grill area filled up (we were seated with one other party), our chef arrived and began doing his showman skills with spatula and knife. Everyone at the table ordered fried rice, so that was the first part of the meal prepared - let's just say that these chefs are pretty talented to be able to throw eggs around without breaking them. I ordered the flank steak, and it was cooked exactly how I requested. The vegetables were very tasty as well. I probably could have stopped eating after the fried rice, but everything just tasted so good!Overall, this was a good place to go for a fun dinner!
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2014,7/26/2014,80,30,9,10,8>Thank little baby Jesus for this place.  The first time I reviewed this spot, I was a Yelp N00B.  Now that I've taken Yelp Review 101, I wholeheartedly felt that this place deserved a more "chock full" review out of me.  Considering it is, indefinitely, one of my absolute favorite restaurants to eat at.  Jorge, the owner, is amazing for keeping this place alive and maintaining it's undying authenticity.  Now, let's get to the good part.  Shall we?So, as a creature of habit, I'm known around the office as one that "latches on" to certain restaurants.  Yes, I get a wee bit clingy.  This place and I started out pretty casual.  One of my tellers brought me here so we could enjoy lunch.  'Ugh, another cookie cutter Tex Mex joint,' I thought.  Boy, was I wrong.My first meal here was the tamales, along with rice and beans.  They had two types of tamales:  chicken and pork.  I ordered both, don't judge me.  Holy Moses, these things were the real deal.  Slathered with green tomatillo sauce, it was just like being woken up in the sweet Arizonian sunshine once again.Then, it got obsessive.  I started coming every single day.  Once, they let me try the Enchiladas Verdes.  Oh my god, freakin' heaven on sweet, little Earth.  However, the real chaser for me is their Carne Asada.  I like to order it will sautéed onions on top for the perfect juicy touch.  It comes with homemade rice and beans (not that junk from a can).One day, one of their veteran servers made me some horchata (bangin') and fresh pressed cantaloupe juice (ultra bangin').  Please, please, please, if you derive anything from this review, derive this: get one of these.  Dining on a budget?  Check in!  They'll give you a small horchata just for checking in.  And, dear lord, do not forget their "guacamole con queso fresco".  I did not even like guacamole before coming here.  But it's just so incredibly good.  Treat yourself to Jessy's.  Do it.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2014,7/25/2014,155,241,4,7,8>We've lived here for more than 2 years now and have driven past this place every single day. My husband, without fail, would say "I have no idea how that place is still here .. It looks scary." So when I suggested we try it out (based on the pretty stellar reviews) he hesitated. He actually said .. "Ok. But not today." hahaI don't know what changed his mind (from when he left the office to his drive back home) but this is where we ended up going for lunch. Walking inside, the place is pretty small and a lot cleaner than what you'd expect. They make everything to order so it does take a little bit of time if there are multiple orders in the que.Now I wasn't sure what to expect but I did hope that my fellow yelpers hadn't just outright lied to me about the goodness of this place. I don't know what they season the meat with but man-o-man that sandwich was TASTY! It has some serious flavor and my husband not adding salt and/or pepper says a lot. Great sandwich. We got the 12" and split it. Because I didn't think a measly 12" sandwich was going to do, I ended up getting 1 gyro, too. The meat was wonderfully seasoned and cut thick. It paired nicely with the veg and sauce. The only (very tiny minor) issue I had was the flat bread seemed to dwarf the rest of the ingredients. It seemed overly thick. Good flat bread. Weird balance.We also got an order of fries. Not much to say about them. Pretty standard fare. The one thing of note regarding the french fries was the sprinkling of kosher salt. That's good eat'n folks.So.. 1) Don't judge a book by it's cover, 2) Kosher salt works just as well on french fries as it does EVERYTHING, and 3) I have no idea what a Philly cheese steak is supposed to taste like but their version was bang'n!
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/20/2014,7/24/2014,70,154,4,6,4>One of my best go to Seafood restaurant. The staff is always so nice and friendly.For Easter Sunday there wasn't any wait so that was cool. But Has the she-crab soup change? I think they added to their recipe, this roasted garlic chips and it just didn't go well with the soup because your eating this chewy little bits of garlic. Anyways as always the food was delicious and the view relaxing.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2014,7/23/2014,21,240,4,5,9>I must confess, I am kind of a coffee snob.  There is no excuse for a bad cup of coffee.  I grind whole bean coffee, I weigh the amount of coffee, I use 190 degree filtered water, I use an aeropress and a timer...I drink good coffee.  Three Ships Coffee is awesome, a gift from the coffee gods.  I have tried several of their blends and was titillated by each one.  Each had is own unique flavor and characteristics, each was smooth, rich and aromatic,  each sip embraced my soul.  Three Ships Coffee is really cool, with their name tying  into local history, a great looking website and a creative instagram account... Oh, but the coffee, it is really really good, I am very happy to see a local roaster producing such a high caliber coffee.  Do yourself a big favor and seek out Three Ships Coffee and let them embrace your soul with some really kick ass coffee.
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2014,7/22/2014,121,268,3,7,3>Ok, I've been here over a dozen times and I am hooked! The food alone is worthy of a 5 star! Service is always great! Love the intimate atmosphere. Earlier I gave it a 4 based on the small screen rooms. BUT, if you get there 30 minutes early (which you need to do to truly get a chance to check the menu and order food)....you do not have a problem. I always get here 30 minutes early and I sit in my favorite seat (it's a secret...)...and I am good to go! It is my favorite place to go now!
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/31/2014,7/21/2014,166,132,2,6,2>This location for Surfrider  restaurant just opened! Yeah for the Chesapeake Square area.The location is great with plenty of parking. Great booth seats with comfy cushions. Great color schemes. The bar area is coming along nicely. The hostess was excited and her smile cheered us up. Our waitress knew what she was presenting. She knew the menu items and how to pair the appetizer with our entree for the best dining experience. She asked all the right questions to help us select our food.We started with a bowl of SheCrab soup, it was good. Moved on to Calamari,  it was excellent with a wonderful homemade marinara sauce.  Our entree was the Broiled Seafood Platter, it was amazing.  Tasty and plentiful. Cooked to perfection just like the menu said it would be. Yummers!We arrived later in the evening and saw many of our fellow foodies were already there. Cool! The service was amazing.  I will update this review with our waitress' name. Come, eat and enjoy! This location is a gem. The place was packed with happy people and they were not even serving alcohol until next week so you know the food was fabulous! I will come back and update this review. I am excited to see what will happen when they are finished with all the details. Woo Hoo!
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2014,7/20/2014,28,44,4,7,6>This place rocks! I grew up in Baltimore where having a snowball from the local snowball stand was a summer tradition. Since having moved to Virginia, I never really understood why the concept didn't have a following a bit further south. I drove by this place going somewhere else and knew I needed to stop in with the kids. Could this place really fulfill the nostalgia of my childhood? Later that day, the kids and I went for first time and I'm so glad we did. The service was super awesome, the snowballs were exactly like I remember from childhood, and the outdoor games for the kids were awesome! It was even better than the snowball stands of my childhood! Stop by, you will be glad that you did!
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/28/2013,7/19/2014,57,77,1,7,3>This place is quite unique in the fact that it's general location is somewhat "hidden" from the busier areas of Greenbriar.  However, when you manage to find it, I'm sure you'll notice the bit TASTE sign in front of the facility.  Not "Taste unlimited" but just TASTE.  Just like the idea of googling, I'm sure the idea was to create a verb for the whole "vibe" of eating here.First off, the facility.  It's a cheese/wine marketplace combined with places to sit in between.  It has a real rustic feel to it coupled with miscellaneous art on the walls that are for sale.  Very simplistic yet at times (lunch in particular) can get quite loud since the walls just echo all the noise.  However, as a lunch date or business lunch, this place is perfect.  The open atmosphere keeps things simple and not "over the top"Next up is the menu.  The menu is fairly simple - with vegetarian options to boot.  This (of course) is always the kicker for my reviews.  If my wife has to do significant "modifications" to the food, then it's not really aimable for her.  The vegetarian options are quite astounding.  Since TASTE emphasizes on sandwiches and lighter fare - this gives them a lot of flexibility on creating entrees to satisfy the vegetarian lifestyle.  As for myself, I was able to order a nice healthy turkey sandwich that wasn't sickly filling and was very fresh.  They were a bit light on the dressing and would've preferred a little bit more but overall simple and effective.  Take note that when you look at the menu, everything is ala carte.  So if you want chips to go with your sandwich, order away.There are beer/wine selections to the right when you enter the facility.  Take a moment to browse these as they seem to highlight a lot of local breweries and wineries.  I found the Alewerks beer from Williamsburg and was very delighted on how glorious the beer I had was.  I plan to visit there sometime soon.  =)The staff here must be told to highlight customer service.  There wasn't a single person on staff who wasn't eager to help or rather polite.  It's this type of service that makes many want to come back.Overall, this is definitely a simplistic favorite where the food and service shine.  The only recommendation I would ever give would be to potentially add some decorative sound deadening walls to help eliminate how loud this place can get during the busier hours.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,7/18/2014,30,37,2,9,2>What a great new addition to City Center! My Pi is located with an entrance inside the new Paragon 12 as well as an exterior entrance and you can take to-go orders home, inside the theater or to be enjoyed on the patio.  My Pi gives you plenty of "favorite" options for your personal Pizza combination or the option to create your own - ranging from $7.50-$9 these Pizzas are not only a great deal, but are enough food to be split comfortable by 2 people.  They also serve beer (served in to-go cups so you can enjoy at your movie)My Pizza was delicious and perfectly cooked, I know I'll be back again soon for my next pizza craving!
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2014,7/17/2014,34,79,11,10,4>AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW SHUCKS NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IDK how in the world I managed not to review this cute lil in the cut spot!So about 5 years or so I was invited to a going away party here. Got the address, put it in the GPS and got lost - beyond lost trying to find this place. Drove round and round and then I saw it in the middle of a shopping plaza thingy.I love this place so much! I've never had a bad experience with my food or the wait staff. It's not very big in here, so depending on when you go, you will be waiting. Especially if you show up late for brunch. I've never sat on the patio, although patio seating is really my thing - this patio is enclosed. They have an extensive mixed drink menu, I'm particularly fond of the grape nehi and another drink that is made with kalua and espresso. Typically I get the shrimp, fish or oyster po boy and BOY that roll is packed full of seafood-y goodness - YUMMY. Something else that is on my ALL TIME favorites is the Chesapeake Burger (y'all know I love a burger!) it's a jumbo cheeseburger topped with lump crab meat sprinkled with a 2 and a half dashes of old bay seasoning. A moment of silence, please. Okkkkk and I'm back! I get the hushpuppies and they are SWEET mounds of fried cornmeal deliciousness that are served with a sweet butter spread, LAWDAMERCY!!!!!!!! Please do yourself a favor and yelp your way here like soon.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,7/16/2014,83,62,5,8,7>I've been craving some good Vietnamese food since Pho Hung closed over the holidays, and from what I've been seeing from other Yelpers they've been talking about this spot. I finally got a chance to try it out for myself and I now I'm a happy fan.First thing's first, this place is nice - very nice. Not to knock Pho Hung and Jimmy but that spot was a dump. Albeit, that building already existed when Jimmy opened Pho Hung there, but it was a dingy spot. I didn't mind it because they kept it as clean as possible and they put out some awesome food. Van, the owner of Miss Saigon, put up a very nice spot that is seemingly clean in every corner. I can never complain about that and that just means I can sit back and relax.I got a vermicelli dish with egg rolls and pork, I believe. It was delicious and was prepared fairly quickly. To be fair when I came in there were no other customers but it's still nice to get your order quickly. But in regards to the food, it was delicious. I love a good rice vermicelli dish and this didn't disappoint.  Also, as a standard order I did have the spring rolls. It was fantastic. As for the staff, they are as nice as the building they're in. They're so nice that Vann's son is on point when it comes to service. There was another Yelper who talked about Vann's son in his review and I'm proud to back up his assertion that many adults out there could learn a thing or two from him. I didn't actually see Vann's son the first time out because I went during school hours but I took my parents here the following week and he was up and at 'em. He rocked a shirt and tie, was very polite and even coached my mom on how to eat the dish she ordered. He follows after his dad because he, too, is very polite, is great at conversation and tutored me on how to eat my rice vermicelli dish. And just to make me feel old and dumb, Vann's son is only eleven and he can speak both English and Vietnamese. English is actually his second languge... yeesh, haha.I've been here twice in a week and I have nothing but good things to say about this establishment. My search for a new Vietnamese spot is now complete, and if they keep up the outstanding food quality with the top-notch service then they'll be around for awhile... and I'll be there enjoying my vermicelli.  JV
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,7/15/2014,533,177,22,29,30>Yesterday was my first visit to Colley Cantina.  It won't be my last.I first noticed a cool decor with bright colors and great art work.  I then noticed the friendly staff and was greeted warmly.Alli was our server and she is great!  Friendly and on her game and also has a great sense of humor.Upon perusing the menu - I was taken aback.  There were so many great sounding dishes - I wanted to order 2 of everything and told Allii that and she asked what sides I wanted with that.Got the Calamari and it was beautiful and delicious.We got Fish tacos and Shrimp tacos and a dog wrapped in bacon.  All of the food was amazing and delicious and looked like it should be dipped in polyurethane and hung on the wall - a work of art.The beer was cold and there are a lot of choices.  I have now found a new favorite place to go have fun and great food and be surrounded by great vibes, smiles and cold ones.Oh - I can not finish this review without mentioning Christine.  First I noticed she had amazing ink.  Then I saw she had a great smile and personality.  The staff here is not only cool but they add a lot to the dining experience.I have added photos from my visit.  I hope to get more soon.  (food beer and photos)This place is a gem on Colley Ave!!
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,7/14/2014,13,167,10,12,6>I've been hearing really good things about this place and was pretty excited to get a chance to try out their pizzas.  I was there around 6PM so all of the bread and pastries were sold out - a good sign.  I imagine if you want some of their baked goods you better rise out of bed early.  On to the pizza ...If you're like me, you think most of the pizza in the greater Norfolk area sucks (aside from Cogan's - but they are hit or miss).  In steps in these guys with their fancy schmancy wood-fired brick ovens coupled with their organically friendly mom and pop style service.  How dare you tempt the area's hips and thighs with your bangin' ass pizza pies!?I had the 10" pepperoni and it was perfect for one - though I could envision the larger sizes on a more gluten-ous day (see what I did there?).  The crust was excellent.  Kinda chewy, kinda burnt and rustic, kinda awesome.  The cheese, sauce, and pepperoni were certainly muffin to shake your head at.  I'm on a roll.Can't wait to return to try some of their other stuff.  A very welcome addition to Norfolk.  Thanks to places like this, we are getting cooler by the minute!  You knead to come here.  Had to get that last one in.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/7/2014,7/13/2014,62,212,,4,3>People say this place is off the beaten path...but if you are down in Sandbridge, it's actually off the main road leading in to the beach front community. It is unsuspecting though. You wouldn't think much of it if you based your opinion off the way the building looked, but once you get inside and sit down, you'll see why this place is liked by so many. There are lots menu options but the best option (in my opinion) is the Tidal Wave. It's basically a HUGE platter full of snow crab kegs, steamed and spiced Shrimp, mussels, oysters, clams, scallops, crab cakes, fish fillets, french fries, oh..and broccoli. There is a minimum of 4 people for this, but they can accommodate up to 100 (according to the menu). It is $29.99 per person, but there is so much food and it's fresh and tasty. I wish I had worn my sweat pants. The four of us chowed down until we couldn't chow any more. There was still so much food leftover, I felt bad letting it go to waste. Next time we go, we are bringing 2 more people and ordering for 4 (apparently you can do that).
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,7/12/2014,100,82,6,7,5>I usually try to come here at least once or twice a month. I've been here a long time ago when they didn't have the extension. I've seen this place come a long way and it's one of the hottest pizza spots in VB! I usually come here at night after work around 9-midnight. This place closes at 3 AM great for those who need their late night pizza cravings fulfilled. I love getting the deluxe garlic knots & cinnamon knots for appetizers (even though it's dessert hehe). Their fries are delish too! For pizza: their brothers specialty pizza and spicy chicken ranch always hits home. I've tried their very spicy inferno sub. It was packed with tons with jalapeños and cheese so good! But definitely had to recuperate after that one.If I just want a slice, I do their 2 slice special (I believe it does come with a drink) but I usually get water. I always get either the spinach, steak, or eggplant. I never stray from these.This place has happy hour everyday starting at 4! I haven't gotten a try since I come too early too late for it. Brothers is a family owned place. Everyone that works here is familiar for the most part. I always get the same servers and their very nice! There will be days will it may be a little busy and they can't attend to you right away but this place for the most part is overflowing with business and should be continued to be supported. Their crust is simple and something about how they prepare their dough should be kept a secret for everyone to enjoy. It's reminiscent of New York style pizza with a VA twist. I love it! And will be a costumer for life here at Brothers!
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2014,7/11/2014,124,171,5,6,7>Easy going...chillaxing.  I attended the festival on Friday and Saturday.Now Friday in my opinion is for those that want to attend but without the hustle and bustle of the crowd, traffic, and long lines for food.  But that takes the fun out of it all.If you are like me, I love crowds and energetic folk just walking around living life with huge smiles on their faces!!!  Now that's a Boogaloo just waiting to happen :)Saturday's festivities were in full swing.  I arrived about 6pm and it was already crowded...loved it!!I was super lucky to find parking on the street so parking costed me... zero coins/dollars!!  However, if you are unlucky they do charge $5 for event parking in the surrounding parking garages.Don't forget your lawn chair, blanket or cushion because if you aren't lucky to grab a seat on one of the 10 or less benches in the park you are gonna wanna sit at some point.  Now unless you are a party hearty person and don't mind walking around and grooving the entire time...no seat is needed (I didn't need a seat either :))I was lucky to snag VIP tickets for this event ($75 per person).  Even though I didn't pay for them (I won them through a Yelp Contest...go me!!!!) it was well worth it!  If you plan on drinking and eating...then VIP is the way to go!  The ticket included: entrance into the park, enhanced views of the main stage, complimentary drinks (beer, wine and a southern comfort drink...unlimited), finger foods and snacks (fried fish, hot sausages with peppers served on a bun, spicy rice, hushpuppies, chips...unlimited), large tent, stand up tables (very few), limited seating, and a private restroom trailer.  The works pretty much.  I left the festival full and happy!!!Music acts performed on 2 stages.  However, I only saw acts on the main stage and they all were great.  There was even a parade of umbrellas that marched through the lawn audience...so awesome!! From the looks of people, they had a great time!  Some more than others...dancing out of their seats, dancing with the children and some folk right in front of the stage with their drink in one hand and the other hand in the air...just grooving to the sounds!!There are vendors from all over that come out to this event.  Some vendors are more expensive than others...but it's a festival so just keep in mind to spend wisely.They have activities for the children.  Also the Rad Hatter was there...everyone (all ages) came to the tables and decorated their own hat (paper bag) and wore it proudly (so did I)!!I really enjoy this festival every year.If you love good music, a good time, good eats...you should definitely stop on in.  Tickets are $10 but $20 for a 3 day pass (Fri-Sun).  Also if you go on Friday before 5pm it is free...money saver indeed!Have fun!!
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2014,7/10/2014,57,40,1,10,2>My second time here and it's still great as my first!!  It gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait for about 30 minutes or so depending how big your party is.  The wait isn't bad though considering the amazing food you are about to consume.  While you wait you could always hang out by the bar area and grab a few drinks.  The drinks are strong and awesome!  I think I had two drinks while waiting and I enjoyed both of them.  It is strong by the way so be careful in how much you drink.  I ordered the Pique a Lo Macho for my meal.  Beware!  It is spicy for those that are sensitive to spicy foods.  No worries though!  They have a mild version of it as well to satisfy your taste buds.  The steak was cooked to perfection!!  It was cooked to my liking, and it was tender and juicy!  Save room for dessert because you have to try the flan!!  I'm picky with my flan and I love their version of it!!!  It has the perfect consistency and it has a vanilla taste to it.  It just melts in your mouth and I would honestly just come back to eat it.  I would definitely come back and try their tomales next time or maybe something different.  I could see myself coming back here again in the next few weeks again.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/14/2014,7/9/2014,96,146,3,6,4>Well the time came and I got to have a taste of this location. Sure it was during restaurant week , so keep that in mind during my review. The location itself is very nice inside, lots of space, private rooms, clean, and will kind of shock you when you walk in with how large it is. The service was very good, considering it was very busy , it took about 45 mins for our food to be plated after ordering off the restaurant week menu, much like every one around us was. Minor hiccups included not being asked if we wanted something besides water to drink but again, it was very busy. The food , each item, from the lumpia to the wedge salad, to the Cheesy grits tasted wonderful. Hearty flavors that I was very happy to consume. I came with 3 of my co workers and they also enjoyed themselves and said they would be back. As my main dish i ordered the braised short rib, the portion was very very tiny, don't get me wrong... i know its restaurant week, but this was like... a 2 Bite portion... maybe, That being said, the flavor was excellent, it was fork tender, but for me the highlight was the cheesy grits that came with it. I also sampled some other items, the Fries,  someones roll... all tasted great. The main thing I took away from this lunch is, I want more. This is the whole point really to go, experience a taste of it and come back for seconds. I shall be back to this location for a full size meal and expect it to be excellent.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2014,7/8/2014,11,53,,4,3>Love Sandy bottom. Its in a good location off of Hampton Roads Center park way. You can picnic, kayak, canoe, paddle board and many more out door activities. Kayaking is about $4 for an hour and totally worth it. They also have play grounds and an indoor nature information center with some of the local insects, snakes and various other animals/reptiles from around the lake/park area. If you have little ones I totally recommend for a little outing.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/24/2014,7/7/2014,171,233,1,9,2>-3.5 Stars-Ramen in Hampton Roads. It's sad that it's such a new concept when there's tons of diversity in the area. I gotta admire the guys at Alkaline for pushing this thru and I think the way they go about it is pretty clever. Pop-up restaurant! This is usually the kind of thing you see on the Food Network, but we have our very own pop-up restaurant going on. This one is at the Cutting Edge by Sam's Club. My family and I tried this place out right when it opened for the night since I hear the place fills up quickly. We get seated at a long table and our waitress gives us a heads up that she might seat some more people at our table since there's room. A couple did end up sitting at the other end of the table, but we had a healthy distance so it didn't feel like they were intruding. Menus are served on clipboards covered in cartoons/anime. My little bro enjoyed reading that. There's some music that plays in the background and normally, I wouldn't comment on it. This place had some screaming type music going on at times. Just not my cup of tea.Our waiter knew we were new to this whole concept and gladly explained how everything works. He did a great job describing the food to what we knew i.e. the fish cakes are comparable to crab cakes, etc. After watching tons of restaurant improvement shows, I can say he did a great job "selling the food." We'd order an entree and he'd make sure if we wanted to get an appetizer with it or not.Food.-Fried Congee: Probably my favorite app of the night.It's fried, but not oily and pretty light food. The sauce comes with a kimchi marinara that can be on the spicy end, depending how you handle your spiciness.-Smoked Fish Cakes: It is like a crab cake, but instead of crab, there's tilapia. I wasn't a fan of this one. After biting it, you do get a sense of spice building up in your mouth for a while. Maybe I'm not big on the whole smoked aspect?-Ramen! I got the tonkotsu/pork broth with additions of pork belly and soft boiled egg. Here lies why I'm not giving this place 4-5 stars... My ramen noodles felt like they needed to be cooked longer. The pork belly I got tasted like char. Again, maybe I'm just not cut out for these smoked items. My broth tasted almost too salty. Overall, I kept comparing the Ramen to my experiences with Pho and I was missing the Pho. I think I will have to try a different broth the next time.I think there's some great promise to this place. It's a new concept in the area and a great alternative to Pho places if they fine tune some stuff. Maybe some food aspects would be way better if they had their own permanent place to develop it more. I really hope more places like this push the envelope in providing a greater variety of food in the area.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,7/6/2014,114,446,2,4,3>My favorite place to get a cake or desert. Their almond cake is the BES! But everything else is wonderful! I love the cream filled horns!  Cookies rock!  Everything I've had is great! Usually crowded but all that means is that they are scrumptious! Yum, yum, YUMMY!
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2014,7/5/2014,105,151,,4,2>I'll be the first to tell you that I'm a big Reginella's fan. Sure there are downsides to the location; it's can be a bit noisy inside and it sports an open kitchen, but I think that adds to the "divey" goodness of this spot. Vinny runs a great little joint here and the food is very good.I frequented this place so much that when I decided to get married about seven years ago, I chose Reginella's as the place for my rehearsal dinner. Both of our families really enjoyed the dinner and the service was phenomenal also.If it's dinner time when I come I like to get the spaghetti carbonara. That is one of my favorite Italian entrees and they make a very tasty one here. If it's lunch time I find myself ordering a chicken parmesan sub. I could eat this sandwich over and again. It's done very well and the chicken parm itself is delicious! It's hard to find good Italian, but this is one of my favorites in Virginia Beach. Give it a try!
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2014,7/4/2014,50,105,4,4,5>We came back after a brief absence from the area to get our Filipino food fix, and it was as yummy as I recall.  I had pancit and sinigang (a beef and vegetable soup) which totally hit the spot, as I'd been feeling ill lately.  My DH had adobo and SPAM fried rice, which was the bomb. I was so jealous I'm thinking about going back for spam fried rice tonight :-)Mariam's - you still rock!
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,7/3/2014,55,131,2,7,4>In Hawaii there is Tango, in Virginia there is Dish. I had this great idea that we should go check Dish out after I read on their menu that they had pea soup, not that I wanted to eat it .. but I figured that any restaurant that would put pickled herring and pea soup on their menu is worth a visit. We went on Good Friday, so the place wasn't crowded at all. Was seated right away and started guessing who were Swedish or not. We started off with their Skagen which is shrimps, onions, dill, sour creme mixed and served on a lightly toasted piece of bread. It was delicious! For main course we decided on Tunnbrods rulle, a wrap filled with mashed potatoes, hot dogs (with crispy skin) ketchup and spicy mustard. On the side there was a little bit of "boston gurka" which is basically a Swedish relish. If you have ever been to Sweden, or know anyone from Sweden, they will talk to you about the Tunnbrods rulle, mainly because it is so freaking good. It is yummy, filling, messy ... basically everything that a meal should be.  We decided to not to dessert this time, because we were both pretty full. But they looked pretty good from what we saw. The service was great, the food was great, the Swedish-ness was great .. AND they sell Swedish things in one corner of the restaurant, perfect for those days when I am craaaving Swedish candy.
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/24/2013,7/2/2014,119,199,7,3,8>Due to a scheduling glitch, the Holiday Speed Dating Event in Suffolk was postponed until sometime in January, leaving me some time on my hands.  In an effort to better my odds at the Speed Dating Event, my self-inventory of strengths and weaknesses showed a glaring weakness in 'Cultural Awareness.'  I'd heard about this fancy new venue smack dab in the middle of Virginia Beach, why not give it a try?  A quick look of their website showed that I was in luck, tonight they were having a special Karaoke Christmas Event, an outfit called Handel doing their Messiah Sing-Along.  That DJ name rang a bell, maybe I saw him at a dive bar in Hatsboro during their Karaoke night.  In any case, it was free and open to the public, plenty of free parking in the garages surrounding in Town Center, what's not to love?  A warm and dry place to hang out while listening to the locals sing along to 'Don't Stop Believing' and other chestnuts.The Sandler Center for the Performing Arts is a gorgeous, well planned out venue implemented perfectly.  If anything is confusing in the slightest, the well trained staff is there in abundance to lift the fog and get the patron on his merry way.  Since this was a free event without tickets, I asked one of the vest adorned guides if there were any particular seating restrictions.  In return, she asked me if I was a Bass or a Tenor.  Not wanting to appear as some sort of culturally deprived surf punk, I smiled and said, 'Yes.'  Screw it, I'll figure it out for myself.  Upon entering the main hall itself, one cannot help but pause for a second and take it all in.  To see this majestic venue, high wood adorned ceilings, comfortable and inviting seating, perfect acoustics, located right here in the middle of Town Center, less than 10 miles away from the Alien Pod Dropped from Space known as Scope, well, let's just say that serious progress has been made in the last 20 years or so.If there are any complaints at all, chalk it up to 'stranger in a strange land.'  Through my travels, I found that every place has their own rules for Karaoke Night, Sandler Center is no different.  I couldn't find The Book or slips of paper where I could jot down my song selection and name, nor could I see the sign saying who was up and who was up next.  My guess is that all of this is somehow taken care of well in advance, because when the band came to take their seats (yep, this was the real musician brand of Karaoke.  I'd call it Rockaoke but I think that may be a registered trademark), there were also extra chairs in front for 4 regulars:  Billy BY, Robynne R, Frederick B, and Andrew P (I love how nobody on Yelp has last names! ) who were in heavy rotation by DJ Handel.  No big deal, though, because they nailed it!  I really wanted to sing along to 'Rejoice Greatly, O Daughter of Zion' and 'O Thou That Tellest Good Tidings' but it wasn't in my key and I didn't hear anybody else singing along.  Maybe that is another house rule or something.  Towards the end of the Karaoke Night, Handel must have felt sorry for us so he had his assistant get us to all stand up and sing a song together.  No words were projected on the screen or anything like that, but I did see that a good share of the locals brought along their own songbooks, I'll remember that fact the next time so I don't stand out so much.  In my personal opinion, though, 'Don't Stop Believing' fit perfectly with those Hallelujah things that everybody else was warbling.Armed with the cultural knowledge that is Sandler Center for Performing Arts, Speed Dating Night at the Suffolk Comfort Inn and Suites may never be the same....
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,7/1/2014,31,70,1,6,6>A legend. Best dogs & chili in town. Any local can tell you that Tony's is THE Dog Place! Hotdogs, soda, coffee, & chips. That's it. And here's a little advice: Never, ever, ever, ever, ask for ketchup on your dogs! You will promptly be directed to the closest Hardees. Dogs are rolled on the grill by hand. Payment is by cash only. The kind of dogs that snap when you bite them! Best hotdog chili...no comparison!They are somehow related to the Tony's on Lafeyette in Norfolk. I believe a divorce settlement resulted in a one for you and one for me deal.
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2014,6/30/2014,77,61,,5,2>I had the pleasure of volunteering here and am happy to see that another great trail exists in Hampton Roads. I was actually a little confused because you have to go through some residential areas to get there, but it is quite spacious and secluded where it is.This site covers about 140 acres, unless I am misquoting, so it's pretty spacious for a good walk through nature. There is a 1 mile trail that circles a lake (Lake Ballard). There is all kinds of wildlife that resides in this watershed area, but I wasn't able to see much of it since we are still on the tail-end of winter. It also has a some shoreline, abuts a creek, has 5 trails, and hosts some seasonal kayaking. I also noticed that they have a pavilion, which I assume can be used to host an event or gathering, but that is an assumption.I highly recommend stopping in to check this venue out. I know I will be making some more appearances as the weather gets better.
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2014,6/29/2014,64,171,6,5,2>Indian food is my favorite.OK, food is my favorite.Yesterday was my Birfday.  Please don't everyone bombard me with Happy Birfdays at once.  I keed.  I keed.I decided to treat myself to Indian "boofay" at Rajput in Norfolk.  Since I was considerably impressed by the "boofay" in Suffolk, I said "eff" it" and stopped in for a bite.....or 238 bites.Two plates worth of deliciousness.I had to dig around the buffet bowls a bit for the chicken, but it was really good.  They had lentils on the line which I have yet to see in Suffolk.  They were outstanding over the rice.  Like melt in my mouth goodness.Only complaint is that I really wish the norm for buffet food was extra super duper spicy.  Come on people! Put your big girl panties on!
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/10/2014,6/28/2014,79,115,,6,2>My boyfriend and I were in the mood for some Greek food, so we opted to try this place out since we are typically in the area. It wasn't busy at all, and we were able to place our order right away. We both got the original gyro platters with potatoes. The food was good, but not better than other Greek restaurants I have been to. Although the lamb was cooked to perfection, it was served in much thicker slices than I am used to. Both the potatoes and lamb were also very greasy. Their tzaziki sauce was more watered down. I did like their salad with feta cheese, my fave (although I wish the cheese was crumbled up). The waitresses were nice. This place has so much potential! This was a quick visit, nothing too special. I'm not sure if I would come again, but the food was good for the price.
<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/28/2014,6/27/2014,129,351,1,7,4>Being a whiskey connoisseur and a foodie it didn't take much convincing for my wife and I to meet friends at Whiskey Kitchen / gastropub. Ambiance: Décor is a modern rustic with plenty of seating inside and out making it a great place to meet friends for a drink. Bar: I was hoping that being a whiskey bar they'd have a good choice of whiskey, scotch and bourbon with my personal whiskey favorite (at least for last few months) Dalwhinnie...but no. In fact the whiskey selection wasn't much more than what can be found at a good quality restaurant in Hampton Roads and less when compared to similar liquor specialty bars like 80/20. I actually don't remember seeing some mainstay favorites of whiskey lovers like Jameson, Tullamore Dew or Scotch's like Laphroaig, Macallan, Glenfiddich. However, they did have Hudson, which I settled on and a few whiskies that were new to me. That said if you're a beer drinker, which I'm not, I think you'll be pleased because it seemed to me they had a larger variety of beers than whiskey. Service: I can't comment on how long the wait would've been for a table because the others were already seated when we arrived. What I can tell you is that despite the place being full our server kept checking on our table and was very professional. Even when our group finished our meals we weren't rushed off. Everyone felt comfortable staying seated and enjoying a few drinks together. Meal: The menu is a little limited, which would be fine if they mastered everything on the menu but that wasn't the case. It was average Burgers with a good Chimichuri Steak. Cleanliness: Good. In spite of the large crowd the tables and chairs/booths were wiped down and restrooms clean. Overall: This is a great choice to meet for casual conversation, watching a game or just getting drinks. However if you're coming for dinner or whiskey's you could be a little disappointed. I know it's a new gastropub and will improve over time but for now it's just A-OK so I give it 3 Stars.
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/28/2014,6/26/2014,163,183,1,7,2>Spankin' New! Shiny, clean reclining seats! Oooo! Ahhhhh! Beware, seating are assigned, so grab your tickets wayyyy early to get the "love seat" chairs with foot rests and tray tables. Price is about average (11bucks - 14.50 for 3D films), if you get it online there's also a dollar surcharge. They offer Military, Student and senior discount though! Oh and $8 matinee. They have 2 large screens and the rest are your typical small theater style. They do NOT serve you at your seat, so its up to you to grab your booze at the NEO bar or your popcorn stuffs at the concessions. Free parking across the street, also fills up pretty fast on weekends. Aside from that, nothing really special here, just another theater. Good quality dolby sounds and movie started on time. Oh, one cool thing, they show you the trailer start time and when the lights will dim from the board near the concessions. So you know how much time you have left to run to the restrooms before heading to your seats.
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2014,6/25/2014,76,81,,6,3>My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place! We came here for lunch, during restaurant week, but looking at the prices, it's not that much different. For our appetizer we ordered the Asian chicken noodle soup and the oysters! The oysters were fantastic! The sauce was so good, I wanted to get another order. The Asian chicken noodle soup was good too! It was so flavorful, and had a ton of ingredients, which my boyfriend loved. As for our entree, I ordered the smoked pork belly sandwich, and he ordered the Korean BBQ sandwich. I thought my sandwich was Better than his, but both were very good. I must add that the fries that come with the sandwiches is really good as well! I love how this place has a twist on Asian dishes! We are definitely excited to come back and try other things.

We had passed it a few times in the past month when we were in the area & one of his coworkers had recommended it before.  I'm happy we stopped in!We were the only ones around 2 besides some patrons sitting at the bar, more people started coming in around the time we left. Our server greeted us with a smile & told us to sit wherever we would like. He immediately asked if we would like a margarita. He must have been a mind reader ;-). I ordered a jumbo on the rocks with salt & my bf was pleased to see El Guapo on tap. Chips & salsa/white sauce were then brought out & the salsa was fresh & tasty. They have a large menu, but I was craving my usual order of chicken chimichangas. Mine came out in a cool little ball of carbs, cheese, & chicken. MMM yum. My boyfriend went with a burrito that was ginormous. He shared a bite before scarfing his down, & the shredded pork in his was super tender. They have daily lunch specials til 3pm & daily happy hour til 7pm. I love this & get annoyed when other places don't have the same specials on the weekends. This 9-5'r loves a deal too ya know!Good job Guads!!

I had the braised duck in beer which had a great taste but be careful of the bones. My husband had the pepper lamb stir fry which was amazing. We will be back to try more on the menu. I loved that they had so many options and the staff was very helpful in helping us choose our food. This place is definitely off the beaten path but it is so worth the trip.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/21/2013,6/19/2014,22,99,2,7,3>Tonight, I was in the mood for having some Chinese food, as I haven't done it in a while.  I had heard about this place opening a few weeks ago, so I decided to give it a try.  I was not disappointed here.The ambiance is definitely more upscale, but the prices are not for the food.  The dining area was very inviting.  I didn't really know much about this Peter Chang until I came in tonight.  Seating was immediate, but that was likely since I got there around 5 pm.  After the meal, the place was full.This place is definitely different from any other type of Chinese food place I've been.  This is definitely a more authentic Chinese restaurant.  Many other Chinese restaurants in the area, as indicated by others, is "Americanized", while this place was not.  Everything was completely fresh.For an appetizer, I started with the spring rolls, after confirming there were no mushrooms in them (I have an allergy to them).  They came out in just a few minutes and they were very good.  You could taste that they were freshly rolled and cooked..  This is a far cry from the quick-serve Chinese restaurants, where they seem to have been pre-purchased and just cooked as ordered.  For the entree, I had the General Tso Shrimp.  This entree was delicious.  The meal comes with your choice of rice as well.  This entree was really good.  The Tso sauce goes very well with the shrimp and broccoli and that also comes with it.  When I first got it, I thought it was small, but quickly realized it was larger than I thought.  There were ten jumbo sized shrimp.  The only thing I think they could do better was that the entree wasn't that spicy, and I like things on the spicy side.  :)I also learned a few things about this Peter Chang, who was actually in the restaurant tonight.  I found out that Peter Chang's "home base" is going to the be location here at Landstown, so he'll be at this location more than any of the others.  Also, he is planning to open three more restaurants in this area as well, including at Town Center Virginia Beach.I would definitely recommend that you try this location out.  I will definitely be back.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/24/2014,6/18/2014,509,292,1,7,6>I am in love with this place. My girlfriends recently held a surprise birthday party for me at Mermaid Factory and I could not have asked for a better day. Its like one of those places you paint pottery, sans the pots and kiln. Its Mermaids only. They have paint, glitter, sand, rocks, shells, moss, you name it, they have it so you can customize your own undersea princess. Everything dries extremely fast, so you walk away with your mermaid the same day, in a nice box, packaged perfectly. My friends were able to set up a table with hor d'oeuvres, cake, WINE and we had our own little private party while letting our creativity flow. Its $22 per person. All the extras are about $.50-$1.00 each so you end up spending about $30 after its all said and done. I loved the way mine turned out and since I am slightly obsessed with mermaids, I will probably go back to paint and add to my collection. The girls that worked there were really helpful and its in Ghent, so ill take any excuse to spend time in that neighborhood. Not only did I walk away with a fantastic piece of my own art, but I bought a few pieces of mermaid memorabilia for my daughter and Christmas tree. They sell REALLY cute stuff! Absolutely recommend this place if you have nothing to do or want something different to entertain.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,6/17/2014,37,327,,4,3>We like frozen custard.  Found this place when we moved back to the area a few years ago.  They make the 'concrete' which is a base flavor and toppings mixed in.  You can also just get a flavor and toppings on top.  It's all outdoors, but they have a drive through.  We hadn't been in awhile and I will say this last visit the custard was different.  More air perhaps?  But we like the outdoor feel, and the staff are all very friendly.  Mostly teens.  We aren't as close to this place as before, so don't go as often.  But if we like it.  I just hope we had an off day this last visit or I will change my review. Until now it's been amazing!
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/3/2013,6/16/2014,31,57,5,4,4>Oh handsome biscuit, however am I to rate you less than a 5...It's been a long road coming to try this place out. It has been talked, pointed, and planned and the day finally came!On a nice cool Tuesday afternoon, me and the lady walked all the way here. We were ready to try what our eyes have feasted with Yelp pics and the house made sodas.The first up, the Dill Na Na ordered by the bday lady! Nice frittata in a strata (they call it egg), dill mayo, clumps of arugula and just deliciousness all around topped and bottomed by delicious sweet potato biscuit! Brunch party in mouths!!Second in line, Mr. Close Love may just make love in people's mouths...uhhmmmm.. Roast pork (shoulder), mustard, and a cucumber between two sweet potato biscuits to "hold it." This was pretty damn good, something about it made me want to order it even when not the hugest fan of mustard. The roast pork was just delicious, cooked well and soft!So, they accidentally messed up when there. I'm pretty chill about those things, and the guy approached us with a cookie apologizing for the mistake before I even realized there was something wrong. Besides all the other service, this topped the amazing service. The cookie had nuts, I hate nuts, but damn did I munch on it because of the ooey gooey chocolate ways that cookie had.This place was delicious!

I'm not the type of woman who apologizes (mostly because I'm a woman and am always right), but in this case, I owe you one.I'm so sorry for not stopping by sooner.It shouldn't have taken an appearance on Diner's, Drive-ins, and Dives for me to notice you, but I'm glad it happened. Your french toast was amazing. Truly. & the fact that the super-friendly server was more than happy to tweak our orders to our exact specifications (signature citrus glaze on the side, extra strawberries, etc) - well, it made the wait completely worth it.I guess what I'm trying to say is... we should get together again. Sometime soon.Love,Amanda
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2014,6/14/2014,43,132,,9,2>Get your doughnut fix. Their gourmet selections were $1.39. The choices when I went included Samoa, black tie, maple glazed with bacon pieces, red velvet, blueberry cream pie, apple pie, and more. You can watch them make doughnuts through a large window. They continually make fresh doughnuts. If you buy a $14.99 shirt, you get 20% off every time you wear it. If you buy one of their mugs, you get 30% off refills. There is ample seating with 4 tables of 4 seats, 2 club chairs, and a counter with 5 stools. I'll be back soon.
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,6/13/2014,91,52,3,5,4>When my friend told me that they had the best fish tacos he's ever had, I was skeptical. So, he piqued my curiosity, and here am singing similar praises. They had a couple options for their fish tacos. They had a baja fish taco (the one they're famous for), which has beer battered fish, a habañero sauce, and salsa. This fish taco is the king of fish tacos. It is no surprise that people will go out of their way to get this thing. They also had a mahi fish taco, which honestly blew my mind more than the baja. The mahi fish taco wasn't on the menu, but I'm REALLY glad I got it. I have seriously been craving it since I left. The spot itself is pretty small. Tables of 4 are about the max, but when you're eating these tacos you might even forget you have friends. The wold is in that tortilla.
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2014,6/12/2014,121,170,,11,5>The Dirty Buffalo is starting to grow on me!  I've been here quite a few times and I'm happy that things are going well for this restaurant.  Their wings are better than good; I would say amazing. On the last trip, I had 12 wings - 6 Sweet Sriracha and 6 Garlic Parmesan.  The Garlic Parmesan wings have quickly become one of my favorites. It's more like a glaze than a sauce and finished with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.  I think grating it fresh might take it to the next level.What would I like to eventually see at The Dirty Buffalo? I'm looking forward to an expanded menu, more wing sauces, more beers on tap; I would even love table service.  With the business The Dirty Buffalo is doing, maybe we can expect these additions at their new location?
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2014,6/11/2014,334,138,7,8,7>Oh my goodness!!!!!!! I had the pumpkin patch and I must say it was perfectly delicious !!!!! Wow !!!! It was so soft and good and the frosting was not to sweet besides being fluffy and fresh.  Great customer service but do try to get there early because apparently there is a lot of cupcake fanatics out there ??? They are almost out of cupcakes for the day !!!  Can your believe that ??? So come and enjoy !!!!
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,6/10/2014,34,51,2,4,2>When we first walked in, we were immediately overwhelmed with all the delicious treats to choose from. From chocolate covered strawberries to various sweet potato creations, pot pies and Mac and cheese...we just couldn't decide. Then we saw a huge loaf of pepperoni bread and just had to have it. It was a huge loaf and only cost $7. Great deal especially since it was delicious. My friend described it as a homemade hot pocket. It was fresh and still warm which made it taste even better. I definitely recommend stopping by here if you ever have the chance!
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,6/9/2014,131,103,2,6,3>I don't think I have every had so much fun learning how to salsa and bachata. I love to dance but have two left feet when it comes to latin dancing. My friend invited me out one night and I was all in.. I even decided to wear heels to practice in! I'm not the best salsa dancer but the staff and people at Mambo room welcomed me with open arms, and I was dancing in circles (literally) by the end of the night. It was great! I learned so much and will definitely be going back!
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2014,6/8/2014,107,136,2,6,5>Great service! Ordered the special.. Beef Wellington with Foie Gras! Flakey dough was perfect. Beef was tender and cooked just right. My friend ordered a burger and fries. I enjoyed the fries. Tasted like the kind of fries that would taste delicious w/ malt vinegar. If one is sensitive to smoke....one can still smell it in the non-smoking dining area.I still need to come back for their bacon week...
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/4/2014,6/7/2014,84,331,,4,2>Decent place to watch the game. Great service here! Food was decent: chicken sandwich had a big, juicy hunk of delicious white meat, yummy chipotle sauce (you can choose any wing sauce), and a surprisingly nice roll, not just a cheap hamburger bun. Potato salad was awful though, mushy and not potato tasting. Loved the deep fried appetizer platter (of course). Plenty of TVS, but they are all medium sized...I prefer the GIGANTIC ones!
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/13/2014,6/6/2014,31,234,6,9,3>As long as I can get an order of scotch eggs and a cider, this place is well worth the visit. And while the portion on the fish and chips is generous for what they term a small, it could be crispier. Especially the fries. This last time I specifically asked for the fries to be cooked longer and that was not an option. I found that off putting. Service on the whole is spotty. Generally slow, often understaffed. They are frequently 'out' of menu items (and the menu is fairly small). The food, for the most part is very good. Some items are under-seasoned, and a few items that come with a sauce or gravy could have had a larger serving to prevent things from \being dry. So far I've sampled the fish and chips, bangers and mash, meat pie, and steak and ale pie. Unless you are really craving British food this is not my go to by a long shot.
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/10/2013,6/5/2014,38,55,2,3,4>Currently my favorite sushi restaurant in the area. Yama has been around for a while and have expanded to more locations throughout the 757. This location is one of the newer ones.My cousins come here often and a lot of the staff have familiarized themselves with them. My last visit here, my waitress asked me how my cousins were doing. It was nice to see that level of customer service, even asking about my cousins that have moved away to Hawaii. Hospitality alone is a good reason to come here. They'll take care of you and evidently remember you.The sushi is great and you can tell you're definitely paying for what you get. The quality is excellent with crafty presentation. Lunch specials aren't too pricey and the bento box lunches are very worth it. They're helpful with whatever questions you may have. I feel like they serve the right portion of food to leave you satisfied and not overly full.I've noticed that if you treat them respectfully, they'll return the favor with something on the house. I've tried new menu items, not on the menu items, desserts, and even random gifts from their staff, simply because we had a great experience with them.Clearly an example of "treat others the way you want to be treated." Respect the food, respect the people, and it may come a long way.

I will not divulge which one gets me excited because I want plenty left for me.This refined desert is created by masters of their craft. Believe me the quality is unparalleled. Don't believe?

<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2014,6/2/2014,152,116,3,5,2>I was driving through Phoebus on my way to explore Fort Monroe when I noticed this restaurant along the part of Mellen Street that can only be described as charming. Situated among a variety of small-town businesses that include pubs and antique stores,The Point's façade is as delightful a sight as a wrapped present beneath a Christmas tree (It even had the decorative ribbons to match when I went in December). Whereas all establishments on Mellen Street exist within a mix of classic American architectural styles, The Point manages to stand out. Maybe it's the red and white flags, the outside seating, or any of the other subtle nuances that scream bistro. Whatever the case may be, for the famished explorer, the place looked appetizing.I don't usually go for sandwiches in restaurants. . . I mean it's not exactly difficult to stack ingredients between two slices of bread, so there's no reason to pay a premium for minimal labor. But of course, that's not The Point (hahaha. . . *sigh*). I still enjoyed the Comfort Country Club sandwich like I would any involved meal. It's $11.00 for "Grilled Chicken & house-smoked bacon on local sourdough. Served with Swiss, cheddar, lettuce & tomatoes. Dressed with roasted garlic aioli." Couple that with a drink and a side of fries, then you're all set.I was still brand new to Hampton Roads and my only buddy was working at the time, so I sat at the bar and ate my food by myself while watching an SNL special on one of their overhead TV screens. To make things a little sweeter, I went ahead and ordered hot coffee with Bailey's (my favorite!). It was such a relaxing afternoon, and I was thankful it wasn't busy. There is ample space to bring parties of over 10 people. The Point is more than just a bit out of the way coming from south of the Elizabeth River, but as a local Hampton Roads destination, it can be a special place to come together with a group of friends for a leisurely lunch or a night filled with sounds of clinking glass and laughter. If you're in the area, I say why not. Like them here on Facebook: facebook.com/ThePointAtP
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2014,6/1/2014,11,159,6,3,1>Fun fact: Did you know that a large contributing factor to climate change is cow and pig farts?  It's true.  These disgusting animals have no concern for this planet and go about willy nilly blasting noxious fumes all over our planet.  Let's join County Grill in their campaign to wipe out these deplorable animals.  Being good stewards of our little blue rock, nothing must go to waste.  That means we have to eat these malevolent, yet tasty creatures en masse.  The noble, albeit stupid, poultry that has gotten mixed up in this whole affair decided long ago to side with the beasts.  Much like those angels who threw their lot in with Lucifer, they have been cast out.  Feel no pity for them, for they have made their bed.  Now they must lie in it.
<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,5/31/2014,65,174,,4,4>Whoah! I know I start my reviews a lot with "how did I not know this place existed?" But seriously...HOW DID NOT KNOW? Bent Fork Grill is a small building with two or three two tops inside and a few patio tables outside. I ordered a burger with gouda, bacon, jalepenos, and chipotle sauce. It....was amazing. Nicely seasoned burger, juicy, awesomeness. Then, to make it even better, it was served with PARMESEAN GARLIC TATER TOTS....whaaat!!! So amazing! Their mac n cheese bites are pretty spicy...I'm pretty sure it's nacho cheese in there. It's amazing. They have live entertainment and the drink specials are the bomb. Go there. Like, right now.
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2014,5/30/2014,59,90,,9,2>This place is cool! Soo much potential. My coworker and I went here after work. The cuban sandwich was "best he has ever had" The margarita mix is home made...quite tasty. The bartender said they had a dj on saturdays. Might come check em out. The burger was pretty good and they came with home cut fresh fries (im a sucker for home cut fries) I really want to try the cheese fries, but went with the crab dip instead. Spicy and served with cut plantains?! Impeccable! They need more of a happy hour special or just specials to help market themselves. I hope this place does good.
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2013,5/29/2014,122,469,2,8,2>I have to thank Steven for showing me the ropes at this place. I had seen it many times before but I've never eaten at a Phillipino restaurant so I was a bit intimidated to go in and order something blindly off the steam table. We got there right when they opened at 11 and they were preparing everything on the lunch steam table, which is a hot buffet-like table that has about 8 dishes made fresh everyday. Lynn, the owner, quickly came out and welcomed me right away, giving me descriptions of all the food as well as samples of whatever I wanted to try. She was so hospitable and kind; I would say for anyone on the fence about coming in and trying something new, not to hesitate because she really makes you feel comfortable about asking questions and what to order.Steven said I had to try the chicken adobo, which is a Philipino staple, so I got that and another entree (which I now forget what it was called) but it had pork, onions, carrots, jalapenos, and a ranch-like dressing on top. You then choose rice or pancit. So for 2 entrees, pancit, and a coke I paid $8. And didn't even finish everything. Fantastic deal. It was my first chicken adobo but the chicken was so moist and succulent, seasoned well and paired great with the cabbage. The pork dish was nice and spicy, a lot of complex flavors going on. Also, none of the food is greasy or has that "yucky" feeling; it's totally different than Chinese food. It just reminded me of fresh, homemade food made with love. By noon, this place had really picked up and apparently you can experience a bit of a wait so I would definitley advise getting here early. Overall, I am pleasantly surprised with my first Philipino experience and the medley of flavors that go on. Everything was fresh and delicious and for $8, this will be our new go-to carryout place. New hidden gem in Suffolk!
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2014,5/28/2014,56,193,,4,4>So this saturday we decided to try this place out, the devor is awesome and clean and we were greeted as soon as we walked in and told to seat our selves we grabbed a booth and started to peruse the menu and took the place in. One of the things i loved was each booth had a power outlet with usb plugs great idea, the decor was americana using exterior materials indorrs which was very cool, yhe bar has a wide array of beers and is a full bar, wine special was very reasonable as were the Mary and Mimosa prices. The wife ordered the seaffod cobb with homemade blue cheese and it was beautiful and tasty with shrimp and limp crab a little pile of fresh bacon on the side egg and avacodo. I decided to screw up. I went with the meatloaf sandwich which clearly states spicy ketchup, i should have said leave off the ketchup as it is not my thing but was not thinking the meatloaf was awesome wrapped in bacon with mashers on the sandwich the real star was the Gouda mac and cheese could have eaten several bowls of that over and over and over!!!  They have many dishes i want to try and will be back soon
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/7/2014,5/27/2014,4,65,1,7,3>Came in here with the kids after sunny beach afternoon. The ambiance is a little interesting for a bbq place, dont know if I care for the sort of weird bar seating that is right in the middle of the restaurant...it seems like no one would ever actually want to sit there and they should just turn it into a normal table, but maybe I am wrong....It is pretty much the same seating arrangement as it was when this place was "Savor" so the tables are somewhat limited, we were there pretty early in the evening and I am not sure how crowded they get later...Service was excellent and very friendly! I thought the bbq sandwich was great, and my daughter had the penne with cheese which was very tasty though it was very, very much drenched in butter. I am loathe to point this out, because if you are ordering what is essentially macaroni and cheese, you really should not be griping about it's health component, but this was sort of out-of-control.  Coleslaw also tasty, and if it were not so lovely out I may have gone for one of the soups. They sounded fantastic!!I noticed that as of right now, this place has a single dollar sign listed as it's price-range on yelp, and I am going to very strongly disagree with that. Except for the BLT and veggie sandwich, most of the sandwiches are around $9.99 and the entree (platters) seemed to be more in the 15-20 dollar range, not saying it is not plenty of food or a good value, I just would not want to come in thinking it was going to be considerably cheaper than it is listed as being (which is what happened) I figured it would be more along the lines of Malbon Bros when they were at Hilltop. This was an assumption on my part though, so I am not going to blame them!It is pretty rare that we go "out" for bbq, but I will be checking out their take-away menu for summer!
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2014,5/26/2014,74,230,3,7,4>We've lived here for a little over three years now and our family can best be described as creatures of habit.  Much like a pop radio station might have run a Debbie Gibson song into the ground back in the 80s, we find something we like and we stick to it.  It works for us.  But, it makes those discoveries of little gems outside of our "usual" so much more exciting and we made one with El Morro this past weekend.I've had this bookmarked for quite some time and decided to stop in while out running around.  The GPS took us down Dahlia Drive and I was certain the address must be wrong in Yelp.  It was taking us through a residential area.  But sure enough, a little strip center popped up.  The moment my son and I walked in, we both looked at each other and said "It smells good in here".  And it did.  The smell of fresh baked goods was heavy in the air and it was wonderful.  As we approached the counter, we had no real idea of what they had or what we wanted.  So, we started with the pastry case in the front.  They had some turnovers and donuts that looked good and we grabbed a few of those.  There was a gentleman in the restaurant enjoying his lunch who could tell we were newbies to Puerto Rican food and this place.  He recommended the pan sobao and the alcapurria.  The bread was freaking amazing.  A nice crispy outer shell and just the freshest and softest middle you can imagine.  The two loaves barely survived a couple of hours.  We tried two types of alcapurria.  I can't honestly say I know what made them different but they both were great, filled with delicious beef (I think) and the outer shell was crispy and fried to perfection.  Very good.  It was my first encounter with alcapurria but certainly not the last. Overall, my guess is we will make this a regular stop.  In fact, the kids wanted to go back the next day to get more bread but we didn't make it.  We will.  They also have a nice selection of sandwiches and other dishes that I think change daily.  There is word of even having tamales on Saturdays, so call ahead to see.  And if you go, look for the guy sitting in a corner eating a whole loaf of bread by himself......and listening to "Foolish Beat" for the five thousandth time.
<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2014,5/25/2014,73,159,2,12,5>Great trails! We have a super-nifty State Parks pass (worth it!), which is incredibly affordable and absolutely amazing when you live in Virginia -- which happens to have THE best State Parks (it's SCIENCE, folks!). First Landing is sort of inconvenient to get to, in a way, since it doesn't have easy access to an Interstate. But, eh, who cares: Nature! "Exotic Lagoons"! Trees! Scat! SQUIRREL!There are many many miles of several different trails, plenty of geocaches, and it's beautifully maintained. Family favorites are High Dunes and Osmanthus Trail.For the love of all that is -- don't park just inside the gate (there's a lot a bit up the road an to the right) if you plan on hiking the trails. This lot dumps you off on the PAVED (blasphemy!) portion of the Cape Henry trail, which is an absolute nightmare to navigate in a group -- especially with small children. Cyclists don't always pay attention, and they tend to whizz through much faster than they should. There are some nice informational plaques along the trail, but you won't be missing much if you just drive straight to the Trail Center.The Trail Center is beautiful, with a mini museum of common flora and fauna and a little history. Purchase a trail map pamphlet for Bald Cypress for $0.50 at the front desk and enjoy the factoids.Go hike. Get outdoors. Be active. Live. Enjoy.
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2014,5/24/2014,298,491,6,14,10>I love sweets, so when a sign caught my eye that a new bakery in the Bayside area opened I was all over it. Upon closer inspection it's name is a dead give away, this wouldn't be a run of the mill bakery, but patisserie. The name "Gateaux" in French means cake which is the bakery's focus. The shop does all sorts of specialty cakes including the wedding variety.The bake shop is located off of Pleasure House Rd. in Thoroughgood Commons. The bright burgundy and white awning that protrudes from the building make it a cinch to find. Parking is plentiful and should never be an issue. Both the parking lot and sidewalk were in exceptional condition on my visit.Upon entering the store I was immediately greeted by owner Chris. The confectionery has one long case and another for refrigerated goods like tarts and cakes. This is strictly a carry out store. There is no customer seating inside, or outside. Some reconfiguration of a shelving accent wall would have to be changed to provide interior tables. But I suspect they will add a few tables outside the door come Spring... at least they should in my opinion. I guess you could say owners Chris and Joanne decided to have a mid life crisis together and opened the only French Bakery in Virginia Beach just before Thanksgiving. Joanne who does all the baking has taught and most recently was in the healthcare field. However, this would not be the family's first foray making French baked goods. Previous to Gateaux they owned a bake shop in Greensboro, NC. Husband Chris has the flexibility to work from home and assist in the store daily. You could say it's a family run business with there college age daughter assisting when home from school.Everything looked scrumptious in the case. Chris, then later Joanne came out from the kitchen to discuss some of the items. I elected to choose several to take home and sample. I picked up a few palmiers (like a danish) in chocolate chip and blueberry, a chocolate bouchon (like a cup cake), an apple caramel tart and a few chocolate chip cookies. Chris gave me a chocolate macaroon to try in the store. Strange, but I had never had one. It had a nice crunch to the exterior cookie and a delicious creme inside. I was immediately craving another, it was awesome!Fast forward to my home after dinner with the family all dying to try the treats I brought home. Mom said  the chocolate chip cookie was to die for, so rich, crisp and tons of chips. My wife and I thought  the chocolate bouchon was over the top. It was crazy rich with a moist chip center and crisp outer edge. My son and I both loved the chocolate chip and blueberry palimer's. I heated mine up and enjoyed with coffee. OMG it was incredibly yummy! The tart immediately reminded me of my all time favorite desert at Disney's Epcot French bakery. Lots of fresh fruit, scrumptious flavors and nice texture to the bottom. Not to mention lots if crumbly goodness on top.Is anyone keeping score, I certainly am. Five different items sampled, a family of four tasting five home runs dishes. There is no doubt in my mind that those who try Gateaux will fall in love with this new Bayside patisserie like we have.
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/19/2013,5/23/2014,46,196,,7,3>I need more than 5 stars for this review, I kid you not..  We knew it was time when we started finding shingles in our yard that matched the patchwork repairs that had been done during the past 20 years but...who should we call?  I put the word out on YELP and got 3 referrals, thank you Mike A for this one.Jon's estimate wasn't the cheapest, he was in the middle but his contract included more goodies that the others. It was also extremely detailed. He is also the sole owner of his roofing company which was founded in 2005.We notified Jon on a Friday and the job was meticulously completed the following Thursday.  I knew the job had started when I thought Santas reindeer were on my roof at 6:45 am.  That's right, they were actually there at 6:15 covering my yard with tarps and moving furniture off my deck.  His crew of 5 tackled my roof with extreme professionalism.  They walked around up there like it was flat and it's quite the opposite.  On the first day they worked until the sun set and they lost daylight.  They were back the next morning and waited in their trucks for the sun to rise a bit.  An hour later they were done.  Clean up is always a concern when dealing with a project like this.  All my old shingles and all the nails that were doing their best to hold onto those shingles were removed.  I have walked my property and haven't found a single nail.  They have large magnets on rollers that they even used in my shrubs.I just can not say enough about this roofing company.  I have a beautiful new roof at a very fair price.  I am a happy camper.

Here is my top ten list of why you should try them out, and keep going back:1: Husband and wife owned2. Family run. Husband taking orders, Mom and daughter team preparing all the yummy lunches!3. Great food! They have a nice variety of sandwiches, wraps soups and desserts.4. ALL of their pastries are baked in house daily. 5. Friendly (this makes all the difference in my opinion)6. Kid friendly with Grilled cheese, PB& NUTELLA or PB & fluff  sandwiches. Nice treat!7. Named in Memory of wifes brother (nice sentimental touch reminds me to go there instead of chains).8. Fresh ingredients9. CLEAN (some of these smaller places miss that important detail. Not here).10: All meats are sliced in house. Chicken salad is made in house. Soups made in house. EVERYTHING is made from scratchWe need to remember there is more at stake than our time when we run into food chains for a bite to eat. Stop and take a minute to breath while you wait just a few more for quality food that not only is healthier for you, but supports another local like yourself!
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/18/2014,5/21/2014,83,478,,5,5>Mmmmmm!!!  I was FINALLY able to try this place yesterday on President's Day in the afternoon.  I've wanted to try this place for a few months now and have driven past and even come in once before but had to leave because I found out I didn't have enough time to order and wait for the food... bummer. Well yesterday was the day. I got the Tuna Salad on wheat bread with tomato and lettuce as well as the cuban salad.  I did the half sandwich half salad and the portion of the salad was HUGE.  My salad consisted of lettuce, cucumber slices, avocado (like 3 small pieces), chickpeas, 2 small tomato slices and some homemade looking cilantro oil dressing.  It was very good and fresh and refreshing.  The portion was very generous for a half size, I can only imagine how huge the full size must be, and it was fresh made and delicious.  I only wish there had been more tomato and avocado.  Perhaps if I got the full size there would be. The tuna salad was excellent, fresh and moist and delicious.  I enjoyed the wheat bread but wanted the croissant.  You can't do that for the half so I had to go with normal wheat ... maybe next time. I also had a side of the sweet potato fries which come with a sweet aioli for dipping and they were warm and fresh cooked as well. I also tried their sweet tea and it was on point.  This is important to be a Southern gal so if the sweet tea sucks I may not even come back unless everything else is excellent.  I'm glad their sweet tea tastes on par with some of the best I've had around town. I also followed up with the latte of the day which was Creme Brulee to go.  It was delicious as well. It was slow as they were about to close so there was only one other quiet table inside and they left not long after I sat down.  I also managed to find some adorable small salt and pepper shakers on the way out shaped like starfish. While waiting for the food I browsed the cookies and cupcakes, cheese and truffles.  The gals inside working were very polite and friendly.  They went out of their way to be helpful and were very pleasant to talk to and answered all of my questions as a fist timer about items on the menu and what I could and couldn't do with combinations and bread choices. It was a fantastic experience and I will be back soon for sure.
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,5/20/2014,202,207,4,6,4>Good beer prices!I stopped by the other evening and decided to have a $5 flight of beers they had on tap, cool thing was that i got to pick which ones i wanted. They also had wine flights as well. As i sat enjoying my beers. The place is rather a cute little spot off of the main store. I didn't have any of the food but it looked good. There is no way you can beet the prices of their growler refills as well. After finishing my beer, I managed to stumble over my words prompting the bar keep to as me if i she needed to call me a cab, REALLY lol after only 4 small beers...I politely and kindly replied no and was waiting on my receipt expecting to give them a tip and remembered from a previous tip that they don't except tips here. Winning! **Overall a small nice spot to grab a nice refreshing brew. Just be sure to not make the same mistake I did by walking into the store after I was finished. Myself standing in a  Whole Food Store, is like me in the beer aisle at Total Wine with my eyes glazed over every time. That's when I always seem to get stuck looking at all the cool foods/things they have and it can be like pulling teeth trying to get me outta there.lolCheers!
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2014,5/19/2014,72,218,2,6,5>Another great experience. I've read over the somewhat recent reviews but they just do not describe my experience at all. We drove to the Beach for a random date night Friday night. Parking is a beech down there so we parked a block or so away. Not a big deal. It's a tourist area. This Soya along with the one in Great Bridge are my favorites. I ordered the King Neptune again. Very good.  My husband ordered the chicken and steak hibachi. I did have to remind the server about the hibachi sauce that comes on the side.  He happily fixed it and just noted there was a new chef in back. I also had the spicy salmon roll. Holy moly! Very spicy and very yummy. The shrimp tempura appetizer was great. I liked the tempura flake style this restaurant has. We were greeted quickly and seated quickly.  A server took a couple minutes to show up but once he did and realized we had not be helped, he took great care of us. We will be back. :-)
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2014,5/18/2014,221,97,,8,5>I enjoyed visiting this new local seafood restaurant. The Anchor Inn is located in the old Create Bistro in Hilton Village of Newport News-- a powerhouse ally of local eateries. Though the restaurant doesn't seem to strive for anything as creative as Create Bistro, they do make a hearty local seafood joint, one that will be prized in our community and welcomed. The restaurant is only a few weeks old, opening in the middle of our odd January winter storms of 2014. It's waiting on its ABC license but should have a full bar soon. The restaurant is clean, open, bistro feel; I sat in the back corner just below the nose high window hiding the the kitchen. No open kitchen space here. I thought i read .25 cent shrimp night, but it's really a Sunday special for all you can eat shrimp at $25.00. Spicy or steamed. Seemingly this was a good deal too. I passed only because I wanted to try other things for this review and just for fun. I didn't order any appetizers as per my usual. Though they seemed to be tasty, nothing fit my diet.... I ended up caving on once I laid eyes on the menu. Be careful, apps are not listed on their menu but on a small stand up where the salt and pepper hide. The menu seemed like a familiar seafood house display with seafood, land items, and a kids menu. Seafood served here is local which should make every local proud as we have the best seafood in the world.My table ordered the shrimp platter, stuffed flounder, fried oyster platter, oyster stew. For sides we chose a wonderful side salad, an average attempt at a squash casserole (it was bland and didn't seem fresh? but that might have been lost in the cheese... i'm a purest!), tasty twice baked potato, steak fries. All of the meals were served with 3 crunchy and flavorful hush puppies. The food was cooked well, perfectly presented, and fairly tasted. Fair seafood lovers will appreciate the simplicity, local seafood, and fresh taste. Dessert was a chocolate, cinnamon, and walnut cake covered in chocolate. Decadent could be a one word description though it was missing some whip cream or ice cream since its served warm and so rich in flavor. Try with coffee for a better experience or a cup of milk. Service was excellent. We came early for dinner but food was fast and server professional and kind. For those locals, think of this place as an upscale Bills Seafood or Herman's Harbor House. This restaurant is quaint and brings fresh seafood to the lower peninsula sitting in a surprising hidden jewel of local eateries in Hilton Village (Circa 1918, 99 Main, Crab Shack, Courture Cakes, and a not yet open but recently relocated local Rosalita's). I bet its comparable to a strong Surf Rider restaurant but without the crowd and way better service. Speaking of service, the hospitality is excellent and attentive which drives it above its other seafood competitor down the street. I think that the biggest struggle will be the restaurant's prices. Portions were excellent and tasty, but the prices were 3-6$ higher on the entrees than I think it should be. I would come back and try other things on the menu especially because of its local flavor, I would come back faster if the price points were a bit better. I'm thinking that if they want to keep these prices, they need to run successful specials campaigns to promote items on their menu. They do offer lunch so I bet i'll be back to try a lunch crab cake. One can't really judge a seafood restaurant until its crab cake consumed. I'm sure the lunch prices would be satisfactory too. Local seafood lovers, hope you join me.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/14/2013,5/17/2014,66,117,4,5,3>LOUD.  REALLY LOUD IN HERE.But it's a hibachi place, what do you expect?It can be a bit overpriced for what you get in food, but really the price goes into the "show" that the chefs do for you.  They do all the standard tricks- flaming volcano onions, flaming grill surface, flaming everything as well as throwing hot pieces of food at your face.  But if you've been here more than once, you'll notice that it's the same routine.  Every single damn time.  The script is almost identical from chef to chef.  I heard the chef next to us say the same jokes that our guy said half an hour earlier.Nevertheless, it's fun to do every once in a while.  The food tastes good, and when all is said and done that's ok in my book.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,5/16/2014,39,76,4,7,6>By far the best cheesesteak in Virginia Beach! I actually found them via Yelp. The cheesesteak itself is a huge portion. I ordered the ribeye steak combo and added cheese whiz. Anywhere that has cheese whiz as an option gets an A+. The service/server/cook was very friendly and I will definitely be returning again.....
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2014,5/15/2014,38,86,7,8,3>I heard of this place through some coworkers that heard some buzz on Facebook.  Anybody that has followed me knows I have been looking for non-big chain donut shops. I went on Thursday, but they were closed.  So I went Friday morning, and they were so packed, I knew this was something special, but I also knew I wasn't waiting in that line. I went back mid-afternoon and was able to get a parking spot at the door.  Lucky me! I was fully expecting this place to have a different variety of donuts. I didn't expect the same fried hot donut, but a variety of toppings!  I was not amused, but I bought a half dozen anyway (2 maple, 2 chocolate & 2 chocolate w/ rainbow sprinkles) for me and the family.  When I got home, I ate a maple and almost got back in my car to get another half dozen! These donuts blow KK & DD out of the water!  I don't know how to explain it!  No wonder everyone and their grandparents were hitting this place up on the first day! Customer Service: 5 starsTaste: 5 starsCleanliness: 5 starsLocation: 4 stars - not enough parking right now, but will be enough after the newness wears off.  What are you waiting for!  GET THE DONUTS!
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,5/14/2014,34,46,4,9,6>Well folks, what can be said about chow that hasn't already been said. Yes the food is amazing, the libation menu is extensive, the menus are written in chalk on the walls, all been said. Here's what hasn't. I walked in yesterday with some friends who adore this place and are regulars. They were super excited for me to try it. We sat dawn, not having to wait, (yeah on a Saturday at 730pm) in a booth in the back. Our server comes up gets our drink orders and I ordered the fried green tomatoes. They were delish. The ham salad that comes with it makes for a tangy topping on the tomato that you don't need to dip it in any sauce. We proceed to order our food. I got the country fried steak with Mac n cheese and mashed sweet potato. My friends got the burger special and the flat iron steak. Needless to say I was super excited to keep trying their food. Well, a good 20 min pass, then 30, finally after what seemed like forever, our server comes up and says she just checked on our food and it's coming out. Don't get me wrong we weren't rude or even asking what the deal was with our food but we were starting to really get hungry. She bring out our food and we tear into it. About 10 min later she comes up and apologizes for how long our food took and let us know that that's not normal and they would be taking care of our meal. That, people, is customer service! Not only did they admit their problem but they took care of it without us even making an issue of it. Can I just say they totally won me over! Not bc I got a free meal, but they did the right thing without the customer even mentioning it. I look forward to going back and trying more amazing food at their establishment. And I hope people see how fantastic they treat their patrons. They want you to get the best experience out dining there and if you don't they make sure you're taken care of. Thanks Chow for an amazing meal and fantastic customer service.
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/4/2013,5/13/2014,62,168,4,14,12>Field trip to Field Guide today with two of my foodie pals from work.  Let's start with the basics.  I love the seating, it's different, and forces people to invade personal space as the place gets a little busier.  But it also makes it easy to snoop on what others are eating.  Very fun!  I wouldn't want to eat like this at a suit and tie place, but for Field Guide it works.So, clearly the food is good, and there's a ton of reviews about good eating here, so I thought I'd tell you some tips for coming to field guide.First, bring some friends, this isn't because being alone sucks, it's because you can all order something different (there's going to be like 4+ things on the menu you're going to want to try, trust me).  Second tip, if you bring a pack of friends, 1 bowl of sweet potato chips is good for like 2 or maybe even 3 people.  So make sure you mix in the curry veggies (which were spot on) or other offerings (we ordered three bowls and took home a LOT).Third tip, 1 cookie feeds three people comfortably, for REAL.  Forth tip, bring a wet nap, I mean it.  Food is gushy, in a great way.Overall, I really liked this place, it has the hip vibe I've come to expect from these guys without feeling pretentious.  Just like at HB, I got a great table side follow-up on our meal experience, something I value highly.  My table mates absolutely adored the in-house soda, so you might want to give it a try.For $12, in downtown Norfolk, you're not going to find much better for lunch.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,5/12/2014,255,146,6,8,7>I came to this little gem on Sunday after church. I had some friends from out of town with me and  I really wanted to so them the best that Hampton roads had to offer. I tried to take my friends to a different location that was packed. So I jumped on yelp, I thought the name of this restaurant was pretty cool, I heard about the donuts and the reviews seemed favorable, so made our way over. In regards to ambience, it is definitely a hole in the wall mom and pop location, it was very simple basic but very inviting and it made me feel like I was in a diner from '50s (note: my only understanding of what diners looked like in the '50s is based purely on the movies and tv shows I watch ;). We sat at the counter right next to the line cook. My man was working that grill and talking to us the entire time. He and the server were super cool and helped me fall in love with this little place before I even had a bite to eat. The food was amazing! I had a breakfast burrito that was nice and BIG (big boy size) with toast and hash browns (I would say they are more like breakfast potatoes or whatever southern phrase attributed to potatoes eaten at breakfast). I was able to try one of the donuts they sell and it was pretty good, not "smack yo mama" good but it hit the sweet and hearty donut spot I was craving at the time, it was almost like KK and DD had a donut baby. One of the items that I tried that was ultra impressive was the "Larger than yo Face" pancake. I have never seen a pancake that big before and it was nice and moist and tasty too! This is a great place for almost anytime of day; early morning, late night (after bars close) or afternoon. Though an awesome place, it is on the small side, so any group larger than 4 people will start to find issue with eating together and the bathroom is located behind the restaurant so it may be a good idea to relieve yourself before your visit. But definitely try this place out, you will not regret it.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/3/2014,5/11/2014,118,112,6,5,2>I really wish I lived closer to Zeke's because I'd be over there like white on rice!Absolutely dig the vibe of the place and the people there.  I'll get to the point, RIDICULOUSLY fantastic tasting coffee!Try it pour over style... or don't but I seriously recommend it, brings all the delicious high notes out!The décor is anything but mediocre; it's so fun and vintage chic!Music, yes, yes and yes!This place I feel should be downtown Denver or even Ghent; Virginia Beach is very lucky to have such a unique coffee shop!
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2013,5/10/2014,263,519,18,29,24>I had the pleasure having lunch here Tuesday afternoon and am still practically at a loss for words. Honestly I didn't know what to expect coming in here. I had no prior knowledge of Chartreuse before the visit the visit and knew nothing about the establishment other than it's name. So  let me just say that that I didn't have any major expectations and as you know when you go to a place and your "Wowed" from the get go that's a great sign. We seated ourselves at the counter and spoke with a really nice lady who became our server. This also afforded us a perfect view into the kitchen area. The menu changes every day and had some very cool choices on our visit. My so called "Date" would like to think she decided what I was going to eat however a little subliminal manipulation and I was able to have two meals instead of one. She thinks she's winning, and I don't have an argument. I selected a Scallop's dish that was stacked on top of Swiss Chard and a Grit Cake which was surrounded in Parsley Cream. My 'Date' ordered the Grilled Salmon Tartine which was served on top of  two Wheat Baguette's and also included Fried Leeks, Watercress & Red Peppers, and then doused with Lemon Poppy Dressing. Both of these entree's were so incredibly good that I just have a hard time explaining it. The best I can say it is that the multitude of tastes all combined at once in each bite and it was just fantastic!!!But wait there's more... Time for desert. Personally I'm not much of a desert person but after seeing a Chocolate Creme Brulee pass by I was sold. From the chocolate to the fruit topping, it's all about the combination and oh so good it was. I can't sing their praise's enough. Give these guys a try and you won't regret it. They're located right next door to the mall on East City Hall Ave.
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2013,5/9/2014,38,130,,6,5>So I was looking for a new place to try for this weekend. I searched Yelp and came across Monsoon Eclectic Modern Indian Resturant. All I can say is WOW! My wife and I arrived around 6;30 pm on Friday payday weekend. We just beat the crowd and I am so glad we did. We were seated immediatly by the server who seated us in a large secluded booth in the back of the restaurant.  The environment was elegant all the way around. Low lightings with the right amount on each table. It was not loud or were there any over whelming distraction.   My wife felt so cozy at our table and so did I. Our server  Hasmukh came out to serve us. We told him that this was our fist time in an elegant India restaurant, so he gave his our undivided attention. Not knowing much about Indian food we made a lot of wonderful suggestions to us. Job well done on his part. We ordered an appetizer of Crispy Samosa recommended by Hasmukh. I can describe what it was; I do know it had chickpeas, a crispy bottom breading and some Indian sauces. When it arrived we did not know how to eat it. Hasmukh came out and showed us. WOW! it was good. Hasmukh notice I was looking as the Mixed Grill; he said it was a great suggesting and told me what was in it. Grilled beef, chicken, salmon, jumbo shrimp and a variety of mixed veggies such as red pinions, zucchini, broccoli and a grilled lemon to squeeze over it. It was served with some masala sauce and basmata (sp) rice with peas. MAN IT WAS AWESOME!My wife had the highly favored Chicken Tikka Masala suggested by many of you on Yelp. Its funny, my wife is not use to anything different and she loved it! If you order the Nan Bread I suggest you get the Nan with Garlic. I could have eaten that all by itself as a meal. The service was awesome. There were beautiful Indian servers in all four corners of the restaurant waiting to serve you. Keep in mind of one thing. The people of India are proud people and love their country and food even in its greatest dismay. So if you see one of the India servers looking at you eating and enjoying your food please don't be offended. It is a sign of honor. Servitude is a honor to them and it may seem a little over-bearing to the average uninformed American. GO TO THIS RESTAURANT! I guarantee a 5 star review by you! You won't be disappointed!
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2013,5/8/2014,69,206,6,5,3>While I am aware that other people are 'qualified' to review froyo places, I believe being 41 weeks pregnant makes my opinion on all things dessert significantly more valid. So take it from preggers here, this place is great! It's clean, friendly, delicious and not insanely expensive. They have a ton of great flavors, but I think the toppings is where they shine. You can go healthy or not, either way the selection is vast and fresh. The Oreo pieces are always crunchy, the strawberries and mangoes always juicy and the brownies always chewy. It's clear that they take a lot of pride in putting out a good product and I appreciate that!
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2014,5/7/2014,183,190,4,11,8>My new found favorite!  What was I thinking coming here so late in the game?  I have had a bunch of people telling me about this place for a long time and thank goodness I finally did it.  My neighbor used to work here so she brought me--and you know I love a good inside scoop.  So, particularly once it gets warm out, this place stays jammin' and they only have less than 10 tables.  So, unless you get there early or late, plan on waiting, but it so worth the wait.  They do have a small bar to hang out and you can eat up there too.  Thankfully, they do have some parking around back.  When you come here, of course, you have to get Mojitos...their signature drink is the best of the beach.  They have traditional or you can pop it up with a little bonus flavoring of pomegranate, guava, coconut, pineapple, and a few others.  God, they're good!On to the menu.  So, they do have their menu online but each night, they do have a few specials too and several of the specials are frequently recurring.  The chef and owner, Edwin, is genuine and loves to share his passion.  His parents are Puerto Rican and Cuban, so expect nothing but to be dazzled with an authentic feast.   For apps, I would say, start with all of them--LOL.  No really, they are all fantastic.  I especially loved the chorizo con Pan since I am a sausage freak. Every table is definitely deserving of the Maduros--just the perfect amount of sweet with a lovely dipping sauce...plus, if you are going to do Latin, you have to have some plantains, right?  For entrees, the Churrasco con Chimichurri is a zesty, tender skirt steak that had me moaning throughout dinner.  If they have the paella on special, make someone at your table get it and everyone try it.  Most of the entrees come with beans and rice--hooray because they are awesome! I know, you may think it's weird to be excited about beans and rice but until you have Edwin's beans and rice, then you won't understand.  They are also well-known for their fish tacos, so those are on my to-do list.You know how there are just those places you go where you must have dessert--this is of those places!  I have a hard time committing to just one dessert in here.  I hope for your sake, you bring a few buddies so you can all share desserts.  I can definitely vouch for the bread pudding, the tres leches, and the fried banana cheesecake.Thank me later and go have a good dinner.(FYI, there are a couple of tables outside, but since the city has been unwilling to budge, there is no alcohol allowed outside yet)
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2014,5/6/2014,129,84,3,7,3>I'm late getting this review in, I feel obligated to get this submitted, because DoorMasters performed an excellent new garage door purchase and installation at a competitive price. They completed a complete upgrade of my worn-out contractor's special garage door. New belt-drive opener and hardware, and new powder-coated heavy gauge, insulated steel, carriage house-styled door. It is installed perfectly, I mean it is tight, level, no play at all, with a parallel reveal that I did not expect from a steel garage door. Everything went great and I am exceedingly satisfied with the entire experience, from showroom to install, DoorMasters of Greenbrier has my highest recommendation.  I'm a fan.
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/3/2013,5/5/2014,56,35,,5,3>Great place to eat if you want a home cooked style breakfast but you don't feel like cooking.  I had a breakfast sandwich and biscuits & gravy and they were both phenomenal.  I definitely recommend stopping by here for breakfast if you are by the farmers market.  I will be coming here from now on instead of going to overpriced IHOP.  It conveniently located right down the street from my house.  Service is great and they only take cash, but there is an ATM right outside.  Enjoy!
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2014,5/4/2014,34,86,,8,4>My husband and I checked this place out because of their Blind Wine Tasting event. We do love wine, and I am a sucker for small plates, so we went for dinner as well as the tasting. We didn't order a specific wine because we were doing the tasting event, but the wine menu was extensive. I'm sure the friendly staff would help you pick a bottle, as they seemed very knowledgable and friendly. For food, we ordered the cheese plate, which was not as wild as some others I've had, but the cheeses were good quality for their varieties (cheddar, blue and manchego). Served well with crackers, grapes, honey, candied pecans and an apricot compote, it was a great addition to the early white tastings.We also tried the Lamb Meatball Trio, which was not as good as I had hoped. Usually, when I think lamb, I think very tender, very flavorful meat. While it was flavorful, it was a bit chewy, and not as pleasant as I was expecting. The pesto flatbread was lovely - a thick layer of pesto with finely diced bits of tomato and a nice coating of mozzarella. I'd definitely order this again. The crabcake bites were also very tasty. The dipping sauces they were served with complimented the flavor of the crab. The consistency was just right - not falling apart but not making your jaw work too hard either. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. I think we'll come back and bring a couple friends with us next time.
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2014,5/3/2014,25,96,3,7,6>If there is any place outside your own mother's kitchen that uses love as an active ingredient in their food, it's Cutlass Grille. It's evident in every single bite that comes off the plate of food that is put in front of you.I could tell you how tender and flavorful the jerk chicken is. I could tell you how creamy the mac-n-cheese is. I could tell you how the baked beans practically melt in your mouth. I could tell you how dessert-like the fried plantains are. I could tell you I would bathe in the chopped brisket bbq if I could. I could tell you that I'd like for the family who owns and runs Cutlass to adopt me and teach me the secret family recipes. But none of that does you any good if you don't go experience it for yourself.Do yourself a favor... go... now. I'll meet you there.
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/29/2013,5/2/2014,49,45,,6,4>This sushi spot is up and coming, so don't be turned off when you don't see more than 2 people in the building. Some of my friends that eat at Ang's frequently have raved about this place, and I have to agree with them. Most sushi spots in HR aren't that great. I usually stick to one or two restaurants, but I can see myself coming back here to try more things.The salmon carpaccio has an interesting flavor, something that I can't really put my finger on, but it was delicious. I wish I had the entire plate to myself. I don't think it would be filling as a main dish for one person, so get a few more appetizers or rolls. The age dashi tofu wasn't awesome, but you get a lot for your money. I tried the Spicy Girl (or City?) roll, OMG roll, and Best Friend roll. None of them disappointed.The owner treated us to a round of sake shots on the house, which was very kind and welcoming of him. I guess it helps to go to places with a group of girls! He also gave us Japanese cheesecake. The cheesecake is not like the cheesecake Americans are used to. It was light and reminded me of a mix between angel food cake, pound cake, and cheese cake. So much better than regular cheesecake!!
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2014,5/1/2014,121,268,2,7,6>I finally had the chance to stop in with my kids to check out this library. Man were we impressed! It is small and old, but they had PLENTY to choose from and the staff was OUTSTANDING!!!! My kids loved it! The ladies were helping my kids find their favorite books and helped them choose some new fun books. They also have NEW RELEASE movies on DVD to check out for free! They have the same titles that are in Redbox right now, for FREE! It was a fast and easy checkout. The lady offered my kids a sticker book and cute bags to put their books in. Overall, a very pleasant experience. I look forward to returning!
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2013,4/30/2014,155,241,4,9,9>I've really been slacking on making it to all the local craft breweries around here. I need to fix that. Immediately.After a UYE (International Supper Club) last night, my Yelpy S/O decided that I HAD to try Young Vets because 1) She know's how much I love craft beer, 2) The restaurant we were at was about 5 miles from YVBC and 3) They were the only ones open. The stars were freaking aligned, people!I was rushed out of the restaurant and transported (via Mazda SUV) to this amazing (though small) tasting room(s). We actually decided to hang out in the front area with all the seating and that was totally cool. The space is small but I fell in love with everything. From the concrete stained floors to all the copper art pieces adorning the walls and shelves. This place is definitely my kind of hangout.First. I come from a very long line of military veterans to include my husband. So basically anything that supports our US military, you can bet I'm all for it.I opted for the flight, though I don't typically care for IPAs and YVBC makes a few of them. I decided it was the best POA (plan of action) and that it was the only way I was going to get a taste for how they were represented in their beers. The flight carrier is awesome, made up of welded metal pieces with the names of the beers and descriptions on little copper placards. It made me giddy happy, ya'll. As far as the beer goes, I liked it all. My favorite though, was surprisingly, the Semper  FI.P.A with it's upfront citrus notes and wasn't at all overpowered by that bitter hoppy thing that happens with IPAs. I recommend you make the drive out to YVBC and go with the flight. And then sit back (if you have time) and order a pint. It's totally worth it.

Great little hidden getaway even the ice cream truck made it through!!Lighthouse was nice and fun to climb, but  it's a hike!! The narrow stairs made me want to pass out, a little boy asked me if I was ok. Dang.., if he can do it I can pump up enough courage to do it too! But once you make it to the top what a beautiful sight!
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/25/2014,4/28/2014,54,75,3,8,4>Welcome to José's welcome to a larger then life cantina.  I was excited to see this converted Texas restaurant changed into a outdooresque feel of eating with great friends and family.  The decor is wonderful,  check out the bar with changing illuminated bar and star lit ceiling.The food portions are large and delicious.  I liked the tea cups are large and they provide to go cups if you ask.  The seats at the larger tables are refurbished barrels.  The service was pretty good.  Eye catching menu and the flan was yummy.  I ordered the fajitas Chiquita and tried the flan.Good food, nice ambiance, will return back!
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/21/2013,4/27/2014,166,132,1,9,4>This is a great place to hunt for treasures.  I found everything from antique garden gnomes to great 1920"s retro bedroom furniture.  You will love it!The customer service was wonderful. I am the customer with questions and they loved sharing bits of history on the pieces in the store.Enjoy!
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/6/2013,4/26/2014,13,167,1,8,6>So glad to have a new restaurant occupying Empire's old location.  Luce just opened this week and I've been excited to check it out!Walking in, it's a familiar layout with some nice new tweaks.  The tables are no longer shorties and this gives the diners an experience that they aren't being overtaken by the crowd that can sometimes linger close by.  Power to the people!  The bar looks to be a glazed concrete and the new dark floors are nice.  Overall, there is a sexier vibe here now.  My only feedback would be with what appears to be stock photographs on the walls - I'd like to see something a bit more personal and/or unique, and the music went from Johnny Cash to Swedish house music.  Now to the food.Some complaints I foresee with the timeliness of your food should be balanced with the understanding that the chef appears to be cooking everything to order.  Though this can take time, I have no problems waiting for good food.  This is also a bit more of a traditional dining experience than what previously occupied this spot (Tapas).To start, we had the mushroom toast and it was great.  I'm not even a huge fan of mushrooms; however, they were accompanied with fresh mozzarella and a rustic toast that held up the entire time (never a soggy moment).  The juices were very flavorful in this dish.  For me, it's the consistency with most mushrooms; however, these were cooked to the point where they had some charcoaling and it really worked for me.My main dish was the Pesci Franny.  I thought the grouper accompanied with the walnut and Frangelico was fantastic.  The sweetness of the Frangelico combined with the added texture of the walnuts made it very enjoyable.  I did think the presentation could have been better - perhaps less cannellini beans, I thought there were too many of them.My girlfriend ordered the Tonno and Tomato and we both thought the quality of the tuna was a bit off.  It was certainly cooked to the temperature ordered, but the quality didn't meet our expectations.  She raved about the sauce - so this sounds like an easy fix.Overall the experience was good - but my expectations were through the roof after some of the great things I heard from some folks that were at some of the soft openings.  I will say that the service didn't seem ready.  I didn't feel like there was a lot of knowledge with the restaurant and its offerings.  Though I was impressed to see the chef coming out to introduce himself and talk a bit about the dishes, and who doesn't like free cannoli's?  They were great, thanks!These are my first impressions, I'm curious to hear what others have to say and look forward to a return soon!
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/16/2013,4/25/2014,48,123,2,5,5>I was pretty disappointed when I found out that there aren't many Indian options in Newport News.  Nawab is the only option around the City Center area.  Thankfully, this particular Nawab is a great Indian restaurant.I've been here on a couple occasions, most recently for lunch.  They had the lunch buffet open until 3pm, which was good because we didn't get there until 2.  The selection was good, though I feel like I get more of a curry selection when I go to Saffron in Virginia Beach--but everything I tried was delicious.  I particularly liked the spinach and corn curry, and the coconut grilled chicken.  That chicken was the most flavorful chicken I've ever had.  They knocked it out of the park there.The prices were reasonable, and the service was good.  I'm a big fan of this location.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/31/2014,4/24/2014,60,60,1,7,5>My wife and I spotted this restaurant, when we were going to one of our other favorites and decided we had to give it a try.  As we walked in, we were greeted by a bubbly young lady, who welcomed us and sat us down.  I noticed the nautical/WWII style motif - and also noticed that there was '40s music playing over the speakers.  Nice touch.The server gave us time to peruse the menu long enough for us to make our drink selections.  Both my wife and I went with raspberry sweet tea, and it was awesome!  Probably some of the best raspberry tea I've had (and I LOVE raspberries in every way, shape and form).  Took a while to digest the menu, we were a little surprised it was only breakfast & lunch (and we were there for dinner), but hey - we'll try anything.  In keeping with the nautical theme, everything is named for something tied to the Navy/military.  I decided to go with The Veteran (Steak & Eggs on a pretzel bun), with a side order of potato salad.  My wife ordered The Captain (Grilled chicken club sandwich on a pretzel bun) with a side order of fries.  Originally, she ordered the shrimp macaroni salad - but they were out.  The nasty weather as of late apparently interrupted their supply chain a bit.  I'd say that's understandable.Our sandwiches came out both at the same time, and well prepared.  Their pretzel buns were delicious, and the steak was cooked perfectly.  The first half of my sandwich melted in my mouth, and I relished every bite.  The second half I ran into some gristle problems with the steak - making it tough to chew through.  I think a recommendation I would have would be to trim the steak a little better, or use a leaner cut - so that the customer doesn't have to work too hard.  My wife's sandwich was really good, and as reported fries were just OK.  The potato salad was very good.  The owner came over and welcomed us and talked to us for a little bit - which I think is good for any small business.  I would rate this a solid 3 1/2 stars, but bumped it up to 4 because of the service.  We didn't feel suffocated, the service was good and overall we enjoyed the experience.  There are other things on the menu that I wouldn't mind checking out in the future as well.
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,4/23/2014,13,39,3,6,5>Im writing this review in front of the restaurant. It was that good!I've just finished an order of cured pork spring rolls, a grilled pork sandwich, and half of a house special sandwich. I had to stop myself. The sandwiches are great here. I've been looking for a great vietnamese sandwich since leaving California and I finally found my new spot. The spring rolls were great. Perfectly balanced with delicious cured pork and fresh ingredients and some chopped peanuts (which i wasn't expecting but really complemented the dish well). The grilled pork sandwich has always been my personal favorite of the vietnamese style sandwiches. If you've never had one it starts with a baguette, seasoned grilled pork (of course), mayo/butter sauce, cucumber, cilantro, daikon and carrot pickle and fresh jalapeños. The peppers do pack a punch so be ready for that. The bread has great texture and flavor, the meat is delicious and all the veggies are crisp and flavorful. It all just comes together very nicely. I highly recommend this sandwich. I also tried the traditional Banh Mi sandwich which has the same veggies but is made with liver pate, vietnamese meatloaf, and head cheese. Traditional vietnamese cold cuts. I just had to get the classic to make sure it measured up to other places I've tried. And it did. If you want traditional go with the house special. But i personally, really enjoy the grilled pork. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great sandwich, and not just a vietnamese sandwich. I still need to try their soups. But for now, I'm happy i found a place to grab these awesome sandwiches. Oh, and the service is great too!Try this place, you wont be disappointed.
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/30/2014,4/22/2014,4,69,3,7,4>Excellent authentic mexican food.  My favorite is their tortas (mexican sandwiches).  The torta cubana comes on fresh bread overflowing with three kinds of perfectly seasoned meat and just about every mexican topping you can imagine.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall with a casual ambiance.  You'll hear a lot of Spanish, but the staff are easy to communicate with.  It's possibly the best Mexican food in the area.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/30/2014,4/21/2014,114,446,3,9,7>This is my boyfriends' friends place. Had to stop by and meet Alan the owner...and to try his food. First of all the service was wonderful. We sat at the bar and the bartender was ver nice and made some wonderful suggestions. She definitely knew the menu. The fried green tomatoes with the magnolia sauce...fantastic. Perfectly fried. The sauce, sweet with a touch of heat from the jalapeños. Mmmmmmmm.Next we had the salmon BLT. The homemade coleslaw was fab! The fish was cooked perfectly...just as we ordered, medium rare.  The remoulade sauce to dip our hand cut fries in was perfect.  The tomato mayo on the sandwich was also da bomb. We will be back to try the shrimp and grits and whatever else tickles our fancy.
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,4/20/2014,171,233,5,10,7>I go back and forth on whether I want to give that 5th star since I really enjoyed my experience at this new place. My man and I were looking for a seafood place and with our first place striking out as too busy, we decided to head here since I've had the place bookmarked.Once inside, we were greeted by the host and he sat us immediately in a booth. From here, there was a good wait for our waitress to arrive. We almost started wondering if they had forgotten us when the waitress did appear. She started us off on some a pitcher of water and a couple glasses. I did think it was weird that she didn't put the water for us. When she came back for our orders, we asked for a recommendation on what wine to drink. We ended up choosing one of her recommendations for the Rose which had a nice little bubble to it.Our food arrived and everything looked impressive. I ordered the raw oysters which were the Sandy Points from Cape Charles. Surprisingly for a place that has oyster in their name, this is the only kind that they served. The oysters were pretty fresh, but didn't seemed to be shucked all the way as there were some I still had to finagle out. Still, they made a great selection on this one oyster since it was very fresh with brininess that wasn't overwhelming. For me ordering a half dozen, I ended up getting seven. Not sure if that was on purpose since the oysters were smaller than some I have had in the past, but that extra one happily made it to my tummy.Next up was my old bay shrimp that was on some grilled toasted bread. The bread was a great addition to the dish since it held all the flavor of the sauce that it came with. I also tried my boyfriend's since what's his is mine, right? He ordered the Oysters Rock and She Crab Soup. The oysters had some smoky flavor and spice to it. My boyfriend really enjoyed this dish as it has been a while since he last ordered it. The soup was also delicious and there was crab meat chunks in the soup! SOLD!We both enjoyed the atmosphere of the place to the point that the boyfriend didn't want me to check in so we could keep this place to ourselves. Oops, too late!
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/3/2013,4/19/2014,57,40,2,7,3>If you're craving a pizza, GO HERE!!  If you're craving a pizza on a Sunday, GO HERE!!  I say that because on Sundays they have a special for a large pizza.  I forgot the price but I remember my total being under $10.  I wonder if they still have that.  It has been awhile since I last been here.  Their pizzas are great and it does not taste like something old or frozen they cook for you when you order.  Careful though cause when you bite into it, the toppings come right off!!  They load it up!  I love it!  Well it falls off for me.  Maybe I'm eating it wrong?They have an outdoor sitting area where you could eat your pizza with that night time breeze blowing in.  Or hot humid breeze during the day.  Whichever you prefer.  Great night place to go to also.  Pizza and Beer, what more can you ask for?!  Speaking of beer, they have a wide selection of it.  No complaints with the wait staff also.  They are very knowledgeable with the specials and know the menu inside and out.  They even recommend something for you if you can't decide based on your preferences.  That's great customer service right there!I basically have no complaints about this pizza place.  Every time I go here it has been a pleasurable experience.  Atmosphere, staff, and food are all great!!  Give it a try!!
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2014,4/18/2014,119,199,6,11,10>Years ago when I was but a wee lad growing up in the upper midwest, Mom and Dad would load my sister and me into our hulking Ford Galaxy to make our weekly trip to visit Gramma Dora who lived in a massive old farmhouse about an hour away.  I always looked forward to these trips because Gramma had a huge upstairs with rooms filled with bright and shiny treasures, at least in the eyes of this innocent youngster.  To others, this was a house filled with junk (in fact, one room was known as The Junk Room), sometimes requiring a shuffling of feet to make it from one end of the room to the other.  Along the way, I found old magazines, metal toys, discarded cigar boxes, and glass figurines, each with its own history, its own story.  I would spend hours playing with these treasures, vicariously living the existence of each through the mind of a 7 year old.  My sister was a constant companion on these journeys, we would compare stories and invent new and up to date versions of what each discovery had endured.  Sometimes these items were props in our new imaginary adventures.  Our reverie was put aside only to go back downstairs to watch The Wonderful World of Disney, after which we piled back into the Ford and made the trek back home, but not before Gramma Dora would inquire what we had found and gave us her account of how each thing came to rest in the massive farmhouse.  As I got older, Gramma Dora would spend hours telling me about when she was a kid, what she did for fun, what her life was like, and how her life changed as she got older.  Gramma Dora was a cool old gal, on long car trips across the country, she was my backseat companion, sometimes even taking the oversized Soundesign headphones from my head to listen to the Elton John Goodbye Yellow Brick Road Double album that I had recorded onto cassette.  She would show me pictures of infant me sitting on Grampa August's lap.  He passed before I was able to really know him, but Gramma Dora assured me that I was just like him.  Gramma passed from this life when I was in High School, but to this day, when confronted with a fork in the road, I think of what advice she would give, which direction was the way to the unfound cool and exciting.Cool and Eclectic is my connection back to those days.  It is filled top to bottom with treasures and memories from years gone past, with treasures that have history and stories of their own.  When I see an old pinball machine, I'm taken back to my misspent youth where my pinball partner and I would rule the King Tut table at our local restaurant.  The bins filled with vinyl records are a link back to that time, to what I was doing, to what I was feeling, to what I was dreaming.  My visits to Cool and Eclectic are not shopping trips, but rather side trips down the too long ignored rabbit trails of yesteryear.  You don't shop here, you linger here.  You contemplate here.  At best, you recharge, you reconnect with those hopes and dreams of youth and find a way to find that path again as an adult.To compile a list of what is here is fruitless and not the best use of time.  Instead, you visit, you bask, you remember.  You allow yourself to dream.As a teenager standing at Gramma Dora's fresh gravesite, a fellow mourner came up behind me, but his arm around my shoulder, and said,'You had a real nice Gramma.'  At that moment, I shed tears of sorrow at my loss, and tears of joy of what I had the chance to experience.  Although my visits to Cool and Eclectic don't elicit the same visible response, somewhere deep inside this grown adult, I find that moment again.  And it makes me happy. It makes me feel connected.Thank-you, Cool and Eclectic for being who you are, for being more than big box retail, for giving me the chance to pause and reflect on where I have been and where I am going.
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2014,4/17/2014,83,62,4,9,7>Fantastic little spot tucked away behind a house off of Shore Drive. Upon driving up it looked like the spot was an old house connected to another house next door and the owners converted it into a small eatery. It's a little hard to spot the first time but once you see the pink house you're there.This is the place to go for some good home cooking. Much like their name implies, this is a little reminder of how good mom's cooking can be. They serve breakfast all day, which is always awesome, and they are a little diverse with the menu. I tried their wings as I noticed their sauces are homemade. I had the Thai wings and they were fantastic. The wings were huge, cooked perfectly and the Thai sauce was tasty without being spicy. I'm not a fan of spicy food but I'm sure they can oblige spicy wings. I also tried their french fries which were cut in store and seasoned just right. If I'm correct a little cilantro was thrown on there to add color. The dishes looked great and tasted great, too.The service was friendly as there were two guys running the kitchen. Since I ate there they were nice enough to give me a free smoothie that they made. It wasn't a giant cup but it was a nice gesture which went a long way to making me feel welcome. Already looking forward to checkin' out this spot again and try their breakfast. I'd recommend it, especially considering how good their wings are.  JV
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/17/2013,4/16/2014,96,146,1,5,5>My inner fat kid wanted pizza. Therefore pizza was had!Tried this out for the first time ever. Had the delivery service. Took less then one hour. Pizza was real good. Nice crust. Nice cook on the bottom. Not watery or flimsy. Nice firm foldable piece. Wings were great, sausage on the pizza was kind of bland and the mozzarella sticks were kinda hit or miss however. I enjoyed the meal very much and the pizza itself was what I was after and it didn't disappoint. I recommend this be given a try. If your ordering Pizza Hut or dominos this is above that for sure.
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2013,4/15/2014,533,177,14,28,22>Mariam's blew me away today!!  I stopped in after seeing it on Yelp - on the way to work.  I got a dinner to go.  First off - walking in I found the place to be clean and neat and refreshing.  I was greeted by the owners and a young employee and all were very friendly and helpful.  I was shown the selections and picked Pancit, Chicken Adobo, Sausages and a Beef BBQ on a stick.  Everything smelled great in the Restaurant and looked great.  I also saw fresh steamed crabs and a grilled fish and a lot more that looked amazing.  Mariam gave me a free Turon (bannana desert in a wrap) and it was awesome. When I was checking out - I almost fell over.  The price for this food was around (and I think less than) $7.50.  Amazing.I couldn't wait to have this food at work in the evening.Update - I heated up the great looking food and dove in.  The aroma was great, the food looked fresh and inviting (photo added) and the flavor knocked my socks off.  The Adobo was fall off the bone tender with a hint of sweetness but plenty of hearty flavor.  The BBQ beef was tender and had a fantastic flavor.  The sausages were amazing.  And the Pancit was off the hook great!!  Lots of amazing tasting food and at a great price with friendly people running it.   I hope they stay in business for ever!!  I want to eat here every chance i get!!  Mariam (and crew)  Welcome to Virginia Beach and thanks for making my day!  I'll be back (hopefully tomorrow)Photos added (more soon)Jim
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,4/14/2014,79,115,1,7,5>I finally had the opportunity to try this place for lunch, and I'm so glad I found this place! I would say it's comparable to a Panera Bread or Jason's Deli, but much better.They have a large variety of salads and sandwiches with delicious sides to choose from as well. I liked how the menu was written on a wall-sized chalkboard that you could easily see when you walk in the door. The descriptions of the sandwiches were all so mouth-watering that it was hard to choose just one! I ended up getting the Medi Veggie with sweet potato fries. I was extremely satisfied with my meal and didn't feel like crap afterwards! The bread was very fresh and crispy. The sandwich had a perfect mix of hummus, spinach, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and feta cheese. And I loved the sweet potato fries! They seemed to be fried with a little bit of salt on the outside, which gave you the perfect mix of sweet and salty. I don't think I've ever had sweet potato fries anywhere else that tasted like that.Although the restaurant was packed when we walked in, there were several people with take-out orders and my friend and I snagged a table right away. Our food was also prepared quickly. I definitely have to come back and try some more sandwiches!
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/11/2013,4/13/2014,105,151,7,5,3>Let me just say that I have had a long, amiable relationship with Twist Salon. All of the names in this review have been changed so no one feels uncomfortable.I started getting my hair cut here when I first moved to town in 2003 by a girl..oh let's call her shmAnne.. shmAnne cut my hair for quite some time and did a phenomenal job! Then she had to go and get herself pregnant. I was lost. shmAnne left my life just as quickly as she had entered. It was a true Twilight moment. I wandered the streets of the 757 confused and hurt to say the least. Finally I built up the courage to reenter the salon and trust people again.That's when I met another girl..let's call her shMegan.. shMegan began cutting my hair and doing such a wonderful job that I began to feel guilty not seeing shmAnne.. I would purposely book my appointments on days when I knew shmAnne wasn't in. Every trim felt like a filthy affair with shMegan..but I couldn't stop! She handled the clippers so amazingly. She was like another shmHoudini. I highly recommend this place! The owner shmTodd is a fantastic fellow! Book it ASAP! You won't be sorry!

When you get there, sit in the parking lot for a few minutes and you will notice that at least 50% of the customers leave with a white cup in their hand. Here's why. They make KILLER smoothies! I am seriously addicted to their Dreamsicle - Banana, almond milk, Orange / Banana Fruitein Smoothie. Their cafe has some very healthy and tasty items on their menu. Make sure you check it out!Don't be put off by the bohemian atmosphere. You'll see plenty of dreads and lots of old hippies, but everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. I dig the local produce. Lots of natural products. You can even get a massage here!You'll be guaranteed to leave this place feelin' groovy!

<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2014,4/10/2014,48,178,2,4,4>This place has so much nostalgic value to me. My best friend's parents are members & I spent many summer days with her at the pool during middle & high school. We always used to order their in house made chicken salad sandwiches, that are to this day the best chicken salad I've ever had. I loved all the food you could order from the grill. It also became my first job when I was 16, working as a banquet & pool server. I had worked many a weddings here during high school & was happy this past weekend to return after almost a decade (sigh) for one of my childhood friend's wedding reception.  It's a great place for a small/medium sized reception. Plenty of views of the water & a large deck on the back for party goers. Couldn't tell you a thing about the golf course, but the clubhouse is fabulous!!
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/30/2013,4/9/2014,59,189,3,9,4>It's a beautiful venue, mostly because it's new.  What do I know about architecture?There was a really bossy usher, who literally shoved me aside after she told me the [wrong] way to go.  But thereafter, all the ushers were overly friendly and responsive. Seated on the first floor (orchestra) in about the 10th row, I was able to enjoy a clear and comfortable view of the Moscow Ballet's Great Russian Nutcracker.I cannot comment on the highly raved acoustics of the theatre, because there was no orchestra.  (What a flop, Moscow.)  However, the recorded music sounded great and filled the venue.I will most definitely return.  For live music.  Or anything, really.  I love the arts.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/8/2014,4/8/2014,122,43,14,17,12>Okay, here we go...I've been meaning to get around to reviewing Happy Times Food Mart for quite some time and figured I'd do one before my next semester started up and I further procrastinated. My fellow Yelpers, lend me thine ear...or, rather, thine eyes...Happy Times Food Mart, or as I just like to call it, Happy Times, is a bit, ummm...let's see, how can I put this in layman's terms? Alright, to hell with it -- Happy Times is located in the 'HOOD! Nestled at the corner of George Washington Highway and Elm Street it's outwardly appearance isn't exactly going to give you a warm and fuzzy feeling. But that jerk sauce will...The parking lot is littered with potholes and in some cases -- trenches! Yeah, so if you have one of those "smart" cars or lowered trucks you may want to park on the side street adjacent to the property known as Lindsay Avenue. There's a 7-Eleven across the street to the east and a mom and pop mechanic shop across the street to the north.Here's the scoop and the skinny people: I discovered this place one day when I was stuck at the light during rush hour and looked up and saw a sign that read "Curried Goat, Jerk Chicken, Oxtails" and it was a wrap! The inner West Indian/Latino in me was willing to look past the outwardly appearance and take a chance. The store isn't the prettiest or most aesthetic but I'm a former Sailor. I used to eat in a place called the "mess decks"! You can definitely tell upon entering that it's an older store and was probably something else years ago but the setup inside makes sense. There are aisles of goods from washing detergent to cat litter. There are ample refrigerated items to choose everything from juices and sodas to an assortment of malt liquors and those energized frou frou beers. No thanks. I always say "hello" upon entrance and then make the beeline to the back of the store where there's a buffet-like setup that usually features several entrees like jerk chicken, curry chicken, oxtails, stew chicken, curry goat with sides like rice and peas, yellow rice with vegetables, cabbage, string beans, yams, corn and other items. The selections change daily but the cabbage is pretty much a mainstay as a side. They have lunch specials where you get one entree and one side for like $6 or something like that. I rarely ever get there for lunch so I always end up getting the dinner which is perfect for a strapping young lad like me. That generally means I get the jerk chicken with two sides -- rice and peas and cabbage. I also tell Earl (the cook) to scoop a couple spoonfuls of jerk sauce over my rice. If you don't ask then he may ask you. Helpful note: Earl makes pans of food fresh daily so when he leaves and the pans sell out then that's it. I've been to the store enough times to know the timing pretty well. If you venture inside to get food, do so before 6:30 - 7:00 p.m. or else you may be looking at items that run out. The store owners tell me hungry Sailors come through and clean them out. The food: Look, I've visited more of the "upscale" and aesthetic Jamaican restaurants in the area and they're cool and all...but Happy Times, to me, beats them in taste and quality. Dare I say that the food evokes memories of my childhood! I think that's why I visit here so much...the staff is cool and laid back and the food reminds me of better days when I was a youth visiting my grandmother in Flatbush.Okay, enough of the sentimental stuff. Let me wrap this novel up...In CONCLUSION, Happy Times offers great food for a great price. The portion sizes are very sufficient. I'm far from a petite dude and I never finish a meal feeling jipped. You get plenty of bang for the buck here. I will also say that Happy Times isn't spot on everytime. Some days my jerk isn't as spicy as I like it or may be a tad bit too salty. But me and the cook/store owners are cool enough to where I mention it to them and adjustments are made. The location is in a very urban part of town so if you decide to visit keep your head on a swivel and you will be fine. They take credit cards but the purchase has to be over $6 I think. Oh! And watch out for those potholes! Don't say I didn't warn ya!
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2013,4/7/2014,163,183,4,13,5>Kimchi that's not "salty"? What!? Who knew? Asahi freaking rocks! Sadly my wallet does not think so. We've been here a few times with a good amount of people, so they always seat us in the private/karaoke room. They have an awesome karaoke system, but it's only limited use for certain times? At least that's from what I could remember. The decor is your typical modern day Asian restaurant. It's not too upscale but certainly no hole in the wall. Restroom is always clean and is in the rear of the restaurant. The food, fan-effing-tastic! I think everyone loved their food and the many side dishes. The least favorite was the beans, but not at all because they taste bad or anything, but just as a personal preference. I've tried the dak bulgogi and the Haemul Dolsot Bibimbap on different occasions and both were terrific. The flavors were all there and it was the perfect blend of spices! Also, they serve amazing soju! They have what they call "Yogurt Soju" which tastes similar to what a yakult would taste if it was alcoholic. Careful with this one, it will sneak up on you on both the price (each big bottle cost around $27) and the alcohol. They also have watermelon and pineapple soju, which are contained in their respective fruit. The server we got is always fun and friendly! Just a hint, order way ahead of time before you plan on going here with a big group. It saves so much time! Just make sure you keep an organized spreadsheet of who pre-ordered each dish. Also note, they are redoing their bar area to extend around the karaoke lounge, so they currently have that space closed off (No Karaoke for a little bit, sad panda!
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2014,4/6/2014,64,171,11,6,5>Nothing makes me happier than a Mexican restaurant where the staff speaks very little English.  This place is as authentic as they come.  500x better than any Azteca if you ask me.I ordered the Mojarra y Camaron.Pro tip:  this dish is an ENTIRE fish.  A whole tilapia with head, fins, tail.....everything.  Totally not what I thought I was getting.  I ordered thinking I was getting a couple fish sticks and shrimp.  Nah, I got an entire deep fried tilapia looking up at me likeWAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZUP.After Nemo and I bonded, I removed his head and fins and dug in.  Very tasty.   The shrimp was cooked well, not rubbery.  The rice was fresh and not sticky.   I will never order this again, not for lack of being delicioso, because it absolutely was.....I'm just not a fan of eating food that is still looking at me.   I'll definitely come back to Mi Casita, it's a little gem of a restaurant.
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2014,4/5/2014,18,133,,6,5>The mailer for $1 off brought me in (what can I say, I'm a sucker for any deal), but I'm glad because I would have never known it existed without it!The good: Very clean inside, classic boba/asian theme on the inside that would fit in anywhere in SoCal. The workers were incredibly nice and gave us free popcorn while we waited for our drink! The store itself was surprisingly big, so I understand why other reviewers mentioned it would be a good place to hang out and study or read (especially with the free wifi--which doesn't surprise me much since it seems like it's almost an expectation now). The boba itself was pretty decent, but not the absolute best I've had. The tapioca was perfectly cooked and the rainbow jelly was plentiful! The not so good: It was a little strange but there was really no place to park to come here! We ended up parking on the backside of the building, but it seemed a little shady and I'm not totally sure we were allowed to park there. I also thought the boba was overpriced--even with our $1 off. $5-6 for a sm/lg is just too much in my opinion--it's not like they are using fresh fruit! Also, they claim to have pastries, but the only ones I saw were pre-packaged ones that looked the same as ones you'd find in a gas station...I thought it was strange, but maybe they intend to have real pastries in the future?Overall: It's always nice to have a boba place in this boba-desert called hampton roads. The store is pretty cool and service was great! The prices...not as much. The boba was very good but not the best, but good enough for me to come back.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/2/2014,4/4/2014,76,81,2,8,6>This place is amazing! Definitely my favorite pho restaurant in the 757! We're from va beach, and is definitely worth the little drive here! First off, the appetizers. You have to try their sweet and spicy wings! It's so good, and they give you a generous amount. It's full of flavor! We also tried their spring rolls, which was delicious as well! Also, they sell French fries! I LOVE French fries, and was totally not expecting that. As far as their pho, what made me really love this place is how they sell kid size portions. I rarely am able to finish a small sized pho, so seeing this option made me super happy! It's the perfect size for me! Their pho is so good and they have many options to choose from. Lastly, another cool thing they offer is boba. My good friend is obsessed with boba and was thrilled they sell it! He said that it was really good, and is excited to try different flavors. It's safe to say that we are definitely coming back, even though we have to drive a little farther! :)
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2013,4/3/2014,509,292,2,10,7>I am so happy this place has finally opened its doors. Located in what I call the "mom corner" of Hilltop, it's such a better alternative to neighboring Starbucks. I must admit, I exploited my son for promises of free coffee, so he was a part of their cute commercial advertisement they posted on the internet. I became pretty chatty with the owners wife through this. Their vision was great, I love that they serve food other than pastries and the KeepCup idea they have is fantastic. I have yet to get mine, but soon!! I have tried several of their flavored coffees and so far, their mocha is my favorite. The coffee itself has a unique flavor to it, like nothing I have ever tried before but I absolutely enjoy it. Artisan creates the pastries and soups, which are so delicious. I have yet to eat anything here that wasn't pleasing to my palate. The soups are especially delicious. The baristas are all super friendly and "coffee creative" and the interior decor is simple, but hip. I love the indie tunes playing in the background as well. All in all this is a great little addition to VA Beach. I always dig a unique spot and they definitely have their own little thing going on. Check it out, you will not be disappointed!
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/3/2013,4/2/2014,198,161,3,6,4>So many beer options your head will spin.  Our server was very knowledgeable of the beer list and could answer many questions which I found impressive.  I ordered the Reuben schnitzel which was not only a tasty sandwich but attractive too!  Many people enjoy the vinegar potato salad.  I tried it and it just wasn't for me. The vinegar was overwhelming.  My only complaint is that there is absolutely no healthy menu options unless you order a side salad which is super small and consists of iceburg lettuce and a few vegetables.
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2014,4/1/2014,99,254,3,4,3>Update to my first review On my second trip here, I found vegan options a plenty. They were both inspired and delicious! Vegan risotto, kale salad, quinoa salad, roasted cauliflower and hazelnut salad, and last night's phenomenal special - asparagus tempura with a light, crunchy chickpea batter. Every single thing we ordered was spectacular. I also learned from another yelper that the Montessori school provides an extra source of parking after the school closes.The service continues to exceed expectations and our hostess, wait staff, and I believe the owner all worked hard to ensure we felt welcome.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/8/2014,3/31/2014,14,98,,4,4>So, I decided to try this place out with some friends after reading up on some YELP reviews from fellow yelpers and YOU guys are right on the spot! This place is awesome. Great staff, very accommodating, very quiet interiors, nice decor, prices were reasonable and let me tell you about their food. Food = DELICIOUS!This was my 2nd time trying out THAI food and I must say, because of this place, I am IN!This is a great place to dine. Even though it's tucked away and hidden from the main road, is it very elegant and nice.We had a fantastic time. We will be going back there again.
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/24/2014,3/30/2014,72,106,,6,4>So I finally made it to Judy's! I missed like 6 UYE events so I have been wanting to try it although i was very intimidated with the food, as I thought i wouldn't find anything I would like but your typical american Asian dishes I know....Which I ordered to be safe...Beef and Broccoli! Everything was great! I tried things I never knew I would like. Like all others say the onion pancakes are great. It was all good, Id like to go back and experiment more!

Aside from the girl on girl dancing in the middle of the floor throughout the night...this place is super awesome!!  The lighting, the DJ, the free admission...a good time is just waiting to happen every Friday night.The dress code was relaxed as well.  So relaxed that I thought some people just came from the playground...hmmmmmm...but everyone were in good spirits.  I will definitely return REAL SOON...they have some themed parties coming up.The food...I had the steak and chicken skewers.  They were served on a grilled pineapple.  The presentation was awesome...I believe I included pics.  Now unless they were supposed to be served cold...they both were chilled (COLD).  It wasn't so bad that we couldn't eat them...but when I think of steak and chicken...ummmmm I'll take it hot please for $200 alex!!  Nevertheless, my girl and I ate it all...very good flavor!!!I'm definitely looking forward to trying more menu options. They also offer happy hour...I believe 7 days a week.There is VIP seating and few table tops with chairs as well.  Get there early as I assume it starts to fill by 1130...12a.  They close at 2a.  And there is plenty of parking.  The venue is located in a shopping center.  I might add the venue itself is just the right size.  Not too big and definitely not a match box.  They have 2 exits....so in my booking they are winning!!  Safety first :)Hope you can make it...if it's a Friday, you will definitely have a good time. #cherrystamp of approvalIt's for the crowd that enjoys R&B, rap and soul music...Friday night that is.  I believe Thursday nights are set aside as ladies night and top 40 is played.Be good...have fun :)
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2014,3/28/2014,107,136,7,13,7>Absolutely the BEST Gyro meat I've had in many years!!!! I am such a pig in mud! I ordered a Greek Salad w/ Gyro meat, a side of Tzatziki, and pita. I have ALWAYS ordered gyros/Greek Salads like this so I can make my own little baby gyros! Hehe AND let me tell you, I enjoyed EVERY scrumptious bite!!! I saved pieces of my pita to sop up the juices on my plate!! Wow.... Luckily, I was the only one in the restaurant because, I know I was making a lot of noise with each bite! For those that venture out here... Don't miss the driveway to the parking lot behind the building! If ya blink, you'll have to turn around! It's SOOO worth it tho!Delivery was quick & service was spot-on!I left finding Tzatziki on my pants & STILL tasted the remnants of spices! Excellent! Kudos for making this woman's day!
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/15/2013,3/27/2014,84,331,1,7,4>Should have got the pho...looked so good! Instead I got the chicken curry which came with chicken breast chunks, carrots, and potatoes. Soup-like and pretty tasty, although the texture of the potatoes were off and my coworker's vermicelli was a better choice than rice. Generous portion, under $8 and came with a free plate of fresh watermelon, so I was happy.I look forward to coming back and trying the grilled meat combo. They also have a nice variety of Asian drinks like soybean milk and Vietnamese coffee. Looks like they don't have banh mi or boba, just FYI.
<review# 246,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2014,3/26/2014,37,327,,6,4>Super friendly server, food was excellent!! Had pictures on wall of many meals but menu was descriptive enough.I had a steak quesotaco.  It was corn tortillas, onions, cilantro, and some cheese between the tortilla layers.  It was simple but tasty.  My gordita was a nice surprise. I got chicken and wow, was this flavorful!  I enjoyed the gordita very much!One child had a quesadilla.  This is good cheese, not your basic block from the local store.  We all really liked the flavor.  Rich.  My other child got a chicken chimichanga with the queso on top.  WOW, it was full of chicken and the flavor of it all together was perfect.  My husband got the supreme burrito.  Rice/beans/steak.....the steak tasted very good and it was layered very well.  Like perfectly balanced......not like some places where you end up with sour cream on one end.  This was perfect all the way through with all ingredients.  The rice and beans on the plates are way better than other 'mexican' places in the area.  The server was helpful when we said we had never eaten there.  Offered a lot of info about the meals without rushing us.  I love the HUGE cups of drinks.  When I needed a refill I begged for just a little in the bottom....no way I could drink 2 glassfuls lol.  The chips are thick.  Salsa was on the hotter side for the kids.  And the guacamole was chunky and mild.  There are desserts but we didn't have any.  And there is a store attached here....with more sweets and tons of products.  We don't live near this place but came to try it out and was very happy with all our food and service.  We will be back to try more.
<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2013,3/25/2014,40,107,1,8,5>What can I say that hasn't already been said? Nothing. This place is amazing.I got the Mr. Close Love, and the pork shoulder is crazy tender, nicely seasoned (without being salty), and is paired well with the sweet hot mustard & cucumber slices. The sweet potato biscuit is really, really tasty. Not at all dry and crumbly like most biscuits tend to be. I'd gladly come back just for the plain biscuits.I swiped a bite of my boyfriend's Bleu Blazer (what's his is mine, right? I think that's how that saying goes) and the chicken was excellent. Meat was tender and juicy, and the outside was crispy and wonderfully seasoned.The house soda (at the time, apple ginger, I believe) was great, too. If you aren't a fan of sugary sweet drinks, you'll love it.Whatever you get here, you won't be disappointed. Suggestions:A sign on the door asking everyone to keep the door shut while waiting in line would be helpful. We had been waiting in line behind people who had held the door open for a good 10+ minutes before a guy came and told *us* to keep it shut. A sign would help customers from feeling singled out.Also - as cute as the striped straws are - they are cardboard, and get soggy really fast. Unless you chug your tasty house soda immediately upon receipt the plastic up lid will tear the straw, and it will eventually fall apart on you.Other than that - this place is great. It's 100% worth the wait (and our wait for two orders, on a busy Saturday morning, was approximately 30 minutes). We'll definitely be returning again & again.
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/29/2013,3/24/2014,17,153,3,7,4>Took the girls to see the showdown between the Seven City Sirens and the Black Rose Rollers from Hanover, PA.  It was our first time checking out the roller derby, and I dare say it won't be our last.  (The kid has already started making plans to sign up as soon as she's 18)  Both teams looked like they were having a good time, even though the Sirens were kicking ass.  But, one thing we found out early is that points can rack up quick under the right circumstance, so you can't really count a team out until it's over.  This keeps even a seemingly lopsided event exciting.Looking forward to the next one.  Go Sirens!
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/23/2013,3/23/2014,28,86,,5,5>Wow! I wasn't expecting much and never batted an eye passing right by this place on Lynnhaven pkwy, but all that changed a couple Sundays ago.Friends of ours took us here for lunch (they swore by how good the food was!) So we came, not expecting much from the looks of the outside , walked in & decor was kind of confusing. Not sure what they were going for but we sat down . They gave us free garlic knots (what!) that were fresh and delicious. The group got a pizza to split ,but I had to be the oddball & got a sandwich. It was some kind of fried chicken sandwich on a ciabbata  bun. It tasted fresh and perfect! And the fries were soooooooooooo good. (yes that good). I know it wasn't an extraordinarily unique meal but they did it right! And at $7 it was a STEAL.Our waitress was so friendly & kind, it made the delicious meal even better!Then a couple days ago we ordered pizza for take-out...grande white pizza & added chicken & spinach. Droooool. Yep, it was FANTATASTIC. I have high standards for the quality of my food & apparently they do too...chicken & spinach were fresh! (unlike the usual frozen crap)  For $12 we got a fantastic large pizza...Also, a huge plus is they have online ordering! We will be coming here more often! Their prices are good & their food is FRESH (just like their name)  The only thing setting them back is the location. For some reason they chose a  shopping plaza where noone goes to  (next to the family dollar) Don't understand why they'd have such nice food in such a *not nice* area, but it won't stop me from coming back!

<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/10/2014,3/19/2014,27,57,,8,6>O Chic N Fish. You are one of the places I miss most about being stationed in horrible, horrible Norfolk. I remember the first time I convinced my husband to give you a try. He was mad that he didn't listen to my earlier attempts at getting him to try something new. I also remember that you were the first place I wanted to eat at right after I had my second baby. Sure enough, on my way back from the hospital, we stopped by and picked up enough food to feed an army (even though it was just my husband and I eating) and had a celebratory feast for bringing our newborn home. The extra painful bumps in the road post -cesarean was definitely worth sinking my teeth into your chicken. Even though I now have several Bonchon's in my new area, I still think of you. I especially miss your mac n cheese. How does a Korean place make such delicious mac n cheese? Your chicken is spot on and delicious and I could eat your pickled daikon as a snack all day long. And, your bulgogi is also really delicious. It tastes authentic and homemade. I didn't want to write a review until I left the area because, selfishly, I wanted you to be my little dirty, fried chicken secret. Others may complain that your food takes too long to make. But, that is only because it is made with care and love. Go to KFC If you want crappy fried chicken made quickly. But, for flavorful chicken, you guys own my fat heart. Language barriers aside, your service has always been informal and welcoming. I will truly miss your restaurant when we move completely out of driving range. But, until then, I will make sure I make a pit stop the next time I decide to drive down into the area.
<review# 254,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/10/2014,3/18/2014,34,139,,8,6>A beautiful place to enjoy some free trails and enjoy nature along the bay.  There are more trails than I had realized.  We even had the unique pleasure of a harbor seal sighting.  The kids enjoyed watching the snails slither along on the banks and the playground next to where CBF's Brock Environmental Center is being built.  This also seems to be a popular place for people to walk their dogs.  The next time you need a little fresh air go check out the trails at Pleasure House Point.
<review# 255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2013,3/17/2014,46,168,2,5,4>This place is gorgeous. A beautiful state of the art piece of architecture, steel and glass. It's amazing walking up to it at night because it's like a well lit glass house and since the walls are primarily glass you can see into most if the rooms. You can see people studying, having meetings, busying themselves with other activities.I spent countless hours in libraries as a child. I was a huge reader, and libraries were  my intellectual amusement park. This place could have been my Disney if it were around 2+decades ago. They have these awesome study rooms that look like observation rooms to me. Glass on three sides. With a large LCD screen mounted on the back wall. But no food allowed in the rooms. Not sure I could study for hours without food though.The bathroom is pretty far away, deep in the middle of the library, far from the circulation desk and the cafe. Perhaps this is for safety & convenience reasons. It is near the children's area. There is a second restroom at another location.Everything here is bright, clean, organized, modern and comfortably inviting.
<review# 256,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/6/2013,3/16/2014,43,132,,5,4>This is my favorite Mexican place in Hampton Roads.  I've been going here since 1999.  The staff is friendly and provide great service.  The food is delicious and is served steaming hot and very quickly.  They have a wide choice of drinks : beer, margaritas, etc.  I like the recent addition of having fresh guacamole made tableside.  I've tried too many dishes to list and I've never been disappointed.  We are here once or twice a month.  I sometimes sneak in without the family for lunch.  (Don't tell them.)
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2013,3/15/2014,31,234,6,7,5>Eat here. Don't question. Just go.Oh, you want me to elaborate? That kinda seems like you're questioning my recommendation. Well, service was fast and friendly. I had a plate of sides (pick three for $7). Huge portions delivered quickly. Collards, mac & cheese, candied yams. I couldn't finish it all. Compared to the collards at Chow, these are better. Compared to the mac &  cheese at AW Shucks, these are better. The yams will put you in a diabetic coma.Now, Julia was kind enough to let me have a fried chicken wing. She ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of spinach. If we are talking just fried chicken (not sauced, not flavored just a big fat wing and a seasoned skin), well I'm here to tell you it was the best I have ever had. Since the dawn of my taste buds, there has never been a better fried chicken wing to pass these lips. Waffles were hearty, spinach was bright, syrup was a throw away, but at that point I really could not care less. Eat here. And when you do, take me with you.
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/12/2014,3/14/2014,122,469,4,15,5>Finally something cool in Hampton Roads! I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile since there haven't been many reviews but its opening was surrounded by scandal. After a partnership with the shady ex-Guad's owner who was on the lam, the initial owner, Ernesto Alonso, had a bunch of his liquid capital stolen and had to be bought out by new owners. It's a shame when this happens because often the vision of the restaurant becomes watered down with a change of management. I hope this place can survive, however, despite all the controversy surrounding it. Walking inside, the place is huge and open; would be great for parties or work events (AHEM, Xerxes....elite event???). We showed up on a Saturday evening, while it was pretty much dead but I imagine this place to be the more late night/after hours spot. The menus are horribly awkward wooden things that take up much of the table and threaten to knock over your drink. What a weird thing, to have oversized, wooden menus. But I have to say, for a lounge, even perhaps masquerading as a bar, the food was outstanding. We started with a coconut ceviche that had a bunch of shrimp and lobster pieces. Fresh, creative, and well executed. I ordered the carne asada with a side of plantains and my friend ordered the crab cakes with some starchy veggie side that the server claimed was very good but was not. I don't think she had actually ever even tried it. Our entrees, however, were excellent. My carne asada had all the fix-ins and a nice corn tortilla that you could tell was purchased at an authentic mexican tienda (think Jesse's). Onto the drinks. The lead bartender, Josh, is very knowledgeable and passionate about his job, if not a bit too verbose for my liking. It sounds like he takes pride in creating many new concoctions that are not on the menu and changing them up weekly. The drinks listed on the hard menu looked great but apparently they were created pre-change of management and he prefers not to make them. His list was comprised of many masculine liquors (such as bourbon, whiskeys, cognacs, gins), which I found bizarre because this is, in fact, a tequila lounge and most people are here to drink TEQUILA. Frankly, I just think he catered a lot of the menu to HIS tastes, as opposed to what the general population would prefer. The drink menu begs to feature more tequila cocktails that really allow the star of the place, tequila, to shine. The drinks are served in very skinny, petite glasses, which is probably done to use less alcohol. My cocktail was $14. This isn't Manhattan, so for $14 I would like to be knocked on my ass not get a puny pour. With that said, he was very informative in guiding us through a couple tequila flights, that range from $25-30. It was interesting to compare young tequila to more aged varietals. If you come here, I highly suggest sitting up at the bar and letting Josh customize a tequila flight for you. I would pass on the undersized, overpriced cocktails, however.Service was friendly enough; I realize it's a new place and new management has come in but again, for the prices, everyone seemed kind of undertrained and a bit unsure of themselves. This is a tequila lounge, have hot servers come out who know their shit and can tell you anything about the menu and introduce you to new things. The bathrooms are a bit off too; I think they used to be a closet. When you walk in, you get welcomed with a hand-dryer to the face, a trashcan in the middle of the floor and a soap dispenser less than 2 inches above the counter. Above the entrance to the restaurant is a large projection screen that serves no purpose. I asked if it was for karaoke or conferences or something and got a bunch of non-answers. Weird things like that. I would like to see this place do a bit more marketing and introducing some events, like happy hours or guided tequila flights (as Josh suggested) or an advertised DJ with some upbeat dance music. They need a webmaster and an events coordinator (maybe salsa or merengue dance night). It has SO MUCH potential, I just hope these new owners have a similar vision as Ernesto. This needs to be a chic, hip place that couples and parties want to come out to late night, buy a couple bottles and hear some good music. Time will tell if it will work out these initial kinks and become that place.
<review# 259,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/10/2013,3/9/2014,38,84,2,6,7>When my spouse was out of town for work, the kid and I had our dinner date here. The kid and I started dinner with appetizers. I had the chicken skewers while kiddo had the seasonal pumpkin soup. I asked her how her soup was, which she responded with two thumbs up! And my chicken was extremely tender. Our waiter, Chad, was very attentive with us, making sure that everything was to our liking and that our glasses were always filled. After the first coarse, we shared an entree between the two of us. Usually when we do this, I have to ask the server for an extra plate, but once the food arrived, Chad made sure that the meal was split between us on separate plates. The little things like what Chad had done made our dining experience wonderful.In our house we had what we normally call the manna of the sea, which is mostly referred  by others as sea scallops, were extremely tender, just cooked to perfection and as I'm reviewing about the scallops, I'm still salivating over the taste of it. Later in the evening, it turns into a place to hang out, see and be seen. The social night life really opens up here. And as far as the food goes, we will definitely be back
<review# 260,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/31/2013,3/8/2014,298,491,3,8,4>Regino's may not look like much from the outside, but there is much more to this 70+ year old family business once you step inside. There is no mistaking the exterior is indeed an old Pizza Hut. However the food cranked out from the kitchen of this Norfolk eatery is anything but ordinary chain grub. The history of this family establishment dates back three generations of Regino's. First located on Main St. in downtown Norfolk, then later Wards Corner in Norfolk and now it's present day home for twelve years on East Little Creek close to the Ocean View area in Norfolk.It's present day location is  just a quarter mile from Gate 2 Little Creek off of Shore Dr. it is easy to find. Look for it on the North side of the road and you will see banners for "Best of" for different years all along the East side. Parking was fine on my visit tonight, but if completely packed I could see an issue.I have been wanting to check this place out for a long time after seeing rave reviews from Joe D. and others. So what better time than New Years eve with the family. I had planned on take out and reviewing the menu once I arrived. I told the sweet middle aged woman that it was my first time and needed a menu to review. I was immediately treated like family on my first visit.  After discussing some options and recommendations I ordered a starter of fried ravioli and half peperoni, sausage. According to the woman everything is homemade and fresh. While waiting for pizza and set up at bar with a soda and bread on the house. The bread was hot and incredibly delicious.The inside is dark and cozy with a small bar in the middle. The dining room seating have perimeter booths , just like the ole style of the previous restaurant that occupied it's space. The decor is somewhat dated, but dare say it is charming and has a comfortable vibe.Lucky for me I was in early enough to avoid a big crowd and my take out order was ready in 15 minutes, or so. After arriving home in around 10 minutes the pizza and ravioli were still hot. They put a loaf of bread in with the order as well, so a great treat for the family to enjoy too. A nice size of Marinara sauce was included with the fried ravioli. After getting everything unpacked and on plates it was time to sample this great smelling chow. The pizza was super cheesy and had a healthy amount of meat spread all over every piece of real estate. I enjoyed the taste and texture of the pie which is a departure from you will commonly find. Everything was so fresh, but the crust was the hero, not greasy in the least and like a puff pastry. Not to be out down by the fried cheese ravioli which was down right scrumptious. I kept those bad boys dunked in the delicious red sauce often.I only held back a star because it was my first visit and I did not experience eating in the dining room. There is no hype in the reviews on Regino's. So when Joe D. says it's the best pizza in Hampton Roads I am not going to pick a fight with him and dispute his opinion. I look forward to coming back and providing an update.
<review# 261,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/20/2014,3/7/2014,74,230,5,8,6>This place rocks!  We have driven by it a bunch since it opened and we occasionally see Mario out encouraging us to come on in to check it out.  So, we did.  The first thing to know is that this place specializes in old school games.  I am sure they have new selections at good prices but I wouldn't know because I was too distracted by the Atari 2600 and Intellivision games.  Seriously.  If you are old like me, you remember the days when these systems were ruling the earth.  Well, they sell games for them.   In fact, they sell games for any system you can imagine from your childhood, no matter how old you are.  It is a very cool place.  I didn't look for Tecmo Bowl but I should have.  If you are too young to remember Tecmo Bowl, sorry, your childhood is incomplete!Anyway, I had an old PS2 stored away from back in the day so the boys bought a Star Wars PS2 game for like six bucks.  They loved it.  I guess the retro feel is exciting to them, too.  I would guess that we will go back soon to buy some other games.  If you are into game systems, this place will likely be right up your alley.
<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,1.0,12/21/2013,3/6/2014,8,13,1,5,5>You would have to pay me to go back. Let me just throw some logic your way. You are a drive in. People like to be out when it is nice out. Therefore you should expect to be busy when it is nice out. It would probably bc beneficial to learn how to operate under such stress because right now you SUCK at it. Here's another little food for thought, paper and pencil. Maybe if your servers wrote down the order I wouldn't have to repeat it 4 times AND it would be the correct order when I finally receive it 40 min later. A 100 year old blind man with no limbs would have been more efficient running this establishment today . Let me preface this by saying I was born and raised up north and apparently "we don't do BBQ right". That being said I really wish the pulled pork was covered in a sweet BBQ sauce. The meat itself was good and juicy, just lacking that BBQ flavor to me. I also got a strawberry float which I found to be way way way too sweet! My husband got the limeade and really enjoyed it! Best part of my visit was the famous waffle cone and butter pecan ice cream. Another plus is it's pretty darn cheap. Husband and I both had sandwiches and fries with floats and dessert for under $20. I think I'll stick with this place more for an ice cream run or end of paycheck but I don't feel like cooking run.
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2013,3/5/2014,73,159,11,15,10>Holy donut-holes! I'm not normally a fan of cake donuts, but. But. BUT!! Wowza!Let's get through the boring stuff first. This shop is located next to the place that sells batteries in the strip plaza across from the new-ish Twenty-One complex on 21st St. There's a traffic light specifically for the plaza, and a large parking lot. Score and score on location. You place your order at the back an pick up at he counter in the front on your way out the door. Very beautiful decor, well thought-out. I didn't see any seating inside, but there was a table outside. This is definitely a Grab & Go Deal. But oh, baby, oh!It's a great idea, actually. They coat your donut with your choice of glaze or coating, and top it with an assortment of bits and pieces, pack it in a box and send you on your way with a smile. The donuts themselves are fluffy with a crispy golden exterior. I got a plain one to try (no coat, no frills), so trust me in this. The flavor was good with a very vague hint of something citrusy -- probably some lemon juice or zest. Not overpowering or in any way noticeable when eating a coated, topped donut. The PB-glazed, Reese's cup donut I just devoured was out. of. this. world.Go to O's. Taste some magic. Get some stretchy pants and put on some poundage for your winter hibernation.
<review# 264,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/5/2013,3/4/2014,91,52,1,11,7>The Dirty Buffalo is my favorite wing place in Norfolk. I've gone here twice, and the waitstaff has been consistently helpful with their recommendations and their service. It's space is small, but I went at about 8:30 PM on their Wednesday wing night both times and it wasn't very busy. Other reviews say that it gets packed, but maybe that's around 7:00PM. Anyways, when you order wings, be patient! It takes a while because they are made to order. And also, their wing night has changed from $0.50/wing to $0.60/wing. I love that the wings are fried then sauced. The ends of the wings are perfectly crispy, and the sauces are delicious. If you come here, be sure to ask if they have any special flavors! They often have a flavor that isn't listed on their menu, and it's usually super delicious.
<review# 265,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2013,3/3/2014,66,117,3,4,4>I've been here a few times to hang out with the goats and birds and stuff. Lots of fun, lots of four legged things to pet (although the llama or alpaca thing always looks like he's about to spit at you), and overall a cool place to visit.  But really, it's almost a must-do in Virginia Beach at Halloween to do the Haunted Hunt Club.Been coming here for Haunted Hunt Club for at least the past five years straight. And every year they get better at doing it.  Two haunted walk-thru areas and a hay ride.  Save the Hay ride for last, because it's usually the best.  Just be careful and eyeball any groups that may be walking with you because you're more in danger of some random stranger freaking out and accidentally smacking into you than you are of an actor doing the same thing.Definitely hit this place up for Halloween.  And even if it's not Halloween, go there and pet a goat.  They're cute. And creepy.

<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2013,3/1/2014,83,478,1,6,3>I thought this place was great.  I wasn't expecting much when I saw that it was located in the upstairs portion of the house it shares with Texture and walking across the porch laden with bum-ly looking college students (sorry guys - I was there once too) but once I walked up the charming stairs to the top I saw that it was a hidden gem!  It's clean, neat, and tidy, but still has some small coffee shop charm.  There was a ton of space for seating, with lots of tables and they had board games you can play.  The bathroom was roomy and clean and nice and they have a pretty large menu with some food items (muffins and brownies and such) and teas, coffees, iced drinks, and frappes.  I had just eaten the huge breakfast at Handsome Biscuit so I didn't have any space for anything to drink though I saw several things I want to come back and try, The Godfather looked interesting as well as their Chai.  I pretty much try the Chai everywhere and decide from there if it's a legit place - because if it's all watery and powder I know it's not the good stuff.  I'll be sure to come back and spend some time here when the weather gets nice again.  I wish I had known about this place while getting my M.A. at ODU.  I'd have loved to have had a place like this to go study before my late night classes but I didn't know about it back then.  Ah well, I'll be back!

<review# 269,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2013,2/27/2014,63,174,3,8,4>A sneak local's park in the Great Neck area of Va Beach, Great Neck Park is located a stone's throw from the Great Neck Recreation Center, on the banks of the Lynnhaven River.  There are all the usual park amenities available here, including wonderful landscaping, picnic and grilling areas in small shelters and under majestic trees, a play area with swings, etc. for the kids, walking/jogging paths, and always clean and well maintained rest rooms.  But what makes this park really special is its location on the banks of the Lynnhaven, and its beautiful gazebo.  It's a really idyllic setting, and is often used for weddings, art shows, and lots of other local events and functions.  And yet, somehow, the park is never overrun with people; it's never crowded to the point where you're not able to enjoy the solitude, and feel a part of the surroundings.  So it's with some trepidation that I write this review of, and highly recommend, my favorite small park in Va Beach.  You can bet that, if I'd been the "First to Review," this review would never have been written.
<review# 270,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/14/2013,2/26/2014,129,351,1,6,4>Nice facility with friendly experienced staff that are welcoming to beginners. If you're considering giving yoga a try this is a great place to start. I stink despite trying for some time and in spite of my inabilities I always feel welcome being there. The yoga room is more than large enough to comfortably accommodate 10 to 12 students. There are two decently sized locker/restrooms and a single message room, which I haven't tried so I don't have anything to say on the message therapist. There's also an extra storage box at the entrance if the locker rooms are full.There are plenty of mats, towels and yoga supplies so no need to have anything other than yourself when you get there. Prices are decent and the location is convenient for most Chesapeake residents.Overall this is a nice place for yoga. It's clean, relaxing and has good instructors. Not sure if the prices are competitive compared to the beach? Still I give it 4 Stars and hopefully will get myself there a little more regularly, I certainly need it.
<review# 271,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,2/25/2014,34,46,1,4,4>What a great event! Walking in from the cold weather into a warm (heated) and friendly event, you were welcomed at the door. Check in tables by last name made getting registered very easy. As you made your way into the event, there were tables for the silent auction. After passing that you walked into the grand room. A half circle of chefs and restaurants greeted you not only with sight, but delicious smell. As we made our first circle around to check out the food, you couldn't help but want up just jump in line and get food. Our plan was to start savory and end sweet. Well, that didn't work out as so many places had both! The group I was with loved Smalls BBQ with their pork belly, but I have to say, my favs of the night were Bravo! Bacon cookies and 80/20's brownies. Holy cow. I could have died and gone to heaven after eating those two treats. Overall, the atmosphere and ambiance added to a phenomenal evening that wasn't you're typical Saturday night. I look forward to next years event! Thanks to Xerxes for hooking it up.

I need to have the Chorizo & Queso dip with chips.  While it was flavorful, it wasn't the most memorable of appetizers, next time it's the scallops for me. For my main entree I managed to resist the urge to get the Three Tacos featured on DD&D, and instead went with the Jamaican Jerk after my waitress confirmed the blue cheese gnocchi were fantastic.  The dish was, for my palette, REALLY spicy / hot and hot (temperature wise) it was definitely a challenge!  While it was a little hot for me, they added a jelly on top that was perfect and the blue cheese gnocchi were cooked to perfect.  It's a LOT of food, especially when you have to quaff down a bunch of sodas!  If you like spicy, I definitely recommend it.  The vegetable in season was broccolini which instantly gets a dubious look from me, because... you know, why not just have broccoli?  Instead of it's stemmy cousin.  Fortunately they had just the right amount of salt and butter to make it wonderful.I was way too stuffed to consider dessert.  Definitely give Flip Flops a try, the wonderful staff and environment make it worth your time.
<review# 273,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/10/2013,2/23/2014,38,55,4,10,9>If you love Handsome Biscuit, you'll love Field Guide. Located right off Granby, this little spot complements the cool and eclectic lifestyle that Downtown Norfolk is growing to be.The atmosphere is peaceful, the food is tasty, and the soundtrack was on point both times I've been there. Maybe I'm biased but eating a well prepared sandwich accompanied with the emcee lyricism of Nasty Nas echoing throughout the restaurant is a WIN-WIN. Not to mention the garage style store front that is opened on good weather days allowing you to enjoy your meal at the stand-up bar as "passerbyers" look in wondering what it is they're missing out on.They offer a signature sandwich menu with specific names. I've ordered the Ms. Kodiak and the Privateer, both of which were excellent. My side choice was their freshly cut sweet potato chips that were luckily made to order for both of my visits.This place really deserves great reviews and the pictures Yelpers have taken of their food can pretty much do all the talking.If you're strolling through Granby during lunch/brunch hours, stop by here, you won't be disappointed. Inviting staff and satisfying food, perfect for a quick lunch date.

I try to make it here at least once a week and am still working my way through the menu. More often than not I end up writing about a burger, or my dog and a burger :) This time however I'm writing about something else. Wings... Didn't know the Bent Fork had wings? I didn't either. They're excellent wings and unique to. How so you ask? Well, they're grilled not fried and let me tell you that's an art form all unto itself. I tried these wings for the first time just a couple of weeks ago and they are delicious. The sauce is also a house sauce and it comes across as a combination of smokey BBQ with some heat. Absolutely delicious and if you like wings I recommend giving them a try next time you're at the Bent Fork.

Lots of family activities like canoeing, a nature trail, park, cabins etc.  Deer are in the park and are very friendly. The problem with this place is urban development is closing in on this nature spot, I feel so bad for all the animals that are trapped in that area for it is surround on all sides by development. Because of that, I don't recommend camping there because of the noise from nearby interstate 64 (that is the only reason why I give it  4 stars).  However if you are looking for a great spot to spend the day with family and friends, this is it! Great for Kids!
<review# 277,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/6/2014,2/19/2014,183,190,5,17,8>Shhhhh! Let's keep the best kept secret in Hampton Roads on the DL!  I don't know about you but I always wish I could take better care of myself with facials and chemical peels, but now I know I actually afford to do it.  I just left feeling so relaxed...and my face feels incredible!  I went to the back of this spa-type room filled with massage/facial tables, laid back, and let the magic begin.  All of the stress left me.  It was peaceful "me" time.Tonight, I came for my first visit with Courtney.  She is amazing and I would never know that she is a student.  They are all students taking care of you but they get plenty of education and training before they ever work on you so don't hesitate...do this for yourself.  Courtney did a full facial skin evaluation and then cleansed me, steamed me, rubbed me, exfoliated me...yes, it was everything I needed.  Guess what?  My one hour dreamy facial only cost me 25 dollars!!! Yes, really!! If you think that's awesome, won't you just love to know that they offer other self-indulging services too...try getting a chemical peel for $30!  Or, microdermabrasion for ...$30!!  They also do waxing, LED light therapy, IPL, and hair removal.  I did have a couple of concerns about my skin and what should I really be doing to take care of it.  You know how it is...you walk into Ulta or Nordstrom ready to try the next best age-defying fountain of youth formula, but I don't know what really works or what is really worth the money.  Courtney was able to tell me what I really need, all personalized for own skin concerns whether it is Vitamin A topicals or toner.  They do have products there and surprisingly, they were very reasonable.  I have seen plenty of hyperpigmentation creams sell for for a big bucks, but the one they have is only $17 and it lasts a while.  And, guess what?  This place isn't just for the ladies.  Guys, you have breakouts too and they can get you spiffed right up. Thankfully, they have nights where they are even open until 10PM, so my crazy work schedule is no problem for them.   I can go in the evening, get loosy goosy and totally relaxed, just in time to go home and drift off into bed.  I am so lucky to know about Chrysm and they are going to be my secret to beautiful, stunning young-looking skin.

Well Julia A made sure I stopped that madness last week when we went here for lunch. I just followed behind Julia and what she ordered because I was so overwhelmed by the smells and wanted to try EVERYTHING! I ended up with rice, spicy beef, spinach and this flat bread thing that tasted so delicious and buttery.Everything was DELICIOUS! And I love the fact that you can do half orders of everything, which is what I did. I think if I had done a full order, I would have hurt myself, lol.Definitely am going to go back because I want to try the desserts.

<review# 279,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2014,2/17/2014,121,78,3,9,6>This place has it at: ambiance, fantastic libations, and superb food. We went on a Friday night around 5:45 before the evening rush and got seated immediately.Our waiter Darren was polite and was an expert at the menu selections. For an appetizer we had a fried goat cheese with cranberry relish and a pimiento cheese board. Both were done amazingly. To complement our dinners we had a 1703 (Mt. Gay rum, Texas Tarragon, ginger, and cardamom) and a Smokey Jones (3 Bs - Bourbon, BACON, and brown sugar). The 1703 was mixed to perfection and tasted similar to a Dark and Stormy but with less spice. The Smokey Jones was simply sweetened bourbon with a bacon appetizer in it, but done well.For dinner, my girl had a succulent New York Strip with TASTY truffle parmesan fries and spinach with shallots. I had the INCREDIBLE braised short rib that was so tender you could cut it with your fork. The rib lay on a bed of creamy gnocchi that just mixed well with the main dish.As "dessert", we chose two equally good drinks: Bay Coffee that had hints of spice and a touch of bitter chocolate and Elephant Cocoa that tasted like a buttery tootsie roll. Thirty 7 North did an AMAZING job with everything. I am thoroughly impressed with this place and will certainly come back here again!PROS: Excellent mixed drinks, DELECTABLE food, great wait staff, elegant decorCONS: Careful, the menu items can deplete your wallet FAST.
<review# 280,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/8/2013,2/16/2014,144,389,2,4,3>Came here during Hampton Bay Days. It was crowded, hot and humid inside of the store. A bit on the pricey side, as far as Ice Cream go. However, being hand dipped Hershey's, instead of semi-solid soft serve (from the vendor right outside their front door), which isn't even in the ball park, as far as ice cream goes, this was a satisfying experience.Friendly, though very busy staff. Small dining area, no doubt set up to remind one of an old fashioned parlor.I can't imagine driving here to get ice cream (parking in Downtown Hampton is frightening). However, I would expect that they get plenty of foot traffic here, from the locals.Pricey, but worth the stop.@Removeyourhat
<review# 281,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/20/2013,2/15/2014,49,45,,5,7>Grape & Gourmet feels like a tiny Total Wine that came together with a Harry & David store. This business is only found in Virginia Beach and they carry a medium sized assortment of beers, mostly craft beers. I am not a beer connoisseur, but several people have mentioned that their selection is the best in the area. If you're like me and don't know a thing about beer, G&G even provides a mini description and number scale rating for each product.Aside from beer, you will also find wine, wine glasses, wine stoppers, cork holders, jams (pepper jelly jams, apple jams, any jam you can think of), cheese dips, salsas, peanuts, and random gifts. I'm sure I left out a bunch of other stuff. They also have a variety of sake to choose from, which surprised me!I saw on their website that there are beer tastings on Thursdays and wine tastings on Friday. I haven't been yet, but I'll definitely clear my schedule up for that in the near future.
<review# 282,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/12/2013,2/14/2014,36,23,2,6,6>As someone who prefers to support local businesses, Brothers has been my go-to spot since moving to the Hilltop area of Virginia Beach. They deliver to residents in the nearby vicinity, which fortunately includes my apartment for those truly lazy Sundays. They have an option where you can order online, but that does not always work, a bummer for when I am feeling a bit antisocial.First of all, their selection beats out most places in the area. Unique apps, such as fried ravioli and fried coconut shrimp grace the menu. Their variety of toppings is swoon-worthy. Few places offer fresh basil as an option. Brothers is one of these places. They use the perfect sauce/cheese/dough blend, a rare ratio to come by. If you are dining in, they offer a full bar to make sure you have a really enjoyable time.Their customer service is nearly always top notch. The only time I was irked was when my table had asked the waitress for more information about the Brothers Challenge. The challenge consists of two people eating a 24 inch 3 topping pizza in one hour. As a self-declared pizza connoisseur, I was heartily interested in participating. I say was, because the waitress insinuated that only the two guys I was sitting at the table with could participate while I would just be a bystander at a nearby table. I may be a small girl, but I can put down quite a bit of pizza by myself in one sitting, so her comment really peeved me.Other than the weird underlying sexism, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a yummy bite.
<review# 283,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2013,2/13/2014,59,90,2,5,4>This place was awesome! Aaron, our server had impeccable knowledge of the wines. The 'wine tap' at the bar was cool because you could get a fresh glass of wine. If you are in Town Center just go in and check out the taps and get a glass of wine. The food was really good too!The crabcakes were flawless! The surf and turf special was really tasty. The scallops app. was majestical! Malbec I had by the glass was super special, it had a 'smokey' flavor that was surprising and pleasing at the same time. I definitely suggest to go here. I would request Aaron to be my server.
<review# 284,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/15/2013,2/12/2014,255,146,,5,5>I like coming to this park. It's great for multiple uses. I have come here to have church related functions, for a workout and to watch fireworks. What I like about Mt. Trashmore is that there is always something going on here. The park hosts concerts, festivals and puts on an annual carnival. The city has repaved the track and installed new workout stations and benches to relax on along the track and if you rollerblade, bike or skateboard, there is a half pike there for you to practice your skills. This park has a pretty cool set up. I definitely recommend you check it out and enjoy the benefits.
<review# 285,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/16/2014,2/11/2014,121,268,1,5,4>Normally, I would give a place like this 5 stars! It is local, it has a little grocery section, and they have cheeses, wines, and more to purchase. I like the location on Shore Dr. They just rebuilt it and the new building is very nice! I always enjoy their yummy deli sandwiches and homemade soup. But, I feel like it is a little to pricey and it is always busy. Last time we went, we had to wait for a table. The people working the registers were busy and not very friendly. That is why I did not give it 5 stars. Otherwise, the food and the store portion is great!!!
<review# 286,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/12/2013,2/10/2014,69,206,4,7,6>Food vs Service; the battle begins.First let me say that I lived in Germany - as most military brats in this area have at some point or another.  If you're nostalgic for oddly decorated places that smell like beer and have live polka playing, look no further than the German Pantry. Aside from some serious service pitfalls (noted in other reviews) this place was a score. I saw from other reviews that we would need a reservation, even though it was just 2 of us going at 6pm, I thought I should be on the safe side. Good thing, too. This restaurant goes ahead and reserves tables for the entire night when you make a reservation - so the table next to us was slotted for a 7:30 reservation and remained empty the entire time even though people at the door looked genuinely pissed off at not being seated in a room full of empty tables.  I don't know if the reserved tables were an homage to European slow food, but I seriously doubt it, given how rushed we were throughout the night.  We specifically told the server that we were taking our time and didn't want to order our entrees immediately after our apps so that we could luxuriate a bit. She was undeterred. She just came back every 5 minutes until she wore us down. We ordered the meat and cheese plate and landjaeger for apps - both were really good, though they took some time to get to us. Overall, good quality cheeses, smokey salami, braunschweiger and seriously amazing whole grain mustard - served with some sort of ritz cracker.  Immediately on the heels of the apps were our entrees. I opted for a  piping hot weinerschnitzel (don't I always) - which is a breaded veal cutlet served with lemon with 2 sides, I chose german potato salad and red cabbage.  My husband had 2 wursts, spaetzle and red cabbage. We were both really happy with our meals. I loved the schnitzel, it was perfectly cooked and I was thrilled to see they had it made with veal instead of the typical pork. The red cabbage was perfectly vinegar-y, and the potato salad was spot on. The whole thing was made better by the old guys playing polka and incoherently shouting out lyrics in German throughout my meal.  We'll be back here eventually - and we'll make reservations.
<review# 287,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/20/2013,2/9/2014,155,241,9,7,10>Oh Paradise Donuts. I've finally found you.I missed out on the UYE because of a nasty fall down some stairs whilst wearing the slippers of death (innocent looking lamby slippers why have you thwarted me?).I spotted the brightly lit neon sign while eating lunch across the way and suggested to my dining compadre that dessert should be had at Paradise Donuts. She agreed. Or she saw the crazy look in my eye when I started talking about my need for fried dough dipped in icing.We walked in and the space is pretty big. I was told that they had been super busy that morning and they were running low on stock. They come In every night to make the donuts fresh! Well, they had what I was looking for. Upon spotting my go to donut (maple bar) I placed my order. Look. I have no qualms about admitting to my donut addiction. I also know, going into a donut shop, that I will order more than one donut. On a good day (where I actually restrain myself) I'll order a half dozen and may actually share them with my husband.My order consisted of: the last 2 maple bars, the last maple bacon bar, chocolate peanut bar, strawberry fritter and one for my lunch companion. My one suggestion would be to amp up the maple flavor a tad bit. But outside of that, these were spectacular. I am so happy to have found Paradise Donuts! Even day olds (consumed the next morning) were fantastic. This will be my go to spot for sure. Raised yeast donuts for the win!
<review# 288,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2013,2/8/2014,40,56,2,6,4>I knew the owners of this establishment cared about the product they sell and the customer experience during my first visit. I was approached by a young man who asked me whether or not I've been in before. I told him no and he proceeded to give me the 411 on the cupcake selection they had that day. On the surface, a cupcake looks like a cupcake. But if you take a good look into the different cupcakes and the ingredients that go into them, you'll see that they are not like other cupcakes. No box cake mixes here. They even have the ingredients that are included in each cake under the name plates in the display case. I've probably had at least 15 different cupcakes from ethereal since they opened. You can taste the freshness in every bite. One day I walked in and picked up a few cupcakes for the family and the owner mentioned that they also have a breakfast cupcake that I need to try. So I returned the next day before work and picked up this cupcake that had a taste of pancakes, with a maple flavored frosting and topped with bacon. BACON! Besides that flavor town favorite, there are several other cakes including one of their cheesecake selections that are certified winners. These aren't the .50 cakes you'll find in farm fresh. These cakes will run you about 3 bucks a pop. But the quality and selection is well worth it. Treat yourself to a ethereal cupcake, you'll enjoy the experience.
<review# 289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2013,2/7/2014,34,86,1,7,4>This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Norfolk area. My husband and I met up with a friend for dinner here when we first moved to town, and it has become our go-to for Thai food. We've tried others, and they just haven't measured up to the service and the food at Rama Garden. My husband love the drunken noodles - he gets them EVERY time. I have a few favorites - the pad thai is good, as is the panang curry. Their Thai iced coffee is well-balanced, not too sweet, but just sweet enough.The real draw for this place is the service. Every server I have had is nice, and nearly all of them are funny and witty. It is rare to find servers that actually seem like real people these days, since most times servers are not willing to put themselves out there for fear that they won't get their standard tip. To those people, I say it's worth the risk with friendly tables, which my husband and I are nearly all the time. The decor is unique, and feels well thought-out and put together, compared to some other local Thai restaurants that are not cohesive. The seating layout is good to ensure privacy to each table, which is also a gripe I often have with Thai restaurants. Overall, this is a great place for an affordable and DELICIOUS Thai food dinner. Don't forget the iced coffee! :)
