The chairs are big and comfy and have trays for your drink and snacks. The screens are not high def, but the trade off for amazing seats is worth it to me.  We love that you can have a few drinks and real food (but it is really pricey) I have had the quesadilla and the bacon fries.  The cheese on the fries turned to plastic before I could get half way through and the quesadilla was lacking cheese and topping s and the chicken was dry so I don't think I'll be eating too much more here. The theaters are clean and like I mentioned the seats are nice.  Bathrooms are also clean. Would rate higher if the food was worth the price.

Many other Korean restaurants that I've been too are either way too over priced or food is just okay. I recommend this place to any Korean food lovers!
