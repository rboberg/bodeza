<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/17/2014,11/22/2014,5,28,1,3,3>The food was pretty good.  Everyone there was very nice.  The owner of the business interacted with us as well.  A mix of experienced and some inexperienced staff was ok.  Had a rib eye Cajun stake that was very good.  The mashed potatoes were also nice and tasty.  I would go back for more.  The venue is very pleasant.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2014,11/21/2014,1,27,2,1,1>It's highly unlikely that you will be hungry when leaving this diner.  Portions are large, food is good, and the servers are friendly and capable.  Try their soups or try their omelets.  My biggest complaint is that they are closed on Mondays, and that they show Fox News.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2014,11/20/2014,7,120,1,3,1>I have been here several times in my life, but tonight was EXCEPTIONAL service.  I stopped in on a Sunday at 5:30, when everything else was closed.  I figured I would quickly scan the clearance rack (which is huge!) and be out by 6.  I was helped by Pam, and she asked what I was looking for and she started looking for me.  I picked out 3 clearance bras and she picked out maybe 7-10 regular priced bras for me to try.  It was very close to closing time, but she made sure I tried on every bra, as I apparently lost weight and was a different bra size.  Pam was very attentive and continued bringing me bras to try to find the perfect fit and figured out my style very quickly.  I wasn't rushed, she even showed me the new Curvy Kate catalog, as I had asked for a bra that wasn't available yet.  We also talked shape wear and after I was dressed I mentioned nighties and she also had me go back to the dressing room and try on a bra specific nightie (which is so hard to find).  It didn't fit, so she's ordering some for next time.  I have been fitted and purchased bras at the near by competitor, I paid $113 for a bra that Bertha Church had for $80, for the SAME EXACT ITEM.  The shop is small and old school, I was fitted there for my prom in 97 and it hasn't changed!!  But what it lacks in space it makes up for in selection (the place is packed to the gills with stuff), it not only carries bras (unusual sizes), shape wear, pantyhose, thigh highs, garter belts, some apparel, body products, I don't even know what else.  She keeps some things in "the back".  I have witnessed several bitchy women (sorry!) go in there with attitude, but I have never had a bad experience there.  Honest service, quality products at a fair price.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2013,11/19/2014,5,13,4,3,3>It's a GREAT place!Nice people from all walks of life. Congressmen to bums, (if you can tell them apart...) I fall somewhere in the middle. Cheep well-made drinks and beer, Cider on tap too.When I moved here they were very welcoming. I have met many good people in there. "A dive for Nice People" is tier perfect motto!I just wish all the HOT bartenders would stop hitting on me. It gets embarrassing...

<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2013,11/16/2014,6,6,2,3,2>Shelburne Farms was amazing! We went for Sunday Supper last weekend which was a great dining experience.Pros: Service, food, atmosphere, and the menu.Cons: None.Let me begin by saying the service was perfect. Chris was very friendly and knowledgable about wine. He recommended a perfect bottle of white to go with our dinner. I do not typically like chardonnay but he was right on the money with his recommendation. The food was excellent. I highly recommend checking out Sunday Supper. Everything on the menu is tasty. You really cannot go wrong. Each course was delicious. The salad and the celeriac-cabbage gratin were both very good, but my favorite was the roasted Misty Knoll chicken (which was also recommended by Chris).All in all it made for quite a remarkable evening. We will definitely be back!
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2014,11/15/2014,5,5,2,2,2>I have eaten here about five or six times now, and it's my favorite place to grab lunch in Barre during my work day. The portions are a good size (though sometimes inconsistent), and there are plenty of options. I can customize my order to have everything I want, and nothing I don't! I agree with another reviewer that some of the staff need a bit more training/experience, but the service is always friendly. Plenty of parking in back, too.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/18/2014,11/14/2014,5,10,2,3,2>Some of the most authentic Mexican food in the Burlington area. We sat on the patio, had excellent service, and everything tasted great. I wasn't crazy about the rice and beans that come with each entree, but that didn't take away too much from the meal. Portions are large- expect to bring half of your meal home for round two! Order some fried ice cream with chocolate or maple syrup for dessert. YUM!
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2014,11/13/2014,4,6,1,2,2>One of my go-to places around Burlington. On Sundays they have $6 apps and $3 Sam Adams/Switchback. The wings are great!!! The maple habanero are the best, I am not a huge maple person but they are sooo good. Burgers are also great, huge and juicy. Potato skins are also great. The only thing I haven't liked is the calamari, I'd definitely avoid that.

<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,11/11/2014,0,2,1,1,2>Great class, and Bill is a fantastic teacher! I really like how the theme of a class is always different and is tied to a little bit of philosophy behind each exercise we do. Bill is great about walking you through the exercise and explains how to make it more challenging if one wants. But it is optimal for most levels! Class always ends with a good meditation! And then Bill brings out orange scented cold towels, that feels so good after you broke a sweat!
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2014,11/10/2014,0,9,2,2,1>It says in the Yelp rules not to review a business that you have a personal connection with. That's not good for Liesje, because once you've had a session with her, you have a powerful personal connection. So I'm just going to break that rule.I just received my first rolfing session ever, and I'm blown away.You know when you are getting a really good massage and the therapist keeps hitting areas that make you go, "Yeah! Right there!" The whole session was a deep dive into Right There. It demands surrender. It opens and opens. For me, there were some tears from touching into a sublime, grateful, sadness. It moved me. This is powerful work--a gift, a journey, and for me a beginning. Liesje maintains a beautiful, calm, strong, clear presence throughout. I immediately trusted her with my vulnerability. She is not merely learned, but deeply practiced. Grounded. Read the other reviews. They are right on too.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/9/2012,11/9/2014,30,1,2,4,2>This place is one of my favorite places in the area. It is kid friendly and so delicious. No matter what you pick you will leave full and satisfied! It is a once a week must in my house whether it is pizza(the best in vt) or dining in I get a craving once a week! If you love pizza and a good NY style thin crust and big slices that you need to fold in half ( ya know what I mean) this is the place, the sauce is perfect & always cooked to perfection. Try the Pappardelle pasta it is a must.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/20/2014,11/8/2014,16,26,2,1,1>Excellent Almond Croissants and very good everything else. They run out of Almond Croissants a lot and the seating can be a little limited but the staff is always friendly and the product is consistent--I've been here countless times.My advice to Red Hen: make more Almond Croissants! And enforce the no shirts, no shoes, no service rule, ya hippies!
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2014,11/7/2014,9,88,2,2,2>We biked the path yesterday, we parked in Stowe at the bottom of the white church and started there, I biked and she roller bladed. The path was absolutely fantastic, It was extremely scenic, had about 7 or 8 small bridge crossings, several wild life moments, on one bridge we stopped to watch a deer on one side and a beaver on the other. The path has tons of exits/entrances and even has a few on route restaurants that cater to the path users, including bike stands and outdoor seating. We biked briskly and took us one hour each way from end to end, not including our stop for sushi half way. A definite recommend and a definite repeat! This is a must do in Stowe!

<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2013,11/5/2014,23,5,3,7,4>Although it is a bit of a hike for me to get to, at times I find myself looking for any excuse to head out to Essex just so I can have lunch or dinner at Sukho. Between the tasty dishes, large portions, friendly waitstaff, and a very reasonable price point, it's no wonder I frequent this place as much as I do.While I have settled on a few go-to dishes (their Spicy Cashew Chicken is something else!), they often have great dinner specials that I will explore once in a while.It's a fairly relaxed setting with lots of "for two" tables, so it's a good date spot, but it can also accommodate larger groups as well. Great for any occasion. And with their generous portions, you'll have lunch for tomorrow. Can't beat that.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2014,11/4/2014,3,66,1,1,1>Really good.  Mexican with a slight twist.  We were confused as to when they were open, looked like only lunch but a friend said they went for dinner.  We now think they are open only lunch except Friday's when they are open only for dinner.  Anyhow, make sure you go out of your way to eat here.  Friendly hostess and waitstaff.  We started with Margaritas (duh!) and asked about the house drink noticing it has "lime mix" and I hate most mixes.  She said its prepared in house so we took the chance.  Very good (four stars).  They also offer a "naked" version for a couple of bucks more (good tequila, grand marnier and lime).We were told by friends to definitely get the guac.  This is a must, very clean and good.  Plenty of guacamole and chips for two people (or maybe for four).  I had the taco trio and chose the fish, duck and sirloin.  All had very interesting combo's of veggies and complimentary sauces plus the green rice and beans.  I was stuffed and happy.  My wife had the chicken enchiladas.  Very good and not your typical enchilada.  Can't quite describe it but very good.If you are not looking for your basic Mexican but want something a bit more refined, this is your place.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/13/2014,11/3/2014,0,9,1,3,2>As you walk in it is very welcoming. The open kitchen immediately draws your eye and it is very clean and organized. There are 4 places to sit and watch the goings on in the kitchen. The chef/owner is at the helm impeccably dressed in his whites. Roomy dining area with lots of natural light. I arrived after 2pm on a Monday and the dining room was busy. Service was fine but the food was wonderful and good value for the money. The menu has a nice lunch selection and the desserts in the case are just waiting to be enjoyed. I would recommend this establishment to friends passing through.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2014,11/2/2014,2,24,1,2,1>I love this place: great food, locally sourced, professionally prepared, and service with distinction. The menu at Roots definitely leans toward the kale-quinoa, veggie-vegan set, but since it's in Rutland, which is not exactly the hippest town around, it also offers a choice of options with beef, chicken, pork, emu, and seafood. We have only eaten here twice, but both times were so outstanding that I feel qualified to give Roots five stars. The restaurant is relatively small (maybe 25 seats, plus 4 or 5 stools at the bar) and we didn't have reservations on the Friday night of our last visit. Much to our surprise the host seated outside on the sidewalk where we had a memorable meal. Thank you Roots. You are an oasis in the desert.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2014,11/1/2014,13,68,1,4,3>Amazing breakfast spot, and the only place I know that does a really classic, California-Mexican cuisine. Deserves a cult following, this place. Also, totally empty before say, 9:15 on the weekends, so great for families.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,10/31/2014,23,68,7,21,8>When the rotary was built, I wrote off Winooski. But then a strange thing happened. Really good restaurants started setting up shop to complement the really good restaurants already in place and now it's hard to ignore that Winooski is becoming a bona fide alternative to the Burlington breakfast/lunch/dinner scene.My wife (a vegetarian) and I (a carnivore) have been to Sneakers a handful of times in the last few years and we've left with a smile on our faces and full bellies each and every time. It's a bit of a hipster hang-out so the wait can be long on the weekends (can't speak for how busy they are during the week) but they hand out buzzers, take your number, and let you walk next door to the Monkey Bar to wait until it's your turn. What this means is you don't have to stand for 40 minutes but can instead sit down, enjoy a cup of coffee and the newspaper and think about all the tasty food you're going to soon be eating.Once your name is called, you'll be greeted by a friendly and attentive staff. While seated, you'll never feel forgotten. The waitstaff is helpful if you're unsure of what to choose, and honestly, who can blame you for being unsure? There's a lot to choose from and all of it is worth it. As I said, my wife is a vegetarian and I'm a carnivore and Sneakers satisfies both of our diets. I'm a fan of the California Benedict, the Breakfast Burrito, and the old school omelet. All of these dishes are breakfast staples and yet, it's amazing how easy they are to screw up. Sneakers gets this right every time. I also recommend the orange juice. It's freshly squeezed every day and you'll never want to drink grocery-store-OJ again.Check out Sneakers. You won't regret it.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2014,10/30/2014,8,8,2,3,3>So happy that they're in the south end! Speeder & earls makes quality coffee and the shop is cute. Their iced coffee is superb!
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2014,10/29/2014,2,4,1,3,2>Excellent value for lunch. I had the Pad Si-Ew with tofu. It was very flavorful and the portion size was just right. I also liked that it included a small salad. The only thing I didn't like was that the hot tea is served in a cup with the Lipton tea bag in it. I was looking forward to a nice pot of tea on this chilly day. My lunch companion had the Param Long Song with Chicken. I liked this dish even more than mine - I will be ordering this next time. It's a no frills, basic service restaurant, but perfect for lunch when you have a limit on time.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/24/2014,10/26/2014,4,45,4,2,2>This is the place to go if you're looking to shred your daily-calorie-intake budget and spend the last 5 or ten bucks in your wallet.Incredibly dense & creamy ice cream like no other. What else is there to say? Have fun!
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2014,10/25/2014,4,30,2,3,1>Amazing variety! My friends and I came here for brunch on a Sunday, hoping that breakfast food was still available. It was -- and then some! They have much more than what was listed on their online menu. I got the Vermont Benedict ($12): a delicious poached egg on top of ham and a Portuguese sweet roll (SO much better than an English muffin), topped with a perfect béchamel sauce, and a hearty chick pea and vegetable croquette on the side. My fiancé got the Crab Cake Benedict ($13), which was delicious in terms of the crab, but the side of latkes were pretty burnt and mangled. Our third diner ordered the coconut rice and beans ($9), which seemed like a mistake. It looked more like nachos because it wasn't an integrated dish. The rice didn't taste like coconut at all, the beans were just heaped on top, and the chips fanned around the edges looked cheap and unnecessary. Seemed more like a cheap appetizer, than a satisfying entree. Next time, he'll have to try something different -- maybe the Cubano sandwich? We did get great glasses of brewed coffee, but they also offer full cocktails (delicious Bloody Mary's) and espresso drinks (hello, double mocha). Will definitely be back to try more menu items!
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/25/2014,10/24/2014,1,5,2,4,2>This store is A-DOR-A-BLE with pink chairs and twinkle lights and cute merch. The cupcakes are super good, but you really only need one or two and you've had enough sugar for a week. They do a Friday night wine tasting special where you get 3 mini desserts and 3 glasses of wine for $10!!! TEN DOLLARS! It's amazing. My man and I went and it was such a fun, relaxing time. Would definitely go again. I would also recommend their iced chai which tastes like ice cream. It's amazing, though probably not very authentic (go to muddy's or uncommon for that, snob). All in all, a cute little place to stop in every once and a while.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2014,10/23/2014,10,15,2,3,2>The ideal breakfast in a setting that is authentically Burlington! The menu choices draw upon the Vermont ideals "farm to table" and "fresh and local." I had the pumpkin-bread French toast with yogurt and cranberry relish--wow! (Next time I'll ask them to hold the powdered sugar because the pumpkin bread is sweet enough.) I love how a full bottle of real Vermont maple syrup is left on the table for diners to use. I've had the granola several times...very healthy & tasty. My son got the buttermilk silver dollar pancakes and scrambled eggs...and partook liberally of the maple syrup. Coffee is excellent...bottomless cups and freshly brewed. The waitstaff is great--around but not hovering. Prices reflect both quality of the food and the service...not the lowest, but you get what you pay for!
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2013,10/22/2014,7,48,2,2,2>One of my favorite bars in town for getting special cocktails and good wine! The downstairs makes you feel very swanky and you can relax in the large chairs and sofa while enjoying a drink and maybe some tapas. If you can get The Slow and Steady which is a great drink they make I like to have when I am there. Also the owners are super nice!
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2014,10/21/2014,10,36,2,4,2>Every now and then you visit a place that just has it totally together. Fireworks is friendly, hip, attractive, well-priced, and THEN you get to the food: really interesting tempting choices, lots of gluten-free options, and the ones I chose were great. Fireworks is not haute cuisine so you may ask how it could deserve 5 stars. I seldom give that many. But Fireworks just does everything right. For the record, Sopa de Lima is terrific chicken soup, tart and interesting. The Blue Moon pizza again was novel-squash with pesto and chicken. I liked it a lot. Arugula salad was yummy, and the mocha flan was amazingly creamy. Go !
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2014,10/20/2014,55,26,2,4,3>This is a MUST if you have a few minutes to spare. I'll usually arrive to the airport early just so I can stop at the skinny pancake. I usually go with the Choco Monkey or Lovemaker. Whipped cream is fresh and the staff demonstrate the quintessential Vermonter attitude of friendliness. I highly recommend to anyone flying in or out of BTV to stop by the Skinny Pancake and experience a taste of Vermont...
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2013,10/19/2014,17,7,2,4,2>I love this place! Even though other places may be closer I will always go to Essex Cinemas. Management is very accomadating and with a bar and the T-Rex auditorium it makes for an amazing experience. I have only had one bad experience during the showin of The Hobbit when the audio system died but was quickly given a ticket to return whenever I liked! When new movies come out that are a part of a Trilogy they usually have a marathon showing starting with the first movie and leading up to the showing of the recent addition (Dark Knight Trilogy being an example). Also with Throwback Thursdays it makes for an amazing experience to experience movies one may have never had the chance to see in a theater setting.
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/13/2014,10/18/2014,1,3,2,4,2>Great atmosphere, great people and GREAT food. Presentation was absolutely wonderful! I Ordered the seafood grits and it oh SO delicious. The portion was perfect, not overwhelming and not too small which was perfect considering I was able to have a full course meal, appetizer, entree and dessert! I definitely left The Gryphon on a very satisfied stomach. Would highly recommend and will definitely be going back! :)
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2014,10/17/2014,1,3,1,1,>I love this place!  Their antipasto is amazing with its variety of meats and cheeses. They are not currently offering the beef cheek which is tender and delicious but instead they have a filet that is every bit as amazing.  The waitstaff are very knowledgeable about the best wine pairings with food.  This restaurant is very special.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2014,10/16/2014,42,125,4,5,4>I have to preface this review by saying that I am not wine people. I don't think I've ever been to a wine tasting before this. I was here for a Yelp sponsored party, which was lovely. The wines I tasted were the reds and the sangria. All were delicious, healthy sized pours. The bar tender was knowledgeable and chatty, which is why I know I can get this wine at my local Hannaford. He also have me a hot tip on a cheaper mixing alternative to my favorite high end gin. I don't know what a normal night is like for them, but the only downsides are the placement and size of the bar, which I'm told is soon changing, and the ultra weird bathroom situation, which is not uncommon for Church St. I'll try them again on a regular night with the new space layout.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,10/15/2014,98,40,,5,4>I came with 3 friends on a Saturday night and there were only 2 other tables seated.  I wish more people would come to this place so the atmosphere is livelier.  You can sit at the open sushi bar and watch the sushi chef do his magic.  Unlike Koto's, the hibachi cooking takes place in the back.  I really like the ambiance of the place.  It's dimly lit, looks elegant, and has pleasing art on the walls.  There are booths for a group of four, which was perfect for us.  A good thing about it not being crowded is that you get to pick wherever you want to sit.  The customer service is superb.  The waiter checked on us many times and even offered us more water after we paid the bill.Now on to the food! The hibachi is so much better than Koto's! I can't speak to the sushi, but the hibachi is very quick.  My friends who got the yakiudon and hibachi both got their meals before my house specialty fujiyama roll came.  Here's what I got:#Hibachi soup as appetizer.  This is one of my favorite soups ever now!  I usually get miso, but trust me, this is so much better.  The flavor is rich beef, contains white mushrooms, and is very savory.  I will keep ordering this.#Fujiyama roll.  This is the house specialty roll that was recommended to me by the waitress.  The presentation was nice and simple, but because I had super high expectations, I wasn't wowed by it.  I definitely wish it was spicier.  It has three different types of fish - tuna, yellowtail, and salmon and is topped with wasabi tobiko (tobiko is fish roe).  I like roe, but didn't like the wasabi tobiko.  I normally am not a big fan of wasabi so this was definitely a downside for me.  The roll was fresh, but I definitely am going to try a different house specialty roll next time.  I recommend getting the hibachi fried rice, which is only $6 with meat, and the hibachi noodles.  I personally loved my friend's noodle dish more as it came with a seafood and ginger sauce, which were both good.  The yakiudon another friend had is also flavorful.  My favorite was definitely the hibachi soup, hands down.  College students can get 10% off with an ID and there is also a buy 1 entree get the second half off.  You just need to show the waitress the coupon on your phone - no need to print.  That's usually a better deal and the one I used.  There is always usually a coupon online so just make sure to check the Hana Restaurant website before going or when you're there! Overall, I really enjoyed the experience.  The only downside is there weren't more people.  The wait staff were just standing around.  On the plus side, you don't need to wait long for food and the attention you get is amazing.  I might've found my new favorite sushi place around town, but I will go to other places because I have yet to find delicious sushi that can replace my old favorite restaurant on Church St, Sakura.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/24/2014,10/14/2014,21,41,1,4,2>At Leunig's I've tried their brunch menu, dinner menu, desserts, and just hang-out upstairs and their special Lounge Menu. Every time I can say that it's only ok.  I really want to love Leunig's. I'd want it to be my "cheers" and they could be truly special, but service doesn't seem that invested in your experience. I've gone half a dozen times. It's minutes from my office and my visitors want to go, and admittedly the menu is ambitious! With its prime location, and price points - they turn over a lot of tables. This week we went twice. Brunch was disappointing - I had some very chewy Duck Taco's, but they redeemed themselves when we hung out upstairs on Friday night. Terrific coffee, and the Seared Foie Gras with White Truffle Toast, Port Cherry Compote & Spinach & Artichoke Cous Cous was tasty. I give high praise for anything close to service in Vermont, because surprisingly, it is often hit or miss here. For a tourist -dependent economy I'm always surprised by the lack of effort that you'll find in many other cities and towns outside of Burlington at even lower price points. Their fries are good. Overall, I say go. I keep going back hoping for a rave review. Maybe someday.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/21/2014,10/13/2014,18,101,1,12,2>Burgers and brew and, yes, salads! This is a great neighborhood pub with tons of good local brews on tap, great burgers, and very good boneless wings. Don't miss the fried dill pickle chips! They rock. The waitstaff here is also super friendly.Don't know what the first review of this place is talking about. This place is one of the cleanest pubs I've been in. I've been here fairly regularly since its opening and have only had positive experiences. When reading a negative review on Yelp, always look to the number of reviews the writer has created. If it's a small amount, it's probably a fake review and an account created just to disparage an establishment (for god knows what reason).
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2014,10/12/2014,89,88,1,4,1>WOW. I came here on a Thursday night and was seated immediately in the window table in the back. I've been a few times prior but had never been specifically to try multiple courses of food at once, so I was pretty excited. I was super happy to see that the menu was 95% seafood with very few meat options, as I'm pescetarian and do not eat any farm animals. I ordered 3 menu items and a couple beers, and my first pick was one of the top 10 things that I have ever eaten, anywhere! It was a Halibut Crudo with Asparagus Ice, Yogurt and Smoked Almonds. It was UNBELIEVABLY good. Wow. I would EASILY go there any day of the week just to order this one item!! So incredibly good and such an exciting and unique combination of flavors, textures and temperatures. Well done guys. The second course was octopus, also phenomenal, easily a 7-8 out of 10, but nothing mind-blow in like the Halibut. The third course was the only disappointment and should be removed from the menu. It was a whole fried crab with a plate of fried veggies; which prepared any other way would have been good, but being fried it tasted like a plate full of cholesterol and salt. Way too much salt. We both wished we had not ordered this one. The service was great although we pretty much had to ask for second rounds of drinks and then again for thirds, they'd be smart to train their servers to watch people's drinks and prompt them for more, they're probably losing out on a lot of drink sales by not proactively serving the customer when the customers are ready.The location isn't the best (they'd be a whole lot better off with a nicer space in a better location that suits their incredible food) and the outside LED street lights that lit up our indoor window table as if we were sitting inside a K-Mart definitely killed any ambiance we had hoped for, but besides that these guys are amazing. Overall they are are killing it with unbelievably creative food and fantastic beers and drinks. Well worth a visit by anyone except vegans and vegetarians
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/20/2014,10/11/2014,4,9,1,1,1>Phenominal! Creative! Fresh! New! Delicious!  This young restaurant was a completely refreshing, fulfilling and welcome experience in creative dining! A fabulous menu that should satisfy any foodie. A staggeringly full bar with some wonderful beer options. ( I recommend having a 'Heady Topper') a brilliant brew!I had a difficult time making my choices from the menu because everything sounded so good. 1st, Blistered Shashito peppers with an anchovy aioli. Unbelievably flavorful and exciting app. Who knew? Just great. 2nd fresh greens salad with vinaigrette. A light tasty palette cleanser. Bright and sharp. 3rd the Harissa marinated steak. Very flavorful, very tender, cooked to a perfect medium rare. Served with roasted potatoes and a fresh Chimichurri sauce. Excellent!  What was the true shocker? That was their French Fries! Once I had one shared from a fellow diner, I had to get an order for myself! With a lovely piece of steak on my plate, I ate the fries instead!!! Who does that?! They were just so darn good! I highly recommend this place to anyone trying to find the tastiest food in Stowe. Fair prices, excellent service.  No disappointments! I wish we had a place like this closer to home! AAA++++
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2013,10/10/2014,0,6,1,3,>We love what has transpired from some serious thought and sweat equity with the new owners of Ten Acres!Gone are the overstuffed and aged furniture and welcome to wide pine floors, a wonderful color scheme, working fireplaces.The menu is full of wonderful choices, the waitstaff is attentive and knowledgable.Love all the "little touches and details" that Linda has incorporated throughout. Highly recommend you make a reservation and check them out!Also, let's bug them for some outdoor dining this year. :)
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2009,10/9/2014,25,28,1,2,1>Everything at Gracies is made fresh, to order, and is consistently good. You must try the soup of the day and whatever pasta of the day that you can get in place of your side dish. No matter what it is, it's always excellent.You will not find better food in Stowe unless you're willing to pay more than double.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2014,10/8/2014,1,11,1,1,>I highly recommend the soufflé with corn, mushrooms and smoked cheese. The calamari is smokey flavored from being grilled, which is nice. Also the banana pudding is really good and comes in a mason jar. You can take the jar with you along with the leftover pudding. The portion is huge. I ordered some side dishes instead of an entree. They were okay. My dinner-mates both had burgers which they liked. I wish there were more items on the menu but I will certainly return for the soufflé and pudding!Service was good. Everyone was friendly and our server checked in many times to make sure we were satisfied.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2014,10/7/2014,15,6,1,1,1>I love the design your own salad. Everything is so fresh and yummy. The goddess mac - - cheese is heavenly. Fresh toast on homemade raisin bread is a great weekend treat.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2013,10/6/2014,0,30,1,1,>Creative is the first word that comes to mind at Sonoma Station.  The food is well prepared, fresh and delicious.  You can tell htye care about the quality. It shows. Go here and you will not be disappointed!
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2013,10/5/2014,24,19,2,1,>Went to the Kitchen Table in a party of 6. We were not an "easy" bunch for the waitress on this Friday after Thanksgiving. My sister is gluten and dairy-free. My brothers-in-law are lightheartedly inebriated, and my mom almost never leaves the house. I was the only NORMAL one.The decor is simple and calming. The staff are accommodating and very friendly, and the food was terrific.   The only hitch (to the elder bro-in-law) was that they do not serve espresso. I had the hake (could've sworn it was pronounced HA-key, but it's hake, like rake). Two ordered the pork (yum), and the gluten-free sister had the hanger steak (if you order rare, it will be rare!). No entree was left unfinished.Dessert was interesting. Two of us ordered the pudding which was served in a neat little mason-jar type thing. Yum. The younger (balder) brother in law ordered what we all thought would be creme brulee with cookies. Alas, it was just two little, but delicious, cookies.I plan on returning. They're barely ever open, but the food and feel are so good that you'll find the time to dine on their schedule.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2011,10/4/2014,19,1,3,3,3>I had a jar of Fat Toad Farm's cajeta in my fridge (for a very short time, mind you) and I would find myself fixated on having some when I was away from it - in the car, on the bus, church. Some people may like it on ice cream, but I preferred a few dips a day with my pinkie finger. Delicious.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2014,10/3/2014,44,38,,4,3>Locally owned and operated - this Burlington based wine and cheese craft store consistently delivers.  The staff are knowledgable, helpful, friendly -- and the sales are spectacular. They really do a great job organizing the place, have the best selection for artisan wines, cheeses, Vermont products as well as other bulk and grocery items.  A must for any Burlington local, a great place for beginning foodies to the educated localvore.
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2014,10/1/2014,5,45,,1,2>A truly outstanding restaurant. The attentive service, fresh food, wonderful wine and stylish decor made for a wonderful evening. I can't wait to come back. This is probably one of the nicest restaurants in Burlington.
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/20/2014,9/30/2014,1,6,,2,2>Shawn was great fixing my washer and dishwasher.  Professional, knowledgeable, trustworthy. Answered my questions.  He knew about a required software update for my LG washer.  Would definitely recommend and use his help again.
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/6/2013,9/29/2014,55,137,,3,3>I hired this company to clean the apartment we were vacating -- outside of any promotions, but at the very last minute before we were supposed to be out. The apartment, alas, wasn't in the best shape. Dennis, the owner, did a decent job at a reasonable price -- not perfect.  Overall, I think I got my money's worth. There were a few tiny things I wish he would have done better -- the only major thing he overlooked was scrubbing the toilet, which was annoying. But I think he did an overall good job.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,9/28/2014,0,20,,1,1>Love love love but now they are only doing take out sadly. Dining room will be missed. Regardless the food is excellent. Especially the chicken parm. And the chicken ripeneo, (chicken with fig and gorgonzola ) and salads great.
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2013,9/27/2014,11,43,,3,6>Exceptional!  Kind and quick staff, fun space w/ assorted seating choices, and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS FOOD!  We had the meze platter and also felafel appetizer.  Homemade lavash (OMG)   w/ meze was enough for both plates.  Every single item was moan inducing.  We were full but had to just look at the dessert menu - and when we learned that the baklava was made w/ apples and maple syrup, well.  You understand.  It was divine.  The best baklava that I have ever had.  Why there is not a line out the door to eat here I do not know but I expect it soon!  I will make my way here often even then.  Go.  Now.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2013,9/26/2014,1,25,2,1,1>I was pleasantly surprised by this bakery since I thought it would be yet another disappointment since there are only a select few good places to eat here in Vermont. The fact that I have a favorite item here also is quite shocking BUT that's a good thing. Haven't had anything bad here & you get quality food for the price. All the employees are very pleasant, well mannered, efficient, always happy, and very helpful. The ambiance is upscale relaxed & the interiors were done well plus they keep it very clean. The best part about this place is that they they are open late for those who work unconventional hours and need a place to grab food later than normal.Overall, it's a wonderful addition to Hinesburg & hoping that the food quality does not go down & that this place stays open forever.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2014,9/25/2014,7,1,,2,2>3 of my friends and I went to EB Strong's last night craving the Waygo burgers, in which we all ended up ordering after enjoying oysters, calamari and fried oyster sliders (all amazing btw).  When we finally got to the main meal... the burgers were absolutely delicious. All 4 were cooked to perfection by Chef Nic., side salads and truffle fries were the perfect serving size to accompany the quite large burger.  Of course why stop there, we had to indulge in dessert which consisted of cheese cake...again delicious.  The service was on point which I feel is hard to come by these days in Burlington.  Was a great experience overall and we will definitely be going back.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2014,9/24/2014,1,9,1,2,1>I love this place.  The owner is very sweet and so are the girls who work there.  Sometimes the employees are a bit ditzy and talk amongst themselves, but they know I shop there a lot and I don't need a lot of attention or help.  If you do ask for help, though, they're more than happy to do it.There are a mix of different price points, and there's always a lot of sales items and new items in stock.  It's a very preppy and pretty selection; they have trendy stuff but that's not really what most of the clientele (myself included) look for.A lot of Susanna Monaco, Amanda Uprichard, Yumi Kim, palm beach sandals, vineyard vines...midscale prices.  Great cocktail dresses, jeans, cute shoes, and OMG the ACCESSORIES!!!!  Personally, I prefer to go to this store more than Ecco.  It's a more intimate and inviting store and the girls who work here are way nicer.  Ecco has a certain look that they try to convey, and it's just not my style.
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2014,9/23/2014,6,1,1,2,2>Therin was recommended to me by a friend and I went there for a facial for the first time yesterday. I must say, it was a wonderful experience! Therin has a sweet nature and is very professional and knowledgeable about skincare. I have very sensitive skin, so Therin took extra care to give me a gentle treatment that wouldn't leave me looking all red and inflamed when I left (something that usually happens when I leave from facials). She offered advice on how to care for my sensitive skin and tailored the session to my specific needs. The atmosphere was extremely relaxing and the bed was amazingly comfortable. I highly recommend this place! I can't wait to go back.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2014,9/22/2014,1,46,1,1,1>Always good service and tasty food. Have the Twiggie for dessert, you'll be glad you did!
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/6/2014,9/21/2014,61,32,2,3,2>This is my go-to place. For manis and pedis. I'm a regular. Everyone is good. You don't need to ask for a specific person. The whole staff is friend labs efficient and they work together to keep things moving. On top of all of this, the price is great!
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2014,9/20/2014,20,11,2,2,>Just finished my first pedicure here. What a delight! A full pedi menu - I chose the lavender and milk pedi for $35. I have bad callouses and she handled them easily. No razors for those who prefer them. Fragrance was not overwhelming and the massage chair was fun.  I chose one of the toluene free polishes.  Took an hour and did not feel rushed. Right now they have a small staff do you may wait on for walk ins. I will definitely be back.

<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/10/2014,9/18/2014,25,19,2,2,2>I think I walked in and nearly died of excitement to see Cruisin' USA for 25 cents/game. I remember begging my parents for the $1 to play back in the 90s.This is a fun place to hang out. I was there on a Tuesday night and while people piled in and out, it was never overly packed. Old arcade and pinball games are super fun and really inexpensive. There's a great selection of beer...far more beers than what they list on their website, which is still an extensive list.Even with the long list of beer, I'd bring kids here. It's not a bar. It legitimately is an arcade that serves really good beer and food. I didn't eat any food, but everything I've seen there looks delicious.I'll be back here without a doubt; most likely during my lunch break so I can blow off some steam playing some video games!* UPDATE - I just realized you guys open at 4 pm. I was talking to a few of my coworkers and we really wish this place was open around noon so we could play games during lunch!
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2014,9/17/2014,7,97,,4,3>We had our first meal here this evening for a date night!  Arrived at 6:30 and there was already a line out the door!.  Pretty impressive for a Wednesday, especially for a place a mile from downtown Burlington.  We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes.  We waited 35 minutes and got a table.  They were clearly super busy and being inundated with takeout orders, which was slowing the table turnover considerably.We ordered right away.  Mango salad and Tom Yum for appetizers.  Sweet Potato Curry with Tofu (#25) and Pan Seared Shrimp (#28) for main course.Appetizers arrived within 2 minutes!  We shared them and they turned out to be a nice pairing.  The spiciness of the soup was perfectly complemented by the cool mango salad.  Both were really flavorful and just what we wanted.It was a while before we got the first entree - the Pan Seared Shrimp.  Cooked in a clay pot with herbs and spices, they were supremely flavorful and well worth the wait.  It's a good job we had planned to share or we would have been disappointed that the second entree didn't arrive for another 30 minutes!It didn't matter though.  We were enjoying the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant.  When it finally arrived, the Sweet Potato Curry did not disappoint!    Really incredible flavors of lemongrass, ginger and coconut.  A really fresh and delightful Thai-style curry.  Hard to imagine how this could have been improved.We rarely eat desserts but we enjoyed the meal so much, we took home their special - coconut cream pie.  It was very yummy!We had a great meal.  Service was slow but very friendly.  One more server working there would have really helped.  I felt bad for our waiter, who was rushed off his feet the whole time.  But this restaurant is the real deal; the food is incredible and it is priced just right.If you're not in a rush, this restaurant is among the best Burlington has to offer.  We'll definitely be back, but we might get takeout next time unless we have a few hours to spare.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2014,9/16/2014,23,5,,3,3>be. Skin Clinic is exceptionally clean and well appointed and offers a fine selection of proven skin care products, including Vermont-made product from local entrepreneur Tata Harper. The clinic offers a variety of skin care treatments and has invested in the best dermatology equipment available.  I highly recommend this local business and was very impressed upon my initial visit!
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2014,9/15/2014,1,1,,2,3>Cool place, very old school. Great prices and good quality goods. Great location also. I love the shop your way program. I get 15% points with kmart MasterCard. The automotive section is huge. I hope this store lives on.

<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/19/2014,9/13/2014,18,32,1,2,3>Great little place right off the roundabout downtown Winooski.  Creative beer list with different styles and brands to fit any meal or tastes, plus some creative (if expensive) mixed cocktails.  Menu was typical gastropub fare, simple, but creative local fare, all with high quality ingredients.  We had the smoked bluefish pate appetizer and the fish and chips and bacon-blue cheese burger, all were excellent.  We will definitely be back to try the poutine with pork belly and some of the other interesting items.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2014,9/12/2014,14,11,1,4,4>This was my third time visiting and I really enjoy the atmosphere. There was great live music, it's a beautiful space, and it's a good complement to the other offerings in Winooski. However, with Mule Bar (and their great cocktails and beer selection and food) right across the street, I think that oak45 has some work to do to compete. First, even though they have a nice selection of lovely cocktails and martinis, the strength of the place is the wine list, so the bartenders need to know the wines. I asked for what I wanted and the bartender looked nervous and couldn't really offer any convincing direction. But the wine I ended up choosing was excellent.Second, there just absolutely needs to be more available to eat. This place is begging for a variety of simple, elegant, bougie snacks (ahem, small plates), in addition to the cheese plate (which the staff also seemed undereducated about). You don't need salads, fried food, shellfish, etc. Please just ensure that there are a few palate-cleansing or experience-enhancing items to keep us there longer. Like, herbed roasted nuts (not peanuts), raw chocolate, pate, pickles, fruit. Small desserts would be amazing. You know, the kind of accompaniment that makes you want to stick around and drink wine all night. Because I would come back often and stay longer if this was an option. As is, it was a glass of wine and then we were out. Feels like a missed opportunity.
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2011,9/11/2014,21,20,1,2,3>After strolling down by the water one beautiful afternoon in Burlington, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this shop. For those of you who may be put off by the ostentatious attitude of many wine shops, the welcoming and knowledgeable staff will not make you feel out of place. They have wines to suit all budgets, host monthly wine classes and best of all, they have free wine tasting every Saturday from 1 - 7pm. This gem is well worth the visit and be sure to sign up for one of their Wine 101 classes - totally worth the $15. I have now become a loyal Dedalus fan!
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/22/2011,9/10/2014,15,26,1,2,3>I always try to come up with a few places to take visiting friends and family when they "get away" to VT. Shelburne Vineyard (only a few minutes from Burlington) is a great place to take them! The wine tasting is fun and the grounds and building are beautiful. All three times I've been here the owners are present. The husband takes you through a little tour and the wine making process and the wife rings you up for any purchases you make. I'm a fan of their whites but I haven't loved any reds I've tried. Regardless, a great place to visit for an afternoon.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/10/2011,9/9/2014,10,47,,1,2>This is an AWESOME wine store. Brad knows the wine business, knows his stock, runs massively great tastings on Saturday, and has totally earned our loyalty. Appallingly young, he clearly is a wine savant and I predict that he will have a long and distinguished career in the business. There are several places downtown selling wine, but by a nose, this is our favorite.
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2014,9/6/2014,23,3,,2,2>This is my first time here. I had the special: Chipotle bacon cheeseburger with crispy onions. It was delicious, cooked just right. And the hand-cut fries were perfect. The service was friendly and attentive. My son had the Apple-brie burger,  and while he's not great with descriptions, he devoured it. This is a great place in a convenient location. And the prices were extremely reasonable, especially considering the quality and size of the portions.

Whether you're looking for a trim, color, wax, mani-pedi, makeover or massage, Trio is the place to go.

Large, well-spaced tables, free wi-fi, great coffee, friendly staff with some personality.Oh, and, as the name would suggest, it's a gallery as well. Keeps active locally by displaying artists' work, as well as making appearances at the the Winooski Farmers Market and even on Google events such as with presidential candidate Gary Johnson.The only real complaint I have, and its a minor one, would be perhaps a better selection of pastries would be in order here.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2012,8/31/2014,4,9,1,1,2>Chaga Mushroom has changed my life dramatically for the better! I have been drinking chaga everyday for the past year- and I am very pleased that Chaga Vermont has been providing me with the finest premium grade 100% raw chaga!!!  It is reassuring to know that in addition to the purest grade chaga available, but that also their process is that of a pure one- their Chaga never comes into contact with harsh chemicals or put through a wood chipper (as other Chaga companies do)I can also appreciate the wholesome mentality that goes along with the purchase of Chaga from Chaga Vermont- there is a real sense of family that is hard to describe in words- Everyone is family at Chaga Vermont no one is turned away.

I will always recommend them to my friends due to their reputation as an great shop. They are always honest and provide top notch care. I will always take all my family's volvos there. They are thorough, honest, keep their promises.  Especially nice are Jeremy and Jason of the service team.  Hats off to you both, you do a great service for Volvo owners.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2009,8/29/2014,39,96,1,4,4>I went again just for a drink and dessert.  I had the porter which was smooth, rich, and delicious.  My guy ordered a cocktail which was fantastic too.  It had raspberry puree, crushed lime, simple syrup, a Brazilian liqueur made from cane sugar.  It was so good!The dessert was the best!  A key lime flan with mojito syrup over a house made graham cracker.  OOhhh so good.  It was fresh citrusy sweetness with smooth creamy finish.  Fantastic!
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/9/2013,8/28/2014,50,4,1,3,3>Excellent pizza and homemade pasta. The decor could use a bit of work, but overall the restaurant is clean and unpretentious. The service was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. The prices are reasonable, as well, with entrees running between $12-$17. I'd certainly recommend the restaurants to friends.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2014,8/27/2014,3,9,1,2,3>I stopped here this morning while waiting for the library to open. The barista seemed very friendly and knowledgeable - using a bottomless portafilter to pull her shots! Ooh la la! I always appreciate when a barista knows how to use their tools, and not just press some buttons. There were two patrons in front of me, yet I was only there for about 5 minutes - that includes wait time and ordering time for myself. Quick service, yet not rushed. I got a maple latte - $4.75, a little on the pricey side, but if all the baristas are as skilled as the one I had and can produce just as great of a drink with a beautiful rosetta on top, I'd say it's worth it. Oh yeah, and not only was the milk textured perfectly, but the temperature was ideal as well. The natural milk sugars were a beautiful compliment to the sweetness of the maple and the brightness of the espresso. Next time I'll be sure to leave out the maple to really taste the espresso, howeverI only give 4 stars because this was my first time here and I've only tried one thing. But that one thing was delicious, and the service was calm, warm, and welcoming.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/22/2014,8/26/2014,0,12,2,5,2>Been coming here since the mid 90's. Never disappointed. Quality food, great service. You really cant go wrong off of the breakfast menu. There will be a wait on weekend mornings. Plan accordingly. If you are up here visiting Burlington and want some local flavor it's a must. Killer Eggs Benedict and Kahlua waffles. Great spot to nurse a Sunday morning hang over, wink wink.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,8/25/2014,13,68,1,5,4>I love the friendly, helpful staff here, and frankly, I feel good that I can get so much of what I need at a locally owned store. Even though Amazon offered a wide variety of convertible baby seats, when our kid was ready to move out of the basket-seat phase, I still decided to buy here because of a lovely experience I had buying her earlier basket seat, the Chicco Keyfit 30. It was a pouring rainstorm, and my fussy little nugget refused to sleep or calm down in her very antiquated and totally past-legal car seat. She was still like 6 weeks old or just over, so I decided, F-it, time to buy a car seat for her and maybe it will calm her down. In the pouring rain, I went to Kids City, and they not only let me plop my goobery child in all the seats to see how she took to them, they also let me roll out two finalist seats to my car to see how they fit in the slope of my CRV's rear seat. And then we tried the baby in the seats again.Mid-rainstorm, we covered the new seats with a tarp, rolled them out in a shopping cart, and the lady helped me with the seats or the baby, every step of the way. When you are a first-time mom, and you have a crying baby, there's no limit to the fury you can have for potentially insensitive jerks that seem to cross your path all day long. When someone manages to actually make you feel better? It's sort of like when a person saves your life and then you're in debt forever. That's how I feel about Kids City. We found the one magical car seat that propped her up enough so she was comfy and stopped crying in the car. After that day she was a *slightly* better car baby. And so - when it came time for her big-kid seat, we went there for our fancy Diono, and I am so glad with that purchase too. Plus - they give you 10% back (at least) on all purchases, so you either collect 'cash' in an account or they give you a rebate on purchase. So when I checked out, I got it for the same price as Amazon, but without the waiting and with verbal and lets-try-it capability (the Radian fit in a Civic very well.) The changing room is spacious, clean, decorated, and has lots of places to plunk things - unlike the local competitor in Williston. When I was breastfeeding they invited me to use their wide selection of rocking chairs - which are conveniently tucked away in a quieter area of the store (near gift wrap and nursery decor). It is brilliant marketing, frankly.They've allowed me to return presents from my awful mother who aggressively refuses to give us receipts on clothes purchases (even though in once case they weren't sure she got it there.) Lastly - they really seem to value customer feedback on products and ordering. I love that. It's the kind of service that brings home the "local" in locally owned business.
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2014,8/24/2014,7,10,1,2,1>Awesome cafe!! Brings a little life to five corners area.  The supremo burrito has a nice amount of spice (swear to God it's a hangover cure) the owner is an avid mountain biker and is involved with the community, wish this place was in Burlington, it could easily replace a lot of the overrated joints downtown
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/13/2013,8/23/2014,5,20,1,3,3>Probably one of the most unique coffee shop/cafes I've been to.  We got milkshakes and the barista special made them for us with alcohol combinations that she recommended.  Their milkshakes are regularly $5 and ours ended up being $10 each after adding in the whiskey and Godiva liquor but it was totally worth the extra cash.  SO GOOD!  Be creative with their menu, because they'll be willing to help you out and make your own kind of specialty drink.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2014,8/22/2014,6,23,1,2,3>This is my favorite (guilty pleasure) food. Best burgers in Vermont, delicious chicken sandwiches and amazing ribs (at a great value as a meal with fries). If I move from burlington this will certainly be my most missed food spot.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2013,8/21/2014,1,2,1,5,2>I let my dogs out into the backyard this afternoon as usual -- and there was a skunk, in daytime! To my horror the dogs ran right over to it and killed it.  My first thought was that the skunk might have rabies and thank goodness the dogs' shots were current. Then my heart sank as a powerful odor of skunk began wafting to the house and all over the dogs. Pampered Pet was a lifesaver!  They rearranged their schedule so I could bring my two stinkers right over to get de-skunked.  They even washed the leashes.  I have used them for several years and they've always done a good grooming job. But this time they really came through for us.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/30/2013,8/20/2014,0,12,,,1>This is my favorite local dive.  The music is great.  The beer is cold, the drinks are cheap and well made. The bartenders are always friendly, and the people watching on the street outside can't be beat. FYI- It's a Yankees bar for anyone who has been looking for a good one in Burlington, you can catch the games here.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/17/2012,8/19/2014,30,37,1,1,1>The best Chinese food in Vermont.  I could live off their delicious dim sum items for the rest of my life.  The steamed buns are so delicious and different from anything I had ever tasted before coming here.  The ants on a stick dish was very good, with a spicy sauce and yummy cellophane noodles.   I will have to come back to try more of the menu items.  A bit pricey.
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/12/2010,8/18/2014,164,26,3,2,2>Hands down the best place to go after a late night of imbibing in Burlington. Without fail, the Rise and Shiner sammie hits the spot. I wish they had places to sit, but at 2am, it doesn't matter too much. HINT: unless you don't mind  witnessing that night's hookup/breakup, an obnoxious band of bachelorettes or douche-y frat boys holding court, plan to get there right at 2am or just before. The clubs/bars close at 2 and that is the #1 desto after they're all shooed out of their respective bars/clubs.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2013,8/17/2014,3,21,1,2,2>Very good pizza! It's always made as ordered, and tastes just as great every time. Though Domino's is a chain I prefer this one for the Burlington and surrounding areas; drivers have always been warm and friendly.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2014,8/16/2014,17,21,1,4,2>This place lives up to the hype.  The dining room is beautifully-crafted.  The staff is attentive but not annoying.  They knew their menu very well - presumably a nice perk to the job.  My wife had the cod, I had a poached rabbit special.  Both were awesome.  They've clearly invested so much in this operation - the location, the excellent fit-up, the great staff, awesome menu, that you just want a place like this to succeed.  We will be back, as will many others.  Pro tip: if you want to eat there on a Friday or Saturday night, you will need to reserve online at least three weeks in advance.  For reals.
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2014,8/15/2014,22,8,1,5,5>Fiddlehead IPA is my personal fave at the moment (I'm a big fan of second fiddle also) Mondays bring your growler for an 8 dollar fill. Get some Bree and bring it over to Folino's for great flatbread and pizza. It's BYOB.... This is a great stop after hiking at my Philo... And right next to Shelburne vineyards... Grab some revenge from the vineyard so good!
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,8/14/2014,25,28,1,3,3>Vermont classic. Service is always quick and happy; no matter how long the lines. Love the fries, cheese burgers, corn dogs, chili dogs. pizza burgers & more! Haven't had a thing I didn't like. Great place to go grab a bunch of food with friends.
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2014,8/13/2014,5,3,1,5,4>hands down, BEST french onion soup EVER. great vibe, cute/friendly staff, great portion size for the $$ and awesome selection of local and imported beers. can't wait to go back-sooo worth the hour drive :)
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2013,8/12/2014,23,68,4,4,4>I've only used the self-service grooming station at Play Dog Play so I can't comment on the boarding/daycare aspect of the business. And when I say I've only used the grooming station, obviously I'm talking about my dog Agatha. (I doubt they'd let a grown man wash himself in the sinks!) Anyway, the handful of times we've taken Agatha to PDP for a bath, the washroom was available, clean, and well-stocked with towels, aprons, brushes, shampoo, conditioner, treats, etc. The water sprayer worked just fine and was easy to work with to get that just-right temperature for a pup. The sinks were big enough for dogs much larger than our lab-mix and included a nice ramp up from the ground in case your pup is no longer a puppy. (Agatha's always got that puppy mindset though so I had to lift her.) The staff was friendly and the price was right ($2 cheaper than anywhere else). Agatha left smelling clean. We left (mostly)dry and happy to have a dog who didn't stink. So to make a long review short, I can't complain, and can only recommend, provided, of course, you have a dog. Like I said, no human washing stations on the premises!
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/24/2014,8/11/2014,7,4,1,2,>Steve and the guys at Home Town Tire & Auto on 99 Industrial Ave in Williston VT are beyond great! I can't event start to explain the customer service.  I always feel like they are looking out for our best interest and certainly stand up to their mission statement; "At Home Town Tire & Auto Service, we strive to provide excellent customer service and to provide our customers with an outstanding product at a fair price".   If anything I don't think I'm paying them enough.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/25/2014,8/10/2014,1,2,1,2,1>So each year I give my sister a pedicure for her birthday. For the past two years I've joined her (though it's not considered a manly endeavor, who wouldn't want their feet and legs massaged and cared for?). This place used to be called Tootsies and has since changed their name. Very nice, courteous staff. They offer you coffee from Speeder and Earls when you sit down. I don't know a lot about pedicures (I've only ever had two) but they made this guy feel cared for from the moment I set foot (pun intended) in the place. Recommended for the pedicure professional and neophyte alike.
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2014,8/9/2014,4,6,1,3,1>This has become my new go-to pizza joint in the county. They have my favorite new pizza, the amazing "Vermonter" (which has a garlic/butter base instead of tomato sauce, bacon, caramelized onions, sliced apples and maple drizzled over the top) and a vast array of craft beers (22 from Vermont alone) to make any beer lover happy. The space is roomy with plenty of natural light and ample seating, including lots of stools at the bar. The service has been terrific both times I went. In particular, my waiter on my first trip was very knowledgeable about the beer choices and was able to recommend something for me based on my tastes that turned out be quite good. While I still love American Flatbread and Pizzeria Verita, their downtown Burlington location make them a little less appealing to me on the weekends, since I live outside the city and finding parking can be a drag downtown. That's not a problem at the Tap House. They have a large parking lot, which makes it easy to get in, eat, and get out. As far as I'm concerned, this is a very welcome new addition to the local restaurant scene.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/26/2014,8/8/2014,3,4,,2,1>I could eat their breakfast sandwich every day for the rest of my life. Totally affordable, everything is delicious, a dream come true for someone with food restrictions of any kind!
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2014,8/7/2014,5,10,1,4,4>As far as diners go, Parkway is one of my new favorites. It was fairly busy, but we were seated and had our breakfast in no time. Great diner food! I had the Eggs Benedict- prime. My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich special and loved it as well.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2014,8/6/2014,36,87,1,2,3>Volunteer to be a hair model on Tuesdays at 9am! Cuts are $15 and color is $30. What a deal!I went to Solon Cruz for the first time yesterday and I have to admit that it was slightly intimidating. First, to get into the salon you have to go through the EcoBean and Juice Cafe which just seems a little strange- you're walking into a cafe only to walk through it... BUT! once you get past that part a very friendly receptionist greets you at the salon section and are you seated in your chair. The stylist who came to practice on my hair was very attentive and really wanted to make sure that she was thorough. In order to stay on track she asked for assistance from Justin and the two of them worked together to determine exactly what needed to be done with my hair. She and Justin worked together as a team and I came away with a beautiful cut and some highlights. I really like the new look and feel but I do wish that someone of the highlights were located more towards the top of my hair. However, I wanted very natural highlights that just added dimension and that is exactly what a got. This place is a deal and worth checking out if you want to get something new and different done with your hair. Do check them out.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2013,8/5/2014,11,24,3,3,2>This restaurant is tiny, if you have to wait, DO IT.  It is well worth it!Everything I've tried thus far has been amazing.  The portion sizes are huge.Nothing is greasy.BYOB which is always fun.Number 19 is probably my go to.  There is something so deliciously wonderful about crunchy little egg rolls floating around in my soupy goodness.  Texture heaven.  You absolutely can't go wrong here.  Try it!
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2012,8/4/2014,54,34,1,3,1>Girlfriend and I were able to snag a table for two on a Saturday evening with no reservation. I think it helped that we were dressed to impress.Great Italian wine list. Waitstaff knows the glass pours, which are few but excellent and decently priced. I highly recommend the Pico Maccario Piedmont Chardonnay.Food is delicious and well prepared. Get the squash bloomers (cheese filled), if available, as an appetizer. They come drizzled with tuffle oil and honey.I orderd the quail, which came with brussel spouts and fingerling potatoes glazed with marsala. Everything was tasty, not stand-out amazing, but very good. Portion was just about right too, leaving room available for dessert.Was tempted to order the basil ice cream with strawberries and balsamic, but we agreed to share the chocolate mousse. It came as a thick, dense slice of decadency. A fantastic finish to the meal, especially when coupled with espresso or cappuccinoOverall, a pleasurable and satisfying fine dining experience with excellent service.
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2012,8/3/2014,115,289,1,2,1>The newest burger joint in town! Five Guys!So we wanted a good heavy dinner one night last week...And we remembered the week before this place had opened up! So off we went to Five Guys.So bring a new place you will first see its location. It's located right in the Gate Way shopping center. Not a bad location for sure! The inside had been redone inside. Pretty clean for a fast food joint. I wish it was in a closer location for Essex BUT I cant complain. Its not to bad of a hike for anyone. Its still pretty central in the Burlington area.The staff is also pretty friendly. Granted its still new. We had been greeted pretty quickly with a smile. Again being fast food I like seeing this. They didn't push us through quickly or even make use feel like they didn't want to help. They where clearly there to help us out with any questions that we had. Employees can make or break a place! This was not an issue here that night. (Granted its still new!)The price for the food was a little bit pricey. For 2 burgers, 2 drinks, and 1 large fry ran us around $26.00.  So if you do go here be ready to pay more than BK or MCD! With that being said the portions are HUGE! The burgers we got each had 2 patties of meat. They also stack it high with any veggies and toppings that you would like. The fries are pretty good too! We got a HUGE large order of Cajun fries. They put a Cajun spice on the fries...and they are awesome! We couldn't finish the fries though. Next time we will have to order a small or a medium! Be warned the food comes in huge portions! It only took us about 10 minutes to get our food. They cook all of the food after you order. So this is great in timing.So as of right now I am a fan! It was a little pricey but the portions are good for the money you spent. So if you come here....Come hungry or pack it up and go home! Pretty strong 4/5! We will be going back if we feel the need to eat beef! BUT lets see if they can keep the level of service after the new affect wears off...
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2014,8/2/2014,3,25,2,1,>"Burlington Pizza Tour""Best Fucking Slice"Finally! A smiling face ordering our food, quick delivery, a low price for a slice, a better deal for a whole pie. When the Pizza is fresh I'd say it is the best in town for what its worth. In my personal opinion the Pesto Pizza is one of the best slices I have had anywhere, sooo good and something I don't think I have seen anywhere else although I am sure it is out there. They have a great selection of slices and specialty pies to offer and that is all I really need from a pizza place. On top of that we had some great conversation with the bartender who didn't mind our loud spirits on the last stop of our tour. And I was happy it was the last stop because the Pizza was good, the drinks were cheap, and the mood was ripe. Well there you have it. Our tour is complete, Manhattans and Mike's take the top spots-Fu D.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2014,8/1/2014,42,125,1,3,4>I can't believe we've lived here five years and never come in here! The staff are mega friendly and the prices are so reasonable. It's Dunkin prices but the food and coffee are so much better. I have regret for every terrible bagel sandwich I've eaten in Williston. Never again, I've found my new home for the in between space of not wanting to cook at home and not wanting to sit down for pancakes at a restaurant.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2014,7/31/2014,18,101,2,4,3>I love this place. I snowshoe and run here. I don't use sunscreen for runs here; It's a mostly wooded trail system, though there are a couple of nice spots with views of the Adirondacks and the Green mountains. There's also a quiet beach in the park. Definitely bring your bug repellent! I see there are kayak and paddleboard rentals, but I haven't done that. There's also a porta-potty in the parking area.

<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/21/2014,7/29/2014,2,17,1,4,1>This place is outstanding. They have a new head chef and a completely new menu. We had a tasting menu with wine pairings last night and everything was not only delicious but also creative and exciting, the kind of food you don't expect to find in a college town in Vermont. They've also got a great beer list, including the majestic and legendary Heady Topper. Definitely one of the best restaurants in town, and highly recommended.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2014,7/28/2014,10,15,1,4,1>Where to begin? Location is excellent--smack in the walkable zone from lake shore to UVM and everything in between, which includes most of the area's best shopping and restaurants. The facility itself is exquisite--so much attention to detail has been paid by the owner(s) that listing all of the value-added touches (fresh coffee, tea and fruit on each floor, 24/7) is impossible. The beds, pillows and all of the linens are top-drawer. The rustic-luxury-modern blend works--I don't know how it's all tied together (maybe the plaid-wool throws on each window seat?), but the mix works beautifully. The water pressure and shower/tub is perfect, the ability to control the thermostat is awesome, the rooms are spacious and feel healthy and pristine with the mix of bamboo floors, stone floors with radiant heat and inoffensive carpeting. In the hotel lobby is a wonderful restaurant, Juniper, with great, healthy-yet-delicious food; a full bar; great, local brews; and a bonus--live music in the nearby lobby, visible from the hang-out-on-comfy-sitting-areas bar. The parking is the best of all--the hotel lobby has a hallway that opens up inside the Macy's parking structure so even though I arrived in the middle of a horrible snowstorm, I kept dry and my luggage didn't get messed up in the road slush that has spilled onto the sidewalk. Parking was $8 overnight and the hotel just put it on my bill so I didn't need to scramble for bills when I left.  The Hotel Vermont staff is so accommodating and sweet...this is THE place to stay in Burlington.

<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,7/26/2014,55,26,1,2,1>GREAT, super-friendly staff who welcome you in just like any of the many regulars that also dine there. This restaurant is truly a family run business. Complete with numerous special dishes, that all have a story behind them, you'll enjoy delicious food made by Mr. Earl Handy himself. Now don't be scared by the slightly dated decor of the restaurant. I know it's nothing compared to the flashy Denny's and Starbucks out there. But, it's full of charm, history, and Nostalgia. Trust me, it'll grow on you.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2011,7/25/2014,22,33,1,4,1>I went to August First for the first time on a Friday night when they had their All-You-Can-Eat Flatbread Pizza.  Approaching the cafe from outside you could already see from the windows how crowded it was.  This however did not deter my friends and I.  After paying our fee, we quickly learned how it worked.  On one side of the counter it was vegetarian pizza and the other, meat pizza.  While my friends and I had to start out standing and eating our food, we were OK with that.  Although it was insanely crowded, it was a great atmosphere with friendly people.  After about 30minutes my friends and I were able to get a table where we proceeded to keep eating and play some card games that they had there.  I would say, if you plan on doing the friday night flatbread deal, come after 7pm as it gets less crowded and the family with children start to leave then.  There is no rush to be there at 6pm when it starts.I def. recommend experience this and plan on going back myself.
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,7/24/2014,0,4,,2,1>THE best muffins in town! Decadent, so almost like eating a dessert, but their lemon poppy seed and banana chocolate chip muffins in particular are the stuff of dreams. Great as a wake up treat with coffee, or an after dinner snack. Seriously don't miss out on these!
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2013,7/23/2014,3,6,3,3,1>Wow-wee. This restaurant is an amazing find. Who would have imagined Winooski VT could grow such a great culinary treasure.If you like to eat -- and I mean really TASTE food -- you'll be delighted by the pig tails, corn pudding and other delicacies offered By Misery. The menu may sound a bit odd but each dish we had here -- I was with 5 friends -- was a delight and worth ordering again. Also notable: a great wait staff that loves what they do and food and that takes the time to tell you what things are and why you might love them. This is just a smacking good place to go if you love eating!
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2013,7/22/2014,8,39,1,6,1>This is the best steak in Burlington.  I've eaten here twice now.  The first time I ordered the NY Strip, the second time my fiancé and I split the ribeye for two.  Both times the meat was simply superb.  This is a real steakhouse, not some wanna be place like The Scuffer.  Thick cut, aged local beef.  Simple sides as the real star of this meal is the steak.The food is not cheap, but totally worth the price.I've seen a few reviewers complaining about the service.  While I'm not in a position to doubt their own experiences, I can say that both times our service was friendly and fast.  You can only cook a steak so fast, even if its only done to medium rare.  I felt like we were checked on enough, they kept our drinks full and table cleared.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2012,7/21/2014,76,327,5,3,4>Tatro has saved my morning, seriously. As a recent transplant to the hustle that is St A, I needed a decent place for my morning snarf. Enter ze tatro with his crazy awesome breakfast offerings. No longer must I wait 15 minutes for a simple egg sandwich, nor do I have to deal with grey, overcooked microwaved messes. No, here I can show up and pick from eggs, cheese, and a large amount of mix ins. Shocked was I when he reached for a skillet and actually *cooked* my breakfast. I'm not gonna lie, a spinach wrap with eggs, cheese, veggies, salsa and guacamole is gonna kick any crappy day straight in the choppers. The aforementioned lunch service is still quick, painless and delicious. Try the Taterade for breakfast, you won't be sorry...unless you steal all my guac, in which case, we're going to have words.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2014,7/20/2014,50,139,,5,1>I took a suit jacket to be cleaned and had a nice evening gown fixed here, as I was at one time disillusioned about my weight and tried to fit into a gown that was (at the time) 6 sizes too small. Needless to say, the zipper busted. So, here I am, 6 sizes less than I was when I broke the zipper and able to fit into a gown that had already been altered to fit a 15 year old girl nearly 15 years ago. ;). Well, the lady who does the tailoring put a new zipper and matched the color (royal purple) remarkably well. In fact, I think she did a better job than the first tailor who worked on the dress. She was nice, cleaned the dress and got out off of the wrinkles it had from 14 years of being stored in mom's closet.The price was excellent too. My boyfriend has been back several times for alterations, and trust me, if I had more time, I'd be over there every time I bought a new pair of jeans.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2014,7/19/2014,40,185,,2,1>One of the reasons it's great to see winter go away, Hoss's opens up!  It's your typical snack bar stand: creeemees on one side, grill/fried food on the other.  They take your order, you pay, you get a number, they cook the food, they call out your number, you eat your food or take it home.  The food is pretty tasty for snack bar fare.  It's a large menu but I've tried the bacon cheeseburger (they use a round piece of bacon so every bite has bacon!), philly cheesesteak, fried clams, italian sausage,chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, onion rings and fries (not ALL at the same time!!).  Everything has been pretty satisfying.  I'm not a fan of the mozz sticks but it's only $1.50.  The onion rings are perfect but don't bother buying the $4.50 large, it's waaay too much food.  Fries are pretty decent, russet potato style.  Creemees are a real highlight.  They make 4 sizes but believe me, the smallest "baby" cone is sufficient.  I've seen a "medium" and it's ridiculously huge for a cone.  They rotate flavors of the week.  Maple is the best but orange tastes amazing too.  Shakes are very thick but perfect in flavor.  I haven't tried the flurries yet but am tempted.  Prices can add up for a family but it's great for a weekend treat out.  It has a small sit down area out front and plenty of parking.  The service is quick as well but it can get busy during meal times.  I've seen them open as late as 9pm or so as well.  Stop by before the warm weather disappears for the year and you ask yourself "why didn't we go to Hoss's this summer??"
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2014,7/18/2014,15,128,,3,2>This was the one place in Stowe I hadn't been to so far that was on the top of my "to try" list. Our first stop in Stowe was this wonderful chocolate shop!We walked in and immediate saw things I wanted, bascially, it was like I want  that and this and THIS. One of the ladies was working with some chocolate pretzels. It was awesome to be able to watch! We walked out spending just under 30 bucks. Not too bad, little pricey but so worth it. Oh fudge. It was delicious, we weren't going to get a pound til she gave us samples. Wise business move! We also got a medium box for other chocolates - 8 per box. 4 salted caramels (our fave) 3 caramellows and a raspberry buttercream. Oh yess. I was not disappointed with anything at all.The service was excellent, by far the best we received in Stowe yesterday! Friendly and funny, knowledge and just a cool girl overall.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/2/2013,7/17/2014,25,7,,3,1>Great family mountain!Awesome place to ride. If you're like me you're in the woods, and loving every turn of it. But the terrain is varied from beginner to most challenging so you'll have something for everyone. Unlike Stowe it gets more sun seemingly, and the corn snow/bumps is better in the spring as a result. More locals seem to frequent the mountain which undercuts the pretentious air of tourists and the like. It's also considerably cheaper to ride/ski here than Stowe, which makes it appealing. Lines can be long, and their lifts are slow. But that doesn't take anything away from the terrain or conditions.Ski/Ride Smugg's!
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2014,7/16/2014,3,42,,4,1>Best cafe in the area, hands down. The cinnamon rolls are to die for and the sandwiches are loaded with meat so you get your money's worth and then some. Lines can get a bit long but service is prompt and courteous. There are other cafés in the area that are more expensive and not so good. This one is a winner every time.
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/19/2014,7/15/2014,98,40,,3,1>This is my go-to place outside of the library to do work during the summer and my go-to place to meet up with anyone during the school year.  It's nice and very comfy.  There is a fireplace so it's super warm in the winter time.  In the front there are small round tables with 2 chairs per table. There are couches in the back along with square tables with 4 chairs per table and high chairs with a long table right next to the window.  During the school year, it's more busy as its location in the Davis Center makes it quite crowded, but you can usually find a seat.  There is a phone charger station, which I think is awesome.  It has everything from iPad/iPhone 4 charger to various android phone chargers.  I didn't see an iPhone 5 charger unfortunately.  The baristas are usually students so quality of service is variable.  Prices are definitely on the more expensive side of campus, but the desserts and drinks look great.  I got a hot cider during the winter, which was really good.  Seasonal drinks are good.  The teas and coffee are fancy and popular.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/16/2013,7/14/2014,0,6,,7,1>Went here after watching the food critic on the local news singing it's praises. We live about 45 minutes away and it was worth every minute of travel. I had the salted caramel French toast and it was absolutely incredible. My daughter had their signature breakfast with bacon and home fries as well as a homemade popover with herbed butter. Everything is local and fresh which is reflected in the full flavors of everything we ate. The restaurant was busy so we squeezed onto the counter. The servers were all super friendly and attentive. We will definitely make another trip over soon!
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2013,7/13/2014,232,133,,3,2>A great restaurant that promotes and supports local farms and food producers. Delicious food and a great selection of micro-brew beer. I had the LaPlatte River Angus Farm Beef burger topped with jalapenos and an egg. The deco and ambiance is very nice and comfortable. Service is great but be prepared to wait for your meals as it could take a little longer than expected.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,7/12/2014,3,6,1,5,4>Awesome food. It's pricey but worth it. If you love thin crust, authentic wood fired pizza and quality toppings: this is the place! They have great salads too! Great wine selections. Great place for any occasion.It's busy and hard to get into unless you go right when they open. Warm and friendly staff and kid friendly. They gave my son some dough to play with at the table. Very sweet.I wouldn't hesitate to go back or recommend. Now I'm hungry thinking about their food!
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2013,7/11/2014,6,30,,3,2>Seriously this place is 5 star.. A little piece of Italy in Burlington Vt!From antipasti to primi to secondi .. It's all good.We sat @ the " wine bar" and our server Skyler was quite knowledgeable about the Wines and food pairings. Wild boar over home made gnocchi was a good shareable dish. I rarely have dessert but the flour less chocolate cake with a salt caramel sauce was too hard to resist!
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2013,7/10/2014,89,88,4,15,8>HOLY COW.  Where do I begin?!For those of you that don't feel like reading the entire review, here's the bullet points:Customer Service: 5 STARSRestaurant Design: 5 STARSFood: 5 STARSHappiness Level Experienced: 5 STARSGluten Free Friendly: 5 STARSVegan Friendly: 5 STARSVegetarian Friendly: 5 STARSWhen I heard that a vegetarian restaurant was opening directly next door to my house 6 months ago, I dedicated quite a bit of effort to find out what it was, who was behind it, and when they were opening...I followed the construction developments pretty closely and eagerly awaited what I expected to be an amazing addition to the Burlington dining scene based on everything I'd found out about the owners and their history.As you can expect, I was there opening night; both because I was so excited that they were finally open, but also because I like to try restaurants once a week for the first few weeks that they are open to see how well they handle it. Revolution Kitchen handled it incredibly.  The restaurant was extremely busy for an opening that was completely unadvertised. I expected to be one of a handful of customers, but in reality they had an hour+ wait all night long, and turned over dozens of tables multiple times.  It was amazing to see how many people came out to support them.The customer service we received from the host/manager (Max) and the owner, was nothing short of spectacular. They were so nice and attentive, and made us feel more than welcome, even while being so busy that most people would have lost it and freaked out.  When we first arrived they expected us to wait an hour and a half...Max figured out a way to reduce that to about 15 minutes!Everyone in our group ordered starters, entrees, and desserts.  That's a sign of how good this place is.  It's a pretty rare occurrence that you order all 3 courses; but they had SO MANY options that we wanted to try (I literally wanted to order the entire menu) that we all went for it.  STARTER: I tried 2 different starters and loved both of them.      *The Scallion Pancake is not your typical pancake from any asian restaurant, it's their own creation; similar ingredients in a more fun presentation.  YUM.      *The Maki 61 is a sushi roll, vegetarian style.  VERY good, and a huge portion, but it needed a little bit more flavor...don't get me wrong, it blows away any other local vegetarian maki, but I expected a bit more flavor.ENTREE: For an entree I had the Sweet Potato Enchilada.       *I will reiterate what I said about the Scallion Pancake here; DO NOT EXPECT YOUR TYPICAL GENERIC ENCHILADA.  These guys are far too creative for that.  NOTHING on this menu is presented the way every other place presents it, and this dish along with the scallion pancake proves that.  The menu items may sound familiar to you, but the way they reconstruct them on your plate is not typical at all.  This dish was AWESOME.  I will definitely without question be reordering this.DESSERT: I ordered the Banana Cream Pie made by the owner (the sheer volume of desserts that she made blew my mind!! Most restaurants offer very few options in the way of desserts, and no originality.  Revolution Kitchens owner made like 7 different desserts! It was hard to pick just one, all made in-house, no frozen crap like the other restaurants in town.  The Banana Pie was AMAZING.  I will repeat: AMAZING.  The crust was chocolate!!! Ugh.  So good.I will not only be back at Revolution Kitchen once a week, forever, but I can honestly say that based on the design, location, customer service, and food quality; Revolution Kitchen is easily one of the top 3 restaurants in the entire state.  It's so incredibly liberating to go to a restaurant as a vegetarian and know that you can order ANYTHING and EVERYTHING on the menu; there's no having to narrow down a menu to the 2 items you can order as a vegetarian and be stuck with crappy, uninspired food.  These guys have 20 YEARS of experience, and it SHINES.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2013,7/9/2014,4,30,,3,1>LOVE Soyo! Perfect addition to a town filled with high fat, super sugary ice cream. I love the slight tang that their frozen yogurt has, the variable flavors, and the abundance of toppings. A little pricey, but you get quality without the guilt. My favorite has been the mango yogurt with coconut topping and mochi topping. Yum! Can't wait to try the fall flavors (they suggest apple froyo with cinnamon toast crunch topping to make an "apple pie"). Delish!
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,7/8/2014,30,177,,6,2>Sometimes you just feel like being waited on, others you don't care quite so much.  In this case, we wanted to be waited on but as my first choice (Penny Cluse) had a 30 minute wait at 2 pm and, as I was quite hungry, we opted for it's brother by another mother, Lucky Next Door.  We were both glad we did.  My husband chose a couple of their appetizer options - the meatballs and one other that I can't remember at the moment but was a huge hit and I had the steak pressed sandwich.  Everything was a delight of flavors - I especially loved the unique coleslaw that was served with mine.  The price was right and the atmosphere warm and cozy.  Highly recommend it if you are looking for a quick dining option!
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2014,7/3/2014,2,3,,5,2>It is very rare that a restaurant improves - generally speaking, the trajectory of quality at any establishment is either a flat line or gently downward. But improvement is exactly what has happened here, because unlike the mediocre and forgettable pizza I ate at Flatbread in 2008, our most recent dinner was breathtakingly good.In contrast to the Vermont Tap House, which strives to make the simplest Neapolitan-style pizza from the most basic ingredients, Flatbread seems determined to make the construction of a pie as complex as possible. Multiple cheeses, many spices, weird combinations - this is easy to get wrong, but they seem to be succeeding. I'm not sure I can identify all the herbs they put on our meal, a "15 inch Medicine Wheel flatbread", which in other less imaginative restaurants would be called a "large cheese pizza", but they were delicious. The crust was just chewy enough, and nicely charred.The waitress was attentive and very helpful, and the only hiccup in the experience was our arrival - they close between 3PM and 5PM, and we arrived at 4:57. While I understand this was on us, it was odd to be sent to wait outside for three minutes when there were people seated in the restaurant and at the bar.
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2014,7/2/2014,4,6,,2,1>So good. Never had a bad meal here. Others are right, the coffee isn't that great I suppose... but everything else makes it way worth it. The bucket of spuds is the best if you're ready for some carb-loading, put an egg on top and call it a balanced breakfast ;) The omelets are also great but my personal favorite is probably the breakfast burrito. All the sides are amazing too. The breakfast is so good I've honestly never tried lunch but every lunch plate I've seen has looked just as good. There is usually a long wait but it's definitely worth it.
