<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2014,11/25/2014,132,200,4,4,1>I've wanted to go to DMK pretty much since it opened, but it's such a trek from my apartment (a whole six minute walk... what a struggle). Finally made it and I am so glad I did! I had the tater tots - my friend totally judged me for ordering the tater tots when there are so many fancy fry options at DMK, but the tater tots were so good! Perfectly crunchy and well seasoned. I then had the Satchmo, which was a little on the small side, but really delicious, with very fresh bread and great breaded shrimp. I finished up with the peanut butter shake - I was really wondering whether I could get it, and I didn't end up finishing it, but it was so, so good. Really fresh and creamy and milky, with a thin layer of peanut butter and just the right amount of real peanut flavor. So delicious! I'll definitely be back.

It came with choice of fries or salad & I had the fries. Both my son & husband had the chicken dinner. They raved and raved how delicious it was...Service was more than great....server very attentive with quick drink refills and the management came over a couple times asking if everything was okay...will return. A gem, no doubt!
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/28/2014,11/23/2014,143,199,1,5,3>The location is situated in a cute part of Evanston, plenty of little stores, a small park, available parking, etc. The food is really good. After our 4th or 5th visit, I've grown to like the steak salad and the steak skillet (with semi-hot salsa) with two eggs over easy (oh no, my mouth is watering). The complimentary garlic bread could be a little crispier but we always ask for seconds. The service is attentive and there is a large clientele so they appear established. We'll keep coming back to try more.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/27/2014,11/22/2014,57,93,,4,2>I was pleasantly surprised by my eating experience here at this restaurant bc of the just "a-ok" reviews on this place.  I originally was at Annie's (which is down the street) but they were so packed I decided I would no longer torture my hungry tummy and come to Alexander's which wasn't as busy.  The restaurant is a little and small and the seating is a little awkward.  There are 2 tables for two smack dab in the middle of the restaurant which I thought was a little uncomfortable.  I had read on the service of this place and though I wasn't met with any rude waitresses (ours was quite polite an d nice!), it was pretty slow.  I ordered the mayan benedict (which I cant find on the website menu so this may have been a special?) and it is as good as I imagined it to be.  The eggs were perfectly poached on to of a bed of black bean patty.  It also came with spanish rice and plaintains. The whole dish itself was oozing with flavor.  I have never experienced a breakfast dish like that and it was amazing.  I would come here again just for that dish. I knocked one star off bc it was also the loudest breakfast experience I have ever had.  It was to the point where I couldn't hear my friend and we were sitting right across from each other. I dont know if it was just echo-y in there but I was starting to lose my voice. heheHowever, the prices are decent and I will definitely be back! Great breakfast joint! Recommended!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2014,11/21/2014,130,318,,1,1>My wife and I had an awesome 35th bday dinner for myself here a couple weeks ago!!! Hats off to Jen Eisen and her staff!!! The service was very attentive and the food was OUTSTANDING!!!!We enjoyed the shrimp and lobster fritters for starters, followed by the Brussels sprout salad. I went with the special steak that was a 16 oz sliced ribeye steak over polenta and mushrooms. The sauce was to die for and my medium rare steak was cooked to perfection. My wife had the halibut and thoroughly enjoyed her dish as well. House 406 is a great addition to an otherwise absent fine dining scene in downtown Northbrook. Oh, and it's not an Italian restaurant either, since we have Francesca's, Marcellos and Oliveris as really the only other "finer" dining experiences in town.....all Italian cuisine.Save this place for a special occasion and book it now!
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2014,11/20/2014,90,224,6,7,8>Sooooo close to a 5-star, it's rydiculous! (If they can use y's instead of i's, so can I.)So I popped yn to the new Evanston location today for lunch and ordered the chycken and avocado sandwych with an orange-gynger drynk. (ok, I'll stop) It was fab. The sandwich was a bit spicy, with roasted tomatoes and a marinated chicken breast, all packaged up with avocado in a really delicious oatmeal bun. The fruit drinks are so fresh, and huge! You won't need the sparkling or flat water taps nearby, but they're such fun, so why not?!The environment here is pure green/cozy/clean, with lots of different seating choices arranged in this very cute round restaurant. I really enjoyed my lunch here, the staff was great and I will definitely go back. I think I'm holding back on 5 stars only because the menu was a bit difficult to find when I walked in, didn't seem to have as many super vegetarian/healthy items as I expected and it was chilly sitting near the windows today - someone should really have turned the air conditioning down considering it was only 55 degrees outside.I bet it will be AWESOME to come here for a glass of wine on the terrace soon... might give 5 stars if that works out.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,11/19/2014,16,109,3,3,4>I've come here twice, both for their soondubu. First time was the seafood soondubu which lacked depth of flavor compared to others that I've had. I also have tried the beef soondubu which was similar in flavor but the meat was tough :( This was the first time I've had beef soondubu so not sure if this is the norm or what...They are very generous with the tofu and it's a good portion for $9.99. There's a special deal where they offer $2 off the soondubu if you order an appetizer with it. Also note that perhaps this place is pretty good considering there isn't another korean place that has soondubu in Evanston. I usually end up traveling to Morton Grove or Niles for a nice fix.I've tried two of their apps: pan fried potsticker and the spicy korean style wings. The potstickers were tasty but not memorable. The spicy korean wings though was the highlight of this place for me! it's nice and crisp and I was very pleasantly surprised that it had such good flavor! I'm a big korean fried chicken fan (tried Dak, Crisp, and Bon Chon chains). These chicken wings were up there with the best of them! I would come back just for these wings again and perhaps try some of the other entrees on their menu! The spicy isn't super spicy so don't be afraid to try it!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/29/2014,11/18/2014,52,196,1,5,5>I am always excited to try new types of food, and so when I saw a Portuguese/African Chicken place was going up in Skokie, I anxiously awaited its opening every time I drove by.  When they finally opened, I stopped by on a late weekday afternoon, and there were several people waiting for food.  I placed my order and waited.  For about 20 minutes, which I thought was a little ridiculous until I read the other reviews for Fogo's.  Apparently at 20 minutes I should consider myself lucky.They advertise made to order, flame grilled chicken marinated for 24 hours, which I imagine is part of what causes the wait.  Made to order means they don't start cooking the chicken until someone orders, and big chunks of chicken take time to order.  Have you ever ordered chicken tenders at a drive-through?  I have almost always been asked to park and they would bring the order out to me because it would take longer and I would be backing up the line.  Imagine that, except every order is chicken.I got the chicken and rice bowl which came with chicken and rice (no surprises here).  The mild was actually fairly spicy, I can't even imagine what hot or extra hot tastes like.  They didn't offer any sauce, so I didn't get any, it was spicy, and that was about it.  Overall, while the flavor of the chicken and rice were good, I felt like it needed something more to take it to the next level, maybe the sauce would have helped, or maybe some veggies or something to mix it up a little?The concept is great, but I think they are still working on the execution.  It is a fast casual restaurant that unfortunately is a little slow.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/16/2014,11/17/2014,10,70,1,5,4>My wife and I had dinner delivered from here last week.  I had the Singapore noodles, egg drop soup and some potstickers.  The soup was a solid O.K. though I didn't get any crunchy noodles with it.  The potstickers were not terrible, but I've had a lot better.  With the Singapore noodles, the flavor was pretty good (I could have used more spice though), the pork quality was good but the shrimp was pretty pathetic.  They reminded me of those little shrimps in ramen noodle cups.  All in all, I haven't wrote them off yet, but next time I give them a try, I'll order something different.

She was patient and super nice. She told us to stop and take a sip of our drinks a few times since we ended up being super serious about our paintings. She was also very accommodating  and on top of it she was nice enough to walk around and take pictures of us ( we didn't even ask) AMAZING! I loved everything about tispy paint, and cannot wait to come back.

<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/7/2013,11/14/2014,0,9,3,4,3>Rolf's has effectively serviced my 2003 BMW three times in the past year.  Other reviewers have claimed they are expensive but I found they were over 10% cheaper than a BMW dealership on a valve cover replacement.  They are willing to drive me home when I drop my car off for a repair, then pick me up after it's complete -- this saves me time and effort to get to them.  I will be using them again and again for my beloved vintage Beemer.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2014,11/13/2014,6,10,2,3,3>The best place for breakfast anywhere!! Their pancakes are amazing, so to the sausage, and the crepes, french toast, omelets, coffee, fresh-squeezed orange juice, etc. I haven't ever had a meal here that I disliked. It's no wonder why the lines are out the door on the weekend mornings. The wait staff is awesome, particularly Anna, and they have no qualms about taking something back and remaking it if it doesn't meet your expectations. If you haven't eaten here you owe it to yourself to give it a try. You will love it!
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2014,11/12/2014,4,13,5,5,5>How could you go to this office and be unhappy?!  From the minute you walk in the girls at the desk are polite and friendly, the office is beautiful and you immediately feel relaxed.  I was referred by a friend for a chemical peel with the medical aesthetician, Aggie, and I had a great experience.  She did a full skin evaluation and discuss what she was planning to do, but more importantly she explained that not only would summer maybe be the wrong time for a peel, but that I would really peel so if I had a lot on my social calendar in the next 5 days it was the wrong time to do the peel, which I can honestly say I was grateful to have been told.  I would have been mortified to go to an event with my face peeling!  She is awesome.  I did a regular facial that day and scheduled my peel for September.  By the way, they also have a refer a friend program which got both me and my friend a discount!

I love both the chicken taco and the sea of Cortez. This is a great place to go with our kids because we can have a drink and everyone eats a good meal at a reasonable price! A really great suburban gem that I wish I had more seating!
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/24/2014,11/10/2014,5,17,2,4,5>I needed a new local nail place and thanks to YELP I found one!I called to make an appointment and Tina (the owner) scheduled me for a no-chip manicure and pedicure. I walked in and was greeted with smiles. They were super busy but Tina still acknowledged me and asked me to pick a nail polish. There's a huge selection of both OPI and Essie polishes. The lady who did my pedicure was very meticulous and did a fantastic job. A different lady did my no-chip manicure and she was as sweet as pie.The environment is relaxing, the ladies are professional, and I am overall very pleased with how my nails turned out. With all that being said.... Check this place out! :) You won't regret it.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,11/9/2014,15,16,3,3,4>I love this place. I've been going here for 8 years now. Its very affordable! $12 for a manicure and $32 for a mani pedi, you can't beat that! My go to girl is Chi. She doesn't rush and she does a very good job. I always call ahead to make sure she is there. If you make an appointment make sure you are ON TIME if you're not there they will just move on to the next walk in the next 5-10 minutes. Even if you do have an appointment anticipate 15 minutes wait time just because they fall behind sometimes trying to keep up with walkins (which isnt a bad thing because you don't want thwm to rush on your nails!). I do have to warn you that the owner (an older man) can come off very rude, but to be perfectly honest it is a cultural thing. Which lwads me to another thing is that most of them don't speak alot of English so it can be difficult to make small talk with them. But other than that they understand your needs nail wise.Overall their technicians are nice, they're clean and disinfect their tools and it's affordable prices.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,11/8/2014,103,20,2,4,3>Probably my favorite Go-To place in Lake Forest. The Deli and Fresh Cheese selection is fantastic. They also have food, drinks, deserts to go or eat in. Since they opened, they really made themselves a part of the community and it's one of a kind in the area. The people that work here are helpful and very friendly, it has a real family feel and that your welcomed. I buy things here a minimum of twice a week. Go there and check it out, the quality of products and pricing is Great.

<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,11/6/2014,11,49,3,3,3>Amy will call you honey, or sweetie and it's meant with the best of intentions... she really does think you're honey or sweetie.The omlettes are terrific, mine was filled with ham-off-the-bone.  Nice and fluffy accompanied by hot sauce, and hot coffee. The potatoes that accompany the eggs were crispy and delicious, and the place, while small, is bright and charming.I've been back a number of times... try the pancakes... with or without bananas.  The French toast (on French bread) sounds better than it is... the French bread kinda fights you... but still tasty.I give it five stars, not because the food was the very best in the world, although it was good... but because Amy makes you feel at home, and that's worth it's weight in gold.

<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/14/2014,11/4/2014,1,15,1,3,3>So much to say and like about this place. First the tacos, tamales, and other Mexican dishes are spot on. Very very casual to eat there - just some tables in the middle of the store. They also have a great juice bar with a huge selection. Real stuff, not the sugary flop like the chains. They have produce that looks like it came right from the farm. I get my salad fixins here. The store features tons of Mexican goods and bakery stuff. They also have a nice Jewish deli section for pastrami and tuna salad. Friendly folks and lots of people from the neighborhood.  I really wish they were open Saturday.

<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2014,10/28/2014,206,413,3,8,5>As of the writing of this review, Patisserie Coralie is 3 days old and Cafe Mozart is now a minimum of -3 days old (gone!). Having spotted a french patisserie while driving back from lunch, this place caught my eye. I saw Macarons listed, but I didn't see any inside. I can't say I blame them, as it's a brand new establishment. The woman running the patisserie seemed to be completely overwhelmed and I wasn't sure if my wife should have tried to thank her in french and pay in euros or not, haha! Meanwhile, the food looks - and tastes, amazing.The desserts here are probably the best I have had in Evanston, hands down. I had an exotic egg, which was made with sprinkled vanilla bean on top to look like an egg with pepper, and it had a fruit/mango jelly inside, with some white chocolate. To comprise of the patty/biscuit underneath was a chocolate/coconut combination, not unlike an israeli macaroon. I guess I made up for macarons with macaroons on this dessert.We also got a dessert tart which looked like a wedding cake, made of hazelnut and a few other delicious items.  Both were noticeably well prepared, and staff was really friendly. I like what they've done with the place.Only after the fact did I find out that this restaurant is related to the creperie st germain (same owner, presumably). While the creperie may have been pretty good but not amazing, Patiesserie Coralie is definitely excellent and probably one of the best places to grab a dessert/pastry I have seen yet. Total win.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/29/2014,10/27/2014,56,146,1,6,4>This review is for the three day GROUPON Juice Cleanse. I saw the offer on Group for 97 (plus 8.50 tax) and decided to go for it. Prior to the actual cleanse, I looked on YELP for descriptions and other reviews- which definitely helped. My sister also signed up for a cleanse so we could reap the benefits of it, together.Ordering: ordering was simple- I called the Evanston location and informed them of my Groupon offer. I was told my order would come in 48 hours later and that they would call me. That Tuesday, Jamila (spelling) called back and told me that my juices would be ready for pick up! I picked up 3 bags with 6 juices each (18) and was ready to begin. The week prior, I was eating low carb/no carb options so going into it wasn't very difficult. Service: The employees at Peeled are so informative and friendly! Winter (who works at the Evanston location) and Jamila were both very open to answering my questions and making recommendations on actual smoothies. I will definitely return for the Smoothies. Juices:Green Lantern: the Green Juice tastes like celery/ginger soup with a hint of sweetness. I'm not a big fan of celery but after the second day- it was a lot easier to drink.Maroon 5: I am a huge fan of Borscht. This had a similar taste to Borscht but it did turn my pee pink (TMI) and was more gingery and kind of sweet. I would've preferred it without the ginger or the sweet. My sister actually liked this one cold. Haute Lemonade- Sister said it was horrible!Cashew Milk: It has a strange taste but it's yummy. Not quite as delicious as a milkshake (or rich) but has a hint of sweetness. Verdict:I wasn't hungry and I'm currently on Day 3 of the Cleanse. To be honest- I did eat a little bit of solid food (small portion of protein) during the day. Also, on the Day 2- I went and purchased an actual Smoothie from Peeled for dinner.Will I do this cleanse again? Probably not. I am sure the Juices are healthy and help detoxify my system- but I'll put my 100.00 on something else! However- I do recommend to try a cleanse if you never have before!

<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2014,10/25/2014,33,130,3,2,2>Well, the word is out. Haewadall is consistently busy at night and it isn't uncommon to wait for a table.  The banchan has improved from my original visit along with their other menu items. The soondubu is still good and I love that the seafood is fresh and never, ever rubbery. This is pretty evident in their ohjinguh bokkum (spicy squid). Order it an tell me the squid isn't cooked perfectly, tender yet toothsome. The Daegu muhri jjim is another dish done really well. Read Hannah H's review about it. While those dishes are excellent, some of their other stews are average. The al chigae and daegu tang (roe stew/spicy cod stew) are not spicy enough and don't have much depth of flavor. Service is friendly but they are constantly running around to different tables so I've learned it's best to ring the table bell when you want their attention. Haewadall is the best option for homestyle Korean food in the area. I think the tables full of Koreans would agree.

They are a family business that has been in highland park for years and clearly there is a reason that they have been here so long "good food". I particularly like their BBQ chicken which is their unique style. Going along with the chicken is a great BBQ sauce. They also have a great slab of ribs that my kids love and I try to cop one or two if they are willing to share. They have a nice bar as well and it's a great place to watch a game and have a drink or meet some friends. It is a small place so if you go during the dinner rush be prepared to wait. Ravinia BBQ is a little place, a hole in the wall but it serves great food and for that I recommend it to anyone!

<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/23/2014,10/20/2014,6,90,4,7,4>I'm so torn on how to review this place...but I will be optimistic.If I had to rate the food, Boltwood would be a solid 4-5.  Service was impeccable -- deserving of a 5.  But the noise level in this restaurant was unbearable.  Hubby and I had a babysitter and don't get to go out as often as we like so when I snagged us a reservation at Boltwood, I was pumped.  Then we walked in the door and I realized that I couldn't hear anything.  Our server tried to explain the menu -- again, I couldn't hear a word she was saying (and I admit to having excellent hearing).  It was so disconcerting that we debated leaving but we stayed.  We were moved to a table in the back which helped, but it still did not alleviate the headache.  I was told that they are getting some sort of noise reduction panels installed, which hopefully will help.  I am used to eating in noisy restaurants, but this was too much.  I'll give the staff this -- they certainly tried to come up with ways to handle this situation.  I wasn't expecting quiet and restrained, but honestly I don't think I can go back until these panels have been installed.  When I do, assuming that the food is of the same caliber, my rating will definitely be upped.The food is definitely new for Evanston (thank goodness).  We started our meal with some pickled vegetables and cheese wrapped in a meat similar to Proscuitto but from Iowa (quericia).  The veggies were delicious.  The char on the quericia was a little extreme -- as a result, it was hard to taste the rest of the dish.We tried the bread with the salted butter -- outstanding.  Then hubby had the tri-tips which were fabulous and I had the sweetbreads with mushroom dashi.  Also delicious.None of the desserts really spoke to me so we didn't order any.Cocktails were good -- I had a homemade highball with CH Vodka and ginger soda.  Delish.  Hubby was excited to see Akari Shogun on tap.I hope to be making a return trip -- once I know that the noise levels have been handled.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2014,10/19/2014,32,212,1,6,5>This review is for the Bollywood Groove cardio dance class on Sundays from 10-11 am.THE MOST IMPORTANT INFOThe first order of business upon arriving at the studio is to sign in on a sheet of paper. Payments are taken care of afterward; the prices are $15 to drop-in for one class, and less per class if you buy a set of classes (attendance would be marked on a card). Payments are made to the instructors directly, not the Foster Dance Studio staff.(The above information was obtained via trial and error the day of my visit, and in fact the confusion which ensued in order to obtain this information is the reason for my withholding 1 star. More explanation for the latter statement is given later in this review.)ADDITIONAL INFOThere were ~20 participants the day I went; most of the people appeared to be regulars, while maybe 1/4 were new to the class. The room we were in was mostly full, and while the studio had some air circulation, I still recommend shorts and a tank top during class, as I was far too warm in a short sleeve t-shirt and yoga pants.The two instructors switched off between songs, which manifested as one woman as the main instructor while the other woman acted as the hype lady (excited whoops, shouts, etc.). The class consisted of a warm up, high energy dance routines (which included a fair amount of jumping), a cool down, and a short core workout. That day the instructors were unable to find yoga mats in the dance studio, so if you're planning on attending I would recommend bringing your own. The moves for the routines are taught quickly, and there were some partner movements as well.Overall the class was good exercise, but the confusion before and after class detracted from my overall experience. Before class, it was unclear that a sign-in sheet even existed, and there was no indication of where we could/should put our things; and after class, it was ambiguous to whom payment should be made. Unfortunately, there's very little information about this class on Foster Dance Studio's website, so I hope this Yelp review can shed some light on the matter.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2014,10/18/2014,29,22,2,4,3>The Art of Beer is a fine establishment for anyone curious about, appreciative of, or passionately crazed by beer.The selection is for the most part American craft beers with local breweries well represented and a few foreign gems included to cover a good portion of the beer spectrum in a tiny retail establishment.The recent addition of beer taps and a limited food menu have transformed the cozy neighborhood store into a worthy destination. I've had the steak tacos on a couple occasions and have had to force myself to stop from ordering more (and more) each time. They are an excellent accompaniment to the ever revolving selection of tap beers. If there is any downside, it's the size of the store. With limited seating, a small group of friends can pack the place. I've been a regular since the store opened in 2013. A great addition to Highwood.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2014,10/17/2014,8,16,2,3,3>Glencoe is a charming little town and right at its center is the Guildhall Restaurant - and what a lovely find it is!Friday night, 8pm, and it was hopping! Loud, most definitely, but happy loud; vibrant, brash, ... raucous even! Folks knew folks, tables cross-chatted with other tables of 'near strangers' - some flirty, some cheeky, some serious but all charming and relaxed.  Everyone seemed to soak up the atmosphere and leverage its benign but wholly-addictive energy for good conversation amongst wonderfully flavorsome food. The large windows threw out to some half-dozen sidewalk tables which were equally busy ... and the sound of the joint traveled up and down the heart of Glencoe and seemed to invite even more spontaneously traffic. Terrific service. Fascinating menu that included fun lamb dishes, plenty of seafood concoctions and unpredictable combinations of pastas, shellfish and sexy sauces ;-)I liked it. A lot.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2014,10/16/2014,155,68,6,11,8>I've been to several haunted houses and I always end up liking Fear City the best.  I really like that they didn't have pitch black rooms where I end up walking out like a bruised peach.  The lines were a bit long even with the VIP tickets, but there were several staff members walking around scaring people and taking pictures to keep us entertained.  There was also a band playing rock music the whole night.  Hungry?There is also a bar with drinks and snacks (just make sure someone from your group is saving your spot in line).  I love that their staff actually interacts with their customers.  I was laughing so much throughout the entire night that my cheeks got sore!  If you came here last year you will notice that there that the main Fear City house has the same basic themes with a few twists.  I won't give anything away, but my favorite parts of last year's themes were still incorporated into the house this year.  This year, the second haunted house (Lady of the Cursed) was different (although I can't remember what the theme of the second haunted house was last year).  We were sent to the Lady of the Cursed house first because the line was shorter.  The guy with all of the statues and books was hilarious! There was only one time that someone in my group asked a question to one of the staff and they were taken aback.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,10/15/2014,362,467,3,5,3>I'm not one to ever really treat myself to spa days (I'd rather spend money on food, to be quite honest), but I really felt like getting a mani/pedi (first time getting a pedi). I decided to give this place a shot after seeing the good reviews on yelp. I made an appointment for 2PM on a Tuesday. I basically made the appointment an hour prior to the actual appointment, which was nice. The first thing I noticed upon walking in is that the facilities are very clean and modern. Olga worked with me on both the manicure and pedicure. She was absolutely fantastic - friendly but did not force conversation. She was also very meticulous with her work and spent time adding nice little touches to make the experience wonderful (e.g. warm towels wraps and a short shoulder massage at the end!) I was basically there for about 1.5 hours (although it took me forever to choose the colors), and my experience was fantastic from start to finish. I also love how they take tools out of sealed bags - points for cleanliness!Only small complaint was I had a gel manicure done a few weeks ago and there was some polish leftover. The cost to remove the gel is $5, but I was not told until she brought out the receipt - I would have paid regardless, but a little heads up would have been nice. However, she was an angel and reminded me of the wildcard discount (I went in knowing I was going to use it, but forgot). I also got to watch the movie Monster in Law throughout mani/pedi, which was fun. They accept credit card, and my total came to $40 (student's get 20% off from M-W), including the additional $5 to remove the gel. I then tipped her $7 in cash for great service. If I decide to treat myself again, I will definitely come back here!
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2014,10/14/2014,1,29,2,5,5>Let me start off with the key point - there is some mighty fine BBQ to be had at RUB.The meats we ordered were both fantastic.  Had both the brisket and pulled pork.  The brisket was amazing, super tender, with some good smoke on it.  And it was great both on it's own, and with the spicy BBQ sauce.  Even my wife and daughter (that aren't brisket fans generally) loved it!  The pulled pork was just as tasty, again with or without sauce.  Need to hit a few more of the meats, but I imagine they are just as good.The sauces - they have a nice variety of the main types of "staple" BBQ sauces available at the tables.  My favorite is the spicy style sauce - as I don't care for the sweeter sauces personally (although theirs are tasty).  I also like their vinegar-based sauce for fries.  It's like malt vinegar with a little something extra.The sides and apps we had were also tasty.  Mac and cheese was very flavorful and cheesey - a big hit with the daughter.  Brussel sprouts cooked in bacon were nice, had a little char on them, tasted very good.  Baked beans were also good, with some nice chunks of the meat in there.  We also enjoyed the hush puppies quite a bit.  I also dig the spicy pickles they throw on your tray for you with your meal - they are a nice compliment to all the meat going on.Service was quick, the line just kept on moving.  For me, this is the way BBQ is best, simple on the tray - nothing fancy going on.Long story short - I will be back as often as my waistline will allow it to gorge myself on fabulous smoked meats!  And I will bring along friends and family.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2014,10/13/2014,29,186,1,3,4>What I love about this place, besides that I've enjoyed everything I've tried, is that they have actual bottles of mustard on the table instead of tiny packets hidden away, and the Cholula sauce on every table. I'm a little embarrassed to say that my favorite thing to eat is a plate of naked fries (reasonable, at $3) with globs of mustard and cholula sauce all over it. Delicious! I've tried a few other things, like salads, and sliders. I have no complaints. Of course, there will be loud kids here, especially around lunch, and dinner too...and in between. Well, what did you expect? I recommend it for a casual lunch or dinner, or just a mad hankering for fries. I do wish they had some cheap coffee; it doesn't have to be super good. I would love to be able to buy a  medium cup for a dollar here.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2014,10/12/2014,34,75,2,5,3>Definitely go for the Puriste, though I wouldn't say adding the fried egg is really worth it. Both the crepe filing and the crepes themselves are absolutely delicious, as are the salads. They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the service is a bit slower outside, so eat indoors if you're in a hurry. This place usually has a $10 for $20 Groupon going, which makes a meal here a great deal.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2014,10/11/2014,90,300,4,4,4>I love wine. I love small wine shops. I love small wine shops that have a wide selection and a range of prices. I love small wine shops that have a wide selection, a range of prices, that have wine tastings, and are in my neighborhood. I love Wine Goddess. My first encounter was during the Custer St. Fair, when I had a lovely rose after is had my fill of beer. The woman I talked to who was manning their tent was incredibly friendly and helpful, which made me want to visit again. This business is a great addition to Evanston, one that will be in my regular rotation.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2014,10/10/2014,2251,305,7,7,6>When I heard they were finally updating this restaurant last year, I was so excited. I know people were sad to see the old place go, but it needed a serious facelift. And boy did it ever.The new interior makes me think it belongs in "Horse and Hound." Dark inviting wood with modern touches so you don't feel like you're going to your parents' restaurant.On two occasions, I've had lunch here and ordered the fish specials both times. I was really pleased with both, as were the people I dined with. Sometimes fish dishes can be boring but the kitchen serves an elegant plate.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2014,10/9/2014,151,436,7,9,8>I came here lured and intrigued by the dim sum Sunday brunch.I have to say that this a much better dim sum than the one tried in Chinatown, which was just awful and definitely not my thing.The dim sum bunch at Koi has definitely some tasty items such as the shrimp cakes and spinach wraps. The great thing that these are small bites and that you can try a lot of items on the menu. The Jasmine tea is just delicious and bottomless mimosas are great as well. I think my favorite items on the dim sum menu were the sweets, they are really tasty and unique and I don't know any place that offers them.The service on Sunday is little rushed, there was one waiter that really stood out, and he rolled with the dim sum cart and explained everything in great detail and what he had. The other dim sum cart driver was not that great. The waiter was kind a non- existent, I am not sure what he was doing but he was not by my table. The one dim sum cart guy was like my waiter eventhough it was obvious it was not his job. I hope that he is compensated for his hard work because he really became my server.Overall, I would recommend this dim sum Sunday brunch experience it is a lot of fun and there are some great finds.....its like a dim sum scavenger hunt.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2014,10/8/2014,66,161,3,5,4>This is the world's friendliest Chinese restaurant!  The owner recognizes my fiance and calls him by his first name.  The food is some of the best Chinese I have had.  My fiance swears by the Mongolian Beef. It is slightly sweet and is very tender.We decided to eat in the other day.  Service was a bit disorganized since we were told to sit wherever we wanted.  It took a few minutes to get menus and our server, but after that everything was good.  Our server took the time to make a suggestion of a noodle dish since according to her the thing I ordered was not very good. They make their own noodles in house, and the quality shows.
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,10/7/2014,168,197,2,3,3>Being someone who truly enjoys cooking, this place is a mecca for anyone looking to add a little something extra to your meals.It's a small shop with a ton to offer.  When you first walk in, you get that feeling seeing all of the vats of specialty oils and vinegars.  The small tasting cups are a must try for those that want to spark their taste buds.  Small sips are the way to go for those weak in the palates.  Some of my favorites are:Tuscan Herb Olive Oil - traditional tastePersian Lime Olive Oil - great for fishSmoky Bacon Olive Oil - um BACON!Apple Balsamic VinegarChampagne Pear Vinegar Chocolate Balsamic Vinegar - Don't ask, just taste it!!I'm very impressed with the quality, taste, and friendly service in the place and look forward to filling up my bottles frequently!

The whole process took an hour and a half and I was very pleased with the results.  Kevin and Jeannie are very personable and aim to please.  Their shop is clean and bright.  I would definitely recommend them and I will be back!

Little boutiques all wrapped up into 1 store. There's something for everyone in here. I really liked the paintings and the homemade candles. If you need a cute gift for a friend, you can probably find something here.

Back when I was able to eat gluten, I would devour their pita like a mofo. If I had to complain about one thing, it'd be the fact that they have Pepsi products and not coke products in the fountain. This boy needs his diet coke, ya dig? Eh, no biggie, though, if I get thirsty enough, I'll drink their honey mustard. It's like sex in a ramekin. YUMMO.

<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2014,9/30/2014,19,70,6,8,5>All of the new hipster bs restaurants in Evanston should beware. Peckish Pig is the best of the lot.  The atmosphere, staff and clientele are a lot more diverse and authentic. This IS Evanston after all. Not Winnetka. Drinks are reasonably priced, The staff is awesome, and the patio is cute as can be. The food is good but I would love if it were dumbed down just a little.  For example the burger has goat cheese and the ketchup is not Heinz. Why?  Evanston needs a restaurant with delicious simple food. But that's just me.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,9/29/2014,1,27,2,3,4>This is our third time. Omg. It was a fantastic meal. Started with a wonderful pea soup w croutons. Soup was just the right consistency...not too watery nor too thick. Croutons very tasty. Shared the mussels with Len. We both agreed they were terrific. Next I had short ribs. Made over 4-5 hours on a lovely bouquet of vegetables. Fabulous sauce over horseradish potatoes. Heaven. Finally we shared a berry crumble with ice cream and whipped cream. Superb meal. Highly recommend this place.

This time I came in excited due to the fact that my job (personal chef) very rarely allows me to have my nails done, let alone long nails at that. Since I have some free time I took full advantage of my time! I came in asking for a Gel Full Set, I'm also a Halloween fanatic and wanted something ghoulish. The woman who did my nails was more than willing do the design. At the end she even asked if i would like sparkles, which of course I said YES to! My nails came our beautiful. I love them, they are so cute.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2014,9/27/2014,2,20,2,4,3>As an avid lover of coffee stores and good coffee, I was frustrated with my lack of options for the longest time. Anyone living in Lake Bluff knows that you can get either Starbucks coffee or coffee from a restaurant that just makes a large pot of it for the masses. I just walked into Prairie for the first time today (having completely forgot about it initially) and was pleasantly surprised. It's a small joint, but the Americano I am currently sipping is better than anything I've had within a 15 mile radius. So coffee lovers of the North Shore rejoice! Come in and support the store. Hopefully this hidden gem will make it through the winter with your help.

They have a bakery and excellent baked goods (bagels=yum) too, and you can even order a giant sandwich, (The New Jersey Bypass is not for the faint of heart), and eat it there with a giant Dill pickle, chips, a cookie, and a drink. They have lox cream cheese in the fridge and smoked lox at the counter. They're super-popular with the locals, so don't expect to find easy parking, though the new building does help with that a bit.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2014,9/24/2014,4,15,1,6,4>I love this gem of a bookstore, which is tucked in an alley in downtown Evanston. They sell used and new books, as well and some jewelry. I've heard that they're known for their cooking books. But for me, the real treasure is the children's section. It's curated well, with a fantastic selection of beautiful books I haven't seen elsewhere. They also have children's books in several languages and in translation. Plus, a cute reading spot with little rockers, etc. The people who own the store are very welcoming and helpful. They also gift wrap books.

We also got the milk and honey salad, which was good, but if we had to drop one menu item this is the one we'd have chosen, and we got the smoked tofu wrap which was AMAZING.  They smoke the tofu in-house and it was seriously like nothing I've ever had before.  I was blown away with how amazing everything was.I will definitely be back to found.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2013,9/22/2014,0,5,3,2,1>This was my first visit to VV, and as I always do when I enter a record store I told the clerk this was my first visit. If a store is decent, they'll give me a tour of their inventory. If they aren't, they'll ignore me or worse. I'm glad to say I was given the full tour and at first had no idea it was the owner of the place. He was very nice and his explanation of the store's layout was informative. He only got a little prickly when I asked him about the grading system, telling me all of the records on the first floor were mint or excellent, but that's fine as it made things easier. I can't think of any other store set up this way.Entering this classic record store is like being invited to the home of an audiophile who's been collecting for 30 years and allowed to browse his most cherished records. Where other stores keep "the good stuff" behind the counter or locked in a glass cabinet, VV has it all out for display where I could handle as many as I liked. It was great seeing in person scarce records I'd only heard about, getting to check out the condition first hand and read the back panels. Nearly every record on the first floor has an informative, hand-written note about which version it is and why it's rare. Yes, there are are some high priced records here, but there were also plenty in the average price range too. The store is about equally divided between the collector's records upstairs and the "bargain bin" downstairs where records are uniformly priced at $4 each or three for $10. I purchased three classic LPs by the Eagles downstairs for ten bucks, albums I'd seen priced much higher at other record stores.Upstairs, I splurged a little and bought a bootleg I'd been after for a while. The price was about what I'd seen online, it wasn't a bargain, but there was no shipping and no risk, I didn't have to worry about grading or rip-offs. And I guess that's the bottom line. In one hour I got to browse a selection of scarce and rare records it would've take months or more to find elsewhere. I could handle them personally without someone breathing over my shoulder. There was no risk, no bidding, no shipping cost and no damage from the Post Office. Within twenty minutes, I was home experiencing the instant gratification of finding a great LP and listening to it right away. I hope VV is around another 30 years and I think we should support our local record stores. Worth every penny!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2014,9/21/2014,98,320,2,7,3>My wife and I stopped in here this weekend to check out the scene. We had already eaten somewhere else, so we didn't get to sample the menu (which looked really amazing). However, we did try a few beers and cocktails. The staff is really well trained and they know their beer and cocktails quite well. We had a few conversations with a couple of the bartenders and staff that were quite educational for us. One thing we did notice was that the lighting seemed a bit too bright for this type of establishment. It seems like they are burning 100 watt bulbs in a place where 60 would be more than enough. Regardless, the menu looked very enticing and we vowed to return in order to try it.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2014,9/20/2014,32,156,2,6,6>This is such a great, tiny, classic grubby diner. It is REALLY grubby, but I find that to be half the charm. The menu is on the wall and like, maybe 2 paper menus, our waitress managed to procure some for us but then took them away, but you don't even need the menu. Just like, any combination of egg/bread/meat, and they will make it. I had a veggie omelet and hashbrowns well done, plus toast. So good! I mean, nothing too creative, but i think we can all agree we secretly prefer nice and simple to fancy and creative, right? Also, they give you a full pot of coffee that they just leave on the table, so you will be well-caffeinated.The only complaint I have, literally just one!, is that they are not open sundays. Sundas are the day on earth I need such a place the most!
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2014,9/19/2014,108,103,1,6,3>This is a cozy little Thai place right next to Trader Joe's with a corner window area in the plaza.I came here with my family on a Saturday afternoon for lunch just a little after they opened (doors open at noon).It was a neat little restaurant, very clean with glossy wooden tables. We were seated in a booth by the windows and their service was friendly and quick.Between three people we ordered 3 dishes and two drinks: Thai iced tea and iced coffee, Curry fried rice, Pad Thai and Rama Broccoli. You will also get iced water infused with lemon, which is a plus!There was plenty of food and we had enough to take home for leftovers. The Thai iced coffee and the Thai iced tea WILL be very sweet. I believe that's how it's supposed to be, and most Thai cuisine is too... but just a fair warning!I enjoyed a relaxing lunch here, and they have a wine for dinner as well. For their Rama Broccoli with Tofu, their peanut sauce was also on the sweeter side (as opposed to peanutty). But Rama Broccoli is my go-to dish and I was pretty happy with it! Great service with decent portions, and a good option to grab some grub while running errands.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2014,9/18/2014,132,200,1,4,5>Officially the best (and cheapest) bubble tea in Evanston - hurray! I was so excited for this place to finally open, and now it has and I've gone twice in the last week. I had the mango smoothie, and I only had it with half sugar, but it was still incredibly sweet - definitely getting even less sugar next time. And I'll be back for the passion fruit smoothie - I love passion fruit and I can never get enough of that. Overall, great location, relatively quick service, and great prices means I'll definitely be coming here again and again.
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,9/17/2014,1,14,1,4,4>The staff are friendly and prompt, and they were able to call in another massage therapist so we could go for couples' massages! They do not have one room for both, but it was great nonetheless. I've had Swedish and deep tissue massages here, and each one has been amazing! They know how to feel and recognize trouble spots, and how to work them... I leave feeling like I'm on a cloud. The last time I was there it seems they now have spa pedicure seats... I may have to go again!
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,9/16/2014,25,52,,3,4>The first time I had Piron's chocolate was at a gala for charity back in 2000.  I couldn't believe I'd been by the shop dozens of time and never noticed it.  Since then, it's become my go-to place when I'm in need of a high-quality gift of chocolate.I would pick up bars of their high cacao dark chocolate for my nephew on occasion, some truffles or toffee for a girlfriend.  On my visit of February 28, 2014, I discovered their hot chocolate.  I purchased my first electric guitar down the street at Guitar Works up the street, and found my sales guy there so laid-back and helpful that I also picked him up a thank you, some chocolate covered raspberry animal shapes.What they have is beautiful, not just flavorful.  Hard to say to chocolate that looks to be a piece of art.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2014,9/15/2014,60,245,,3,3>A recent expansion has made this a great place for outdoor dining. There is now plenty of seating indoors as well where it could be nearly impossible to get a table for a burger in the past.Good bar food and some specials. Cold beer and friendly servers. They now host private parties in a new area above the restaurant. The new back bar hosts live music on weekends. I miss the outdoor seating at the old Glenview House but this place is making me get over it. They also have a little 'living room' that's a cool touch with a fireplace and big leather sofa's. The only complaint is the tiny bathrooms.This is quickly becoming my burger/tavern joint due to one of my favorites 'Hackneys' pricing themselves out of my market. But I'll save that for their review.
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,9/14/2014,5,29,2,4,5>Whether for breakfast or lunch, the food here is fantastic.  Eggs benedict and bagels and lox are always good for breakfast and the pastrami, corn beef, and chopped liver sandwiches here make for a great lunch.  The sandwiches are significant and can often make for a couple of meals.  The bread is delicious here too and it is hard to leave without taking a couple of desserts home for later.  Friendly and helpful staff as well.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2014,9/13/2014,34,166,3,4,4>Bobby to the rescue! Delivery or take out this is a great pie. There is a few places to sit for a slice but it is set up for take out. I know that the pizza is always a hit with the kids and the wings are meaty and the perfect amount of spice. Beyond the food is Bobby he is a very nice guy, like shirt off his back nice.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2014,9/12/2014,220,174,3,6,6>Back in school my college classmate always had butter chicken cooked in the basement kitchen of her mom's house. We found ourselves getting through our college days sustained on this butter chicken and basmati rice. Looking for the same tastes of this home cooking has been hard to find and I am always on the lookout for a substantial butter chicken replacement. The drive by this busy intersection does not allow one to take in the store front signs for this restaurant. Unless one was stopped by the Shell for gasoline, then the store front sign would be visible. Tucked into the corner and adjacent to the gas station, what was once the previous spot for Krispy Krunchy Chicken, now stands a new Skokie eatery.Recommended by the local eyebrow threader in neighboring Morton Grove, who claims "very good food," I decided to try out the place. Anticipating the wonders of Indian/Pakistani cuisine I arrived on a Monday. This day was not to be the day to try out the food as they are closed on Mondays. A couple weeks later, with a cloudy outlook and drizzly rain outside, I found myself on a Thursday afternoon, at the doorstep. Only one other customer was awaiting their order when I stepped into the main entrance. The doors open up to the take out only counter and next door grocery.  After ordering, I was asked to wait five minutes. Whiling away the time, I perused the rows of Indian/Pak grocery goods and spices along the aisles and the refrigerated and frozen pre packaged foods along the back wall.An order of Butter Chicken with 2 tandoori Naan $6.99Tandoori Chicken in Paratha $3.49/each2 Samosa $1.25/eachadded up to $14 plus change.Butter chicken on presentation might not be great to look at since the oil from the sauce made it's appearance settling on the top of the dish and seeped out of the container into the bag. Not a problem after first bite, the melding of all the spices with the tender chicken made for good eats, but the heat was probably toned down to satisfy the masses. The tandoori chicken paratha was very tasty and the chicken was moist and tender. I was impressed over the onions layered throughout the wrap. The heat was just slight. Can not say about the samosa because we were just too full to eat another bite. I still have leftovers from the chicken. A couple mehs were the naan bread became too chewy at the ends wrapped in the foil and the oil from the butter chicken maybe even a little more heat to the prepared dishes. Many drink choices and dessert options.Minimum of $3.50 for credit card use.I am adding this place to my list of food options around town. Enjoy!
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,9/11/2014,57,93,1,4,4>The best Thai restaurant in the area! I have been here a couple times and have enjoyed my food each time.  The food is very delicious and the staff is very friendly.  I used to think thai food was the same everywhere but I have had some BAD thai food.  This place doesn't skimp on portions and the dishes are not drowning in grease. There are lots of thai restaurants in the area but I come here (even though I pass up about 3 other thai places) to get my thai food cravings. Highly recommended!
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2014,9/10/2014,94,254,2,5,6>My kids have all grown up with Nemo's since they all went to New Trier in what seems like many moons ago, but I tried it myself for the first time and really enjoyed the turkey with cheese sandwich. It was really tasty with the CSS (Captain's Special Sauce) which is not too sweet or sour, but just right! They use real turkey breast and you can taste the difference. Have the sandwich toasted...umm yummy.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2014,9/9/2014,14,122,1,4,5>I'm glad we followed my wife's suggestion to have a late Saturday dinner here.Froggy's is truly a Highwood  institution.  At one point, I had the feeling that it was resting on its laurels and slowly slipping into restaurant  boredom.  It now feels like the fresh next generation of the institution.There are two rooms for meals--the main dining room and a bar indoor garden area.  Late nighters are seated in the bar area.  The bar area is fresher than before (the irritating heater noise is gone).I think my wife suggested the restaurant being in the mood for duck.  This entree is of the old tradition--it came perfectly done, subtle sauce.  The waiter picked up on my wife's inquiries about gluten free  bread (they do not have it) and made sure of the order being to her satisfaction. I had French Onion soup and veal with mushrooms.  The soup had croutons instead of a slice of bread.  The melding of cheese, croutons and onions with a rich broth was excellent.I munched on the non-gluten free bread--it was crusty, chewy and tasty.The veal special hit its mark as well.  Mushrooms with a rich sauce added to the depth of tastes,Our waiter was very young, not one of the familiar regulars.  A suitable image for the 'new' institution--he was attentive and friendly, making sure of our desires and gently suggesting that the kitchen would be closing shortly (at 10).But I have to get a better understanding of their wine by a glass or they have to rethink what is being served.  The Bordeaux I had was trying to get caught up to the excellent meal that was served and not quite getting there.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2014,9/8/2014,52,54,1,10,7>So incredibly thankful for these guys and the magic that they do.I was in need of a last minute cake and called to see if they had any that was ready for pickup. They informed me that they usually don't have them but can make a cake within a couple of hours if needed. I agreed and ordered an 8.5'' mocha chiffon cake that was all ready for me to pickup within 3 hours.And oh, what a cake. Incredibly moist, fluffy texture, and immaculate looking on top of that. I'm here wishing I still had leftovers as I write this review. They added my personalized message on the cake (ps: "bosing" = boss and it was for my dad who's the biggest boss of them all) and were extremely friendly when I came and picked it up. They've been around for 5 years now and I can't believe I've waited this long despite the fact that it's a 2 min drive away. Will surely be back here for more. Need a cake? Craving some cupcakes? Want a quick cup of coffee? Le Sucre's definitely worth checking out.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,9/7/2014,38,121,2,9,8>I'm a self-proclaimed health freak, so imagine how excited I was to find out that LYFE Kitchen opened in Evanston! In fact, to show my diehard support, I came here three times in one week. I got lucky once and even met Jeremy Bringardener, one of the Food Network's "Chopped" champions! Awesome. As a vegetarian, I was delighted that they had separate menus for those with dietary restrictions (i.e. vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free). Having multiple options for once made my life slightly more difficult, but it's not the most terrible problem to have in the world. Here are must-try's:1. quinoa crunch wrap coupled with hot sauce 2. kale banana smoothie 3. flatbread with roasted mushroom and goat cheese 4. baked sweet potato fries5. chocolate & banana budino6. FREE chilled sparkling water  Overall, this is a great addition for healthy dining options in Evanston. Fellow health freaks will rejoice!
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/28/2014,9/6/2014,3,19,1,3,4>There is nowhere in Chicagoland that is would rather eat than in the terrace overlooking the golf course on a lovely summer evening. The food is amazing and the staff is always so helpful and accommodating. The facilities are beautiful. The pool area needs a bit of updating, but I believe that is slated for 2016. They really go above and beyond for the events. Fantastic place.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2014,9/5/2014,14,9,1,3,3>This is a third place for my husband and I. They have happy hour deals throughout the week, and they have a good variety on the prices. You can pay more for a really good burger, but they also have a retro menu with selections under $6 ea. The grilled ham and cheese is my fave for a quick Saturday  lunch along with an Original Sin pear cider.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2014,9/4/2014,7,7,2,5,3>Tom at Presidential Roofing is the only contractor out of 5 companies that paid attention to my requests and provided an itemized estimate for everything that I needed. Tom was also the only contractor who followed up with me after the estimate to let me know that it had been performed and to contact him with any concerns. We received an honest estimate with explanations and clear acknowledgement of expectations for possible additional costs.The work was completed within the given time frame. We received a beautiful new roof, skylight, gutters, downspouts, additional proper venting, flashing and aluminum fascia/soffits. Professional quality and professional installation. All of this and an affordable price.My old gutters had Gutter Stuff filters installed. I forgot to mention this and was worried it would be discarded with the old gutters. I was happy to see that my gutter filters were saved and put aside. Greatly appreciated. I went onto the roof to inspect and to put my gutter filters back in and was very happy with the worked performed. Great work and installed with care. The gutters felt strong enough to hang from, but I wouldn't recommend trying! I also appreciated the 3"x4" size downspouts. My neighbors downspouts now look inadequate.My home and property was clean and free of any debris. Previously I had used tar for do-it-yourself repairs and got in on siding where my roof meets that siding. They went above and beyond by cleaning up that old tar where the new roof was being installed. It was not expected and again greatly appreciated.Our home is no longer an eye sore. I highly recommend Presidential Roofing.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2014,9/3/2014,6,16,1,4,3>Overall an awesome dining experience. We really enjoyed the location (near some beautiful homes and cool shops). Also appreciated the outdoor seating! We were seated and served promptly.I ordered a caipirinha and my date had the white sangria - and both were mixed excellently. I ordered the lentil salad, which came on a bed of spinach lightly drizzled w balsamic vinaigrette. My date ordered the Thai peanut noodles. Both were full of flavor and didn't sit heavy on us at all! The most pleasant surprise was the speed with which we got our food after ordering.Lastly we took advantage of the yelp coupon and ordered dessert. Our mixed berry cobbler was decent but dry, and needed some local vanilla ice cream to complete it. Friendly, fast service, good drinks and great food. We WILL be back.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,9/2/2014,33,15,3,4,4>Cozy  is super cute! My theory is that a vintage collector procured so many neat items that he had no more room for, that he decided to open up a whole establishment to display his treasures. Traditional, feel-good noodle dishes as well as interesting original creations are presented just as artistically as the restaurant. The taste is also excellent, and the waiters are open and friendly. Charming and unique, yet nostalgic and homey. Great place to go with friends.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,9/1/2014,130,318,2,3,5>Any event thrown at Everts Park in Highwood is more than likely going to get a minimum of 4 stars from me. I LOVE this park, complete with circular walking path with complete access to all the food trucks and other vendors that line the outside. Throw a gazebo in the middle of it all with live music and a few good friends and it's hard not to have a great time. My sister invited me up here last night after work b/c she's good friends with Sarah from the Fat Shallot food truck. I quickly took her up on the invite b/c the truffle fries from the Shallot are simply the BEST I've ever had from anywhere, including any brick and mortar restaurant. Seriously, they must have some magical machine in that food truck that just churns out amazingness!! Well this time they had spicy sesame fries as well, and wouldn't ya know it we had to order those as well as the truffle fries. We also split a buffalo chicken sandwich that was tasty as well. I'm still going to say that the salami sandwich is my favorite sammy I've had from them, although Sarah explained that you can add ANYTHING to the grilled cheese they make, including salami so that sounds like a winner in my book. We walked around, sipped on a couple beers from Revolution Brewery and enjoyed the market as much as possible until the weather got just a bit too chilly for us to stay. While I noticed attendance was a bit low probably due to the weather, Highwood put on a better event on a Wednesday night than my hometown of Northbrook did with the St. Norberts block party last Saturday night. Our block party here in town had great music, but that's about where the comparison ends b/c Highwood just seems to have excellent local restaurants that are always willing to participate in events such as the evening market. They also attracted some excellent trucks last night, Fat Shallot, Toasty Cheese, Grillers, etc. You've done it again, Highwood. I can't wait to come back for the craft beer fest, inferno fest or any other fest they decide to host here in Evert Park!!!

She listens to exactly what you want and will give her opinion if asked. I always love hearing her thoughts on what I should get done. I never have to worry about her cutting more than I asked or doing something without asking. Her prices are reasonable as well! You should definitely check it out!

<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/18/2014,8/29/2014,13,122,2,3,4>I've got a nicer bike than I used to, and I ride it a lot more. I managed to break my chain not long ago, also taking out my rear derailleur. They fixed me up nicely, also re-truing the wheel, and I didn't feel scalped at the end. I was without my bike for a few more days than I would have liked, but they completed the repair in the time frame they estimated in person (over the phone they suggested they might be able to get parts overnighted, which made me think the repair would be faster), and the bike felt perfectly dialed in when I got it back. I'd use them for service or perhaps a tune-up again.They also get points for having an outside air hose available during business hours.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,8/28/2014,35,244,1,4,4>Most people walking in to see a seamstress are there about a pair of khakis, get a suite or dress altered. I took in a pair of motorcycle over-pants. She didn't pause for a second or throw me out... I like that! Everything looked great when I picked them up and for the amount of work being done, I felt like it was too cheap. I may have to go back and pay her some more, seriously. I love service with a smile and I got that from all their employees. Just doesn't happen as often anymore. So next time I need "normal" clothes done, I'm headed back to Sewing Masters!
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/22/2014,8/27/2014,58,347,1,3,3>Good surburb sushi! I was definitely impressed.This will definitely be on my mind when I want sushi (though I don't think they deliver or use grubhub unfortunately)... Here's why:1. Fresh fish... what a concept. Not sure why so many places skimp on this. Lack of competition? A clientele that can't tell the difference? Eh.2. Parking! Not so much a suburb issue, but seriously... having to settle for crappy sushi vs dealing with city traffic... I like a place that avoids both.3. Fast service - I placed an order after I walked in because I had questions, and the sushi was ready in minutes. With a hot kitchen app, the whole order took around 5 minutes!4. Generous portions - The prices on the menu might look steep, but having put up with Chicago prices, you will be very happy with the amount of fish. $15 for a specialty roll might seem high, but it's like twice the diameter of an 8-pc roll from a city joint... plus fish wrapped all the way around the large circumference. You do the math.The menage a trois was very good. Interesting flavor and textures without hiding the fish entirely. You'll also find the same generous portions of fish in the spicy tuna salad! I'd skip the Golden Scallop - way too heavy and greasy after 2 bites and you can't even taste the scallop.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2014,8/26/2014,54,205,1,4,4>Alright...this place is awesome! Can't even begin to explain how nice the staff is and the froyo is amazing. I love how close this place is to our house, we walk there quite often and hope more people check this place out. They change the flavors once a week so it's always different, which I love! It's great for kids too. The have dry erase tables with neon markers...fun for all ages :)Go people, GO!!!
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2014,8/25/2014,88,154,1,4,5>Came here for their $9 lunch special and left happy and full! We both got 2 meats and 1 veggie, which comes out on a huge plate with a side of 4 breads. You can share for a sharing fee of $2 but I don't think that would be enough food for two. We finished everything! Our favorite was the beef stew- mild. The ethiopian coffee was also delicious, and is 2.50 with unlimited refills. Service was great and quick. We were the only ones here (it was 3pm) and she was very friendly and fast. We ordered, got our food, ate, and paid all in 30 minutes. Definitely give it a try if you are around for lunch. The lunch special runs from 12-4:30, which is much later than the neighboring reataurants!
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,8/24/2014,56,146,3,8,7>The only thing bad about this place are the hours- from 12-4- because if I could have it my way- I would want this place to be open for longer periods of time! (Esp because I work during the week and would not be able to make it!)I can understand the limited hours- this place is run by volunteers! Really fun volunteers with cool stories and an appreciation for "great finds".Today I stopped by after I had spent the morning downtown with 30 minutes before the store closed. I had two "great finds"! One 100% silk Ann Taylor skirt that was a size too small (my mom altered it so now it's perfect!) and a vintage Lion Head Anne Klein belt! What was amazing was that the skirt looked brand new (silk would have wrinkles if it was worn) and the belt looked like new as well! The best thing is that my total came to be $5.00, and the entire purchase benefits Shore Community Services, an organization that assists children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The store is clean, the staff member I met was friendly, and they have everything from books and toys to purses and wedding dresses! Wonderful store and I like how things are very well organized and I truly commend whoever runs it! Great job!Notes:-credit card can be used for purchases over $10.00-street parking is free and there are ample spaces right outside the store!
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2014,8/23/2014,49,140,1,5,3>I really like this place! I came here the first time due the grand opening coupon I received in the mail, and had such a positive experience I returned about a week later.This is an extremely clean salon (something I consider super important given the tools they use and the potential for infection). The staff is pretty friendly, although I found my first technician to be friendlier, and speak English more fluently, than the second technician.I loved the pedicure I got here- because if the coupon, I upgraded to a pedicure with a 15 massage, and had no regrets. Unlike other places, they actually set a timer for the massage, so you know you're getting the full service. My technician was also super nice about the water temperature- some places make the water way too cold! She even offered to add hot water partway through, since she could feel it getting tepid. My second visit was for a gel manicure. They have a really extensive selection of gel colors (and multiple brands!), which I really appreciate. It was a detailed manicure- my one complaint is that the technician bumped my hand and smudged the polish, and I had to ask specifically for him to fix it. Small quibble, and I will return!
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2014,8/22/2014,163,595,4,6,5>I have found my go to place for fresh Seafood in the north shore.  This place is great.  The wife and I came here over the weekend for lunch.  And we feasted for what came out to about $45 before tip.The oysters are your standard blue points.  They are nice and big.  I honestly would not get these again because at $9 for a half dozen its a little steep for blue points.  But fresh and flavorful either plane or with the mango salsa they provide.Next was the ceviche tostadas.  The order came with two.  And they did not skimp on the ceviche.  Each tostada was drowning in a pile of ceviche made from what I believe was salmon and potentially some other fish.  The lime and onions may be overpowering for some, but I had no complaints.Now its time for the drunken shrimp.  I was thinking it would be more along the Chinese version where the shrimp are stunned in baijiu, but I was wrong.  It was some sort of dish that had a cream based sauce and I'd have to guess some booze to make them 'drunk'.  I really have no clue what it was but damn I want more.So now we're onto our main and we shared a lobster roll.  Fresh, light flavors, refreshing, and LOBSTER.  It was loaded with meat, celery, and spices.  This with a side of hush puppies are you're good to go.We finished with their coffee.  Now most of the time I wouldn't mention a drip coffee. But this was a Mexican style coffee that was already spiced with cinnamon and was perfectly sweetened.I will come back here fairly often.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2014,8/21/2014,78,54,1,4,3>My boyfriend and I went here last minute around 7 o'clock and we got sat right away. We had a nice little table right by the window. They started us off with some complimentary fried plantains and chimichurri, it was a great start and a nice change to bread and butter. Then we got a crab cake appetizer and it was phenomenal. It had a papaya slaw on top and the flavors blended nicely. Tasted like fresh crab. For our entree we asked the server what his favorite was and he surprised us with a mushroom stuffed skirt steak which was amazing. I don't normally enjoy steak but this was exceptional. Really high quality with a nice crust and great flavors. Our server was very attentive and kept asking us how everything was progressing and if there was anything he could get for us. This was really nice opposed to a lot of waiters now a days not really seeming like they care. Overall it was a really great experience and i definitely will be returning.

The space is very open and relaxing with fresh produce on display, a refrigerated section with cold pressed juices ( there was a special today for $2 carrot/ginger) try this amazing dessert made of chia seeds, coconut milk, shredded coconut and berries,) and some baked goods in the front. There's a huge array of drinks from cold pressed, freshly made to order juices or smoothies, some desserts and other healthy treats which is a great alternative to the overly sweet and processed foods out there. I tried the 'strawberry fields' smoothie with strawberry/blueberry/peach/kale/coconut milk and it was not too sweet and was filling. For the fresh smoothies you can opt for a choice of soy/almond/or coconut milk or coconut water.On my first visit, I tried 'one love' which is freshly made to order with apple , lime, mint, and kale. I really loved this drink and will get it again..also tried a sample of 'let it go' smoothie which is essentially like a chocolate milkshake...so yummy!There's a huge variety of drinks to choose from which can appease the pickiest of eaters. Additionally, the owners are so nice and I'm happy to see them so active within the community at various events. Congrats on your opening and I'm looking forward to making my way through the menu!
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,8/19/2014,26,129,2,8,3>Another Friday visit to The Curragh.   Was supposed to be the boys and I, but the ladies wanted in too.   We called ahead and they were able to accommodate the 11 of us.   The restaurant was jumping.   Very busy.   The experience was really A++.   Supurb night.  With this many people, I got to see a lot of different food choices.   Everyone liked what they ordered.   The appitizers consisted of (kids) cheese sticks.   Wow did they look good.  Freshly made.   Authentic.    The corned beef rolls looked fantastic too.   The chicken nachos... wow..... to bad it was Friday in lent, so I chose to NOT enjoy the super looking appitizers.    It didn't really matter, because with 8 kids....there wasn't much left.I got the fish n'chips.   Wow.... AWSOME tasting dinner.  The fish, the tarter sauce, the (steak) fries.   Perfection, filling, one of the best.  Cooked perfectly....  We didn't take much home.  The desert consisted of the brownie with scoop of ice cream.   Luckily the Waiter told us about the size.   We split hit his desert between 3 people.  It was still too much.   Great brownie.Ok... In a nutshell.   The food was great.   The service rocked (thanks Colin). The band was a perfect touch....  Welcome to the neighborhood Curragh.... Really glad you settled here.   I will see you again soon.
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,8/18/2014,11,26,,3,2>I had a great experience for my first visit here. Came in today with my mom and I was feeling a bit under the weather. I always crave spicy thai soup whenever I'm not feeling well & I decided to check out Simply Thai and their Tom Kha soup. When we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee at the counter who was very welcoming and answered any questions we had. (I only ordered the Tom Kha soup with tofu- so that's what I'm basing my review off of until I visit again and try more of their menu items)The soup was freshly made, super hot(temp) and LOADED with tofu & mushrooms. It was excellent! The broth was seasoned very nicely & had a little kick of spicy heat. It was prepared swiftly & the employee at the counter handed it to me and told me to feel better. Very sweet. I look forward to going back to try more of their dishes & try one of their many smoothie flavors.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2014,8/17/2014,18,149,2,4,3>My husband and I had lunch here for the first time about two weeks ago. We were both very happy with the experience and will definitely go back. The space is bright, open, clean and nicely decorated.We had a salad and a sandwich, and both were fresh, flavorful, nicely portioned, and well-presented.Our service was excellent.Prices are spot-on for the experience.
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2014,8/16/2014,206,413,6,7,6>Hoosier Mama devours my soul, and probably my organs if I give it enough time as well.I have to say that it not only amuses me how much Tanya V loves the place but that I even run into her when I go over there myself. Listen to her review on the place - because she knows what's up.Not only do they make amazing pies which range from sweet to savory, but they make sandwiches, salads, etc. So don't think of this like a Baker's Square that you only go to pick up a pie, think of it like Farmhouse but also with pies.  You do have the coconut cream, banana cream, chess pie, and also savory curried pies. The variety is pretty good, and that's not even getting to the awesome veggie sandwiches.Agreeing with Tanya - seating is nice, staff are friendly, and the place basically has nothing but excellent food.  They also have a two person bathroom (not a stall), which is....odd. I have no words to describe it. This happens to be a great place to escape a rainstorm, which has occurred 2 out of the 3 times I've gone to Hoosier as well.There is one word of warning though - if you come in at the wrong time, expect there to be a line - because there is almost always a line during busy hour and you may be waiting some time for your food/drink/etc. All in all, everyone should come here once - and then pray you don't get addicted, because it seems quite easy to do so.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2014,8/15/2014,19,10,5,6,5>Quirky decor. Interesting food. Where else do you get lamb sausage quesadillas with garbanzo beans with rice and lentils for breakfast?
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,8/14/2014,32,212,1,7,3>I tried the beginner bikram yoga class, which was 90 minutes of atypical yoga in a room that's set to 105 F and 40% humidity. Why "atypical?" You won't find sun salutations and vinyasas ("typical" yoga) in bikram, rather you'll spend about half your time doing difficult standing poses (e.g. dancer's pose) and half your time doing sitting poses (e.g. camel).Although I've done yoga for a while and am a fit and active person, I found that class to be extremely draining, perhaps one of the most difficult exercises I've attempted. A number of other first-timers only managed a handful of poses before resorting to merely sitting on their mat. The instructor assured them that for many people the first class is spent simply sitting in the heated room for the full length of class.Speaking of the instructor, Holly was wonderful. She gave clear instructions, encouraged participants by name (even though she had only met many of us briefly), gently corrected mistakes, and explained the purpose and benefits of various poses. In general I appreciated that she didn't indulge in idle chatter; the periods of silence were complete and purposeful.After class, some of the regular members approached me to chat. They were all friendly, supportive, strong believers in the benefits of bikram, and clearly dedicated  to this studio. I think these people reflect very well on this business. Additionally, the studio was modern, neat, and clean, and there's a private lot for easy parking.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2014,8/13/2014,8,16,5,3,3>Alchemy Coffee House are very serious about their coffee - or at least they appear to be ... because it takes a full 5 minutes of labor, pipes; steam; thermometers; widgets; stirring and sweat before my extra-shot 'for here' latte to be completed. I almost felt I should hold it high above my head and shout some Kenyan / Zulu Lion King thing before sipping the fine brew in awe and wonder! The place is not impressive to look at ... in fact ... pretty darn dumpy ... but that is its charm. It has a cheap wooden counter, an old second hand refrigerated (I think) display case for some dodgy (but expensive) pastries / scones and then the two pieces of magic that clearly help to explain the joint's name :: Alchemy Coffee House ...  In the back room is a wooden pallet containing a few random bags of raw coffee beans some half torn open and then ... the sexiest green coffee roasting monster machine you've ever set your fortunate green eyes on!! WowZa. But the potions we pay for are via the coffee brewing machine (I lack the correct knowledge to attribute its correct name) which is a wonder of stainless steel pipes, knobs and funnels; fussy, high maintenance and perhaps a bugger to clean ... this machine is majestic! I'd buy it diamond from Tiffany if I owned it! (Alas!)The kid behind the counter (literally a kid!) -- Merlin's Apprentice (?) -- knows what he's doing and 5 minutes of wand waving // a flurry of hands turning and twisting and shrugging (?) et voila ... The result is divine coffee! And sitting outside on a Sunday morning drinking and enjoying what the Catholic Church once called "The Devil's Drink" is hilarious because my poor wife and kids are suffering Sunday Mass at SFX just up the road. Ha. The Irony!
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/16/2014,8/12/2014,29,219,6,7,7>Tasty Mediterranean food and surprisingly great pizza. Very family friendly and good service. The waitstaff ( all family??) tried to please and accomodate.Meals come with soup and the chicken kabob was juicy and flavorful. Babagsnoush was fantastic and my kids loved the pizza.My only complaint is that my Sauvignon blanc was too warm, but I did what any other tired mom of toddlers does-- stuck an ice cube ( I know, I know) in it and drank up. Its a great place to take the kids and we will certainly be back soon.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,8/11/2014,5,52,5,7,3>Here is the lesson you learn when you shop at Jerry's: buy meat from a butcher, not at the supermarket. Need a 14-pound brisket? Yup, they have it and they will put it aside and wait for you to arrive before they close for the night.It is that simple. Fair prices, GREAT service and very high quality product. They also carry various sauces, soups, frozen items as well as farm eggs and plenty of time-tested advice. There are three top-notch butchers on the north shore and Jerry's is squarely among them.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,8/10/2014,90,224,2,10,5>I'm really rating my instructor, not the school as much since I haven't needed to interact with the school since starting lessons, but that's a plus too, so... Five stars!!!I contacted the school a while ago to learn more about their piano lessons for adults, and the owner responded quickly that they had opportunities and instructors available for about $30 for 30 minutes lessons. I went in for a test lesson to see where my skills were and if their recommended instructor was a match, and he was!Nate Raskin is my instructor and he is fantastic. He's young, but already has the patience and instinct to guide his student in exactly the right way. He is super talented, but doesn't have an ego about it, and he's extremely aware of strengths and weaknesses, and how to work with them right away.I seem to be the only adult student around during my lesson times right now, but I couldn't be happier with my choice to take piano here and would highly recommend the school. Their online sign up and payment process is a little clunky, but they're aware of it and are very easy to work with. Their pianos are fine and the lesson rooms are a-ok. Love it here and wouldn't go anywhere else!
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,8/9/2014,362,467,4,10,5>There are restaurants that pretend to care about their customers, and restaurants that really put an effort to reach out to them. Farmhouse definitely earns a spot in the latter. After my less than stellar experience with brunch, the manager reached out to me and invited me back to dinner. I went with a friend and I had a great experience. I ordered the Wisconsin ivory char and it was fantastic. The char itself had a wonderful flavor and the fish very juicy. I usually leave the skin, but it had such a rich flavor that I ended up eating that as well. My friend had the elk medallions, which he enjoyed. For dessert, we ordered the pecan walnut pie and the chocolate bread pudding. Both were great! The chocolate bread pudding was warm, rich and chocolatey without being overly sweet. Our server was courteous and friendly. Service was a bit slow at times but that gave us time to relax and enjoy our meal. Would definitely recommend this place for a date night, celebratory dinner, etc. Will be back!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/14/2014,8/8/2014,23,321,2,7,4>Well, we came here and I had done my research and was all set to order the coq au vin until the husband asked the waiter what he would recommend off the savory menu.  The waiter listed almost all he crepes except the coq au vin, so I switched.  I ordered the Cassoulet Toulousain, duck confit, house made garlic sausage, stewed flageolet beans, carrots, celery, bacon lardons.  This was warm savory and delicious.  Flavors were layered upon each other but as good as this was, the husband's Bourguignon, Beef chuck & shin braised in red burgund wine, pearl onions, carrots, mushroom caps, bacon lardons was even better!  This crave-able crepe will bring me back again and again!  It was rich in flavor, melt in your mouth and cooked to perfection!  For dessert we split the Marquis, Chocolate crepe, dark chocolate mousse, glazed mix berries, white chocolate sauce.  I went with this because hubby wanted to.  I would have rather had one of the fruit choices.  But given everything, if I had been in the mood for chocolate it would have been perfect!  The chocolate mousse filling was creamy and delicious.  Also, they didn't skimp on the filling.  Yummy!Service was great too!  Attentive but not overly so.  We also enjoyed the quaint atmosphere.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,8/7/2014,34,75,6,9,7>The lunch specials here cannot be beaten on their quality to price ratio. You get tea, soup, and a giant plate/bowl of food for under $10. Unlike most sit-down places on Noyes, this one is super quick, so you don't need to block off a whole hour for lunch if you don't want to. Also, unlike most sit-down places in general, it feels completely acceptable to come here by yourself. I have never had to wait to be seated at Mandarin House, even in the middle of the lunch rush and even when I've come with a large group of people. I can't really explain this because this place is really popular, but somehow they make it work (probably the super fast service). I always get the beef bibimbap with hot and sour soup, and I stand by that combination. You can upgrade to a hot bibimbap, which is the exact same thing but served in a hot ceramic pot instead of just a bowl, so your food stays warm the entire time, and your rice gets nice and crispy, if you're into that sort of thing. Is it worth the extra $3? That's kind of like asking if it's worth getting your burrito with guacamole at Chipotle: it's an intensely personal decision that after careful meditation, each of us must make for ourselves. Choose wisely.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2014,8/6/2014,51,66,3,9,3>We've loved having occasional dinner at Valley Lodge in Glenview. So we were really excited to hear that an outpost of Valley Lodge was opening in the briefly occupied Big Black Dog space in (much closer) Wilmette. The menu is very much the same as in Glenview: classic, traditional American fare--a nicer Supper Club kind of feel. Not quite as northwoodsy as L. Woods, but similar. We split pork chops (yum!), bbq ribs (tasty, midwest oven style) and a reuben. Portions are huge (think about splitting meals). The food was honest goodness. Great beer list with a bunch of regional craft (Greenbush IPA!) and stalwart nationally distributed stuff like Stone. Solid, reasonably priced wine list, too. How they reconfigured the space works. What once was a pretty awkward room, now has better flow. My only gripe is it is really, really loud. Like, can't have a conversation with people at your table loud. Seriously. Awesome addition to the burgeoning dining scene in downtown Wilmette. We'll be back.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,8/5/2014,22,16,1,3,2>Beauty and Balance is a total joy as a salon -- spirit / energy, cut, color, customer service. It doesn't get better. t followed Kelly from place to place for almost 10 years but had not been to Beauty and Balance for six years. I am back and I don't see myself leaving. Kelly is an awesome stylist, a great business owner, and a terrific person. She listens. She's creative. She's intuitive. She gave me the best haircut I've ever had and I am so grateful! I also watched her interacting with the people who work for her and she seemed like an exemplary boss. This place is about beauty -- inside and out -- which is extraordinary for a salon. Treat yourself to experiencing yourself as an extraordinarily beautiful human being.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2014,8/4/2014,49,11,3,3,3>Went for the first time a few days ago. It was great. Really cozy atmosphere. Affordable prices is what they advertise and it's true. Service was great. Our server was Sheila, and she was so attentive and personable.The food is exceptional. I had the small spinach salad, which was great. Bigger than I expected but the tangy dressing was delicious. The stuffed green peppers were awesome. I got one stuffed with meat and one stuffed with ricotta and mushrooms. The mushrooms were beyond delicious. My friend got the lasagna, which she liked. They do give you a lot of sauce with the entrees even without pasta. For dessert we had tiramisu. I'd recommend it. Between the two of us, dinner was $29.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/5/2014,8/3/2014,5,13,2,3,3>I have been looking for a while before I found a place that had good corned beef hash skillet, and guess what, this is the place and the corned beef hash skillet is AMAZING. My wife and I have been coming here for breakfast, and I don't think we ordered a single item that we didn't like. The service is friendly and good. If you are planning on coming on the weekend, try to be there before 9:30am, otherwise, i might end up waiting.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,8/2/2014,13,12,1,4,3>Coast is a welcome addition to Central Street!  We had a party of 5 for dinner on a rainy Saturday evening, no reservations, but we were seated right away since we arrived so early. We had multiple rolls, nigiri, edamame, and chicken teriyaki (for the 4 year old), and everything was wonderful. We especially liked the wasabi roll. The decor is very hip, the service is attentive, the employees are friendly, and we will certainly be back. If not to done in, for carry-out.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,8/1/2014,19,16,1,4,5>Simply the best. I can only vouch for the cookies and doughnuts, though. But the cookies are life changing. Turtles are a must must must try, linzers, sprinkles, dipped in chocolate with sprinkles, smilies, almond dipped in chocolate. Try some cookies! I've also had a doughnut. It was a cake doughnut with chocolate frosting. Pretty darn good. Give this place a try-- you won't be disappointed.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,7/31/2014,6,15,3,13,4>I almost did not want to write this... I don't want it to get overrun! From the few times I have been here I have been delighted with the quality of the meats, authenticity of the prepared products, preparations, and the owner. I took home a slice of the the Country Pate. It was replete, with boiled egg centered inside each slice and the flavor was sublime... how you want a pate to taste... simple yet complex. And there was the Merguez Lamb Sausage with it's hints of spice (cumin, paprika?, garlic, etc)... all the flavors were spot-on and in balance.I picked up some Bacon as well. They offered a rosemary and a smoked, I got both. They are simply some of the best bacon I have ever had. Yes, its bacon and any bacon is good... No, this is the real thing and is leagues better than anything else I have had. They also have a Guanciale that I will be going back to try... The owner is really nice and seems to be dedicated to delivering small scale, locally sourced (from farm to shop), and honest ingredients. He spoke of knowing the farmers and how they raise the animals... What more can you ask from a butcher/deli? Too much to say about their philosophy and all that, you can check out their Facebook page for more details and you can Google about their former "E & P Meats" history. Okay... you get the point, awesome place!
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,7/30/2014,3,21,,3,2>I've never eaten in the restaurant, and from some other reviews, I guess that's a good thing? I'll judge for myself at some point :) Anyway onto my experience from their delivery.We have ordered from here MANY a time off GrubHub. The food has always been absolutely delicious! I love their crab rangoon and chicken egg rolls. The crab rangoon is always crispy on the outside, not too greasy and perfect mix of cream cheese/crab/scallions. The egg rolls also always perfectly crispy! The fillings is seasoned well, I love to dip it in a mixture of the duck sauce and spicy mustard. The pork pot stickers are pretty good too (a bit big and doughy), I just wish they gave more sauce with it. I have to say I am completely in love with the wonton soup! It's always perfectly seasoned, the right amount of veggies, and the wontons are just perfection. My only complaint is that they need to offer a larger size! I'm completely serious too...offer it in a quart size!!We LOVE the sesame chicken in this household! Definitely the tastiest I've found in Evanston! General Tao's is also incredible and spicy and delicious. I highly recommend the chili stir fried spinach. One of my absolute favorite things to get!
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,7/29/2014,6,20,,3,2>Excellent customer service--you don't find that very often these days. Bob and his staff are wonderful to work with. They make the process very simple and stress-free. Their work itself is outstanding, and is done in such a timely manner. Prices are beyond reasonable. We needed 20 plaques done, approached them at the (very) last minute, and they managed to get them done on time. We were grateful for their efforts, and certainly intend to work with them again in the future.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2014,7/28/2014,13,31,1,3,2>Great place for kids!  I have a 6 and 4 year old and they really enjoy the lessons!  The master is really patient and uncompromising on form and skill.  The kids really like him and comfortable with his teaching.  They have a great one month special to try it out !  They are not pushy at all and really want to see if your kids like it or not .  Wonderful find in the north shore for tae Kwon do!
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2014,7/27/2014,0,33,1,4,2>I have gone by this restaurant for over 30 years and finally tried it for lunch.   I was very pleased with the food and the service.   Our waitress, Caroline, explained everything on the menu and made suggestions.   I had the cheeseburger which was excellent.   My friend had a chopped salad with shrimp.  The carrot cake for desert was great.  The manager, Chris came over to see how everything was.  Highly reccommended, wil be back.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,7/26/2014,12,57,4,2,2>Great service and precision cuts.   The men are all very friendly and welcoming.   The first time I came here it was a little intimidating to walk in and then I was immediately put at ease by how friendly and welcoming everybody was.   Don't leave without saying goodbye and shaking everybody's hand.  You're part of the family.  TV and a fish tank if you like.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2014,7/25/2014,13,103,3,4,2>I confess - I'm really not a regular coffee drinker.  I have maybe a dozen or so coffee drinks a year.  It's really just not my drink...  Newport Coffee House makes such a good Americano, however, that I can't help but sit up and take notice.  Not too strong, not too bitter, not too sour, not too... well, not too anything.  Just an exceptionally-pleasant even-bodied drink that even I can smile about.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,7/24/2014,137,206,3,7,7>I've been here twice for brunch and want to make it out a third time to try dinner. I'm not too familiar with the area, but PP definitely gives off a nice vibe and a fresh breathe of air compared to most of the places nearby. Everything on the brunch menu sounds unique and delicious, but for now I can only vouch for the two items i've tried. The first time I came here happened to be during Passover, so my options were limited. I ended up getting the Potato Cakes - poached egg, smoked salmon, and dill cream. It sounds just like it tasted - healthy and scrumptious! I highly recommend this option...I also had the House Made Flatbread - bacon, egg, goat cheese, onion and sage. It's a great choice for brunch.. I would definitely get it again. My fiancé likes more simple things in life and he got the Fish & Chips both times. The coffee here is perfect - just what a nice cup of joe should taste like. The service was excellent both times and the ambiance of this restaurant is great too. It's very open, light, has a rustic feel to it, and much bigger than it looks from the outside. My only complaint is that they sit everyone very close to each other in one area of the restaurant where as the other half is open and free of people. We walked in and were seated immediately both times for brunch, but I hear it gets busier during dinner hours. Overall, Peckish Pig has everything a restaurant needs to have - great food, service, and vibe!
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2014,7/23/2014,4,25,1,3,2>These guys! My insurance called them when I needed emergency roadside and I'm sooo glad they did. First, they were there within 20 min on a Saturday evening. Second, they knew what was wrong as soon as they came out (axle) and gave me a rough estimate. They looked at it first thing in the morning and had it ready by 1 the same day, including additional things I asked for and needed (oil change, fan belt). The pricing was very reasonable and most importantly they don't charge to evaluate problems like most places in Evanston. Oh, and bonus: they are really friendly. This is definitely my new auto repair shop!
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2014,7/22/2014,17,84,1,3,2>This place is full with authentic people and food, so it's good for a reason. The service is stellar, the food out of this world, and the price reasonable. If you like Nepalese or northern Indian, don't wait! And don't let the fact that this nice sit down joint is in a strip mall next to the DMV fool you. I'll definitely be back. Heck, I make trips from Evanston just to eat here regularly because it's so good. They also do super-spicy if you ask for extra extra hot, so get ready! Yay!The vindaloo, sopas, garlic naan, and every other dish I've had here is great. (I've had at least 6 or 7 different dishes, and almost always get at least one vindaloo.)

Order was exactly as described and out of all the places in Lake Bluff, this would be on top of the list compared to how other places make their burgers greasy. Would definitely recommend if you're craving an all american meal!
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,7/20/2014,64,24,,3,1>This place decidedly takes you back to another time; and is not like these cookie-cutter ice cream/froyo shops that are on every corner.The ice cream is delicious and homemade, and the employees are friendly. It's a nice twist that they offer traditional Mexican snacks as well.If you're in the area, and you're thinking about going to the local 31 Flavors, check this place out!Highly recommended!
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2014,7/19/2014,15,54,,13,9>I slipped on some ice back in February and when I tried to see my GP I found he'd cut his hours drastically.  Either I had to miss work or find someone else.On a whim, I came to this office because it's close to my home.  Boy did I get lucky.. Dr. Fertlemeister (who works Thursdays) is really good and really kind.  They also take my insurance, so visits there never cost me over $20.I actually wound up going back to Dr. Fertlemesiter several times until I started physical therapy.My husband has also come to this location (which is how I knew about it) when he had a sinus infection.  It was quick, efficient, and we got the help we needed.  I'm actually really shocked at the negative reviews here.
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2014,7/18/2014,291,119,4,6,4>WOW!! The wings here are truly delicious!! I met a few people at a party who told me that they would drive from downtown Chicago to Evanston, just for an order of Buffalo Joe's wings, and now I can see why. These wings are so simple and made to perfection!! They are the right amount of crispiness and the sauce is ON POINT! Plus, the portion size and price is not bad either. One order of wings is around $8 and you get like 10 wings!! DEAL! Tip: Get the normal waffle fries and not the one loaded with stuff - the WILL get soggy because it's drenched in canned nacho cheese sauce and and buffalo wing sauce. ALSO, if you want to place an order for a Super Bowl party... do that like 3 days in advance, this place gets so many orders that you won't get it if you order the night before!! - They are just THAT good.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2014,7/17/2014,108,103,6,16,8>BEST NO-CHIP PRICE EVER:This might be my new go-to place to get a no-chip manicure!  For $17 it is the BEST deal hands down.  I've read some of the other reviews that went across the board... but you won't find a better deal for a quality no-chip for hundreds of miles.  What's also great is that you don't need to actually purchase the groupon.I came here for the first time and asked about the original "regular price"... but there wasn't one!  $17 is the set price for their customers... it's not a deal to attract new customers to then raise the price later.  So that's why this place deserves some lovin'!DETAILS IN PRICING:$17 for a regular no-chip manicure$5 for removal$5 for a French no-chip--No coupon needed for any of these prices--There was a minimum charge (I believe $15?) for credit card use.--They prefer cash only for tips.THE NAME/SIGNAGE:There was a Groupon under the establishment "Toni G" Salon and Spa.  I asked my nail technician why their Groupon was under a different name and she said that they are in the process of changing the name from "New Nail & Hair Obsession Day Spa" to a "Toni G" Salon & Spa... which is definitely an easier name to remember.  But it is too cold outside currently to install the new sign, named after the owner, but they'll change it when the weather gets warmer.EASY PARKING:Being my first time here, at first the location was hard to find (because there wasn't a clear sign on the outside)  but it is right next to a frozen yogurt place called Cocomero and across from Annie's Pancake House.  There was plenty of free street parking on the side streets off Oakton Ave.THE 4-Star EXPERIENCE:I've had a no-chip manicure only once before, but this place is also quality.  It was no-fuss, they have a decent color selection: maybe 50 or so to choose from.  Conversation was decent, pleasant but limited... and I'm not the person who normally chit chats throughout the whole process so for me, it was fine.  My nails were filed nicely and the tech was precise.  My friend got the French and was VERY happy with the results.  We joked around afterwards that she had the nails of a bride... And with such fabulous nails, where was the party?  When was the wedding?  Haha. In all, they did a fabulous job.I called in earlier in the day to make an appointment, and it was hassle-free, straight forward and I was told of all the pricing in advance.Depending on your preferences, if you like your nail tech to focus SOLELY on you during the whole experience... this might not be your favorite spot because for a majority of the time, the nail techs were chatting amongst themselves in Assyrian.  They also used paper towels instead of hand cloths and there was less friendly chatter with the client.  Then again, I didn't mind but I'm just pointing out differences between nail salons.SUMMARY:A great place to get a no-hassle, quick and quality no-chip manicure!  I've never had a regular nail routine, but at these prices, it's hard to resist.  The French manicure was beautifuly done ($22 total) and my regular mani ($17) was flawless.  No complaints, I would come here again and bring a friend along... since I feel like I'm getting a two-for-one deal :)Also there are 20% off coupons by the cashier for Cocomero next door... to grab dessert after being pampered.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2014,7/16/2014,9,183,2,4,2>I've been to Tapas Barcelona a number of times now and while I can't bring myself to give it 5 stars for some reason, it deserves more than 4. Really wish I could give it the 4.5 stars it deserves.The food is always delicious. I honestly don't think I've had a bad dish at Tapas Barcelona. Some of my favoritesDates & Bacon - very good, not really any better or worse or different from anywhere else, but that's fine by me.Goat cheese & Tomato sauce - wonderful. absolutely wonderful, a fairly common dish but one executed very well.Pincho de pollo - excellently cooked chicken with a deliciously unique cumin mayo. Great way to counter some of the heavier/tomatoey dishes.Rigatoni con salchicha - Almost always get this one and it's a great value - surprisingly large portion for a tapas dish.Tuna cannoli - interesting take on a cannoli, somewhat subdued but intricate flavorsPuffed Pastry with lamb - fairly small but a lot of interesting flavorsOctopus - one of the few I probably wouldn't get again. octopus is good but not much flavor and rather oily.I always really like the Spanish margarita they have there - brandy, orange liqueor, and lemon. Haven't seen this many other places but I quite like it.Service can be great or quite terrible, there's simply no middle ground. The most recent time it was superb, the waiter knew details about everything on the menu and food came out quickly exactly as we requested it. Other times, I've had to wait and wait only to then ask again for the same dish and have the waiter realize he didn't put the order in or the kitchen lost it. Really hit or miss service.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,7/15/2014,1,31,,3,2>We love Koya.  It started as a very small restaurant with about enough seating for 20 people.  It's since been discovered and they've expanded in to the adjacent staff but it is still an intimate restaurant.  The sushi selections are fantastic - we love the Hawaiian, Philadelphia and spicy rolls but there are a lot of creative ones from which to choose.  There are also options for non-sushi items such as teriyaki, sukiyaki, bento box and the like.  Prices are higher than when it was new but the quality is really top rate.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,7/14/2014,1,15,,3,2>My mother and I had a very dinner at Jerry's this evening. We started off with the beet salad.  Just like one of the previous reviewers said, this was literally all beets which made me very happy!! I highly recommend.For our main course, we both had the fried chicken. It was perfectly crisp and juicy. I get full very easily so I was able to save one of my pieces for later as well as the corn pudding. My mom also substituted mashed potatoes for the corn, which they were happy to do.  The Roquefort sauce was DELICIOUS!!!!Overall, the service was very pleasant, workers were helpful and the atmosphere was lovely. The prices were a little on the high side, but what do you expect? The restaurant is in Winnetka.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/5/2014,7/13/2014,32,156,3,6,4>Y'all know I love a hotdog, and Herm's is TOPS. I am so excited to add it to our regular hotdog dinner rotation. Just a few standouts: MILKSHAKES. the smalls are enormous. Split yours with a child, perhaps. HOTDOGS. they are cut spiral? and kinda crunchy? and fat but not overwhelming, with perfectly steamed buns. nice sized pickle. FRIES. well, fries are just normal, but you can get them with merkts cheddar, which takes them to amazing. SALADS. yes I had a salad at a hotdog stand bc I am a sucker for a good greek salad, and this one did not disappoint. If you love giant chunks of feta and tons of kalamata olives, this is the salad for you. ICE CREAM CASE. there are frozen bananas. and choco tacos. and king cones. A king cone and a hot dog, plus a (pepsi, ugh, but they do have dr. pepper) drink from the fountain or a coke (yay!) or cel-ray (i love any shop that sells cel-ray) from the cold drink case and I'm a happy place.The decor is standard hotdog shop, but with plenty of tables and an awesome mural. Plus, there are a few arcade games if you are a slow eater and need something to entertain your 7 year old so you can finish your salad in peace. And the staff is probably the friendliest ever.Herm's, I'm so glad to know you, and I'm excited to have a long relationship together.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,7/12/2014,132,200,1,6,4>I stopped here for the first time just a few days ago. I've been meaning to, since I live literally right down the street from it, but I rarely have the time to stop and browse - and this store was made for browsing. I picked up three books for about $8, and the owner was incredible. He let me browse at my own pace (very, very slow) and, after asking me if I needed help, just left me alone. I realized I forgot my wallet at home when I went up to the checkout, and when I asked him if I could hold the books there for a few minutes, he actually offered to just let me take them and come back later to pay! I didn't take him up on it, but it was pretty incredible that he offered. Definitely coming back here once I'm done with my books!
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,7/11/2014,0,13,,8,3>Tang Nail & Spa - what a wonderful place! After looking at Yelp, I gathered that this place is reasonably priced and that they do a good job. With this I expected a somewhat dated and under maintained salon and I was prepared to be okay with that. If the service is good, the appearance of the place is not all that important to me.Fast forward to my No-Chip Mani and Pedicure yesterday, I was blown away! A nice, clean salon which has been open for about a year. I had made an appt for 4:30 but was running late after work. My nail technician, Helen, patiently waited and was so so so sweet! THANK YOU Helen for giving me a wonderful Mani Pedi!I'm not the type of person who gets their nails done regularly, but this place might change my mind. Great job to the ladies at Tang Nail & Spa.
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,7/10/2014,0,11,2,4,3>I stopped in here while on a walk and got the Whole Wheat Seeded loaf.  I thought I'd be smart and ask them to slice off a few slices to eat before they wrapped it up nicely in paper and string so that I could munch on my way home.  Yeah...that bread didn't stay wrapped long as I quickly tore into the loaf for more and couldn't stop.  The bread was so perfectly delicious!  The outer crust was nice and crusty while the inside was delectably chewy and light with just a scattering of seeds to keep it interesting.  $7 is a little pricey for my everyday bread but it certainly was a nice treat and I can't stop thinking about it and wanting more. The bread kept nicely on my counter for the following day. The space itself is done especially well with the salvaged wood and fixtures.  I wish they had a little more space for some tables to sit and enjoy but hopefully they will be able to expand in the future.  The sandwiches looked delicious but would love if they did them made-to order where you could choose your bread and filler.  Pastries were also beautiful.  I can't wait to try more!  I think I'm in love.  Keep up the good work, Hewn, I look forward to watching this business grow!
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/14/2014,7/9/2014,1,29,1,5,2>We just took our daughter here on a bit of a gloomy day, and she had a blast!  If you asked her, the favorites were the water room, face painting, and the outdoor park.As her dad, for an occasional trip, the $11/person pricetag isn't too bad, but I certainly wouldn't want to pay that too often.  They have a membership option available if you plan on going a lot, which is nice.  The lady that sold us our entries also mentioned that if we decided to go with a membership that day, they would apply our admissions to the cost.I liked the wide variety of experiences available for the kids here.  From exhibits geared for role-playing, science, exploration, creativity and art...there is likely something for every kid to enjoy.  We even got in just in time to see one of the chicks hatching, which my daughter thought was pretty cool.This is a great, nearby museum option for some fun times with the kids.  I would recommend it highly!
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,7/8/2014,12,11,4,6,4>One of the best reasons to go into Evanston! I grew up going to Dave's but I never really appreciated it until later in life. I am more of a frequent customer nowadays. They have a wonderful and extremely helpful staff who answer all my questions and give me more information than I ever knew I wanted :)In general, they have an awesome collection of stones, fossils, and jewelry. I have been extremely happy with each and every one of my purchases. The museum downstairs is great. I always hear kids coming up the stairs going "That was awesome! Did you see how big that one was?!" The fossils down there are pretty sweet.I recommend you check this place out. It's great for browsing and exploring, but even better for finding amazing stones to take home. Great for children of all ages.. 50 is the new 11.. right? Go there tomorrow. I promise you will love it!!

It actually felt warn and nice. I bought another package to do another area because I was so happy. I can't say enough great things about this salon, so friendly and easy to deal with. Pricing is very fair and set so that a customer wants to return. Don't miss this place!!!!
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,7/6/2014,14,6,7,11,6>Ropa Vieja with Cuban Rice, and Sweet Plantains: the perfect plate (even the waitress said so after I put in my order). Don't forget the Cafe Con Leche as a post-meal pick-me-up! I grew up in Miami and this place is the closest match I've found to Miami Cuban food in Chicago and the suburbs.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,7/5/2014,150,103,4,14,4>This is officially my first non-restaurant review, but it had to be written!  This past Saturday, I had my hair and makeup done because I was emceeing a Northwestern event that night. Although pricey ($150 originally - $135 after the student discount), everything was done perfectly. If you come, expect to pay a lot, but also expect to be super pleased with the results!I called for a hair appointment around 1pm the day of, and they were able to schedule me in at 3:30. I believe my hairstylist was named Nicole. I showed her a picture of my dress (a one-shouldered black gown) and told her that I wanted some sort of hairstyle with my hair gathered on one side. She took into consideration all my requests and created a beautiful curled, low, side ponytail. With lots of hairspray and bobby pins, it was able to stay in place from 4pm to 5am. I was actually planning to do my own makeup, but after seeing how great my hair turned out, I asked if their makeup artist (Elizabeth) was available -- fortunately, she was! It was $60 (including fake lashes) and took about 45 minutes. The lashes she used were separated, with 5-6 on each eye, instead of the long strip that I usually use (I'm not sure if I'm just really inexperienced with makeup, but I found them really cool). Also, she asked to see what kind of jewelry I would be wearing, and purposely made my eye makeup lighter to bring attention to my necklace and dress. The only tiny thing I could possibly complain about is that she made my skin tone extremely light in comparison to my normal skin tone; although it looked amazing in person, my face looked scarily pale in flash photos.Overall, HAIR- 5 STARS and MAKEUP- 4.5 STARS. I'm just going to round up to 5 stars because they were super professional and courteous (offered me tea), had a student discount, and really made sure the hair/makeup fit with my dress/jewelry. I'd definitely come back again if I needed to be prettied up for a fancy event!
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/12/2014,7/4/2014,88,51,5,6,5>This is my staple food as a student at Northwestern. It is one of the closest restaurant to campus. Perfect for a quick lunch in between classes. The food. My favorite dish to get is the Seafood Soondubu. It's a hot spicy stew with tofu and seafood. I was surprised at the amount of seafood in the dish, definitely more than I expected.The Kimchi Albab is a great dish to treat yourself! It's vegetables, beef, rice, kimchi top with salmon roe. It's served in a stone bowl so the rice keeps cooking and gets crispy.The service is inconsistent. They are fast at getting food out, but they often don't remember to refill your water. It's a clean nice restaurant. Perfect for Northwestern students. But there are other great Korean places in the Chicago area.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2014,7/3/2014,68,150,2,8,7>LYFE Kitchen has great options for those who like healthy food! They even have separate menus for non-vegetarians, vegetarians and vegans. I tried their fish tacos and was really happy with how fresh everything tasted. The portion size was also very reasonable - they're careful not to give you too much or too little food. I also tried their ginger mint chia water and liked it a lot, but if you're not a fan of ginger I wouldn't recommend it. Overall, really delicious food in a well-lit restaurant and you leave feeling extra healthy!

<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,7/1/2014,0,11,6,9,7>THE BEST SUB I'VE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, AND I'M 45 YEARS OLD. I've been eating sandwiches for decades now, and I've never had such a great experience at a sub shop. I was recently talking about good sandwiches in the suburbs with a woman. She told me that she and her husband love to eat at Nemo's in Winnetka. Always open to trying new sandwich places I stopped in at lunchtime and WOW, I was really surprised and overjoyed to eat Nemo's turkey club. Great flavor. Great bite and texture. Great everything about it! This is a sub I'd be proud to give Chef Robert Irvine if we had lunch! I can't tell you how rare it is that I eat something that truly blows me away. Usually the world is full to bursting with horrible chains run by people who must hate food, because they serve such incredibly nasty garbage to the world. I have a saying, if you don't respect yourself, how can you respect your customers. NEMO'S is run by people who have respect and love for what they do, and it shows very beautifully in the quality of their sandwiches. I feel I've won the sandwich lottery discovering this place!What a terrific sub! And the man at the register, he must be the owner, is one the coolest, friendliest dudes I've ever met. THIS is the way you run a sandwich shop! GREAT service. GREAT food. GREAT experience. I'd give 'em more stars if I could lol! Blessings,L.O.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,6/30/2014,14,122,3,8,6>The highly trained staff at Sweet Peas reflects an intensive marketing/training effort by the management.  Bravo Sweet Peas!We were finishing a wonderful Mother's day dinner in Lake Forest and we realized what better than to top off the night with an ice cream.  At 8:59 p.m. or maybe 9:01 p.m. or 9:05 p.m., daughter called Sweet Peas to find out if they were open.  They were about to turn the lights out, but would wait the 10 minutes it would take us to get there.We walked in to the shop and there stood the very nice girl who smiled and acknowledged our call, working solo at the night's end, no doubt looking forward to the end of the work day.  We placed our order--Waffle cone, two scoops, Zanzibar and vanilla; cup of chocolate peanut butter. We thanked this very friendly girl and she made sure that we knew she was very happy to have been able to serve us.Daughter, an ice cream connoisseur, confirmed that as usual the chocolate peanut butter was par excellence.  And I thoroughly enjoyed the vanilla scoop, then rich dark chocolate scoop.Sweet Peas (for me) alludes to Popeye among other things.  There's an old TV playing old B&W shows.  Nice back-in-the-day touch with the great ice cream.That Harvard School of Business strategy of hiring young enthusiastic pleasant servers is brilliant!  Great ice cream served by great smiling servers.  Nice going Mr. Sweet Pea!

They encourage walk-ins and I like being able to go in on a whim. Some women like to go to the same person. I don't care because they all do a nice job. It is peaceful, clean, and up to date with all the newest colors. The after service bonus is a short back rub and there is a reward program that adds up to a free manicure. All in all a pleasant experience.

It was an upscale bowling alley with bocce (have no idea how you play Lol), and a nice bar area. I ordered a Goose Island Matilda and the chicken club sandwich. It was very good. Very friendly staff as well. It was a great experience and will go there again. $7 a game (usually $5 but we went after 6) and $4 for shoes, not bad for such a nice place.     Excellent place for a birthday party. Keep that in mind!

More recently, in looking at lightweight jackets, the sales team member was also very knowledgeable without being pushy, which I appreciated.  Be sure to check around the store for the sale section; I've been tempted by discounted jackets and layers and usually they have most sizes available in each sale style, which is great.

My favorite menu items are the taramosalata, skordalia, saganaki, dolmades, and the chicken kabobs. My husband always gets a lamb dish and has LOVED every single one! Oh, their bread is sooo yummy as well! I eat so much of it, I end up getting full! Doh! I love that there is free valet, we are always greeted with a warm welcome, and the servers are attentive, but not overly attentive. If you go during the warmer months, definitely sit out on the patio...it is lovely...I feel like I'm on vacation! :)

Breakfast croissant, served open-faced, has all the great tastes you'd look for in your breakfast. My current Fav is the Bocado: bacon, avocado and Monterey Jack cheese. Fabulous! Of course, it goes without saying that the above items were splendidly complemented by Kevin's Potatoes (they come into the place as actual whole potatoes and get transformed by culinary artistry into a little bit of Heaven)Be sure to bring kids or - if you haven't any - enjoy the many you will see enjoying Kevin's cooks cooking!

It was definitely more than enough food, and we were stuffed by the end. I wish the server had gone through and pointed out which part of the dish was which; we ended up figuring out what the different meats were, but it was harder to tell with the veggies and now I don't know what to order when I come back.We went in on a Tuesday evening and got our food in 10 minutes; granted, the restaurant was pretty empty.Next time, definitely trying the Ethiopian coffee and desserts!
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2014,6/20/2014,78,77,1,6,4>Phenomenal meal (I ordered the ahi tuna and my date, the cedar plank salmon) in a beautiful restaurant with an upscale atmosphere.From the free bread with specialty butter, to the fresh salads with flavorful dressing, and then to the main course. Jolanes nailed it. Ahi tuna was a great cut, clearly fresh, perfectly seared. Salmon was the perfect texture with a garlic seasoning rub that perfectly accompanied the cedar flavor. Neither over cooked and both delicately plated.Our waiter, Phil, was friendly, accommodating and enhanced the overall experience with timely and personable service. While I didn't dabble in dessert- they have quite the decadent selection staring at you when you walk in. Each pastry was literally calling out to me, begging me to indulge.Love it here. Highly recommend trying.
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2014,6/19/2014,58,347,1,6,4>Updating to say that I've really come to enjoy this path for a nice relaxed spring/fall ride.Scenery gets much better past Glencoe but the roads are also more rough, so I don't know how well road tires would fare on those trails, but it's really gorgeous! There are also some nice segments from Kenilworth-Glencoe (a park, some nice patches for grass for picnic, etc). Yes, the lack of lighting still sucks, and having to get past the Wilmette portion for a peaceful trail is still pretty annoying (though after about the 3rd time I finally remembered where to go at some confusing points), but I think the narrowness isn't an issue given the relatively low volume of (much more friendly) riders and runners.As much as I disliked the qualities of this path when I first rode on it, after so many trips it's really grown on me, I guess. Plus, they just repaved may portions of the trail in the fall. There are still a lot of bumps for some reason, but it's certainly quite a bit smoother.Can't wait for all the snow to melt!

The walls are painted in a nice color, there are pillows (and candy!), and a plethora of magazines and comfy couches. The waiting area has coffee and there are fresh flowers everywhere! Helen, the new owner, chatted about how she recently had a grand opening with "grand opening prices" (12.00 for a mani, 36 for mani/pedi, 30 for no-chip) and I had to try it!. Helen is funny and caring- in that Asian-mom sort of way! I loved how welcomed I felt. The manicure itself was a really relaxing experience! For 12.00, my hands were wrapped in hot towels, my cuticles were carefully trimmed, my nails were meticulously painted and I even received a back massage! That is an amazing deal!The manicurist, Judy (pick her!) has been working with Helen for half a decade and is super friendly. She's a mom so she instantly makes you feel comfortable and she's also a very hard worker! Judy is personable and genuine- she is careful with her tools and always made sure to ask if the towels were too hot! We actually even spoke a few words to each other in Spanish!Go to Crystal Nails if you want a relaxing experience where people take their time, are hospitable and welcoming! PS: prom and graduation special! 30.00 mani & pedi with student ID!

Same with the two dining room areas, as it's easy to view a sporting event from every seat in the house. I had a burger that was decent for bar food, nothing to write home about. But I did like that you can order tots or sweet potato fries instead of regular FF. I'd like to try the pizza and some other items on the menu before I can completely comment on the food.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2014,6/16/2014,88,154,3,9,5>This is a cute little burger shop. We came on a Saturday evening, around 5pm, and were greeted promptly by Annick, our friendly server. She explained everything to us and was very helpful. We decided to go with a black cherry cheerwine soda (3) the #1 Burger (9) and the Satchmo (12). Since we had a Northwestern wildcard, we got tater tots for free with our entrees. This is the current promotion, but our server did tell us that it might change in the future. The tater tots were very good, and their ketchup is special too. I really enjoyed the #1 Burger and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes bacon. The Satchmo I didn't like quite as much. It's basically a shrimp and crawfish sandwich, which I would have really liked, but I didn't know that it came with scallions all over it, which I'm not a fan of. There were too many to pick out so I just enjoyed the burger instead.Side note: the bathroom is really cute since it has chalkboard walls, and they have chalk that you can use to write on it. It's also very clean. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, but I don't think it's very good for groups. You will probably end up sitting next to people you don't know, especially if it's busy. We sat at the counter by the window and enjoyed people watching while we ate. They also have handy coat hooks under the counters. Come with a friend or two, and enjoy a delicious burger!
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2014,6/15/2014,163,595,4,6,6>This is one of the best kept secrets in Evanston.  Its probably because its not in the 'downtown' portion nor near any trendy shops.  But once you go inside this place you willl be pleasantly surprised.  It is clean, nicely decorated, and a nice parking lot to boot.So the wife and I went here on a Friday night because they have live music on Thursday-Saturday after 7pm.  We are immediately seated and I start looking over the menu.  The menu is 90% different itterations of fried chicken (different pieces) or fried fish with waffles or other sides.  There are also salads and other stuff, but we're here for some home cooking.We get a half a fried chicken, two pecan waffles, some fried catfish, collard greens, cheesy grits, a sweet potato pie, and a few beers.  The bartender, while she said she doesn't know much about beer, she was learning and knew more than she realizes.  The beer selection was great.  I had a fatty boom batty and the wife had a bourbon smoked cider.Off the the food, it was a lot of food, but it did not last.  I will definately be back to enjoy this place.
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,6/14/2014,14,104,4,5,4>There is almost always a line, but it is well-worth the wait. The owners and servers are a little quirky, and the decor includes some arts and crafts chandeliers giving the restaurant a definite hipster vibe. That being said, the food is outstanding-- these hipsters can cook! Definitely try the cheese flakey and cinnamon glazed bacon. Everything else is fair game, as well. Their lunch and dinner menus are great, but I would definitely make my first visit a breakfast or brunch.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,6/13/2014,4,9,1,5,3>This is a new nail salon that opened up in the area. My sister and I came here for manicure-pedicure treatments and loved it! The place is clean and modern and the quality is good. The pedicure was standard with some nice touches like a leg scrub and massage. The pedicure massage chairs are also nice and comfy. The manicure was also good and my specialist was very detailed with the quality. Afterwards the girls have us nice shoulder runs which completed the experience. Will definitely be coming back!
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2014,6/12/2014,40,126,1,5,3>I didn't purchase my Lexus at this dealership but made an appointment to have an oil change here because it's close to where I live. I called the day before and setting up an appointment couldn't have been any easier. I believe that you can also go online to set up an appointment if you prefer.My appointment was at 6:40 pm and if pulled into the service area..they quickly jotted down the mileage, confirmed that I came in for an oil change, and said it would be about an hour since he had two technicians in the evening hours. No problems, very easy. There were hardly any people and it was a very relaxing atmosphere.The lounge area is really comfortable, you can opt to sit in some comfy chairs in front of a tv, sit at a circular table, or a cubicle. They had cold refreshments that you could help yourself to (water, coke, sprite) and you can even borrow an IPad to play on while you wait. Win-win!Definitely would come back to have service done to my car.

We scheduled a time and guess who was on-time and guess who was late!!!!  Sorry Brad.   Well luckily the wife/kids got home to let Brad's employee into the garage.We were promptly given the cost.  VERY reasonable.  The tech (Eric) did a great job.   Cleaned up everything.   Greased / oiled everything and adjusted the door perfectly.   I also saw Eric test all the various safety features.  Very professional.   I highly recommend this company.  I am very satisfied.   Door fixed less then 24 hours after it broke.

After doing so I found this shop a few blocks down and decided to stop in.I was greeted with, "Look! It's Ms. Saigon!" by one of the ladies working behind the counter. Being Vietnamese, I took this as a warm welcome.If you are looking for clothes or furniture, this may not be the place for you. I was on the hunt for little knick-knacks to add to my home decor.I found a vintage style jewelry box, a mini vase and two other milk glass pieces (oh how I adore anything milk glass) all totaling under $5. On a plus side: they take credit card if your purchase total exceeds $10.On my way out another worker said I got some great finds and told me I should keep my diamonds in my new jewelry box :)I will post a picture of all my new treasures.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2014,6/9/2014,22,299,1,6,3>We were being invaded by little black ants this spring, I tried my usual harry homeowner counter actions but did not seem to be making a dent. I also was not able to determine any obvious access points. I looked on Yelp and these guys were highly rated and local. Plus there was a Yelp deal for $40 bucks off. I called in the evening when I got home from work and a person actually answered the phone, said they would send someone out next morning between 9 and 11. Guy shows up at 9:30, i like them already. Tim, who it turns out is the owners son, is not only a professional, but friendly and easy going as well, you could tell by talking to him that he knew his bugs. They are not cheap but neither is your daughter's happiness ;) They address all kinds of nuisances up to small rodents and offer a quarterly contract to stay on top of it that is optional. The stuff they use is biodegradable within 90 days and is safe for kids/pets/plants. It does not kill on contact but rather infects and ultimately destroys colonies.Hopefully I will be ant free sooner than later but if I have any problem, their work is guaranteed. If you have a bug problem, use these guys, they are truly family owned and local.Happy earth day indeed ;)

It was an interest in passing as a new sport to get into, and I managed to remove a lot of skin off my knees and feet, unfortunately. They do have a great environment for BJJ if that is something of interest. The trainers were very professional and it was a very open environment. The studio itself is rather small, but works.I will be back....once the skin heals :)
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2014,6/6/2014,16,109,3,6,3>I love coming to this place for my watch services! They're great at figuring out what's wrong and providing me with honest and reasonable prices and times to fix it. change in batteries is a straight up $10 and they can change it in 10 minutes - exactly what I want and need. I've also brought some jewelry in to fix before and they've been great at giving me prices for it. i had a costume jewelry fixed before and they did a very nice job. I've also brought in finer jewelry, a gold 18k ring that has a super thin band that I broke. They helped me patch it up though the material they used to patch it up wasn't the same quality as the original material - understandable though. I also broke this same ring again later in the year and ended up taking it to Cottage Jewelry who actually did an even better job so if you have something very delicate and fine, I would suggest you taking it there instead. They're a little bit more upscale and fit better with the gold ring I needed fixed. Everything else though, I would come back to Virag for!
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/24/2014,6/5/2014,49,140,3,4,3>I love Foodstuffs! Amazing gourmet food shop, filled to the brim with delicious pastries, cheeses, prepared foods, and lined with darling baskets to bring it all on a picnic. I used to frequent the Lake Forest location when I was an undergrad, but I had forgotten all about this one until this weekend. I originally intended to go to Great Harvest, but after poking my head in at 9:30 on Sunday, seeing a completely empty place and all plastic wrapped pastries, we elected to come here instead. Great choice! My croissant was delicious, and my fiance's raspberry muffin was so good I kept stealing bits of the crumble topping. The small downside is that they do not have an espresso machine, but I was able to get a latte at the Starbucks two doors down and they did not mind me drinking it in here. We were able to pick up a few things for dinner and some treats while we were here, and will definitely come back to get Ravinia supplies once the season starts!
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2014,6/4/2014,57,116,3,5,4>Cute place for the little kids - clearly the audience it is geared for.  Tons of candy and Froyo.  They've got a ton of flavors available - there must have been 10 the day we were there.  It's the usual fill your self a big cup of yogurt, pile it on with a ton of different toppings and the dig in.  The toppings tend toward the overly sweet candy type - gummi bears, sprinkles, oreos, crushed butterfingers, etc.  And the yogurt was awfully sweet.  I'm more of a tart yogurt with fruit topping kind of guy, so this place wasn't quite my cup of tea.  However my 11 year old thought he had died and gone to heaven (mixed cup of cookies/cream and chocolate yogurt with gummi stuff, sprinkles, hot caramel, and oreos on top.  Yuck.  But I guess there is no accounting for taste - he was very happy.There was a birthday going on while we were there and all the little girls in attendance (maybe they were 9 or 10 years old), seemed to be having a great time.I'd say bring your kids, but if its just adults, no so much.I wasn't super fond of the froyo, but I'm giving this 4 stars just for their ability to make my kid very happy.  And after all, its all about him not me.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2014,6/2/2014,35,14,2,5,4>WORKS MIRACLES. Miracles.I took my shoes in on a Thursday; it was relatively busy, but I was helped immediately. I had called in early that day to try to get an estimate on how much my shoe repair would cost, but was told to come in with my shoes.I brought in BCBG beige suede heels that were in a disastrous condition. Basically, there were vomit splatters all over the shoe and scuffs everywhere. To make matters worse, I left those heels in my trunk for more than half a year to discover that the splatters had changed color and seemed to be a part of the shoe. Embarrassing? Yes... (don't judge me!)The guy looked at it and didn't seem too hopeful he could do much and had no guarantees. Initially he said they would be done in a week, but I needed to be done by Saturday (2 days from then). And he said he would get it done! He charged me $22, which included waterproofing, which I thought was fair (: They accept payment immediately and pick up later.I came in on Saturday to be ASTONISHED. The heels looked brand spankin' new! I really wish I had taken a before and after photo because he literally did magic on my shoes! Amazing!

There are tables and couches at which to have a sit, and they even have a few board games if you're so inclined. The friendly staff members are happy to help you pick something, as well as provide plenty of information about the wine or beer served at their weekly Saturday tastings.

<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,5/29/2014,90,224,4,8,4>I decided to try spinning last week for the first time (whaaaaaaat!), and RevSpin is just a couple of blocks from my place, so it was the obvious choice for a trial run. I sent a pre-spin email to them asking what they recommended to start, and they quickly answered that their Level 1 course would be perfect and that I would just need to show up about 15 minutes early to get the lay of the land from the instructor.So, I did that and the instructor was literally waiting at the door for me. (not on purpose, but still... very welcoming). I explained my newness and she walked me through how to get on the bike and manage myself during class. I took my seat in the front row ('cause I'm brave like that) and KILLED IT. Well, I survived it ... but I'm giving myself big props for that.Spinning isn't for quitters. Expect to sweat your cheeks off for 50 minutes regardless of your fitness level. You control your own resistance at all times, so if you don't sweat it's your own fault.I really enjoyed the class, loved how the instructor cared about my first-timey-ness and the space was pretty perfect. It got a little warm in the room at times, and I would've loved an extra burst of cool air now and then, but I did see some fans there (that just weren't on?!) and could probably ask to set-up near one if it seemed necessary. I'll find out tomorrow when I return for my 2nd spin!!
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/6/2014,5/28/2014,362,467,5,14,4>This is a review for the juice cleanse, so for those of you who are looking to see whether you want to invest the money to try it out, here it is: I've always wanted to try the cleanse but the high price tag and the thought of giving up solid foods for three days were deterring. But when I saw the Groupon for 50% off (discounted price of $97), I figured I might as well try. In terms of logistics, it was super easy to arrange the pick-up. 1. I bought the Groupon. 2. I called the number given. 3. I was able to pick it up the NEXT DAY (Groupon asks that you give up to 2 weeks, so guess I was lucky). 4. I go in on a Friday and then have all the juices bagged and ready to go. NOTE: You DO have to pay an additional sum of money for tax when you pick up your juices, so make sure you bring cash/credit card/whatever. You pretty much have 6 juices a day, 4 unique varieties:1. Green Lantern: tastes quite salad-y, but the kick of the lemon makes it easy to go down. Definitely not delicious, but at least I could drink it without holding my nose.2. Haute Lemonade: lemonade with cayenne pepper. You can really feel the kick for this one! It was surprisingly spicy, but it was also my all-time favorite. 3. Maroon 5: If I were Adam Levine, I would sue Peeled for naming this horrible drink after my band... Beets and carrots = deep magenta, absolutely nasty concoction. I had to hold my breath and down a cup of water to get past this one. 4-5. Repeat Green Lantern and Maroon 5.6. Cashew milk: Strange texture and flavors, but after having the Maroon 5 twice in one day, it was heavenly.You're probably wondering: 1. How did you feel? 2. Were you hungry?1. First day was the worst for me. I actually only got through 4 out of the 6 drinks... it was too much liquid for my body to handle and the nastiness that was Maroon 5 made me feel sick. I also took a ridiculously long nap on day 1 and was exhausted. Days after that felt fine and it was a lot easier to get through the juices. 2. Surprisingly, no. You are pretty much drinking a minimum of 16 cups of liquid a day, so I was never hungry.Would I do this again? Probably not. I lost a total of 5.5 pounds (almost all water weight), so this is not a way to actually lose real weight. Did I feel absolutely amazing and fabulous after? Meh. I would say I felt "lighter" but that's probably because I had no food in my system. Also, it's too expensive to justify the results. Did it "jumpstart" healthy eating habits? I was really portion/food-conscious for a couple days after, but now I'm eating normally again, so for me, not really. What I would do differently IF I went through it again: Wean myself off processed foods a few days before. I think the biggest reason why I struggled so much day 1 was because I literally dived headfirst into the cleanse (I mean, I finished an entire box of Oreos the night before).All in all, a worthwhile experience, but I don't think I would ever go back and do it again.

<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2014,5/26/2014,23,321,,5,2>I like this place.  I can't say that I love it.  It's not what I would call luxury or exceptional.  They do a fine job.  I have come here a couple of  times now for a pedicure.  On my most recent visit I brought my adult daughter with me.  They were able to give us both pedicures at the same time which was convenient.  I only wish that they would spend just a bit more time on the leg massage part. The location is kept very clean which of course is important.  The massage chairs that you sit in for the pedicures are really nice.Though it was the very end of March during this visit we were still in the midst of the polar vortex so boots were still the footwear of choice.  They were really great when it came time to leave by wrapping our toes in plastic so the fresh polish wouldn't be destroyed.

So, the Botanic is a favorite with our family. We can walk the kids and the wife can get her flower nerd on. We end up here quite often. There are many beautiful garden vignettes to explore. I love the Japanese garden. When you're on the island it is easy to imagine being transported halfway around the globe. During the summer they have live music and dance lessons. Super fun for the kids, as well as the senior set. The cafe is a good spot to grab a light lunch. Pro tip: the place is free. You only pay for parking. So, ride your bike in and save $20.

I tried 2 sandwiches, the #1 and the tuna (I forget the number) but regardless both were outstanding! But the best thing out of my meal was the arrancini, or as I refer to it "the rice ball thing". That was simply remarkable. Ontop of all the great food was great prices, and friendly service. My total was 14 dollars and some change and the cashier saw I only had 14 dollars in hand then twenties, and instead of making me break a twenty he just said it's alright, don't worry about it.

For dessert, my first choice was the crème brule with malted milk balls, but they were sold out.  We then had the brown butter cake which was fantastic.  Service was perfect.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and wine list and made some great suggestions.  The flow of service was spot-on as well, and we never felt rushed or delayed.I would definitely recommend MH Fish House to anyone who asks.  Prices were fair for the quality of the ingredients and portion size, service was perfect, and it's close to the house.  We will definitely be back.

I am personally picky about who does my eyebrows just because I've had a bad experience where it was uneven. When I go here I always go to Emmy (that's how it sounds like, but its actually spelled differently). If she's not there I will go to Sonia. The owner is an older "fabulous" [loud] lady and can push you in to services you dont want so just dont feel bad to say no. Nonetheless the girls here are really nice. I would just call ahead of time to see if they can fit you in because I tends to get very busy here. Price wise its not bad. $6 for threading womens eyebrows and $4 for upper lip. For men's eyebrows I believe its $10, but you can always call for pricing.

The owner has great taste, service and product. They don't pressure you into buying anything either which is a huge plus since I hate being stalked... small boutiques usually annoy the heck out of me because they're always on top of you. I also like the fact that the owner is involved with the community and she's always there to help. She has a heart for the neighborhood which is so valuable if you believe in the neighborhood ideal.

The process you go through with the, to choose frame, mat and glass can take some time (and should for expensive or hard-to-match pieces), but it is totally worth it. Local people with roots in their location make a difference. Not the cheapest place in town (I would get a simple job done somewhere else), but for anything you are hanging in sight, this is the place to go!
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,5/15/2014,2,12,1,7,5>My husband and I had a great evening here yesterday. This cafe is the perfect venue for dates. They have a very cozy design and my favorite combination of "white tablecloth on a background of burgundy and dark wood". The cafe is very tiny. We came without reservations, and found the table. but probably in popular days such as Friday or Saturday reservation  required. I was pleased with my meal and the size of dish. It was not huge like in American restaurant , but was not tiny like in many French restaurants when  you need  to have 3 - 6 plates to not be hungry.Price for dinner for 2 persons  is 60 - $ 70 with wine and dessert. But you can only have a couple of appetizers  for 9 - $ 12 and  coffee for price like  $ 30 dollars if you do not plan a big dinner. I'll probably be back here.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2014,5/14/2014,0,12,1,6,4>We've been here a half dozen times or so. Firstly, they service bread and a a simply excellent Rosemary olive oil. As for main course(s), the Tapas philosophy is always great for getting a dynamic mix of serving types in one sitting. The Salmon Ahumado is a personal favorite! If you come here then I also would highly encourage you to try the Red Sangria as it is in my opinion, the best thing about Tapas Barcelona. When so often Sangrias are overly sugary and watered down, this Sangria feels almost authentic in that you can actually taste the wine(s).

When I was younger me and my friends would joke about coming home from work, getting off the train, and going to grab drinks together. Since turning 21, it turns out... that does happen a lot. Honestly, I had never gone into Glenview House until this year. Since I've been home this summer, I've gone quite a few times. The first time, I was mainly there for dinner with a friend. I had the Three Beef Burger as it came highly recommended from our waiter. The burger was pretty good. A little dry and a bit above the "Medium" I requested, but still pretty good.But let's be real, you don't come here for the burger. If you're going to the Glenview House, you're probably grabbing a drink. The beer selection is great and has all (well not all...) the IPAs, Lagers & Ciders you could want. Definitely try the Small Town Root Beer... and maybe order a bowl of ice cream to go with it too!In terms of appetizers (bar food), I've had the Potato Skins, the Wings and the Spinach & Artichoke Dip. My favorite was probably the dip, but overall, the portions are a little on the smaller side. My favorite part about Glenview House though? Tuesday, they have half price beer and whiskey flights. Which means you can get a taste of a few different brews for as few as $4 or $5!I don't know how much longer I'll stay in Glenview after I graduate college, but Glenview House will always be one of my favorite hometown bars.
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,5/12/2014,11,24,1,6,5>My wife and I stopped in for a quick dinner before a movie. I had high hopes for the place based on previous Yelp reviews, and I was not disappointed. It really is a great neighborhood restaurant with a strong sense of character. The Greek personality is evident in every aspect of the restaurant, down to the warm shoulder hug that the restaurant's manager gave me as he asked if we were enjoying our meal. We most certainly were.My wife had a large African prawn that was as delicious as it looked on the menu. There was nothing small about this prawn. It clearly had a well-fed life prior to ending up on my wife's dinner plate. It tasted delicious too, stuffed with cheese and herbs that made the mouth melt.  I had the beef kapama dish, a short rib cooked in a tomato (and cinammon) sauce that sits on top of a plate of pasta. The ratio of short rib to pasta was just right. Sometimes after eating short rib, I feel weighed down, but I didn't after eating this lovely dish. My only complaint about the dish was that I would have liked a little more sauce with it. The flavor was delicious and I wanted more of it!We started our meal with a beautiful plate of fried zucchini. It was a pretty big plate and when they delivered it to our table, I thought there was no way we'd get through the entire thing. Of course, after realizing how crisp and delicious they were, we devoured all of them.  Even though it was fried, I didn't feel all greasy afterward. They know how to apply a light touch at this restaurant.The servers and the entire staff were extremely friendly and much more welcoming than the average north shore franchise. We're coming back!
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2014,5/11/2014,108,103,8,10,7>Buff Joe's.... always works their magic.When someone mentions it, the response is usually: "omg Buff Joe's, it's SO good let's go there NOW!" said quickly, almost panicky in one breath.  Or followed by: "I need Buff Joe's, why'd you have to mention it, we need to go NOW!"When someone mentions your favorite type of food, you have a mini anxiety attack when your mouth waters and you need dem wings... That's kinda what happens... no matter what time of day.I always get a single order of Suicide Wings (topped with jalapenos) with a side of waffle fries ("Buffalo Chips" $1.89).   Your order will come with celery and ranch, and a wetwipe (which you will certainly need).  Sometimes I'll wash everything down with an RC.Their wings are freshly fried, then tossed in tangy sauce.  A single order is $7.99 and you better bring cash because it's CASH only... but they have a generic ATM right inside the restaurant in case you forget.They also serve beer and these little oatmeal chocolate chip cookies in a huge tub by the cashier, which look heavenly, but I never have room for dessert.  Also, they have a "XXX" sauce which is a spicy habenero-type darker red sauce... which I have only requested on the side as a sample because I heard eating an order with that sauce is brutal for your tastebuds.  Try it on the side first to see if you'll like it because once you start it's so spicy it hurts.So maybe I have an unhealthy relationship with this place.  But if wings were ever going inside my stomach, they better be from here.  When friends visit from out of town, I'll take them to Buff Joe's and with a serious face, say: "These are the best wings in Chicago."  (Deep dish pizza will be tomorrow night...)I only go to the Clark location, although there are two others on Green Bay and Howard.  After I have gone and out-done myself again in the form of massive wing consumption, I say I've reached my Buff Joe's quota, forever.  But of course I end up coming back the following month or so.This stuff is on par with being one of my last meals on urf.  Heaven on urf...earth.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2014,5/10/2014,2,24,,4,3>THIS PLACE IS GREAT! I love how they have froyo, bubble tea, and sushi all at one spot! Really inexpensive, and the fish is very good! Talked to the man who prepared my sushi, who happened to be a sweetheart, and he explained how it comes in almost daily. I was there when it first opened and even then they had their act together, it's been a few months so I can only imagine how much better it's gotten! Oh and another thing that was very nice, the man who prepared my sushi was earnestly asking about the quality of the food and how he thought it could be improved. That was so nice! Definitely a place to go back to over and over again.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/26/2013,5/9/2014,0,24,,5,3>Fantastic!  Ken and his staff really take care of you!  Had alternator placed.  Was able to schedule appt, have work done  and out in same day.  I left with the feeling they actually cared about their work and about me as a customer. No other hands will touch my S60R.  Top shop, good pricing, but more importantly, they are there to connect with you as a customer.  You will not be disappointed.
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2013,5/8/2014,131,47,4,11,7>I started ordering from here using Grub Hub a while ago.  It had really great reviews on there, so I figured I'd give it a go.  They deliver super fast, fyi, so don't go by the "estimated delivery time" or else you may get caught in the shower like I did once.Their chicken kabobs are super moist and seasoned wonderfully.  Their beef schwarma is also amazing!  I would definitely recommend either of those... or a combo of both.Hummus wise, I much prefer their jalapeno hummus to their plain.  It has more flavor, and it's not really all that spicy, so if you are a wuss I wouldn't worry about it too much ;-)Their rice is amazingly flavorful, and you get so much that I usually have enough rice left over for one or two meals.I've had both the lentil soup and the stew that they make.  They are both quite good, but I prefer the lentil.Honestly, I like this place better than Pita Inn... so, give them a go!
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,5/7/2014,20,82,1,4,4>Soooo excited that they added the ability to book your appointment online from their website.   It is formatted to also work on a mobile phone browser so you can easily pull up their schedule and the type of service you want and see when each stylist had an opening.  I just booked an appointment and it took about 3 min.  Much less time than it would have taken to call and since it's 9pm they are closed so I would have to wait untilTomorrow to do it anyway. This is a huge plus in my book since it is so convenient  and  saves time!
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2013,5/6/2014,24,55,3,5,4>I've been going to this practice since 1985. Dr. Abt is my dentist, I don't trust anyone else with my teeth. He not only practices dentistry, he is an active professor of dentistry and continues to do research on the most vexing dental problems.You won't see this practice advertising, they don't need to. All of their patients come from word of mouth (no pun intended). These guys are the real deal, their clients are the most educated, discriminating professionals on the North Shore. Come to this practice because you want to deal with nice people and receive the best care of your teeth. They provide great service and never suggest unnecessary procedures. There is NO upselling here. If you want teeth whitening or cosmetic dentistry, you'll have to ask them for it. I would recommend them without reservation.
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,5/5/2014,32,156,3,7,5>Pieros has become, hands down, my favorite deep dish pizza place-- not just in HP, but EVERYWHERE. It's just so good! We get the pan pizza WELL DONE, which is important. The crust is flavorful and crispy, the sauce is really fresh and tomato-y, and the cheese is gooey and delicious. If you want an extra delicious treat, get your pizza with sausage and broccoli. An unexpectedly delicious combo that has become our regular order.
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2014,5/4/2014,5,28,,4,2>Good food, cute atmosphere. I think we may have been the youngest people in the place, and am guessing this place is popular with the older crowd.We ate at the bar and were very happy we did. There was a long wait, but full menu at the bar was easy and immediate. Service was great and we would come back here again!
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2014,5/3/2014,55,123,,8,4>LOVE this place. Service is great. Every time I'm there, I always get a warm welcome. GREAT customer service. One of the big reasons why I return.  I always get the chorizo nachos, my sister always gets the chicken torta. Always consistent and delicious. Their sauces are soo addicting. Whatever that creamy spicy orange colored sauce is.. Heavenly. Thier juices are awesome, I don't know what the red one is called but it was great. Al pastor tacos are to die for.The establishment is clean. Prices are very reasonable. Parking sucks but where doesn't it in Evanston, you can park in the library lot and walk a short distance over. Highly recommended!
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/2/2014,5/2/2014,132,200,1,6,4>I was here with a friend for Restaurant Week and I regret nothing. I had: the cheese curds, the burger, and the peanut butter tart. The cheese curds were so beyond good. My friend said she'd heard people raving about the cheese curds, but I honestly couldn't see how fried cheese could be all that good. And yet... it was. If I got the chance to go to Farmhouse again, I'd probably just order cheese curds - we were stuffed after just eating that huge bowl of cheese curds, and probably could have just left satisfied then. I will say that I didn't like my burger as much as I thought it would. I had it medium rare, but I thought that it was pretty dry, and the bun was huge. I ended up only eating the top half of the bun, because I was just so full! As for the peanut butter tart - I will say that I was never, ever so grateful to see a smaller portion of dessert than I expected. Absolutely delicious - although the peanut were a little too cinnamony, I thought - great textures, an awesome combination of flavors. So, so delicious! Oh! And they gave us some white chocolate cherry scones to start (compliments of the chef) and they were freaking delicious. I'm pretty sure they were the best scones I've ever had. I often find scones to be too dry and grainy, but these were perfect. I would definitely go back - and I would definitely get the cheese curds. Oh man. Mouth heaven.
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/22/2014,5/1/2014,127,267,,3,3>We signed up my daughter Katie here in December after her elementary school hosted a taekwando demonstration by UTC head instructor Master Jeong.  At UTC, Master Jeong (a sixth degree black belt) gave my daughter instruction in some basic moves, and then talked to my husband and I about what they focus on at UTC.  We were impressed.  In addition to a great physical workout and martial arts training, kids are taught the importance of values such as respect, perseverance and self-discipline.  Character is key, along with fitness and conditioning.  Every week, a different "life lesson" is emphasized.  Kids can earn black attitude stripes for demonstrating organization, good manners, respect for teachers, love for parents, good personal hygiene...even for completing book club sheets.The taekwando studio (right across the street from H-Mart) is clean and well-maintained.  Importantly for us, parents can be present and view the lesson from the lobby.  Some drop off their kids as lobby space is tight, but my husband and I like to know what's going on in class.  Kids are initially asked to attend classes twice a week (you pick the days/times) and I appreciate that flexibility.  We pay $99.00 a month (the uniform is included).  Testing for new belts starts at $55.00, I believe.Ultimately, the instructors - Master Jeong and Master Nahm - make the center worth recommending.  I've observed they are both excellent at working with kids.  (Master Jeong is funny and laughter is common in class).  Without being overbearing or intimidating, both Master Jeong and Master Nahm command respect while making the classes fun, high-energy and motivating.  My daughter looks forward to going.UTC offers taekwando classes to kids starting at age three and a half, all the way up to the adult level.  Master Nahm also teaches an adult kickboxing class (that I was told is an intense workout).  Kids camps, birthday parties and anti-bullying seminars are also offered.
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/21/2013,4/30/2014,18,149,3,6,4>Have I really not reviewed Ward Eight yet? I've been here three times, maybe four, and have loved it each time. The cocktail menu is perfect - a good selection of tried and true cocktails, each annotated with the year it was created (1800s, anyone?). The food menu is small, but quality. You can get a bowl of almonds or a larger meal - something for everyone. They have local artists' work on the walls, atmospheric lighting, really friendly servers, and good music. It's small, it's not a pick-up joint, it's not a scene - it's a great little place to go hang out with friends or a date/spouse and relax with good food and drink.
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2013,4/29/2014,3,25,4,8,5>BYOB is always a plus in my book.  Especially when paired with delicious Tom Yum, Yum Nua (Beef Salad), Panang Curry, and Spicy Eggplant with beef.  The sauce in the Eggplant was outstanding.  I prefer my Panang curries a bit thicker, but this one was still very flavorful.  Beef salad had more beef than Wendy's.Ambiance includes muzak w/ vocals remixes of your favorite 70's and 80's classics.  Triptastic.Best part - price.  $32 plus my bottle of wine for a delicious 2 entree 2 appetizer meal.

Great job Vape City! LOVE IT!
