<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/23/2013,11/25/2014,2,17,1,2,1>I've walked past Stitch several times after business hours and made a mental note to come by when it was open.  Today I got my chance, and I was so happy to find that it was just as funky and fun on the inside as it looked from the window.  They have a bunch of really neat sewing and knitting patterns, as well as really great fabrics with fun prints, and a lovely selection of yarn.  I haven't sewed in ages but with a shop like this around I can't imagine I'll stay away much longer.  I picked up a knitting pattern and some handwashing soap specifically meant for taking care of your projects that you can't trust to the washing machine or a drycleaner.  I will definitely be back for yarn, that much I can promise.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/4/2014,11/24/2014,0,12,1,2,2>Des Moines tradition. I have been coming here since a child and still hold this place so close to my heart. It is locally owned so they do use paper/pen and its a little technologically out of date...which I think adds to the charm. Big chains provide the most *efficient* experience, yes, but they will never have the style of a place like this!
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2012,11/23/2014,1,7,1,2,2>The best steak in town!!  Love this place.  Service is always top notch and the food is always delicious.  From the rolls, steak, delicious green beans, sweet potatoe, appetizers.  Did I mention they have amazing drinks on the drink menu.  A great place to sit at the bar for a drink or bring family and friends for dinner.  This place is at the very top of my favorite list!!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/12/2014,11/22/2014,13,147,1,2,5>We ordered the Deburgo ($12/$19) and a side of their garlic breadsticks ($4) to go. The Deburgo is a pizza with garlic - herb cream sauce, sliced sirloin, mozzarella, smoked Gouda, cremini mushrooms, lemon-herb viniagrette,  romano, and fresh basil. This pizza is perfect for anyone who likes white pizzas. There wasn't much sirloin on it, but there was plenty of mushrooms and cheese. The sirloin on the pizza was tender and not chewy at all. As for the garlic breadsticks, the garlic is pretty strong (I personally like the strong garlic taste but I can see how others may not). If you're on a date, maybe you should stray from anything served with garlic here ;) the breadsticks also come with a red marinara sauce for dipping. Overall i was very pleased with Gusto's!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/22/2014,11/21/2014,29,74,4,4,3>This place lives up to its name. It's tucked away in a corner and isn't much to look at (inside or out) but the service was nice and food was good. There are actually a few tables there, but I imagine that actually eating there wouldn't be a great experience (just take it home and watch Netflix in your underwear instead - you won't regret it).The egg rolls are genuinely good and I'm a fan of their fried rice (although it could still be better). For Chinese food, I feel like the prices are just slightly higher than they should be (random chicken dish and a side of egg rolls was $10 and change).Best part about the whole trip was hearing/watching the cashier yell back to the cook, "Shut up man! I want this young man to think that I'm cool. I want him to like me."
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/8/2014,11/20/2014,110,444,4,5,4>Definitely the place to get your MEATZ on!   I dined here with a friend who insisted we go to Jethro's since I still haven't been to one.  You don't have to twist my arm, just dangle some smoked meat in front of my face and I'm there.Jethro's was packed at 5:30pm on a weeknight.  Yes.  I am an old lady and eat at the senior citizen dining hour.  But there are advantages, as we snagged one of the last open tables.  Service was super speedy.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  I got the BBQ pork sandwich complete with waffle fries.  And we attempted to make a dent in a half order of onion rings.  The half order could have fed an entire girl scout troop!!! I don't even want to know what a full order consists of.  The value is insane, as the portions are massive.  Consider sharing.  Or at least fast for 16 hours before dining here.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2014,11/19/2014,292,547,8,7,8>Trader Joe's is a fun place to go, they have healthy options for an affordable price. The stores are very small compared to most grocery stores, but they have the stuff you need and want. Love the awesome diverse selection of goods here, glad I can get unique items here.One thing to understand for rookies here, they are heavy private label here. However, their private label is very high quality and not just a cheap copycat. If you research their practices you will find out that they have a very high standard on each vendors and very secretive as well. So feel confident when you buy their brand that it is of the highest quality.TJ's is a fun place to be, the people are always happy, it's always busy, the employees are fun, and they always have samples in the back. Overall great store to shop at, if you have never been check it out and stock up!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2014,11/18/2014,11,191,2,5,4>Django is popular for good reason; they offer good food with a fantastic selection of wines (so diverse a selection that the menu is on an iPad). You really cannot go wrong with any meal, but whatever you have - save room for dessert!  I am usually not much of a dessert fan, but their French Toast dessert is truly amazing.  If you go on a busy night, expect a wait - so make reservations and be patient; service can sometimes go slooooooow!
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2014,11/17/2014,57,271,1,3,5>*Fair warning: I don't get chiropractic adjustments. This review is for massage therapy only.*For several years, I had a membership at Massage Heights. After my favorite therapists kept leaving, I left too. I would book ad hoc massages here and there at various places around Des Moines, but never really found a regular LMT I liked again. Fast forward to a few months ago. I was talking with some of the girls at my gym and one of them mentioned her excellent LMT, Ben, who was now working at Reset. I wondered... could this be the Ben who I used to LOVE seeing at Massage Heights? I'm sure you can guess how this story ends: I am now reunited with the best LMT ever and I am one happy camper. Reset has a monthly membership plan just like I used to have at Massage Heights, but I like dealing with Reset a LOT more. Appointments are easy to make; you can request them online too, which I love. One note of caution: because it's a massage/chiropractic office, don't go in expecting a super zen, spa-like setting - you can hear outside noise through the door and the lights aren't super dim. That doesn't bother me because I'm not there for relaxation - I'm there for the knots in my muscles to get pummeled into submission by a super knowledgeable LMT who gives amazing deep tissue massages and targets exactly the places where I build up tension.Though I've only seen Ben at Reset, I've heard from the girls at my gym that the other therapists are really terrific, so I feel a lot more confident recommending Reset than I ever did recommending Massage Heights (where the quality of the massage varied wildly by which therapist you saw). The last time I checked, they had an introductory offer on their website - definitely worth checking out!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2014,11/16/2014,76,529,5,8,6>I'm not usually around the Norwalk area, but when I am I try to eat somewhere local. Yesterday this landed me here for a quick burger before hanging out with a couple buddies. From the appearance of the staff I believe this place is family owned. I enjoy eating at family owned restaurants because they focus on the quality of the food for the customers and not necessarily the bottom line. All three of us ordered the Rosco burger with cheese and a side of fries. There were many delicious sounding items from the dinner menu, but unfortunately it was during lunch when we stoppped by. The burger was VERY good, the buns toasted perfectly and the burger in general was very tasty. The fries were crisp and fresh. For a sidenote in our experience, they did not have Coke, only diet coke. Also we had to wait 30 minutes for the burgers because they ran out of buns last minute and had to run out to buy more. The staff member (possibly manager) was apologetic about it. This was a small issue in my book and did not affect my experience too bad, obviously this does not occur often. I would definitely recommend their burgers here and am anxious to come back to try their dinner items.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,11/15/2014,79,58,1,4,4>a slice of heaven hidden downtown. I thought I was playing eye spy like a kid all over again. we saw catfish, otters, bald eagles, and plenty of adorable dogs!!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2011,11/14/2014,25,8,2,3,3>One of my favorite restaurants in town for lunch.  Haven't had a bad meal yet, though the lamb burger can be a little too much grease for one sitting for me.The Mediterranean Chicken is one of the best dishes in town, and great with soup or salad.  The price (~$8) is a little higher than I like to spend at lunch, but is absolutely worth it at Proof, especially when considering how much lunch costs at other, inferior downtown restaurants.I've only eaten dinner once at Proof, so I can't give it a thorough review.  My date and I split a prix fixe meal ($40, normally for one person), with a memorable watermelon and mint salad where the watermelon was stacked up in a pillar.  Dinner was a bit pricey, but again it was worth the money. I would go more often for dinner, but limited hours and the price mean that dinners at Proof will be reserved for truly special occasions.I would recommend Proof to anyone looking to treat themselves to a lovingly prepared, fresh and flavorful meal for lunch, and to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion for dinner.And it can't really hurt that one of the servers looks like Marilyn Monroe.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2013,11/13/2014,5,1,1,2,3>Such a great find on the east-side of Des Moines! Always friendly and you feel comfortable and at home. The breaded chicken sandwich is a MUST-try!
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/26/2014,11/12/2014,1,4,1,2,3>This place is really good! I got the classic ( eggs, sausage links, hash browns and toast) and my boyfriend got biscuits and gravy. It was delicious!The only reason why I won't give 5 stars is because the waiting time was very long. We waited 25 minutes to be seated and other 30 minutes for our food. Service was slow but I understand since it is a small locally owned restaurant. There were lots of people waiting outside which means they are doing a good job! Maybe it is time to invest in a bigger place.Keep it up!
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2014,11/11/2014,12,7,1,3,1>Today was my first time at Mr. Filet. The service was impeccable and the food was great. The line was out the door and the owners knew a lot of the customers that came through. That told me right there that they run a great business. Anyone who loves gyros should eat here.
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2014,11/10/2014,0,7,2,1,1>Don't come here for steak or pasta. Prime rib and crab legs are what brings us back time after time. The fried chicken has been pretty good as well. They also have one of the best little salad bars in town with a great selection of always fresh items. The little loaf of bread always seems warm and is a nice starter even if the butter is too cold to spread.Service has room for improvement but our drinks were always full.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/4/2010,11/9/2014,2,20,2,6,2>Our service in the bar failed from start to finish. Ignored us, then took 15 min to get our bottle of wine. The server then broke the cork due to inexperience. We moved into the lounge and service was then phenomenal! The menu is pretty boring old Des Moines fare. I got the De Burgo because it was the most interesting thing I could find and it was good. The desert was boxed, Sweet Street I think so save your cash there. We will be back to hopefully raise the score. Final word would be: give it a try. We went soon after opening so there may be growing pains but the atmosphere along is worth a visit.UPDATE: We went back recently and had a wonderful experience. Moved to 4 star.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,11/8/2014,86,27,2,3,6>The Des Moines Farmer's Market has it all - produce, prepared food, crafts, music, plants and plenty of interesting people to watch. Every Saturday from May to October we spend a few hours here buying plants and eating breakfast. Seasonal produce and seasonal flowers are always a treat to pick up and enjoy. You'll always see someone you know or meet someone new. We enjoy coming early to beat the crowds as this market can draw crowds into the thousands. The market seems to get bigger and bigger every year. People travel from across the area every week for this market. In the winter they have a few indoor market days with a little bit of a different selection of goods. A summer tradition we will partake in for years to come.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/13/2014,11/7/2014,2,167,4,3,3>If you have visited the Chicken Coop in West Des Moines or Urbandale, you've basically been here too. Thunderhead Sports Bar is owned by the same people that brought you those two Chicken Coops and also several in Nebraska.The menu is exactly the same (a couple of items have different names) and that's not a bad thing. I think Chicken Coop has some of the best wings in Des Moines and these were the exact same, meaty and flavorful. I also recommend the buffalo chips to munch on. They are potato slices fried and then covered in a cayenne rub. On my last particular visit I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and I subbed out the sauce they list on the menu for the hottest one they have. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My wife had the pulled pork sandwich and she said the meat was juicy. We also shared the cheese balls and they were much better than expected. Sometimes bar cheese balls are kind of generic but these were good enough for me to mention.As for the beer. This place is called Thunderhead so of course they are going to push their beers over the others. Thunderhead is brewed in Kearney, NE, (not on site) and this place lays claim to be the only bar in Iowa to have their beers on tap (you can find them in cans at some grocery stores). They have about 15 taps, at the time I was there seven of them were occupied with T'Head beers. They had their standard four lineup on tap plus three others that were seasonal/specialty brews. Then they had your standard macro-crap taps and a few others with Blue Moon, Sam Adams, Angry Orchard, etc. I did spy that they had a beer from New American Brewing Company on tap which is a very new and upcoming brewery in Ankeny so it was nice to see them share tap room with an upstart brewery. Otherwise they had a cooler with another 30 some beers. As for the beers I had, their Leatherhead Red and Cropduster IPA were just OK. Nothing to write home about but not awful by any means. I also had a seasonal peach wheat which was refreshing and hit the spot. Definitely the best of the three I had that night.As for the ambiance, the place is really just a big room with a lot of TVs on the wall.  The bar in back is made of cedar wood and it kind of stands out from other bars I have sat at. A good place to come by on gameday.The service was so so. I chalk it up to being new still. There were several times when the bartenders had down moments yet they still didn't see us waiting to take or orders or offer refills or new pours.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/5/2014,11/6/2014,14,39,1,4,4>The Lift is on of my favorite places downtown. It's a martini bar with an awesome selection of beers and is a great environment for groups, solo drinking, dates, catching up with a close friend, crashing a bachelor party your friend is hosting, you name it.  The bar staff is absolutely great, always friendly, and give great service. If you want to look at original art on the wall instead of a TV, this is your place! Local artists are always on display and changed every few months! They also host live jazz music on Tuesdays. Sometimes you can even see screenings of movies! All in all, this is a must hit spot if you're hanging out downtown.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/17/2014,11/5/2014,63,40,1,3,4>Great flavors, dark and quiet atmosphere, very friendly waitstaff. Both the cashew chicken and the favorite Pad Thai were delicious. The Pad Thai noodles were not oily or gummy and the veggies were fresh and crisp in the cashew chicken. Highly recommend the healthy spring rolls for appetizers and coconut rice w/ mango dessert - both are so incredibly good!
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2014,11/4/2014,0,11,1,2,2>My wife and I had one of the best steaks I've ever had in my 47 years,  we each had the 12 oz New York strips, with the asparagus and hollandaise sauce, out of this world!, grilled perfectly, not over seasoned, and not over dressed with hollandaise, and super juicy. So now every time I'm in clear lake I will have that steak every time, highly recommended. And it's a nice quaint little place, clean and comfortable. Oh and I didn't mention that the steak was only $18.95, I've  paid $30 for steaks that weren't near as good. I could go on and on, so just try it for yourself.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2012,11/3/2014,5,5,1,2,2>Starboard Market is THE must-stop spot in Clear Lake for a sandwich or salad. Nice sized portions made fresh daily. The best savings, if you're hungry, is to grab the salad medley or the boxed lunch. You can get both under $11. The boxed lunch includes a sandwich, chips, salad and cookie. The salad medley includes three salads from where else, the salad section. Lots of salads to choose from, too. Even calorie-craving carnivores will enjoy the choices. My favorite signature sandwiches are the Port Side and Italian, but I haven't heard anyone complain about anything offered. An interesting soup to try is the cheesy cornbread. It's a good comfort-food choice. I don't eat dessert, but if you have a sweet tooth it will be difficult to pass up the 7-layer chocolate cake and other assorted goodies offered at the register.Great service from a small crew that really enjoys what they're doing.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,11/2/2014,3,54,1,5,2>Great sunset over Clear lake.The place is small with only outside seating but the view is great.  The food is above average and they have a nice selection.Full bar and reasonable priced for a nice lakeside restaurant.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/22/2013,11/1/2014,3,4,1,2,2>Our daughter attends school at Waldorf College and we've been to the restaurant three times in the past month when we've been in town to watch her play soccer.  For us, Shooterz the best place in town for good traditional American restaurant food.  The service has always been fantastic and the food has been good.  I've had the Philly cheese steak sandwich twice (chicken and beef) and the ribeye sandwich.  Everything has always been prepared to order and delicious.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/5/2014,10/31/2014,62,122,1,7,4>Loving the fusion food here. Chicago and bigger cities have done something like this already and it's nice to see a place in Des Moines taking some risks. This place kind of has a hipster vibe, as do many fusion places which could either be really annoying or really cool. I have had most of the tacos,the Seitan Andouille fries, and the root beer float ice cream. The tacos are pretty tasty and I like how they use small corn tortillas. Although I like the bulgogi taco, I found there to be too much kimchi juice plus the sauce for the meat which makes that taco soggy. I think the tacos need to be served a little hotter and are usually room temperature. I really dig the sesame pork taco too. Also, this place serves some awesome vegan and vegetarian food! However, I won't be able to bring myself to eat the Banh Mi here because I have to admit, there are some fusion foods that will never taste as good as the original thing. The Seitan Andouille fries are delicious! They are topped with a fried egg, vegetarian meat, and pickled radishes. This place offers a lot of choices with fried eggs and as we know..everything tastes better with a fried egg on top.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2014,10/30/2014,23,123,3,10,3>Went to Namaste around 11:05 AM on Sunday and they weren't open yet.  I remembered reading about a new Indian place on Yelp.  After a little searching, I came across this listing.  I walked in, was promptly greeted and welcomed to sit anywhere.  The buffet, had an equal split of meat and non-meat entrees; approximately six of each.  One of the featured specialties was goat curry.  Another item on the buffet that isn't often feature was chicken biryani.  Unlike many Indian buffets I've been to, the food actually carried a good pack of flavor and was very well seasoned.  They also made naan in small batches--which kept it crispier.  I believe naan is prepared differently depending on the region in India where the cuisine is being prepared.  Other restaurants have served a softer, "poofier" [sic] form of naan.  Drinks were refilled promptly.  As a note, there were no appetizers on the buffet for those of you who enjoy pakora or samosas.  I'll check back later this week to see the spread offered during the week.  The restaurant had a bright and cheery atmosphere and was very clean.  The waitress told me they've only been open since the middle of June.  At 11:30, there was only one other table along with myself.  Spread the word--Des Moines badly needs good Indian cuisine.  If you haven't had the chance to try Indian food yet, this would be a good place to be introduced.  The large variety of dishes (there were some that were mild as well) will fit any palette.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2014,10/29/2014,656,108,3,5,3>Yes! A Farm to Table Restaurant Des Moines!The food is amazing and they have a Full bar! You need to support this movement of local food here in Iowa and a great place- The Historic East Village of Des Moines! Lovely place for a romantic date...They have a Saturday happy hour that I will be hitting up for sure! Delightful server- I was there to celebrate something and needed markers and paper- and she made it happen!

<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,10/26/2014,24,67,2,5,3>This is my favorite place for Vietnamese noodle soup! Although this place may not look impressive, the noodle soup is absolutely amazing! Great value too. I usually order a medium #2 (pork and shrimp noodle soup, hu tieu). #2 Pork and Shrimp Noodle Soup (hu tieu)This is my favorite Vietnamese noodle soup here! It contains rice noodles, pork, shrimp, bean sprouts, and cabbage. The broth is very savory and garlicky, and a little sweet. It definitely satisfies my desire for umami. The broth is so amazing that I sometimes don't want to eat or drink things after to preserve the delicious savory taste in my mouth. The noodles are usually cooked well, although they occasionally stick together sometimes. The pork is amazingly tender, and not dry at all. The shrimp is cut so each shrimp is split in half and tastes great. The bean sprouts and cabbage are great additions and add more texture to form this unforgettable noodle soup. The size medium is usually perfect for me, and I usually don't eat much. My friend, who is Vietnamese and has eaten this in Vietnam, said it tastes exactly what she eats in Vietnam. #1 PhoThis noodle soup is also great, but I prefer the #2. However, this place has some of the best pho I have eaten. In my opinion, the pho here is better than Pho 888's, which was my previous favorite place for Vietnamese noodle soup before I tried this place. The broth here tastes better to me, while Pho 888's tastes too salty sometimes. #5 Vermicelli Noodle BowlThis tasted okay here, but I prefer Pho 888's. The meat didn't taste as savory, and seemed a bit dry compared to Pho 888's. Mango bubble teaThe bubble tea here is the smoothie kind. The mango bubble tea I was a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall, it was okay, but I would probably order a different flavor next time. Vietnamese Iced CoffeeThis was okay, but tasted too sweet for my taste. I prefer Pho 888's.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,10/25/2014,161,81,3,4,3>When I sit and eat at this place it saddens me to think about the people who are eating at Perkins.This is everything you could want in a neighborhood restaurant. Why this place is not packed on Saturday and Sunday brunch beats the hell out of me. Oh probably because they don't offer a pig trough style buffet and all you can down weak beverages! What they DO have is a simple and delicious menu. It runs around $14 but you get two sides and a high quality product and execution! This is where you will find other service industry people eating their brunch. If they like it you know it's good.Do your self a favor and for one of your side get the bacon. I'm not sure what they are putting on it but the DEA needs to investigate cause I think it's crack! The wine cocktails are light and refreshing and a great escape from the "who has the best Bloody Mary" competition. Screw it who cares come here and order a Le Jardin Blackberry-Mint Spritzer!I have yet to eat dinner here, but it has the perfect ambiance for a great place for a date, or dinner with friends. Simple clean modern style tables, exposed Edison light bulbs and a beautiful mural. This will impress any date that you know about these awesome places in Des Moines. I do however have two complaints:1) remove the salt and peppers from the table they are just taking up space everything I've had here is perfectly seasoned.2) the coffee creamers were difficult to pour out off that is all.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/9/2012,10/24/2014,3,5,1,4,2>It is a buffet style restraunt. We actually went on a Sun afternoon. The restraunt on the inside is pretty classy. The neighborhood not so nice. Everyone was very friendly. The food was rediculously good! The chicken actually tastes like my husbands. But the greens deserve special mention. I have attempted to stop 3 other times which they have been closed. I guess the cater also. So my review is if you like soul food and you can ever find them open, it is a must stop!
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2014,10/23/2014,146,3,1,3,2>Restaurants serve as a major form of entertainment for me and my friends.  Its standard fare to hit an old favorite or something new over the weekend.  Yesterday afternoon I was a bit lost to see in a text "Cafe Fuzion at 7pm".  "Where?" was my reply.  "Its next to Thai Flavors (old staple for us)."I arrived a little early as it was snowing at a good clip and I didn't want to be late.  There were a few tables occupied during this blustery winter day.  Cafe Fuzion was decorated nicely and well organized.  I'd say a total of 20 tables exist.  The entrance has very decorated, elaborate asian wall panels, ceiling tiles were with images, and little drops of modern design were in the mix with some small mirrors on the wall.  The walls are bright red.  The impression I felt was one of different and more attentive thinking than the typical place which matched the name.The staff was prompt and attentive and helped put a few table together for the group.  There was a "seat yourself" sign. As my friends arrived with beer and wine in hand it was obvious they had a BYOB policy and none for sale.Appetizers were solid.  Wings had a special secret sauce.  They were spicy and sweek  Fresh rolls were big and good.  As we would learn later the menu has similar inspiration to a Nut Pab.  There were Vietnamese specialties including Pho, Laotian common dishes like Lapp, and there were a full list of Thai specialties as well.  My main dish is one that I've commonly ordered at a number of Thai places, Basil Chicken.  This dish was had more of a sauce but was flavorful and fresh.  It was definitely different and savory in its own way.  3-5 spice didn't send me off the table or under spice me.  Other dishes that came out around the table were in similar flair.  The Lapp was as good as there is around.  Tom Yum soup was devoured.  Furisous (not only angry but ....) Chicken was not super hot but also flavorful.  Sticky Rice helped fill the belles of a few.  The Pad Thai was enjoyed even by the children. After some conversation with the small staff and learning more about their backgrounds and ideas, we had some deserts to share.  They were of common ingredients but still with the Cafe Fuzion flair.  There was a wonton wrapped and fried banana with ice cream and a purple sweet sticky rice with a fruity salad on top.Overall this was a very good experience and we'll be back to try other items.  This is a place where the enthusiastic staff can lead you to authentically prepared Southeast Asian food with twist of Fuzion.

Went to Deery Brothers Chevrolet and the entire process was superb. I highly recommend Dean Beninga as your sales consultant but really everybody there was very friendly that I came in contact with. That say they appreciate your business and they mean it. Wonderful experience, I will buy my next car from them and send my friends. Thanks again Deery!

<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2014,10/19/2014,6,10,,1,2>Never date someone you meet at a bar, they say...I met my boyfriend of 2+ years here. I'd become a regular because of the great staff and the proximity of the place to my apartment. The food, drinks and staff are what factored into me becoming a regular. I used to come here with my father when i was a kid just for their great nachos. after a while things started going downhill from what I remember. The food wasn't as great, the service was awful and the crowd that was drawn here was even worse. After the remodel and new ownership, it seems things have been much better! I would spend whole afternoons here getting to know the staff and just meeting new people. They always have daily specials listed on their chalkboard, so you can try something new. This place will always hold a place in my heart. It's just another dive, but it feels like home. unpretentious and always welcoming.

Chicago spoiled me with Binny's, and I felt lost in the world moving here and not being able to find a single liquor store with more than 400 square feet of wine.I want rows, and rows, and ROWS of beer, wine, and liquor! I want imports! I want local stuff! And I want to talk to staff who know what GOOD wine/beer/liquor is (cough cogh, Hy-Vee, cough cough.) It's not that hard!Well, Cyclone gets it, at least. Thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I stopped by this place on my way home from work, and was extremely impressed by everything I mentioned above. Haven't found anything that comes close in the DSM area. This is a liquor store done right, folks.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/22/2014,10/12/2014,51,69,4,7,5>Convenient for studying for long periods of time because:1. Free coffee refills2. A lot of electrical Outlets3. CHEAP foodUnfortunately the brewed coffee is rather weak, the tables are often dirty (bus yourself or you'll be waiting awhile), and the menu is kind of redundant/boring. To be fair, I have yet to try the eye-catching, scrumptious looking pastries in the front case; rice krispie treats as big as your head! And of course, you can't go wrong with ice cream.I've spent a lot of time here because of the aforementioned positives and its convenient location. It is not where I would choose to host an important business meeting, however, it would appear that many groups do so anyway. There are many, many more tables here than other coffee shops so if you hang around a little while you can snag one.Also, there are stamp cards... you know the "Buy ten drinks, get the eleventh free!" kind of thing.

Super clean, too!While obviously it's not typical to experience it in the way I did but you can see the gem shining through the shiny wedding decorations.Candy for 10¢, wooden rink, old school roller skates... The list goes on. It's great! If you're in for a throwback -- this is your place.

The atmosphere is so chill and they always play great relaxing music. The prices are also awesome! I try to go in weekly, but it ends up being a couple times a month. I've got some of their tea at home and drink it daily! If you like green tea, try the ancient happiness. It's my favorite!

Sunday mornings/early afternoons with Brazilian fries and spicy Bloody Marys are the best. The atmosphere and usual crowd also makes it my favorite place on Welch to drink! They have great burgers and gyros. It's a great place to watch soccer games with a group of friends. I'd highly suggest stopping by for a game - or just to have a Bloody Mary or one of their fabulous Long Island Iced Teas.

Perfect sub. Delicious. Fair prices too.I'll never give a penny to any chain garbage peddlers in Ames. Downtown Deli is just the way I like it. Support local fresh healthy foods. Start here

To my surprise I was seated before I finished my first beer. I ordered the 16oz ribeye, and it came out a perfect medium rare. The flavor was perfect. It came with a salad, potato, and bread which were all served perfectly!!! The owner stopped by and spoke to me a couple times. Very friendly!!! I like these kinds of place where if you become a regular, they know your name.
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/9/2014,10/2/2014,4,106,1,3,1>This place is pretty good it has similar flavor profiles as Proof but they have more inventive dishes. Here's the short review: if you're hungry order the pizza it's one of the best in town.  Do not order the entrees and expect to be full. As you will see my pictures if I stared at my entree for too long it would have disappeared.Okay here's the long review:  came here on a Friday night. The place was packed.  They told us the wait was going to be an hour,  we said it was fine.  Here is what is weird, they don't give you a buzzer. They simply say they "find" you when they are ready to seat you.  This is a horrible system as the hostess doesn't remember what you look like and they inevitably just walk around the restaurant saying "are you Mr. Z?". They need to change this.Anyway the wait was more like 20 min, we granted a drink from the bar while we waited (they make great old fashioneds) and hung out on they patio.  When it was our turn to sit we ordered an order of chicken croquettes and a pizza with guanciale (pork cheek), egg, and potatoes.  The pizza is phenomenal quite literally one of the best in town.  The crust has a sourdough flavor and is bubbly and chewy.  The croquettes were meh... Crispy but dry.Then we moved on to our entrees.  I had the roasted lamb... Which would have evaporated under strong light.  The lamb itself though was very good but the portion was smurf-like.My wife had the hanger steak which was more substantial and very good too.  It was however heavily spiced almost to the point that you could not taste the steak.  The potatoes that the steak came with were great crispy and spicyThen came dessert.  We opted for three :).  We had the budino, zepole and olive oil polenta came.  The zepole were light and airy they came with a lemon custard for dipping.  Hands down the best dessert.  I wish they would serve it with warm chocolate but I digress. The Busoni (Italian custard) was very good but very one note.  The olive oil polenta cake was like eating a cliff bar with gelato.  We were not a fan.Overall a good meal but we will only be back for pizza.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2014,10/1/2014,49,17,2,2,3>This is an excellent consignment shop for women's business attire. Sheila is a very friendly and spunky owner, that keeps an excellent inventory, clean shop and comfortable atmosphere. It is also great for casual, evening wear, winter coats, bags and accessories, shoes, art and home furnishings. There are some high-end gems to be found, alongside inexpensive quality brand items. If you have items to consign, I  recommend calling ahead to see what season and items she is accepting, and if it's a good time to bring them in. Plenty of parking right out front.

The service is awesome, the coffee is DELICIOUS (try the Mocha Bianca! YUM!), and the overall atmosphere is very warm and welcoming.This is a great stop for anyone with an appreciation for the arts. Beautiful artwork covers the walls, and you can bring it home with you for a price! They are super "green" and use actual cups, they are extremely LGBT friendly, and have options for all types of diners, vegan, vegetarian, and others! Love it!
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2014,9/29/2014,67,50,1,3,5>We stopped in on a chilly and busy Farmers' Market Saturday. There was a line from the counter to the rear of the restaurant. The line moved quickly and we were with beverages and at our table (yes, there were several free!) in just a few minutes. Several customers turned around and left at the sight of the line but we were happy we stayed. Perhaps the team there could benefit from a line manager who could give reasonable expected wait times. My coffee and his were both exactly what we expected. Delicious and strong. Enjoyable experience on a busy day!

I came here due to a flat tire with a nail in the sidewall. Associate did not try and up sell me to more expensive tires and recommended tires that would work and have a long life. The wait was a little long because they had to get the tire from an alternate location but overall it wasn't bad for how busy they were! (3 hours) Sales rep who I had worked with prior asking about getting a second vehicle even came over and asked how I was and remembered that my husband is in the military. Very personal service. Very clean and bright waiting areas with popcorn, coffee, and cookies. The shop area where I dropped my car at was immaculately cleaned. Shop made sure right away if
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2014,9/26/2014,37,68,1,4,4>Mmmmm, late-night cookie delivery.  COOKIES TIL 3AM!  Clearly a cool addition to campus town, and they have a wide zone in which they're willing to deliver, too.I stopped in to check it out and try a cookie.  They've got a small storefront area with a bit of seating, but mostly they look to be focused on delivery or grab-and-go.  The workers were all very friendly and cheerful; they didn't push more cookies than we wanted, though they were willing to make suggestions if desired.I brought friends and shamelessly nibbled their selections as well as my own, so I got to try a Double Chocolate Mint cookie, an Oatmeal Raisin cookie, and a Snickerdoodle cookie.  I admit, I kind of expected the cookies to be mediocre, because yeah, I'm biased against chain stores.  But nope, I admit it -- these cookies were all great!  I think the Oatmeal Raisin was best, but the others came in pretty close behind it.  Warm and gooey and awesome, oh my.  And $1.35, which is highly reasonable for a good, generously-sized cookie.They also have "jumbo deluxe" cookies ($2.75, and they were biiiiiig), brownies, ice cream, cakes, and frozen cookiewiches.  They do various deals for larger orders, too.

<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2014,9/23/2014,60,349,2,4,6>I'll admit that when I first heard of Up-Down when my husband attended a work party there, my initial thought was seriously, a place with arcade games!?  I was not very excited about it and hearing my husband's explanation afterwards didn't excite me anymore.Fast forward a couple months to the Yelp 10th Birthday Party which was held here.  I still wasn't super excited but knew it'd be a good time to meet other Yelp Elites.  I was pleasantly surprised at my experience.One challenge is figuring out how to get into the place.  You'll see the signs at street level but you have to go downstairs to get there.  Yet, I felt signs were lacking to get there.  Once you reach it, you'll see arcade games galore along with a nice sized bar and a few tables and booths with games built in.  There are both new and old games (more older than new).  The TV's play movies (Kindergarten Cop was playing), sporting events (American Gladiators and WWF were on), etc from the 80's.  Even the decor on the walls are also older.  It all plays part to the feel of the place.  The bathrooms are pretty nice too!The bar is stocked with beers, candy drinks, and pop.  The games all take only one token which is nice.  I was also told that if it's your birthday, you get some free tokens (pretty good deal)!If you want a unique experience with some friendly competition, I'd say give it a try!
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2014,9/22/2014,21,13,5,4,4>A group of buddies and I made the trip to Des Moines to try out this place. I've heard great things about The High Life Lounge via friends and it being featured on Man vs Food. Coming in with high expectations, I was satisfied with my visit.Coming in, the atmosphere was great. A lively group of people conversing at the bar and the walls filled with interesting pictures and decorations. On top of this, there are old arcade games in the back to give the customers a feeling of nostalgia. Once we were seated, a waitress quickly came over to us and took our drink and appetizer orders. She made great time getting our drinks for us and immediately took our orders, making very helpful recommendations on the menu. She periodically came back to the table for refills and our food was out shortly. Excellent service.For our appetizers we got the renowned bacon wrapped tator tots and the bacon wrapped little smokies. The tator tots were like a mysterious flavor that I had never experienced before, amazing. The little smokies were good and had great potential, except they were slightly burnt. I'm not sure if they are usually that done or if that was just our batch. Another thing was the appetizers were a little expensive at $6.95 each for only 8 bite-sized hors d'oeuvres.For the main course I ordered broasted chicken. A breast and a wing with a side salad and mashed potatoes. Do not order the chicken wing. I got mine and thought it was a bat wing. There was no meat on it whatsoever. Although, this was made up for by the huge chicken breast I got. The side salad was delicious with fresh lettuce and carrots. The ranch dressing is very thin there, which enhanced the salad. The mashed potatoes had a great flavor with delicious gravy. My only complaint about it was it was slightly cold and hard. All in all, the food was good.I would definitely recommend coming to The High Life Lounge. It has a homey atmosphere and excellent service. If you haven't been here and are in the area, make a stop here; it will be worth the trip. Four out of five stars.

Cheesecake Factory, bravo, PF Changs,Champs and quite a few more! Most places are full bar and have decent wait times after shopping. Lots of stores I like and restaurants.

While their inventory covers many price points, countries of origin and qualities they have consistently have ample things for us to choose from at a competitive price.

<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2014,9/16/2014,16,20,,6,5>After spending a long, hot, and muddy day at the Des Moines Renaissance Festival, I was in desperate need of good food and relaxation. As luck would have it, a friend of mine from the area wandered through and recommended checking out Wasabi Chi for dinner. This stands as one of the greatest restaurant recommendations I have ever been given.The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming, almost looks like it might have been the building of a perkins or some other painfully generic restaurant, but do not let appearances deceive you. The interior is extremely classy, lots of dark work and black leather, low lighting, the works. The restaurant itself is split into two sides, a bar side, and the sushi bar side. For my visit, we were on bar side, but it is only a brief jaunt to get from one to the other. There WAS a TV present above the bar, but it was muted, and even though TVs in classy establishments is a pet peeve of mine, I really never found it distracting or off putting.  Seating was quick, and the wait staff was very attentive. They either were on top of any needs we had, or if they got a bit busy, would at least take a second to let us know they'd be there in just a moment. Everyone we interacted with was extremely friendly (albeit curious why there was a pair of pirates sitting at the table. Neither myself nor one of my friends had had a chance to change after the Faire.)I ordered a piece of both salmon toro and tuna toro, as I had never been to a restaurant that actually served them, as well as the Thai style surf and turf bird's nest (NY Strip, chicken, shrimp, and scallops with mixed veggies and hoisin sauce served in what seemed to be an egg-roll wrapper "bowl" on a nest of the crackling rice noodles), one of my dining compatriots just had a bowl of hot and sour soup, and the others got the Sushi & Sashimi Platter for Three, as well as an order or two of rolls I can't recall off the top of my head. The Surf & Turf was simply fantastic. The shrimp were large and plump, the chunks of steak and chicken were big and tendy, the vegetables maintained their crunch, and the hoisin sauce was phenomenal. The miso soup that came with the platter was made fresh (You can tell by the jagged and uneven sizing of the seaweed. Most pre-mades have square cut pieces) Courtesy of the large cuts of fish and sheer quantity of food on the platter, my friends that ordered it were more than happy to share with myself and the fourth member of our group. This place reigns supreme in my sushi eating experience.  Every piece of fish was fresh, and even holding it right under your nose, there wasn't even a trace of the fishy smell that comes from lower quality or older cuts of fish (My nose is crazy sensitive, ESPECIALLY to that fishy smell. It wasn't there, at all.) Each cut of sashimi was large and generous, each roll well crafted and huge (about 8 pieces to each of them) The rolls were the Douglas King roll and the Spicy 2 in 1, both of which were excellent and I recommend, but the Douglas King WAS the tastier of the two.While I didn't get any alcohol (I had plans to hit up a pub afterward) I DID get the tea, which just carried on the tradition of quality at this place. It was visibly green and cloudy, the surefire sign of a good matcha, and was very refreshing, and an excellent palate cleanser between bites. Seriously, this place doesn't f*ck around when it comes to food and drink.We even got a visit from the sushi chef as we were finishing up. He apparently knew the couple I was dining with, and was curious to see what the newcomers they had brought (myself and the fourth member of our party) thought of it. I cannot recommend this place enough. The portions are generous, the food is top notch, the ambiance is excellent, the service is friendly, and the prices are surprisingly reasonable (My surf and turf was only $16)

<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2011,9/10/2014,23,99,4,8,5>My review is based on atmosphere and coffee.  Ok, and the people.  This place is a wonderland of all things old, sometimes beautiful, and often strange.  Road signs, windows and staircases from ancient tear-downs, stained glass lanterns that once hung from church ceilings.  Floor after floor of interesting finds!  The first floor holds a coffee bar (good coffee, juices, decent prices) and a nice open space to sit and enjoy your beverage - they also do special events if you need a space for a shower or similar gathering.  The seating is at tables they've made from salvaged wood, metals, etc.In my humble opinion, I think a lot of the stuff they have for sale is way overpriced.  The pieces that they've put together (tables with beautiful salvaged metals, artfully pieced together) seem to be a good value to me - it's art, really.  But most of the stuff is in it's original, old, dusty, sometimes broken state - very cool, but not worth the hundreds of dollars on the price tag (to me).That said, I'm happy to wander around, wonder at the original purpose of some of the curiosities, and sip my tasty coffee.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2014,9/9/2014,0,7,1,3,3>Very interesting place. I almost walked out when I first walked in. Not a great first impression, but then I got to looking through the shelves. The biggest shelf was for fiction and it was stacked to the brim with classics. I picked up some Hemingway and a few others for a very good price. Some very old books and some in very poor condition but the prices are more than fairThe new books are priced by the standard on the back and aren't really worth it, but the older editions are glorious. Not many options. I wouldn't come here if you were looking for a specific book, but it's fun for browsing.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/29/2014,9/8/2014,57,271,1,4,6>I have never been a "gym person." I was the non-athlete who got yelled at by the jocks in PE for not spiking the volleyball correctly, and the little girl who would rather weave daisy chains in the outfield than attempt to catch a pop fly (true story). I've always danced, but have just never been able to view going to the gym as anything other than a chore. After halfheartedly belonging to a couple of gyms over the years, I'd nearly given up on finding a way of keeping fit that I actually enjoyed. Then I found TGR.Last summer, TGR was running a LivingSocial deal: 6 classes for $30. I took a look at the schedule and saw yoga, aerial fitness, pole fitness, and a variety of cardio & strength options. Why not give it a try? I showed up to my first pole fitness classes with no idea of what to expect, but I was immediately hooked. It's like working out... and dancing... at the same time! And you actually build muscles and increase flexibility doing it too?? Amazing.Since my first class at TGR, I've gotten absolutely addicted. Aerial fabrics had long been my favorite part of Cirque du Soleil shows, but who knew I'd be climbing silks myself and hanging upside down from the hammocks within a matter of months? Since joining TGR I've done all sorts of things I never thought I was capable of.Even better, there are TONS of group fitness classes for those who are not inclined toward a "circus workout." I've gotten addicted to the morning classes which offer a variety of cardio, interval, and strength training disciplines. TGR has a TRX setup, jump ropes, yoga mats, handheld weights, bosu balls, seven aerial hammocks, three sets of aerial silks, two aerial hoops, a trapeze, and thirteen poles. Seriously, what CAN'T you do here??My absolute favorite thing about my gym, however, isn't the gym at all. TGR is a wonderful, welcoming, supportive community of women who celebrate eachother's successes. Too cheesy? All right. Phrased another way, it's not competitive; it's not intimidating. Walking in last September, I didn't know anyone who went to this gym. Six months later, I have dozens of new friends.  How cool is that?I never thought I'd say it, but my gym is now my "happy place." I would wholeheartedly recommend TGR to anyone who wants something a little different from their workouts!
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,9/7/2014,110,444,4,9,6>Shame on me for not coming to Alba sooner!! I'm not sure how I've passed up Alba and their swanky wine list for all this time, but I clearly have some ground to make up.  The space is kinda quirky chic--(is that even a thing??)  the food definitely elevates it into a finer dining category very quickly.  We started with the beets.   I've tried recreating this dish and have not even come close!  Not sure what their secret is, but they make the beets taste heavenly.I went with the beef cheek stroganoff & my dining companion selected the wild mushroom pasta.  Everything is always better with fresh pasta--how is something so simple, so amazing?  Our selections were thoroughly enjoyed.  Dinner concluded with some in house ice creams.  I loved the buttermilk ice cream!   Kick back, have some wine, food & wonderful conversation.  Alba is tops and I can't wait to return!
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/5/2014,9/6/2014,29,74,,7,4>I want to love this place. I really do. But right now, I can't. All of the food that I have gotten thus far has been really good (various sandwiches, tacos, and soups). The wide price range for their menu items allows for a lot of different experiences and a lot of different customers. If you stick to water, then you could eat for $10 or less. If you don't or simple want to enjoy yourself a bit more, then you could spend $30+ just on yourself. The patio is pretty sweet and the decor is kind of cool. Everything simply looks nice. So, what are they problems? Well, there are a few. While I appreciate how open the inside is setup, it is also extremely conducive to being loud. The place doesn't even have to quite be packed before you find yourself having to lean over the unnecessarily long tables and jam your ear directly into whoever your with's mouth just so you can hear them. It is a little thing (pun . . . you'll see) but the silverware is huge. The fork is like a pitchfork and everything is very heavy. It sounds dumb but it can actually make eating a bit awkward. Should you find yourself with a soup spoon, it would be understandable to mistake it for a shovel. But the biggest problem is the service.Everyone there has been really nice to me and my company but two out of the three times that I have been there, it has been slow - really slow. After having finished the free chips and salsa (which I think are really good. Chips are light but still have some crunch to them and the salsa has a little kick) we were asked if we wanted more - we said yes. Forty minutes and two other servers later and they never arrived (although they did give us a free dessert instead). The next time I was there it was completely dead. That, however, didn't speed things up at all. We went about 20 minutes without seeing our waitress and then she simply walked right on by. We spent more time waiting to order than we did eating. We also spent more time waiting for the check then we did eating. I think you get it.So why three stars? One: I'm nice. Two: The food is genuinely good - isn't that the point of a restaurant. Three: The place is still very young and has a lot of potential. I'd like to see what it's like in six months.Here's a bad, unoriginal joke for your troubles.What do you call a cow on its side?...Ground beef.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/5/2014,9/5/2014,292,547,4,6,5>Ted is the way to go if you want a quick meal that isn't chain. I been here a few times and enjoyed it each time with a few different items tried.The Chicago dog is really good, has all the fixings and flavor you would expect out of Chi town. Real deal on this one, I believe they use the popular Chicago brand of hot dog as well.The gyros are good, they did a great job on these. One of the best options in town if this is your thing.The cheeseburger was alright, nothing too special. Try it if you want a change of pace from fast food.Overall nice place to go eat if you want quick food and want something local for fast food.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2011,9/4/2014,8,49,1,9,6>I have waited many, many years for an "Alberto's" (which is west coast slang for this type of mexican food) to be opened here in the midwest. I am so thankful one was finally opened here in Des Moines. I caught wind of it a few hours before I left work. As soon as it was time to punch the clock I headed straight to Abelardo's. Anyone who is familiar with San Diego style Carne Asada burritos will not be disappointed. This place will put all the other mexican food places to shame. You can get a fully loaded Carne Asada burrito for a little over $4. Five Rolled Tacos (AKA Taquito's) smothered in heaping mounds of queso fresco and guacamole were only $3.99!!! This place even has Torta's ... I haven't seen Torta's in years! The drink selection is awesome, they have the standard fare as far as soft drinks are concerned ... but they also have Horchata, Tamarindo, & Jamaica. The only drink they didn't have was Orange Bang (how I miss thee). Do yourself a favor, hit this place up. You'll be glad you did!
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/26/2014,9/3/2014,13,147,1,2,5>Came here for my S/O's White Coat Ceremony and loved it! There was plenty of seats in the auditorium and even though we were seated in the way back, maybe five rows down from the very back, I still had a perfect view of the ceremony. Thank goodness for a really great lens for pictures also! I also felt that there was plenty of space in front of me for people to walk by without me having to tuck my feet in or stand up for them to move by as I have experienced at various other places before. The seats are comfortable, and the lighting and sound was good. It was clean and very modern, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,9/2/2014,36,209,2,2,2>Friendly staff and nice atmosphere to stop for a coffee downtown. Selection of comics and trade paperbacks for purchase. Superhero themed coffee shop, or is it a Comic Shop that has coffee?  regardless it's good! Nice and casual.   Within the Des Moines Social Club, which is an additional bonus.  *RECOMMENDED*
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2014,9/1/2014,5,40,2,2,4>Just stopped in on a whim, holy cow they remodeled! Opened the whole restaurant up and gave it a new look! The menu looks just as great as it did before. The pizza is awesome but this time I tried the grilled salmon burger. What a tasty surprise. I was please with it so much I ditched the bun and just ate the patty. The homemade salad dressings are always good and the place was busy. Very good.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/20/2014,8/31/2014,173,148,1,3,5>Dude. taco truck right outside this bodega (thank you google translate)! Legit (fiar).This grocery store is where it's at for my Mexican needs. Although, I don't have too much of that... They really have anything you want though! From jalapenos to candy to meat to aspirin! It's actually very neat and fairly clean.In the back of the store you will find their ready made food. There was quite a line back there so it must be good. Can't vouch for it because I haven't tasted it myself. The staff is super cool... even though they made fun of me and had a hard time understanding me when I was asking them where their Horchata was. It took a while, but we eventually got there! I practiced that word for the rest of the night, so if anyone needs help finding, saying, or anything that has to do with horchata, hit me up!
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2014,8/30/2014,27,96,1,4,6>Retro video games and beer! Super unique dive bar. The sweet ski ball corner reminded me of all the birthday parties I went to as a kid. Great venue to celebrate Yelp turning 10.
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2014,8/29/2014,26,38,1,4,5>Big fan of Smashburger. I am partial to casual dining and this place is just good food in a casual environment. I always pick the spicy jalapeno burger but the iowa burger with bacon and blue cheese is pretty spectacular too. Also the sweet potato fries are delicious and worth a trip themselves.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2014,8/28/2014,15,42,3,3,4>So excited to have a Chinese restaurant with online orders! It didn't come without it's woes. I ordered two dinner platters and an order of crab rangoons. I got all but the rangoons. When I called, the lady tried to argue that I hadn't ordered them. After I said I had the order in front of me and I see that I was charged for them, she immediately changed her tune. Then it took 25 minutes to get back to my house. BUT. I give 4 stars because the food is awesome. Don't care if it's not authentic, it's tasty. Definitely recommend.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/8/2014,8/27/2014,63,40,1,4,4>Excellent choice of flavors available, great toppings. Why only three stars? I like the base frozen yoghurt at some other froyo chains better, and overall the dirty furniture and general appearance of this particular location was a little bit of a turn off. With so many other options close by with better presentation of a better product I'm hard pressed to send a friend to this store over the others. Still a tasty dessert, and the cup separators to allow multiple flavors is genius!
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,8/26/2014,14,39,1,4,5>I hate to admit it, but I've avoided going to Oddfellows for several months. Not great judgement on my part, but can you blame a Veggie for seeing "Burger Kitchen" and then deciding to pass? But Oddfellows offers any of their burgers with a black bean patty and, guess what?!?! it's really good. The patty did fall apart after a few bites, but I've learned that that's just something that comes with the territory of a black bean burger. The buns are simple to the eye, but are quite good. The make them there, which I think is pretty cool! They also offer their burgers in a lettuce wrap, which is a crazy cool option for vegans! The beer selection is really quite nice as well. Lots of IPAs and some local goodies, too. Or if you want something a little more simple, you can't go wrong with a nice can of PBR which you can find on the appetizer menu, which I found amusing!To go along with all that greatness, the decor is pretty nifty as well! It's got a nice rockabilly fun feel. They have a bust of Elvis that lives in the wall and a lot of Johnny Cash portraits. The walls are covered with posters that range from artists like McCartney and The Boss, as well as some for shows at local places like DGs and old Maximum Ames Music Festival posters! This gives in a great ambiance, and it's lovely to know that they support the local community, too!!
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2014,8/25/2014,86,27,5,4,8>Very friendly staff here at this branch. Always telling us to have a nice day. Fast service and clean lobby. No drive up ATM, but they have two drive up lanes and a decent size parking lot. They always have a riddle or joke up on the teller window - and it always stumps me.

<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2014,8/22/2014,17,68,1,5,5>I think we first discovered this place because they have a restaurant area that's open on Sunday and you could get a good bowl of pho on a cold winter afternoon. We still eat here often, because it's reliably good.But now I'm a regular: I rely on this place for Asian produce (at the lowest prices), bottled sauces, and of course a huge selection of noodles and rice. But I'm also thrilled that their stock changes constantly. Take today: in the produce area, they had whole, fresh durian, 3 kinds of yams, and boxes of Ataulfo mangoes on sale. The meat selection included not only a standard range of cuts for grilling and stir-frying, but also packages of pork and beef bones for stews and soups. And the seafood section had a range of fresh fish, as well as top-quality frozen whole prawns (I've tried them and they are really good; and they are not available in any local DM grocery store).But on top of that, they'd just re-organized what had been their cookie and candy section with a range of new European cookies and more Asian candies. And they have created a new section to include some American snacks and household products. Their African section also seems to be expanding. One of my favorite things, though, is discovering the depth of their selection. We must have spent 10 minutes examining all the options in the rice section before settling on a multi-grain mixture of different kinds of rice. This isn't something I could even get a chance to try anywhere else, and I love that I have that opportunity here.Another note: they are always re-stocking, and the store is very clean and well-organized. I've also only had positive interactions with the staff, including some really friendly and over-the-top helpful cashiers.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/10/2014,8/21/2014,13,17,2,3,4>If you want good Italian I would recommend giving this place a try! This is a family owned Italian restaurant on Hickman. I've been to Christopher's twice and had wonderful service each time! They try to make you feel at home each time you visit. The food was delicious as well. I had the chicken velouté and it was cooked perfectly. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and garlicy. I couldn't stop eating my dish! To end off tag night we had to try tiramisu. There was not enough alcohol for my taste but it was still very tasty! Again try this place!!! It is delicious!

<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2007,8/18/2014,68,340,3,3,2>One of the best little from-scratch bakeries you'll find anywhere.  The chocolate long-johns and cream filled powdered donuts are legendary.  But my all time favorite is the nutty fry rolls.  They frost the top with a light white frosting then sprinkle crushed nuts on top.  Mmm-good!  When I was a kid it would take me me a 1/2 hour to find enough empty pop bottles to cash in to buy one of these, but well worth it!
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,8/17/2014,76,529,2,8,6>We decided to give Jethros a second chance after a disappointing experience at their Altoona location. First, the overall surrounding of this location is better, you can tell it is established in a more upscale neighborhood. Parking was easy and spacious in their big lot. There was less than a 10 minute wait for a weekday dinner during the rush, it was not bad of a wait at all. We were seated by our friendly server and given time to look over the menu and she was able to answer all the questions we had about the daily special. One thing to note, the music is pretty loud in here, you will have to raise your voice to speak audibly. It was 2 for 1 wings so we decided to start off with 20 wings, half garlic parmesan and half Ghost. The wings were pretty good, big and juicy. The Ghost is not as spicy as Bdubs Blazin. My fiance ordered the full rack of ribs with Jalapeno corn and mashed potatoes for sides. The ribs were very good, tender and flavorful, worth the trip! The mashed potatoes were very tasty, however, we did not like the Jalapeno Corn, it tasted too Smokey/burnt. I had the 2 meat dinner, brisket and smoked sausage. The sausage was good and the brisket was average, flavorful but not juicy, cut thin. I had Mac and cheese and coleslaw for sides. The Mac and cheese was very good, they use shells, but the coleslaw was disappointing. We both had corn bread with the meal and that was very good. Overall a great experience, not the best BBQ I've had in town, but very good, glad we gave it another chance! Will come again!
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,8/16/2014,2,167,2,5,4>This is the metro's newest brewery but with as fast as new ones keep popping up probably won't be the newest for long. I heard the owner of El Bait Shop talking about them on the radio and I decided to head on up when I had the chance.Compared to other brewery taprooms in town I would say Firetrucker is a combo between Confluence and 515 Brewery. It has a comfy, homey type atmosphere in part of the taproom as it has some couches and tables but the bar area is more industrial and you can see the brewing kettles and equipment much like confluence. The rail itself is really nice and the whole bar fixture is lighted with LEDs. Pretty slick. They did have a few TVs and at the time of my visit there was a decent amount of people there watching the World Cup finals.At the time of my visit on Sunday they were offering four of their own beers plus three guest taps. They had a lager, red, brown, and ginger beer as their four beers on tap. I went ahead and ordered the flight and tried them all. The lager was so-so. Pretty much their most comparable to a Bud for the less adventurous type. The red was decent but tasted like it was missing something. The brown was excellent and had a great roasted flavor, that is the beer that stood out to me. Last was the ginger beer, which I thought was kind of weird to have on a flight. It was OK for what it was but not my thing. I'm not sure if that is a regular brew but if it is I wonder if they will add vodka behind the bar and start serving their own Moscow Mules. Prices were comparable to any other brewery/taproom around here. They also have growlers and half growlers available as well as some T-shirts and other merchandise.  Firetrucker is another great addition to the craft brew scene here in the Des Moines area. If not from Ankeny I would recommend taking the drive up to check them out.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2014,8/15/2014,62,122,2,13,7>Tried out this new Indian place that just opened and I'm very glad I tried it out. For some reason, it seems like all the Indian restaurants are within 15 minutes within each other and it's wonderful for someone like me with an Indian food addiction who lives within the area. I was mainly interested in coming here for the Indo-Pakistani food. My group ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Spinach Paneer, Chicken Korma, Tandoori Naan, and a Mango Lassi. Was very pleased with all the food. As an Asian, I get annoyed when places are stingy with how much rice they can provide. Some other Indian restaurants I've been to aren't very generous with their rice offering at all. However, this place had plenty enough for my party of four! The food tasted a little different than what I'm used to which probably is due to its Indo-Pakistani influence (not that I'm an expert) I liked how even though I had dishes that are traditionally creamy, they had the right balance and wasn't overwhelmingly creamy. Chicken Tikka Masala and the Spinach Paneer were my favorites. The naan is very crispy in a way that reminded me of flatbread pizza. Personally, I like Naan a little softer but my party liked it. Overall service was great, and I'd be more than happy to support this place and keep going. I would definitely recommend this place!
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2014,8/14/2014,13,162,1,5,6>I came here for lunch on a weekday and was surprised at how busy they were, but took it as a good sign...My first impression was that the place was very clean and had interesting decorations - almost fluorescent paintings of animals on the wall, as well as some big screen tvs to watch.The service was also stellar - they were friendly, accommodating and my water glass was refilled many times.Now, for the food:I got a small #2 Pho (Rare Steak and Brisket).  It was plenty large and generous with the meat, yaye!  It didn't have cilantro in it, which I missed, nor did cilantro come with the plate of accompaniments.  It was served with Thai basil, the freshest bamboo shoots I've ever had (these babies popped in your mouth, so crisp and juicy), lemon wedges (which I've never seen before - usually served with lime, maybe they're saving money here, haha?) and jalapenos.  The pho broth wasn't the most flavorful I've had, but it was still yummy.  My son ordered the Rice with Grilled Beef plate and it was AMAZEFEST!  He devoured this with relish (not a common occurrence for a picky 6 year-old).  Small, thin strips of beef were arranged on the plate with a DELICIOUS marinated as well as grilled flavor, along with rice and homemade cuke/carrot/daikon pickles that were the bomb!  This place is popular for a reason - I saw young moms, businessmen in ties, and old ladies out for lunch.  The food is great, the service is awesome, and the the prices are reasonable.  I will be back!

From start to finish, Danielle was honest, accommodating, and attentive to our needs. She didn't push anything we didn't want; she just gave us what we wanted/needed and direction when we needed it. She helped us devise floral arrangements and decor for both our ceremony and reception that fit both our visions and our budget. The results were stunning--the flowers were perfect and we had so many compliments. Couldn't have been happier. We highly recommend Danielle if you're looking for gorgeous floral work/rental items.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2013,8/10/2014,1,1,2,7,3>I can't say enough good about Action Auto Body and its owner, Chad. I had bumper damage to my car an had been quoted $1200 at other places. Chad said he could do what the other places suggested, but suggested an alternative that ended up being $80. I returned with another issue and he fixed it for for free. It has been difficult for someone like me without any knowledge about cars to find a good body shop. Chad is honest, customer-service driven and clearly knows his trade. Action Auto Body will be my go-to body shop if I'm ever in the unfortunate position of needing such a service again.
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2010,8/9/2014,13,68,4,5,3>Outside: The exterior of the restaurant was very unassuming and plain as it is in a strip mall. There was an ornate wooden room divider in the window. They have free parking. Inside: The seating and tables were standard and the art and cultural items appear very similar to those in many other Asian restaurants.Menu: The menus each have a nice external touch of a swatch of cultural woven cloth. The selection included many items from both Thailand and Laos along with a few general Chinese food items such as Crab Rangoon. The prices seemed to be quite reasonable with an average cost below $10.Staff: Our waitress met us at the door and accompanied us through our cultural meal. When asked she made recommendations that turned out great. She came back often to check out our meal, our drinks and our overall satisfaction. When we were done and just talking she quickly removed any empty plates.Food: Everything appeared cooked fresh and arrived piping hot. From the appetizers to the main dishes, everything was great. We started with some Crab Rangoon which came out hot and served with the delicious sweet chili sauce that I love from Thailand. One big brand is "Mae Ploy" and it is like a sweet and sour sauce filled with dried pepper flakes and seeds which lends to a sweet and hot flavor mix that goes great with the Rangoon. The main dishes included Pad Thai, Oyster Beef and Angry Combination. The Pad Thai had a wonderful smokey flavor that was a great mix with the chicken and vegetables. The Oyster Beef was a bit like Mongolian Beef found at some Chinese places, but with a fresh, slightly sweeter flavor. Everyone loved this dish! The Angry Combination was a mix of beef, chicken and shrimp that along with the vegetables was doused in a wonderful hot sauce based on Thai chilis. On the first bite it was notably hot. After awhile the heat turned most to tears and the flavor seemed to wash out a bit in the heat. It seemed like this dish was better in small quantities or shared as it became too much of a good thing and the tongue only processed the chili over time.Drinks: Several people in our group ventured out and tried the Thai tea which came with milk or cream in it. Those who loved it enjoyed the flavor. Those who didn't like it found it to be either too "woody" or "tasting of sweet dirt."Overall: Everyone was very pleased with the food and service we experienced in the Nut Pob. From the sweet to the heat, the flavors were both known and new and a bit of Thailand became part of our world experience. Personally I'd say to avoid the tea unless you're sure you already like it, enjoy the "Angry" items in moderation, have the Crab Rangoon and ignore the basic outside and come in for a great time with friends, dining in the friendly service and great food of Thailand.
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2013,8/8/2014,3,2,2,2,2>Doesn't get much better than this if you want some excellent Vietnamese food!!  While this tiny place has your typically Asian decor which is a bit on the tacky side, they make up for atmosphere in excellent service. Our "waitress" - daughter of the owner, was a doll. She was quick, on top of drink refills (my personal pet peeve) and to top it off really was concerned that we enjoyed the food. Which boy did we, my fiancée, a Pho connoisseur, said this was some of the best he's ever had! The depth in flavor in the broth is no doubt achieved by their overnight process of steeping! The meat was perfection and noodles...delicious! The medium size bowl, which was more then filling is only $6.95! We will most certainly be back!!
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2014,8/7/2014,2,8,2,3,2>how many Thai restaurants have been in this building? I think I've lost count. I'm hoping this one doesn't meet the same fate as the others. For the last month I have been eating here a lot. Always ordering the Poki salad- a sushi salad with tuna, fresh mangoes and avocados, etc. I can't get enough of this salad. I dream about this salad. I would be devastated to not have access to this salad. One day when I called to order ahead, the woman didn't know what I was talking about at first, and panic set it.  Luckily, she figured it out. Service is always fast and friendly, though, I'm not sure all of their help is actually old enough to be working. Hope I'm wrong about this, as I don't want anything to hurt their chances of long term success.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,8/6/2014,140,1,2,2,4>As a resident in the neighborhood, I was really excited to try a blow out at a different spot. My hairstylist has been doing blow outs on my hair for quite a few years now and I absolutely love them. Their process was a bit different, with them blow drying some of my hair straight before using a round brush, but in the end I had just as much volume as I normally get and it lasted just about as many days. The staff is friendly, welcoming, and the glass of wine was a great way to end the day. I love having a blow dry bar just down the street for those last minute hair do's I just don't have time to schedule in advance or do myself. I will be returning often! Thanks to Kristin and her staff for bringing a great service to Des Moines!
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,8/5/2014,1,9,,2,2>Best burrito place around. Bandit has tons of options to customize your burrito. Five tortilla options, different flavors of sour cream, crushed tortilla chips to put in your burrito, and delicious guacamole that's free if you don't get meat. I like being given the option of a "slim" burrito. Get a smaller sized burrito for five bucks. Trust me, it's still enough food. I've heard great things about their breakfast burritos too- served until 10am.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,8/4/2014,18,21,1,,1>I discovered Funky Finds when I was looking for a new dresser. I was all set to drive to Minneapolis and pick one up from Ikea when I decided to check Craigslist one last time. There I found a gorgeous mid-century, solid walnut dresser for only slightly more than I was going to pay Ikea (gas money). It works great for me everyday and is much better made than anything I would have found. Each time I use it I'm so glad I didn't end up making the trip north. Well worth a trip.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2014,8/3/2014,25,12,3,1,2>The guys at the sushi bar let me order my weird white girl vegetarian sushi every time I come and only laugh at me a little. Boyfriend orders regular sushi though, and he says it's divine. Get the donburi with pork; that's the most authentic meat for the dish. Pro tip: Make friends with the manager and the guys behind the bar. They like to bestow sake bombs and random shots of Hennessy upon you whenever they feel like it.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2014,8/2/2014,55,60,2,5,4>I have a up-down relationship with Gateway. This was the original place we shopped for our groceries upon moving to DSM - it was the closest to our apartment and I'm vegan.The cafe is very finicky. When they are busy the portions get smaller and quality sometimes goes way down. We really enjoy our breakfasts most getting there with the early bird crowd when they open. The groceries are hardly a deal, most products you can buy at whole foods for 40% less than what they charge. Needless to say, I always return and I would say I'm happy 7/10ths of the time with my choice.(Great for groups)
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/20/2014,8/1/2014,51,69,1,7,5>Not in the least bit out of control pricey or pretentious as I was lead to believe! Now that I'm not as intimated by this restaurant, I will most definitely return!I went for an impromptu brunch on Easter Sunday and we were set up with a table within about three minutes. Hostess didn't give us that condescending, "you DON'T have reservations?!" bit that I was anticipating (or look at me weird for choosing flip flops, considering the holiday) and started us on a fun little dining experience. Boyfriend chose the savory Crepes Madames "French Ham & Cheese" which is, "Two crepes filled with Niman Ranch ham and Swiss cheese, topped with béchamel sauce and a fried egg." You know that envious feeling you get when you taste another person's food and yet you ordered something completely different? Yeah, he only let me have one bite. The bechamel pulled it all together; a rich dish overall, but oh-so-good. Perhaps its yumminess was accentuated by my choice of "Crepes Django [--] Five crepes topped with bourbon maple syrup, house cured bacon, toasted pecans, strawberries and whipped cream." Seriously, the sweet vs savory thing goes a long, long way. The pieces of bacon helped to carry me through the overarching sweetness of the dish... yes, I ate all five of those bad boys. I also appreciate and commented several times on the fact that it was a grown-up presentation; I was happy to not see a smiley face made out of whipped cream and/or the perfectly ripened strawberries that I eventually wolfed down.The coffee deserves a nod. (I'm doing something wrong at home I think; heresy for a coffee lover such as myself...) It perked me up right alongside the pleasant food stuff.Our waitress was on point as well. My only regret is not trying a Bloody Mary... next time!
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/7/2014,7/31/2014,7,8,2,2,2>Food has been hit and miss but mostly hits.  The service has been mostly misses though.  The servers all seem really lost or not well trained.  One time our server spent more time hanging out with her friends than keeping tabs on her tables.  The prices are really great thought so some times it's worth dealing with some lazy servers.  Decent and cheap place for a quick dinner.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,7/30/2014,3,14,2,2,2>Great variety of pizza that will keep you coming back to try a new combination!The décor is modern, especially for this small town.  The service is always prompt and they are accommodating when there are children in the group. This last time we had the 4 meat pizza, but you can't go wrong with any of them!
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,7/29/2014,13,16,2,2,3>It took me about a year but I've really come to appreciate China Place as my go-to place for serviceable Chinese fast-food.  I live just across the street and I hit this place frequently for lunch during the school year and get takeout at night a few times per month.The interior is a little sketchy and is not necessarily someplace you want to dine in at (I do it anyway), although if you do the wait staff is very attentive.  I was beholden to the Sesame Chicken for quite awhile and it was very good.  Recently I got brave and ordered the Mongolian Beef and that's my new default order.  It comes loaded with surprisingly tender chunks of beef and a huge amount of onions that are cooked so well you don't mind eating them all like a salad.  The sauce is also very tasty - nothing fancy but a very good dish for the price.And the prices are fantastic.  Lunch is around $6 and the portions are very large.  Dinner is around $8 and portions are even larger.  I really like that I can come here and get full without needing to purchase any extras.  I've never done delivery because I'm so close, but based on the number of times I see their delivery vehicle around the neighborhood it's clear to see it's the bulk of their business.China Place is exactly what it should be - quick, tasty, and cheap.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/15/2014,7/28/2014,7,2,2,2,3>I love Cosi! It's our go to restaurant when we are able to get a sitter. The service is always fantastic. We do usually call ahead and make reservations. We love to start out with the garlic appetizer, which is spectacular! I love the pesto pasta with chicken, the mozzarella salad, the pizza is fabulous! My husband loves the chicken calzone and the ziti cucina. The staff never steers us wrong when recommending drinks and dessert. I will keep coming back!
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,7/27/2014,161,81,4,6,7>Ok I have come back here to try more. On my way out I noticed these interesting little coffee cups. I asked them what it was they told me it's like a French press coffee and that I should try it next time. I did exactly that and so glad I did.They asked if they could show me how to drink it. I must have had a completely puzzled look at what to do. They didn't make me feel like an idiot for not knowing and politely showed me what to do. The coffee is poured over condense milk. You stir it and then pour it over ice. Really great robust coffee.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2014,7/26/2014,41,129,2,5,5>Have to update just to tell you how addicted I am to The Cafe. It's ridiculously close to my office, so going here for lunch is just too easy. So far, I recommend the following, but stay tuned as my waistline and this list grows:1. Veggie deli sandwich - INCREDIBLE. Best vegetarian sandwich I have EVER had. The ciabatta is perfection, the hummus isn't too overpowering or rich, and the vegetables are simply amazing. Roasted tomatoes are plump and juicy, asparagus is SO awesome, and the portabella just makes it.2. Turkey cherry deli sandwich - also pretty fantastic. I got it on sourdough, which may not have been the best choice since the cherries leaked through the dough, but it does allow me to tell you how GREAT the sourdough is!3. Soups - asparagus bisque and tomato basil are both good. Not the best soup I've had, (was hoping for more substance to the asparagus, but it was very nicely pureed) but they were still good. I'd definitely go with a sandwich or salad over the soup, but you really can't be sad you got it, either.Haven't dared to delve into the desserts or entrees yet, but like I said, stay tuned for my next jump in pant size.

<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,7/24/2014,23,123,2,3,4>After trying and failing on a paleo diet, I googled "laos food" last night.  This was the first result I got.  I thought it was worth a try when I saw all the five star reviews on Yelp for Sam's.  Y'all found an absolute gem.  Service is very friendly, including the crazy and funny counter guy, which I think is Sam's dad.  Huge portions and absolutely delicious.  The egg rolls have glass noodles in them--these might be the first ones in Des Moines I've had that contain glass noodles.  Instead of the "traditional" red sweet-and-sour sauce, a large bottle of hot mustard and a very light-colored dipping sauce accompany them.  I ordered the Angry Beef and was told that they would add "more spice" if I wanted.  After it was served, I decided it was nearly the perfect amount of hot, though I considered adding extra.  Entrees come with a choice of soup--I had the hot and sour soup which was some of the best I've had.  Pronounced flavors while leaving the basics of Hot and Sour soup in.  Only down note is I did my math incorrectly when computing the tip.  I'll add extra next time.  As Bill and others have mentioned, the restaurant is tiny, I think I counted four tables.  Brisk takeout business.  They mentioned their limited delivery area-- I think it spans to downtown, but doesn't go any further than SE14th to the east or 42nd St. to the west unless its a large party.  Also as others mentioned, there's only about 45 items on the menu; not the 100+ you see at other places.  I can only assume its for the reason others have alluded to--they do these items right.  I had been going to a place up the street from me because it was pretty good and nearby.  I have to say that Sam's will like replace that place, even though its about 15-20 minutes away.

<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/9/2014,7/21/2014,1,11,1,3,3>I've used Two Men and a Truck twice and I would hire them again. The first time they moved me from an apartment in Des Moines to an apartment in Ames, & the second time was from and to apartments in Des Moines. Both times the total cost was within the estimate they provided. If your budget can afford it, movers are a huge help with moving (shocking, I know).The bulk of my stuff is heavy boxes of books & music. I don't have nice furniture, so I wasn't too concerned about how that stuff was treated during the move. Since moving might damage stuff no matter how careful you are, I moved my most fragile/pricey/treasured stuff by myself (guitars, art, TV, computer, etc). That way if that stuff was damaged I had my own darn self to blame. I'm really glad I rented some of their wardrobe boxes for clothes. That made packing & moving clothes super fast & easy. Their pace was a little slow here and there, but overall both moves went about as fast as I expected. The office staff was helpful over the phone arranging the move & answering my questions.

Looked pretty interesting and fun from the outside -- I love trying a new place. It has a patio, and I will always pick a patio option on a nice night, over an indoor spot. It's small on the inside, tv's, Fleetwood Mac on the playlist, some high-top tables, and bar. The lights are pretty bright (indoors and out), and I think they could remove a few more bulbs to turn up the ambiance. Will be back.

<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2014,7/9/2014,33,56,4,3,5>This was a hole in the wall location that I've  been looking forward to going to since I saw Adam Richman take his trip down here on one of his Man vs Food episodes.To start, the decor was very unique, and I liked the casual atmosphere. I felt that it supplemented their menu selections really well.The group of us ordered an appetizer of bacon wrapped tater tots and bacon wrapped smokies. We all thought they were magnificent. I personally thought the bacon wrapped tater tot elements came together well: the jalapeño gave it a good kick; the cheese added a nice flavor, and the bacon of course added the bacon goodness. The bacon wrapped smokies were good, but they weren't quite as good as the tots, and it seemed the bacon was a bit burnt.As for the entree, the Broasted chicken lived up to its name: it was juicy, had great flavor, and was everything you'd expect out of fried chicken with that extra tenderness.The sides were also pretty good but nothing spectacular. The mashed potatoes were a little cold when they arrived, but the flavor of the gravy was solid, nonetheless. The macaroni wasn't anything spectacular. The roll was very delicious; it came out warm and really had a nice smooth, and airy soft texture.The service was fine. Nothing was bad about it, but it wasn't anything crazy.Overall, I'd say the main special they offer here, the Broasted chicken, deserved a 5 star rating for sure. However, the sides didn't quite live up, and the bacon wrapped tater tots may have been a bit overpriced. They were incredible, but not quite worth a dollar per tot. The Broasted chicken was reasonably priced. It's worth a trip for the chicken, and it's an experience to at least try the bacon wrapped tater tots, as Adam Richman found them to be heavenly (watch the episode to see for yourself!).

Along with what I would call some signature cocktails such as the Moscow Mule, Tom Collins, Singapore sling and many others. We decided to stick with beer. For the food we started off with the roasted artichoke hearts. They were perfect. I ordered the Tiki Burger and my other half had the red snapper. I will only speak for the burger at this point as it was AMAZING!! nice juicy burger cooked to my liking with a grilled slice of pineapple with a sweet glaze covering it all. Along with that some Parmesan covered french fries! The place is pretty cool. Large bar area. Vintage floors along with ceiling reminisce of the old car show room the building used to be. Now this is my first visit as the restaurant has not been open that long but first impressions were pretty good and am already looking forward to bringing my friends back with me!

This has been one of my favorite restaurants for many years and even though I don't live in Lincoln anymore, I try to visit it whenever I am in town (or even just passing through).
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,6/30/2014,12,9,,2,2>Earl's Tire blew me away with their service and facility.  One of my tires fell victim to a pothole and decided to run it over to Earl's. I was met by Earl and Jason. Super friendly and no BS. Looked at my tire immediately and did a test to see if it could be saved. The employees take pride in their work...which usually means the owner takes care of his staff (which is why I choose local businesses as much as possible). Jason went through my options clearly and happily answered my questions. The tire was fixed quickly for a fair price. From the outside, Earl's looks like you neighborhood "mom and pop" auto repair place. The inside was simply amazing, with televisions, pool table, booth and sitting area.  They care about the comfort of their customers as they wait.  I especially liked their shop cat, Ms. Flo 2.  I pet her as I waiting and watched the news.  Also, they had 100+ rims on display...which looked really cool.  Not at all what I was expecting.  There wasn't a single negative thing about this place. I will be back!  Thanks!

I feel like I enter a different world and for the time that I am there I can truly relax and enjoy myself. Everyone on the staff is friendly, professional, and extremely accommodating. Cassie Sampson, the owner, creates an environment that is truly about the customer while providing a team atmosphere for her employees. She believes in using products that are more organic and treatments that are holistic. Whether I go there for a relaxing treatment or to work out a kink, the staff listens and genuinely wants to meet my expectations and provide the outcome I am looking for. I appreciate the work that the team does to constantly look for ways to improve and expand services, product lines, and their skills. I highly recommend East Village Day Spa to anyone looking for a comfortable and enjoyable spa experience.

<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/27/2014,6/27/2014,110,444,6,12,7>I love carbs.  Blue Tomato serves carbs in many styles---pizza, pasta, desserts, bread, booze....I started with a glass of sparkling rose, which came in its own little single serve bottle.  Super fancy style!  I shared an antipasto plate with my fellow dining companions, which included tapenade, bread, pickled veggies, fresh mozzarella & prosciutto.  And then I devoured a bowl of carbonara.  Don't be afraid of the raw egg yolk hanging out on top of the pasta---swirl it in and enjoy the richness.  I snagged a few bites of the chocolate cake with chocolate fudge frosting & also some lemon ricotta cheesecake with cherry compote.    You must try them both---they were equally delightful.  It's a small restaurant, so you may want to make a reservation, especially on the weekend.  You don't want to miss out on any delicious carb consumption!

Great company (as always) and a fantastic sampling of Noodles and Co. spring menu - all made with (largely) locally sourced fresh ingredients, in a kitchen free of microwaves, deep fryers, and freezers. BBQ chicken corn salad was excellent (fresh and tangy), Japanese pan noodles (nice firm tofu and a just a hint of spice/burn at the end)... oh, and Iowa brewery options.Thanks to Noodle's Pete and Tom, and YELP's Patrick.
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/10/2014,6/25/2014,57,271,,3,3>My mom and I were looking for a fun place to have lunch when she mentioned she'd never been to the botanical gardens. I hadn't been there in years, so I suggested lunch at Trellis, followed by a little walk around the gardens. What a fun way to spend an hour or two!The Trellis space is just off to the left when you enter the gardens. It's a visually appealing space with plenty of seating and a lovely long bar with comfortable-looking "armchair" barstools. (Trellis has a nice beer and wine selection, if you're drinking your lunch.) There were lots of people enjoying a late lunch when we arrived, but we were seated right away. The menu is fairly limited - just a few choices in sandwiches, salads, pastas along with a kids' menu - but I still had a hard time deciding. Everything sounded so fresh and vibrant. I ended up ordering a half tarragon egg salad sandwich and a caprese salad loaded with strawberries, fresh mozzarella, pistachio pesto, tomatoes... You name it, it was on this salad. In fact, it was maybe a little unfocused for me with the abundance of ingredients - however, my mom declared it the very best salad she'd had in a long time, so I was probably just being picky. The desserts really looked lovely, but I'll save that for another visit. Of course, the best part about eating at Trellis is getting to walk around the botanical gardens afterward. I'd forgotten what a gem the gardens are - and I can't wait to see the results of the current renovation project! Trellis has very limited hours which means I probably won't be back anytime soon, but that's no reflection on them! I'm crossing my fingers that the renovations combined with the restaurant's popularity will lead to expanded hours in the future. Trellis would be an amazing spot for happy hour. Here's hoping!!
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2014,6/24/2014,292,547,3,8,3>Food court surprise, this is a real nice place for Pho. I agree with the others reviewers here that you don't usually find a place like this in mall food courts but they are one of the best that I have had and how awesome is it that we can get pho in a mall? They have great rich broth and several choices for style of pho as well. While it may be in a mall, they do not skip on anything here that you would get from any other pho restaurant. Very delicious pho!!Had an egg roll with sweet and sour sauce, which was yummy as well. Gotta get a nice side with my bowl of pho, just how I roll. If you love pho this is a must try, they also have a few other Vietnamese dishes if you want to try them. This will be one of my new spots in town!!!!
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,6/23/2014,29,74,,7,2>If Cheers took place in a coffee shop instead of a bar, then it would have been set here. I have never had anything here, food or drink, that I didn't absolutely love. I am definitely going to be making more regular stops here.This truly is a community place. All of the employees are super nice and very helpful. Their hot chocolate is one of the best that I have ever had. They also have pretty amazing smoothies - sooooo good. In my opinion, Ingersoll is pretty dead. Zanzibar's is one of the few places keeping it alive.
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2014,6/22/2014,7,7,,2,1>We tried this for dinner tonight and the food was very good and only one friendly server who had to take care of everyone. Even with one server the food and drinks came to us fast! I hope this restaurant stays open and more people come out and give it a try. Also the maragrtia's were Yummy! In a other review someone said there was no kid menu,  this is not true they do have kids menu with variety to choose from. Give this place a try.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2014,6/21/2014,6,25,,3,2>This is a lake we come to often as grays is to busy. We usually go to the side by the beach as it's always busy on the side by the bridge. Today we went to see the bridge and noticed the new path. To my surprise it takes you back up to the back side of the lake and then the opposite way if you stay on the path is a whole new area. It's so nice. There's a cute little bridge to walk over now, plenty of benches and picnic tables. There's a ton of geese you can sit and watch. This has always been a favorite lake of mine and now it's number one. I sat out there and walked around for 5 hours today. It's very nice and clean.. For now. My only complaint is to update the bathrooms. It's basically an outhouse inside of a shelter. There isn't even a door on the stall. Otherwise this lake is pretty awesome. I like to come here and watch sunsets and seen a lot of fish in the water. The path is awesome, nice to walk on. Easter lake is where it's at!

<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,6/19/2014,19,16,,2,1>Two and half years ago, I saw someone's wedding pictures on Facebook and was  impressed with her wedding make up So I asked who did it and she advised it was Danielle from Beauty of all Faces. I had been on the hunt for a makeup professional for months,  who did air brush make up and understood the difference between photo makeup and everyday make up and I found that person in Danielle. I had her do my make up for my engagement photos and wedding and she did a wonderful job! Ever since then any special occasion I have she is the one that does my make up. My latest visit was for birthday make up and it turned out beautifully. So if you are looking for someone talented and professional, it's Danielle!
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/10/2013,6/18/2014,10,44,,1,>I'm not an expert at Mediterranean /Indian food but I thought the food was pretty good. I got the regular Gyro and my brother got the Tandoori chicken Kabab and a side of season fries. Both dishes were really good tastes fresh and flavorful. The kabab was a little too tomato-y for my taste but I guess it's suppose to be like that. The flat bread was toasted very nicely and wasn't too soggy even when the juices were going into it. Season fries were very good and crispy. The owner (I think) was very nice and kept good attention to us. I'll be going there again somtime.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2012,6/17/2014,0,16,,2,>Horrible atmosphere but amazing food! Seating is cramped and awkward. But food definitely makes up for it. Busy and well known for a reason. Recommend the softshell taco and dessert chips (think giant cinnamon toast crunch). Ten dollars will feed two people to the brim.

<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/4/2013,6/14/2014,36,136,,3,1>Free breakfast + free alcohol in the evenings? Awesome.Would I choose to pay $200+ to stay there? Probably not. The rooms are large and very well laid-out, with separate bedrooms and living room areas. The rooms also include a fridge and microwave.I stayed here for a week while being relocated for my fiancé's career. I really enjoyed staying at this hotel, it has some nice shops and restaurants within walking distance, and the hotel has a great atmosphere.I had my 2 little dogs with me, and even though the hotel is not necessarily dog friendly, they were very accommodating to the dogs and made an exception to allow us to have them there. Of course they are very well behaved and potty trained...I would never bring a dog not potty trained into a hotel that nice!My gripes:-the hot tub/pool have WAY too much chlorine. Like, it burns your eyes just walking in to the pool area. Awful.-The appetizers they offer during the "happy hour" are strange...chips and assorted dips (every day), but the chips dont always match the dips. Like Doritos, oyster crackers, hummus and salsa.-The internet is $10 PER COMPUTER, per day. That is ridiculous! It's Des Moines, for crying out loud. If someone is paying over $200 for a room, they should have internet included. I'd take free internet over the free booze every night.-Parking is between $8-$15 per car per day. Again, it's Des Moines. I can understand charging that much for parking in Chicago or Minneapolis, but it's Iowa. Guests of the hotel should get at least 1 car parked for free during their stay.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/20/2014,6/13/2014,59,46,,3,2>Great location, quaint historic charm, clean and comfortable accommodations. The staff was friendly and welcoming. We got a great deal on this hotel through Marriott's website so I'd have to say this hotel can be a great value. The lobby had a sewer smell but I think this was from the street construction outside because both my guest room upstairs and the basement smelled fine. The bed & pillows were super comfy. It's a well kept secret that there is a pool, hot tub, & work out facility in the basement. The gym has an unusual layout and I couldn't get CNN to work on my elliptical's TV screen so I ended up watching the main TV through the wall mirror. It actually worked out OK. My only complaint was the fitness center was pretty warm and even though I was the only one in there I couldn't find a thermostat to turn the temperature down. All and all, a well-maintained, clean, charming, well located hotel. I will be back.
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/6/2014,6/12/2014,16,120,,4,3>I like beer...Actually I really like beer...Let me say this again, I LOVE BEER!  This is why I like, I mean, I love 515 Brewing Co.  They make a lot of different styles, kinds and variations of beers that all seem to make me happy.  On our latest outing to their small but welcoming tap house they had 8 of their own brews on tap (the most I have seen since they opened last year).  Here is my report in full beer lover form:We ordered a sampler of all 8 beers they had on tap.  First we started with one of their newest offering the Cooter Ray IPA.  This IPA poured golden to amber in color and had distinct citrus-grapefruit aroma.  The grapefruit was present from start to finish and well into the aftertaste. Good beer and I could drink this one all night.Next on the board was the OJ IPA.  So this has been the beer that has eluded me all year.  Every time we stopped in to 515, they had either just ran out of this beer or it was going to be available in a couple days.  This was worth the wait!  Beautiful IPA with lots of citrus flavors and smells.  It finished clean with no aftertastes and left you wanting more.  This is their second best IPA offering.Third we sampled the Mexican Spring, an American wheat beer with agave and lime.  This was my wife's favorite beer of the afternoon.  Nicely done wheat beer base with just slight hints of agave and lime.  A very refreshing beer that I could drink on a hot day at the beach.Up next is the D.A.R.T. Dodger IPA which is a full assault of west coast hops and in my opinion is the best IPA that 515 makes.  The color is amber and the aroma is all centennial hops.  The taste is citrus and dank with a little biscuit malt.  Finishes smooth to round out this high quality beer.Halfway through our beer journey, but ends they IPA portion with Hopititis-C.  Compared to the other IPAs we have had this one was a little lacking in flavor.  Good presence of bitter flavor yet smooth mouthfeel.  The finish left a slight aftertaste and slowed me from taking another quick drink.To start the second half of our 8 beer flight we have the Belgian Mistress.  This Belgian tripel was awesome!  maybe it is because it is so different from the IPAs we started with but the Belgian funky yeast that left a slight banana ester matched with this subtle sweet base was great.  Next we sampled the Castaway Porter which was a coconut porter by their definition.  I, on the other hand, thought it was a good porter but completely missed the coconut.  I smelled, tasted and repeated numerous times searching for the coconut and never really found it.  Other than that it has nice coffee flavor with a deep dark brown color.Lastly we tried their Vanilla Stout dubbed Sweater Weather.  I really enjoyed this brew, lots of chocolate, vanilla and coffee flavors in a easy drinking stout.  When winter (or sweater weather) rolls back around I will put this in heavy rotation in the beer fridge.I would recommend 515 Brewing Co to anyone looking for some great local brews!  Cheers!
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/8/2014,6/11/2014,173,148,,4,3>SHUCKS! I thought they were opening a scooter shop and scooters were back in style. It's actually just a coffee shop. You're lucky i'm a fan of a piping hot good 'ol cup o joe!Scooter's is in place of the previously opened Starbucks. Honestly, when Starbucks was there, I only went once. They brew Starbucks on campus already, plus, I'm not too much of a fan of the coffee I've had at Starbucks. I was looking forward to this change.The service is not too shabby, the staff is friendly, and the coffee is not bad. Better than Starbucks at least. Another thing I appreciate is that they brew fresh coffee every 4 hours. I got the chance to chat with the manager and the owner for a bit. Apparently, their fruit smoothies are made of real fruit & creamer... probably dairy :(Although they are just starting up, I've noticed a few improvements that could be made. First of all, the menu isn't complete. They offer a lot of different types of neat teas, but that's not even on the menu (I would recommend mango something tea btw!). Next, all their pastries don't have names or prices. I would appreciate some allergy information which I believe is extremely important. Another comment I would make is, although this is my problem with all the coffee shops in DSM i've been to, they don't offer almond milk for those who are lactose intolerant and don't drink soy.Unfortunately, I can't comment on their other drinks because I only got the chance to try their black coffee and 1 type of tea.The prices of their drinks are quite comparable to other coffee shops.I'm looking forward to the growth of this coffee shop and writing a more updated review on that.
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,6/10/2014,86,27,,6,3>Very accommodating. They will make you a vegan breakfast burrito for brunch if you ask them. It's not on the menu, but it is delicious - potatoes, vegan chorizo, peppers, lettuce, sauce and a tasty tortilla.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/3/2014,6/9/2014,4,14,,3,3>This place is absolutely delicious. If you're looking for the next best thing to home made pupusas, this is your best bet! Everything I've ever had has been wonderful. It is a family owned restaurant and is very small. Don't expect any commercial style service or decor because that is not what you will get. The prices are VERY cheap!! But you will make up for what you don't pay in time, once you place your order don't be surprised if it takes 30-45 minutes to get your food. Not sure why it takes so long to make pupusas, maybe they have to kill the pig first?
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,6/8/2014,18,3,,2,2>The dipping sauce that comes with the sticky rice, as well as the Asian beef jerky, are two of the best things I've ever tasted! It reminds me of the authentic flavors my Asian grandma used to buy. The service never disappoints and the food is never ordinary. The space is new, clean and bright. Great place for a quick lunch or a dinner date!
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,6/7/2014,62,18,,2,1>Another great addition to the downtown sushi restaurants. Different from my favorite, but equally as good. Great atmosphere, staff, and overall delivery of customer service. They might be the top of the chain for me in Des Moines. I have a regular of salmon and tuna sashimi with a Philly roll and miso soup. The food is incredibly consistent from the quality of the fish to the consistency of the soup. They also have great bento options for lunch whose simple presentation and construction offset the large menu of well executed specialty rolls. There's also a full bar with a number of creative Martinique. A solid recommendation for anyone downtown DSM looking for for sushi.
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/24/2014,6/6/2014,0,1,2,15,2>The food and service at Paradise Biryani Pointe is fantastic. I have been there 4 times since they have opened and have had take-out two additional times. The chicken biryani is very good, and the chicken chettinadu is great. I am also a big fan of the chicken tikka masala and the paneer korma. This is also the first restaurant I have been to in the US where I have been able to get chicken 65. I just wish they offered prawns 65. I do not fault them for their service since they are first just starting out. I have always had a positive attitude from everyone in there. This place definitely beats out all the other Indian restaurants in DSM, and I will continue to go back.
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,6/5/2014,14,3,,3,3>Amazing store! The floral arrangements can vary from traditional arrangements to fun trendy bouquets depending on what you ask for! I love shopping at the store too, it feels like the best of etsy- local artist works ranging from taffy to knit goods and everything in between. Such a gem!
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/21/2014,6/4/2014,4,106,1,4,1>Stopped by to check out the old Pho K&K.  It's under new management hence the new naming.  Here's the good:1.  Pho is good as usual, no deviation there the only spot in Ankeny to get good pho.2.  Lots of variety on the menu, they have some Thai dishes and some Korean dishes which are very good (try their combo plates)3.  Overall they are very reasonably priced.The bad:1.  Do not come in here if you are a large party.  We arrived at around 8 on a Friday night, there was a group of about 16 people eating their dinner at one table.  Our party was a party of 8.  We ended up waiting 45 minutes for our food.Overall its a decent pho joint with some nice variety.  I like how their menu has some nice pictures that show the different dishes and has the pictures numbers in line with the menu so you know what to order.  Don't come here if you have plans after dinner, you will be late.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,6/3/2014,14,39,,5,4>This is a lovely little establishment in Ames! From the delicious confections they make for you, to the retro diner feel, this place is a must see when visiting Ames a wondering down Main Street. Not only do they offer delicious cupcakes, but they also have a small lunch menu and beverages like coffee or sodas in glass bottles. I love stopping in here for a quick treat and am always quite fond of their gourmet flavors like, key lime pie or mexican hot chocolate!
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,6/2/2014,76,529,3,8,5>I heard from a couple of people that this place had good sandwiches, but I never believed a simple place like that could produce tasty sandwiches. I finally decided to check it out after reading so much about it and finding out it was featured on Andrew Zimmerman's show.Walking in makes you wonder if you are in the right place, it's like a convenience store with a meat counter in the back. Walk towards the meat counter and be greeted with the menu of sandwiches and other food items they offer. I got thee Dad's Killer because it was the most popular. They asked if I wanted it hot, I decided to go with hot to see how it would be. The sandwich was not as big as I thought it was going to be, but it was good! There was a ton of flavor in every bite, the meats, sauces, and veggies combined very well. The price is pretty good, not much more than a sandwich shop. There is no place to sit and eat here, eat it in your car like I did or take it home. I cannot wait to come back and try all the other awesome sandwiches!Edit: I was informed there is a small seating area inside!!!
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2014,6/1/2014,27,96,,6,1>We went to try the sushi but quickly realized this is my new go to restaurant in Des Moines for Pad Thai! Had it at a level 3 with chicken and it got eight thumbs up from all of us at the table. 4 of us also split the Avocado Crab Rangoon, another 8 thumbs up. Did a bowl of the shrimp lemon grass coconut soup. Two if us didn't care for it, two did. To me it tasted like a soapy lemon cleaner...yuck. Now, back to the sushi. We had 4 rolls Dragon, Blu, Mafia and Under The Sea. All 4 were good but nothing great that will draw me back for it. Rest assured I will be back again for the Pad Thai as for the sushi I would suggest Wasabi Chi, Hoshi, Haiku or Sakari.

They rave about the cleanliness and the way the employees keep everyone safe and on task. My niece is 6 and quite petite so they appreciate the rules that keep the big kids and adults away from the smaller kids. When it isn't busy, they let her play in the large area and as older kids come in they direct them to the other half of the court. If it gets busy, then they move the young kids to a different play area altogether. The price is quite reasonable and they have a lot of fun events for people of all ages. I have stopped in a few times and they seem to really have their act together. I imagine it is quite hard to keep order in this environment especially when you have people twice your age trying to do what they want to do so I commend the staff for all they do!
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/24/2009,5/26/2014,86,391,2,4,2>I'm confident in saying that the West Street Deli is home to Cyclone Country's best sandwiches.  I've heard good things about the built-to-order and specialty dagwoods, but I've never been able to stray from their daily specials that are prominently featured as you walk in to order.  Their daily concoctions are always very odd at first glance, but are works of gastronomical art.  They fuse right brain sensibility with left brain whimsy to create one of a kind sandwiches.   If I was to make a request to the warden for my final meal, their Sweet Potato Curry soup would be included.Sandwiches are hefty and pressed on a panini grill.  I don't have a single complaint other than the long lines and wait times every time I go.  People around here know a good thing.
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2012,5/25/2014,62,122,,3,3>Delicious coffee, tea, and food! Great local cafe and location. I go here at least twice a month and it's one of my favorite places in Ames! When I'm making plans with a friend, this is a popular choice. It's in campustown and relatively close to campus. It's also refreshing to go to a local place like this instead of a big chain. It's a hip and trendy cafe for a small city like Ames. The menu here is awesome! All tea selections are great. They provide you tea strainers and put the loose leaf tea in it for you so you can pour hot water over it.  Coffee drinks are good as well. What I adore most if the FOOD!  My favorites are the tomato basil bisque soup, all the crepes, and grilled cheese sandwich! All sandwiches comes with a choice of salad, pasta salad, or fruit. This is a great spot for any occasion-- a date,  studying, brunch, breakfast, etc. It's also the cafe that's open the latest, which is a major bonus for college students that want to stay out late.  My major complaint is the absence of power outlets! I understand that eliminating power outlets is supposed to encourage a more socially friendly and bonding environment, but it's hard to use a laptop to study sometimes. Overall, i highly recommend this cute cafe!

I've never been a big sushi fan, mainly because there hasn't been much in the middle of the midwest. The couple of other places I've been the sushi was...ok...but I thought it just wasn't for me.Miyabi 9 changed all that! It is fresh and served beautifully. I now consider myself a sushi fan. The prices are fairly decent too, considering the quality you get. Last time there I had the edamame and the spicy tuna roll, both for around $11 with tip.The location in the east village is perfect. Caution: it's a small place, so get there early or call ahead if you have a large group.

We really enjoyed the experience and purchased a membership for our family. The zoo is small but very well maintained and it seems like they work hard to make it a very enjoyable experience for all age groups. The membership was reasonable ($99) and in 2 trips has almost paid for itself. We're excited to frequent the zoo over the next year!
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2006,5/22/2014,23,45,6,5,2>I once bought two zebra finch at the Botanical Center bird show.  Those two birds turned into 20 birds.  Do you know how hard it is to get rid of 20 twittering zebra finch???Seriously though, the Botanical Center is a fantastic way to spend a Saturday afternoon.  I have always loved coming here to smell the earthy, green aroma of dirt and exotic plants.  Watching the birds that fly freely in the dome is a lot of fun but don't wear your Sunday finest because you may be "blessed" by the little beauties as they fly overheard.

<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,5/20/2014,0,2,,5,3>WOW!  My experience with Malo began outside...what a unique space with an impressive patio.  Once inside, guests are treated to a very contemporary and classy atmosphere - the multi-colored celing tiles, luchador painting and colorful chandeliers being amoung my favorite touches.  We visited Malo for brunch, and started with the homemade chips and salsa - YUM!  Chips were thin and crispy, salsa was flavorful and fresh.  The brunch buffett consisted of an assortment of delights - some of my favorites being the fresh fruit (very elegantly displayed), a full taco bar, custom burrito station, and of course, chicken and waffles.  This must be tried to be believed - it's that good. Chef Stroud isn't new to Des Moines, but I think he hits it out of the park with Malo.  I would highly recommend for anyone looking for some great food with a latin flair and a fun atmosphere.P.S. You simply must try the pineapple mojito.  YUM!
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/27/2013,5/19/2014,2,11,,6,2>If you have kids, this is a really great place to go with them. The exhibits are engaging, interactive, and a lot of fun! They educate kids and easily entertained adults and disguise it as fun! I love visiting here with my little brother and with friends who have kids, because it's fun to watch the little ones learn and problem solve! Highly recommended for families with kids! 5 stars for families with kids.If you are an adult with no kids of your own, as I am, it can be a different experience though. The main exhibits are geared towards children so of there's no special exhibit, or you aren't quite so fascinated by the exhibit, there's not much else there for you. The IMAX theater is great, but I get motion sick and it's a wrap around IMAX, so after about 15 minutes I'm not feeling so great. It's still a fun place to go every once in a while, but wait until they have a cool exhibit. 3 stars for adults with no kids. Thy didn't quite plan for us I think. Overall: very clean, well managed, good gift shop, good cafe, polite and knowledgable employees, a bit expensive though. Averaging for families with kids and families without is how I got my 4 star rating.
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,5/18/2014,55,60,3,5,5>I told myself I wouldn't review a place after just going there once but this place is too amazing to not have formed a solid opinion on after one visit.I found it on YELP yesterday and we decided to go there for lunch and wow. WOW. It's a mixture of Thai and Lao food and it's amazing.I had the Vegetable Delight with tofu and we ordered a few pots of hot tea. The spice levels are accurate. 3+ gets pretty crazy it seems like.The veggie delight had a nice array of vegetables in it that I wasn't necessarily expecting (zucchini!?) and the thai curry had broccoli in all the types also, which sounds amazing.The parking lot is fairly large so that helps and they have tables set up already for larger groups. The staff is quick to refill drinks and bring out to-go containers. Also they were quick to wipe down tables and we were there almost til their 2:30 closing time on Saturday and they didn't rush us to leave at all.I am excited to go back.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/1/2014,5/17/2014,51,69,2,6,4>Walking in I felt a bit self-conscious in my scrubs; the atmosphere seems to call for fancier attire (most of the other guests were all doodled up for midweek lunch? Perhaps they don't have jobs/school.) After the initial awkward feeling everything was great. Our server, Josh/John (I really need to work on remembering names) made the meal even more enjoyable. Him being in a tshirt made me feel more comfortable. Great sense of humor and left us alone as appropriate. Pesto chicken flatbread came out and I thought, "I won't be able to eat all that," but it was so darn good I finished it. No regrets! My friend had the margarita flatbread and confessed the same sentiments at the end. I don't know how lavosh is supposed to be, so I can't really judge it; this serves as the base for the flatbread and is light/crispy so you don't feel all weighed down (or guilty) ...Why I decided to take a pregnant lady to a place with "wine" in the name-- I'm not sure. But I will most definitely be returning for a happy hour where aforementioned flatbreads are $5. Can't wait to try to the wine.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/24/2014,5/16/2014,161,81,,5,3>Changing review to 4 stars. After seeing my review raygun contacted me and let me know their return policy:"But as our return policy states, if your shirt shrinks or gets ruined somehow, you can always bring it in and exchange it for a new one"That's a great return policy for a clothing store. I'm still not a fan of American apparel tshirts. The shirts at raygun are to clever not to buy. Plus with the message they showed great customer service and that they aim to please! Why not 5 star I'm just still not a fan of American apparel. Any other time I won't buy shirts printed in them they seem not to fit guys with broader shoulders very well. That's just me though.

Place is a bit small and there is usually a wait on the weekends for breakfast but once you're in and seated you won't regret your decision. Make sure to bring cash or a check however since they do not accept credit/debit cards of any kind.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2012,5/11/2014,34,2,,8,3>In the back of this foreign-foods grocery store is an amazing little restaurant.The food is awesome.If you don't know what to order, just ask Ahmad for "food" and let him surprise you. It's hard to go wrong here. The atmosphere is very familial with his whole family running around, including his precious little girl who is simply adorable.The setting and ambiance are reminiscent of a small delicatessen. There is absolutely nothing fancy about the decor, definitely not a date-worthy venue, but a great place to sit down with a group of friends and have great food.

<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2013,5/9/2014,2,9,,3,2>I'm not much of a "recreational shopper" but Jax might be the exception to the rule.  Great selection in clothing and gear you can't find anywhere else in town. The type of gear that makes you daydream of exotic, outdoorsy vacations. Anyway, along with adventurous aspirations, you'll find solid quality.  It does cost a bit more, but it will stand the test of time.Even better is the customer service. They don't overwhelm you but when you need them they are accessible and knowledgeable. I once purchased a shirt that didn't perform to my expectations - admittedly it was partly my own fault. Assuming that I had ruined the item, I contacted Jax to ask for tips to remedy the situation.  They convinced me to bring it in and became my personal advocate in replacing the item, including placing a special order.  I totally didn't expect that. How many stores would try to convince you to return something?  But their extra effort and expense was worth it to keep a loyal customer.It worked and I'll keep going back.
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,5/8/2014,5,18,,6,4>This is one of those places you come and never want to leave. Beer after beer, plate after plate.... My experience here was much more enjoyable on a Wednesday afternoon than a Saturday night simply because of the weekend crowds, but the service is always knowledgeable, prompt and friendly and the beer selection and menu are extensive. The food is amazing; there's not a bad choice on the menu but the BBQ chicken is tender, juicy, excellently seasoned and highly recommended. The staff is super nice and genuinely cares about your experience, not just their tips. Long story short? Just go. Often.
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/9/2014,5/7/2014,51,352,5,6,2>Update! Ed F. has informed me there is a side entrance. HALLELUJAH! --------------------------------------------------­----------AMAZING pizza! I'm one of the few people in the history of time that doesn't always think pizza is a good idea.  Where is it from (certain places just don't make the cut no matter how awesome of a special they are running!)? What toppings do they offer? Do they use fresh mushrooms or canned? Is the sauce sweet or savory? ...you get the idea. Of all the things in the world to be a hardass about, I pick pizza. Jeesh. Anyways, so after seeing all the rave reviews for Sam's, and it's only a few blocks from my humble abode, I decided to give it a try. I just went with my childhood fave: classic pepperoni. I took note that the guy on the phone was very nice. I get so irritated when the person taking the order makes you feel like you're somehow inconveniencing them (ironically by giving them your business!). Not the case here, thankfully. Great service via phone.Loved, loved, loved the pizza. HOWEVER...15 minutes after placing my order, off I was to 824 6th St SW, the address shown on the yelp business profile for Sam's Pizza. WRONG! Sam's Pizza is now in Mr. B's bar - allllll the way in the back. The location is the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars and quite frankly probably deserves even fewer based on this alone. Picking this pizza up was borderline sexual harassment. I had to weave through the very crowded bar with bros and dudes giving me the stare down. "Wait, this chick came to the bar ALONE?! I'm all over that shizz." UGH. I couldn't get out of the place fast enough. And even when I did weave back through, I still got comments from a band of smokers asking  "where's our pizza?" and that "I'd definitely share with you so why don't you come back and chill with us". UH, no thank you please. So between that and fending off drunk line-cutters, actually retrieving said amazing pizza was less than pleasant.Would I order from Sam's again? OH YES. Absolutely... Unfortunately there are conditionals: it would have to be before nightfall :-/
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2014,5/6/2014,4,1,,4,4>Even though this place has only been open for a couple weeks, you wouldn't know it from how the place is ran. We sat at the bar on a Sunday and enjoyed a couple different pizzas (delicious) and tried some different local micro-brews. Our bartender was awesome--she was very professional and fun but even more importantly, extremely knowledgeable. I will definitely be back and look forward to enjoying the patio this summer. It basically goes without saying that this establishment will be a very successful and welcoming addition to the Ingersoll area.
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/24/2013,5/5/2014,3,3,,3,2>I am big on supporting local businesses, so Cafe Diem is my go-to when I want some caffeine before work, or when I'm meeting a girlfriend for a coffee date. Their employees are cheerful and helpful. Lately I get a dirty chai, and although their chai is just a mix, I still enjoy it. Their other beverages are great, whether you're a latte person or a black coffee drinker as I am most of the time. Smoothies are good, and you have the option to add protein powder if you want. Love their blueberry muffins and scones as well. The fact that they have a drive through is awesome too.Cafe Diem isn't amazing by any means, but if you want great atmosphere and a decent cup of coffee, it's great. Compared to large competitors like Starbucks and Caribou, I will almost always choose Cafe Diem.
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/26/2012,5/4/2014,4,15,,4,2>Definitely a little greasy spoon joint. I love this kind of place, especially the old men at the counter who seem to slip in and out of conversation with each other between reading the paper and talking to the waitresses. Waitresses are kind and adaquately attentive. The breakfast food is standard fare and always hits the spot. (Think great hangover food.) It is exactly the kind of place my husband (who is obsessed with breakfast) loves. The people watching is great and it's been around forever. I can't attest to the lunch menu but it looks just as all-american diner as you can get. I will also say that walking in is initially a little bit awkward as there are so many regulars, seats aren't always available, and the waitresses don't really acknowledge your presence right away. Just find a table or stool, the awkwardness will pass.

Not very busy when we got there which worried us but that disappeared fast.  My friend got sweet tea and within several minutes of ordering our food was greeted with it. I had the pork platter with baked beans and sweet corn, my friend had beef platter with sweet corn and fries. Sweet corn was delicious and our pork and beef were pretty much perfect! Still very moist. I enjoyed the KC style sauce and original bbq sauce. Roommate enjoyed Chicago style. Baked beans didn't stand out but weren't bad and garlic bread was bland to me.

If you dont know what a taqueria is, it's basically and usually a dive/diner where they specialize in nothing but tacos. Going into los laureles i was really excited because my american friends said it was the bomb blah blah. I tried it and i was kind of disappointed. It is authentic BUT there's something missing flavor-wise. I think the tastiest thing they had there was Chile de Arbol steak. I feel like the servers are just there to take your order but not really interact. They are somewhat polite and "OK" i guess. I have to agree with a user who commented earlier, if you want awesome authentic mexican, go to Mariana's on University & 13th St, or Panchos (known before as Gorditas San Pancho) on Hubbell. There's also this taco truck on Martin Luther King and University next to the Auto Parts shop. Good tacos! However, los Laureles is open till 2 am on certain nights so that's always convenient....

I understand brisket is the toughest part of the cow, but slow cooking it usually tenderizes it pretty good. I found the brisket to be a little tough still.As for the sides, the macaroni was incredible and unique; you'll just have to get it to understand what I'm saying. The jalapeño creamed corn was tasty too; I'm not a big creamed corn kind of guy, but it was good enough for me to recognize it's excellence. The corn bread was good too but nothing spectacular.Service was good, and our waitress addressed all our requests. I'd give it 4.5 stars just because the brisket was pretty tough, and this is a BBQ landmark location, so that's uncommon. 4.5 rounds up to 5, so fair enough...

I normally drag my fiance or my brother to come long whenever i crave some Hawaiian food. Not that they don't like it but because i hate eating by myself. However i have had the courage to go and eat in by myself because my cravings for this place was unbearable. i go about twice a week. Trying to have a withdrawal and it's hard =D. It's my go to restaurant for comfort food. The food comes out quickly to satisfy your hunger. their macaroni salad is one of the sides that i normally come back for. it's not good for you but i don't care... i wonder what they put in it to make me wanting more. sometimes i substitute the rice for the macaroni and the owner never understands how i can eat this without rice =D.i just started getting into the Saimin... it's a clear ramen broth dish. it's light and very satisfying, especially for these long winter nights we've been having in central iowa. I've only tried the chicken saimin but i'd definitely would try it with the beef and pork sometime soon.If you want something quick, cheap, and savory I'd highly recommend this place.

Their planter selection is a little on the expensive side and most don't have proper drainage. They suggest putting rocks in the bottom (and will for a price), but I found it still can rot the roots of plants. I suggest grabbing some of their fabulous plants but picking up a planter else where or drilling holes carefully into the bottom.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,4/20/2014,57,271,3,8,7>I LOVE Tacopocalypse. Here's why.1. Tacopocalypse is BYOB. For the moment Tacopocalypse doesn't have a liquor license, so we have been known to bring a bottle of champagne to brunchpocalypse and purchase glasses of orange juice to make mimosas at the table. I have no idea if there are plans to get a liquor license in the immediate future, but I can't say I mind - DIY mimosas are cheap! 2. Waffle of the day. There's a different feature at every brunch - I remember there was a Korean chicken-and-waffle special during our first brunchpocalypse, and I stalk Tacopocalypse's Facebook page waiting for it to return. 3. Late night snacks. Tacopocalypse is open until 10, and the order-at-the-counter setup makes it very easy to stop in and grab carry-out on my way home. Now, if only they were open until midnight...4. Burrito of the day. OK, I'm not a burrito person myself (I prefer the tacos), but there are some very creative creations for burrito fans to enjoy. The last time we were in, the lemongrass pork special was given a very enthusiastic thumbs-up at my table. 5. Vegetarian and vegan-friendly. I am neither of those things myself, but I love that I can sub potato poblano for meat if I choose. What's more, four of the eleven "meats" are vegetarian. Great place to take my veggie friends!6. On the flip side... the meats are fantastic. My personal favorites are bulgogi and wasabi brisket. 7. Masa fries. These are crazy good, and I've never had anything quite like them. You choose your meat, then they're topped with fried egg and queso. Wow. 8. Mexican chocolate push pops. (I could come up with more, but this review is getting a little long.)My fingers are crossed that eventually Tacopocalypse will expand to a nicer, bigger space as it's a little out of the way and the bathroom setup is a little inconvenient, but these are not big enough concerns to keep me away. I absolutely LOVE this place.

<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/9/2014,4/18/2014,39,137,5,4,4>Where to start with this place? Definitely not your mom and dad's burger place nor is it like any other. It's got that crazed hip zombie obsession vibe the kids are into these days. The burgers are really delicious if not a tad overpriced. There are still a few options for health nuts like veggie burgers and sweet potato fries and so on. But for the meat eating don't give a crap if I clog my arteries crowd - The Walking Ched is 100% love. Crack between two buns.

Thanks to Raygun for hosting (y'all rock) , Backpocket Brewery (mmmmm... Raygun IPA), Zombie Burger for the always (mmmmm... delicious Raygun burgers), and the DSM manager Patrick for organizing! Reinforces what I know to be true: Des Moines is a great place to YELP!
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,4/16/2014,292,547,4,8,7>This is a great steakhouse in downtown Des Moines! To start with the sides, the green beans were delicious; they use onion and bacon, the boursin mashed potatoes were rich and full of flavor, and the lobster mac was amazing. Also they offer half portions which is a huge plus at an upscale steakhouse. I had the NY strip with the Cajun spice rub and it was cooked perfect, seasoned just right, and had a great aged flavor. I was very happy with my steak and enjoyed every bite. They do offer several different finishes to your steak, so you really can experience something different every time that many steakhouses do not offer.The Creme Souffle was amazing, they had three sauces that come with that were very very good. Need to try more desert here, didn't know a steakhouse could bake so well.Had a great experience here, would love to come back and try more of their offerings.

<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/15/2013,4/13/2014,5,12,,9,2>I moved to Iowa from the East Coast about 1 1/2 years ago.  I am very picky about my hair, which is naturally brown / red and as fine and straight as it gets.  I've struggled all my life finding a stylist who would not only cut my hair, but would help me come up with a plan for that haircut as to what would look good for my type of hair and my level of preferred maintenance (which is zero). I had someone recommend this Salon, and I called to get an appointment.  I asked for one of the most experienced stylists, since I'm not playing games with my hair.  I had to wait a very long time to get in for an appointment, but when I did, it was worth the wait. I had to fly back to the east coast for a few haircuts in between, but such is life.I doubt I will let anyone cut my hair ever again other than Katie Jo. I'm  very confident the other stylists are qualified, but she gets me and gets my hair.  She understand what it takes to make a good haircut based on your face shape, hair type, styling desires and abilities. Not all stylists are that skilled. This Salon seems to focus highly on education and precision.  All of the stylists, colorists, etc. are constantly being trained and learning new techniques.  This is so important and it obviously shows in the quality of work they produce.Katie Jo has kept my short hair manageable, helped me choose and cut clip in extensions (which look amazing and real), educated me on growing out my hair for my wedding and has been a trusted adviser for me on all things hair and beauty.The Salon is impeccably clean (I used to work at an impeccably clean salon, so I know what to look for), everyone is friendly and helpful, they sell quality products and do not up-sell you, or try to convince you to buy crap and services  you don't need. With a basic cut you get some great additions at no charge like a delightful scalp massage, hand massage and moisturizing hand treatment.I've had a few of the spa services done and all of the things have been great- and remember, I am very picky (some might even call me a snob, to be fair).I've booked my wedding day of hair for myself and all of my bridesmaids,  no way we would go elsewhere.  I am also planning on getting airbrush makeup from one of their skilled makeup artists.If you are looking for the best Salon, you've found it.  Waiting for an appointment will be worth it in the end.
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/14/2010,4/12/2014,17,68,3,4,2>You know those stupid movies where people survive a hurricane or take cover in a basement during a zombie attack or flee professional killers in a jungle, and yet their hair is perfect? I now find them perfectly believable. Ok, not the plots, just the hair -- because I now have that haircut. I can wear hats, spend twenty minutes in a high wind, get rained on, and my haircut still looks great. Giovanna gives a fantastic haircut. She takes time to make sure every detail is perfect and she styles your hair so that you look as if you were naturally just that elegant and hip. This place is magical.
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2014,4/11/2014,29,39,,8,3>I had a great experience with this salon.  I had extensions put in and they came out almost immediately.  I did a lot of research through out the state and I came across Dawn's information.  I emailed her, and she was quick to respond.  I live two hours away, so she was willing to do a consultation over email.  My hair is not the easiest to work with due to breakage, and she gave me a few options and explains cost and maintenance differences between all of them.  I also explained I was nervous since I have to wash my hair almost daily because I am active in roller derby and my work smells bad.  She said these extensions would hold up to a daily wash.   I made an appointment for extensions. She had my hair ready to go, and colored my hair perfectly to match.  I was there almost nine hours, so we chatted a lot.  Dawn is very friendly and personable.  Offered me something to drink or to order food.I received a lot of compliments on my hair.  The color was awesome and matched to a t.  She is def an expert when it comes to color and cold fusion extensions.  Its been almost 5 months and I've only lost a couple of strands, but that was because I didn't brush them with the brush provided.I have another appointment this week, and I'm excited!

We hadn't been to one in about 6 years. The food was surprisingly good, nice server. Vegetarian options for me. Only drawback was that it really felt suburban and chain like when you are used to the local family owned spots. We are mid 30s and were the youngest by a long shot. If go again though if I'm in that neck of the woods!

They have a large selection of craft beers in both six packs and bombers including quite a few rare finds.

<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2014,4/3/2014,8,4,,3,3>The service is excellent! At least 2-3 people greeted us when we came in and we were seated immediately. The food is really yummy, love love love the salsa--very fresh with a little heat. I ordered the shrimp fajita quesadilla and it was great! Lots of peppers, onions and tomatoes and tons of shrimp (definitely couldn't eat it with my hands). I also had a regular chicken hard shell taco and it was very tasty. There wasn't any hot sauce so I used the salsa to spice it up. Overall great food, service, and ambience for a great price!

Our waiter was very nice and gave us our bread to give us time to look over the menu. We ordered the little italy combo, which is huge! So good though. Got our steaks and its without a doubt the best steaks we have ever had! i reccomend the fillet oscar and drunken steak. Wonderful service, amazing atmosphere, and for all courses our bill was roughly $95 including the 20% tip. Will be going again!
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2007,4/1/2014,68,340,1,4,2>A home-grown, locally owned taco chain that has been a tradition in Des Moines for over 30 years.  The flour taco is what everyone goes crazy over.  It's a pillowy flour tortilla that is deep fried and stuffed with meat (the beef is pleasantly seasoned and contains a few whole pinto beans), lettuce, cheese, tomato and the usual taco stuff.  It's soft and a little crispy on the edges, but never greasy.  Order it with a little sour cream packet to top it off and don't forget a squirt of taco sauce from the ketchup bottles on the table.   My kids are now hooked on them too.  Taco Bell's Chalupa is similar, but not nearly as tasty - nothing else hold a candle to it.  I'm sure there are other good items on the menu, but why mess with them when you can have the best tacos in Iowa right here.
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2014,3/31/2014,10,80,,3,4>I was looking at buying a salvage title vehicle in the area, and after seeing the good reviews here (and the close proximity to the dealer), I decided to have Ace Body & Motor do a final look-over before I purchased the vehicle. And I'm glad I did!Everyone there was extremely educated and very friendly. They know what they're talking about. The owner, Larry, gave the car a look-over, and let me know to definitely, definitely not purchase it at the price they were asking. He took me around the car and showed me why each one of those things was problematic and told me how it was SUPPOSED to look and how it was going to cause problems in the future. Turns out this salvage vehicle hadn't been properly repaired. He then spent another half an hour telling me about how to find a good car to purchase, what to look for, and recommended dealers and options in the area. He answered all of my questions thoroughly and without any sort of annoyance. He really seems to love what he does.I was already impressed by his service and planning to come back again, but when I asked the front desk how much I owed them for the visit, Larry said I didn't owe them anything. Amazing service and super-duper above-and-beyond. This is exactly what I want when I come to see a mechanic. I think I'm going to be drive all the way out to Des Moines from Ames when I need something done with my vehicle.Seriously, one of the best mechanics I have ever gone to.

<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2012,3/27/2014,23,99,1,6,4>A co-worker introduced me to this place through their delicious (and CHEAP) soup.   Soup of the day choices are varied, and all I've tried so far are delicious.  They serve them with these little garlic knot rolls, and those puppies are tasty.  Since that first visit, I've been back several times to try out some of their other intriguing menu items.  I loved the Big City Burger with cheese (you can pick your cheese from a pretty good list of options), I ordered it with the Big City fries (omgheaven).  The burger tasted goooood, and I'm mostly non-carnivorous.  I've also really enjoyed the NYC salad - big and filling, and again served with those tast little garlic knots.I love that there are so many organic options, fresh, local/grass-fed meats, the plates/cups/etc. are all compostable.  One note, the place is busy right at peak lunch hours, but show up after 1pm and it's really a nice, peaceful dining experience.  It's fun to sit and watch people walking by out of the big windows, and when that gets boring, you can tap into their free wi-fi and watch stupid cat videos on YouTube.  Good times.

And for less than $15, both the experience and the bill are magnifique!Two insider tips: As in France, Django serves lukewarm water without ice, so you'll have to specify ice water with lemon if that's what you like. And servers package leftovers for you, so instruct them to include your soup if you plan on eating it later.
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2014,3/22/2014,13,22,,3,4>Fong's pizza is bomb diggity. I've been there twice, and both times had a great experience. Their Tiki drinks are tasty (and strong), but don't forget your debit card because at $120 per, they need collateral. Admittedly, they're tempting to want to walk away with. Safety is important while drinking, so don't forget to ask them for a pilot helmet to wear while indulging. You'll be ready to fall down without getting a concussion, not to mention the added benefits of fun photo opportunities. I've had the Loaded Potato pizza, which was delicious and filling. I was skeptical of Crab Rangoon, but during my last visit I gave it a shot based on Jessica W's recommendation and the rave Yelp reviews about it. It was absolutely amazing, I must say! I don't typically get thin crust. However, it complimented this particular pie quite nicely. The Cheeseburger pizza was decent. The ketchup/mustard base sauce wasn't my favorite. If you're into that kinda thing though, you'll love it. I also like the fact they give canned soda! The atmosphere is cool and fun, and the service is great. Whether you're a Des Moines resident or just a visitor stopping through, Fong's Pizza is a DSM landmark you HAVE to experience and share with friends and family. It's a place you can get loaded with the best munchies with your pals on a Friday or Saturday night and take your family to the next day.

Several of us had the filet, which was cooked perfectly to order, and melts in your mouth. Steak deburgo was one of Des Moines' best. Kids meals were excellent. Desserts were unbelievable. I'm a regular here for a reason - it's always great food and service. And grab a fresh baked cookie on your way out the door.The menu is huge with price points for most. Nice selection of wines. Filet was $30, but comes with side, and salad. The table bread is great too.

<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2014,3/18/2014,76,529,,7,7>My fiance told me many years ago they were located at E 9th St before and they closed, apparently they had great food. When she heard this place is opened again she dragged me to come here right away. I have many things to say about this place, but overall: AMAZING PLACE, PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE PHO PLACES IN TOWN!First, the decor is modern and sleek, they kept mostly the same decor from the Sakura Sushi place that used to be here. This is a sit down restaurant in a small and comfortable atmosphere. The menu is small, which is awesome! No need to flip through a big menu past  many items you don't care about; they only put in the best items here. We ordered two appetizer sampler combos to try their different appetizers, Ban Mi sandwich,  and fried chicken wings. I had their featured pho, the Pho All Season (large of course). Other people at the table had chicken fried rice, wonton soup, and porkchop rice dish. The food quality was amazing! You can tell they spent their time to make these items fresh. Their pho may actually be one of the best I have had in town. This is an ideal business model for new restaurants opening in a  market with pho restaurants everywhere. (This is because they make their quality of food better than the ones already existing).One thing that I wanted to bring up, but is not really a big issue, from the time the first entree came out to the last was about 10 minutes. I was actually done eating before the last person's food came out. Like I said, this is not an issue because, the manager/owner (I believe) came out and apologized for the wait because there was an issue with the order ticket in the back. This brings me to their service, it is excellent! Their manager (I believe) was very friendly and able to strike up a small conversation with us regarding our experience in their restaurant, she obviously takes pride in her business. Before leaving we decided to also try their bubble tea, and it also may be one of the best I've had in town! Another small note, their staff appear to be Asian-American which is a nice touch, they are able to relate to the customers more and also appeal to their taste. The price here is standard for a pho restaurant. I am glad they opened, this may be my new go-to Pho restaurant in the area! I CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK!
<review# 254,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2014,3/17/2014,14,69,,3,3>Of all the froyo places, I find Menchies to be the most pleasant. Staff is always courteous and helpful and when they thank you for stoping by, you truly feel like they mean it. True they do not have as many flavors but love the ice cream sammy flavor and feel like they are not just creating flavors to create flavors.2 pieces of advice and why I docked a star:1. Some of their fat free flavors contain aspartame (found this on their website). Wish they would list as ingredient on the flavors that have it in store. This stuff can mess you up.2. They use paper cups and plastic spoons which have top notch design value but then everything goes in the trash at the end. Froyo shops are supposed to be hip and cool, like recycling. If you are not going to recycle, you may as well use an old school Mickey Ds styrofoam container.

I've always been a fan of bands that people don't know of, or were popular before I was even born. I get majority of my music from Half Price Books. I also find the books I want with little effort. The staff is also very helpful. They are great at making recommendations!
<review# 256,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,3/15/2014,14,39,3,3,3>My favorite place to see music in Des Moines. Sound is great, staff is the best in the biz, and there are always great shows. What's not to love? The first show i saw here was when I was 17 when my family first moved to central Iowa. I don't remember who played, but I remember having a great time. Since then, the Vaud has held a very special place in my heart. I have seen some of my favorite bands (and favorite friends) play here and it's even where I had my first PBR. If that's not love, I don't know what love is...
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2014,3/14/2014,24,12,1,4,4>Jethro's BBQ is one of my favorite restaurants in the metro - they have great food (especially wings!), I love the decor and ambiance of the restaurant (good enough for a first date - even better for a night with friends) and of course the service is great as well.  But the main point of my review is for their catering - they exceed all of my expectations. We had a corporate outing and ordered our meal through Jethro's - the managers were beyond helpful (even allowing us to change the date of our event the day of the event due to weather). Everyone had nothing but praise for the food and we plan to use them as caterers again in the near future.
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2014,3/13/2014,2,6,2,7,4>I had heard from some friends of mine how good the Restaurant was.  I did a little research online and read they offered $1.99 Margaritas every day.  If that wasn't reason alone to step foot in the establishment and see what all the "fuss" was about, nothing is.  When I arrived at the Restaurant on Thursday night with my brother, there was a lot of cars parked in their make-shift parking lot.  I can't even begin to imagine how busy they'd be on a Friday night or Saturday night, or the inability for someone to find a parking spot to eat there as a result.Anyways, we walk towards the entrance and it's not the slightest bit appealing to look at.  Looks like a dive in fact, but that doesn't mean the food won't be good.  If "fancy" or "classy" is what you're looking for, you're going to the wrong place.  This is an "Eastside" establishment, and for those of you who don't understand what I mean by that, then it's probably best you keep eating in West Des Moines or Clive and stay away from the Eastside of Des Moines.We enter the restaurant, and wait to be seated.  There's a huge party of people (10-15) being loud, obnoxious, and indifferent to anyone else.  Personally that's not an issue for either my brother or I, so it didn't bother us.  What was being discussed and said would bother me though if I was with my Mother, or small children so keep that in mind too.  That continued the entire time they were there until they left (we dealt with it for about 20 minutes- they did apologize to us, and we said "It's fine.  It doesn't bother us at all").  I also noticed at the front counter that there was sign stating "Effective January 2014, Margaritas will be $2.99".  It didn't leave a very good first impression on me just walking in for the first time, but I get it.  They probably had "similar unruly types" drinking 5 or more of them and causing problems.So we sit down, start perusing the menu, and immediately order a couple Margaritas.  They were very good, and quite stiff.  A lime in them, salt on the rim of the glass (it was very good tasting), and what seemed to be Margarita Mix with a cheap Tequila.  It was so good that my brother and I ordered another for our meal.I got their "Tequilas Burrito", and my brother got a platter with Enchilada, Flour Taco, and Burrito.  Both entrees came with refried beans, and rice.  I failed to mention that they brought out Chips and Salsa for us too when we first sat down.  The salsa was incredible, with tomatos, onions, green peppers, and had some kick to it.  The chips weren't anything fantastic, but decent enough to snack on.I did next what I always do when I eat at an Authentic Mexican Restaurant.  I taste the rice, and by that alone I know whether the entire meal will be good or not.  Wow the rice was fantastic, and the refried beans even better.  My beef burrito was huge (you can choose what meat you want- Beef, Steak, Chicken, Pork) and I could barely eat half of it.  My brother enjoyed his Beef Taco, Chicken Enchilada, and Beef Burrito entree too.  He also had the choice of what meat he wanted for each.  It was the kind of meal where it was so good you wanted to keep eating it, but you also knew that you'd feel miserable if you ate the entire thing.  I took food home, and it was as good if not better left over too.I would highly recommend this Restaurant if you're a "substance over style" type person.  I could see a situation where I took a date to the Restaurant and she being reluctant to be there or eat there seeing it.  Once she tasted that margarita and their food, her mind would immediately change I'm sure though.  It's a "diamond in the rough" as I told my brother.  For the both of us (4 margaritas and two entrees) the total came to just over $32 dollars, which isn't too bad.I can't wait to go again and order their Fajitas which everyone recommended to me.  The Chimichanga, Cheese Enchiladas, and many other entrees were "intriguing" to me too.  I had a difficult time deciding what I wanted in fact.  Also, they have a Lunch Menu that is cheaper than their Dinner Menu.  I would imagine during the week it wouldn't be too busy either if you went that route.
<review# 259,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/9/2014,3/12/2014,86,391,1,4,4>Let me start off by saying I am biased.   I love hockey.I love professional hockey even more, and Des Moines is blessed by having options for your hockey enjoyment.  This is American Hockey League hockey baby.  Arguably the 2nd best hockey league in the world behind the NHL. Congratulations Iowa! It's right here in the Capital City just a few hours away from Iowa's big league parent organization up in St. Paul.You'll see speed and talent here that is rivaled by only by the NHL for a low, low price of admission.   The close proximity to the big club has allowed fans here in Iowa to watch players in Wells Fargo one night and on television playing in Minnesota several days later. The Wild employ a disciplined, finesse style of hockey that isn't my personal favorite. The fights and big hits I enjoy have been infrequent this year.  The talent on the ice, game day production, media production and customer service however is excellent from top to bottom.  Great seats start at $18, and if you're will to look there are some good promotions that will get you great seats for weekday games at $5.Looking for a indoor sports fix during the winter months?  This would be my #1 recommendation for those who like hockey, are interested in hockey, or want to see elite level athletes.
<review# 260,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2013,3/10/2014,18,21,1,4,2>I have now been here twice. Once for lunch and another time for appetizers and drinks. Both times I have received excellent customer service. The last time I was in my friend and I split the spinach, artichoke, crab dip. At first we were skeptical about including crab in a very classic appetizer, but it proved delicious. I generally do not like crab. The sandwich/soup I had on my first visit was also excellent.I enjoy the relaxed, yet classy atmosphere and one of the best Bloody Marys I've found in the metro. A welcome addition to the Valley Junction area.
<review# 261,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2014,3/9/2014,30,10,1,5,4>I grew up in the 80 ' s and feel right at home here!! They have all of the old - school games and newer ones too. You want food? TV dinners are on the menu lol. They also have Tommy Morrow selling his Chicago Italian Beef sandwiches as well. Friendly service, clean, free games on Sundays.  Check it out and get your game on!
<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2014,3/8/2014,23,123,1,5,4>Most restaurants that offer a "box lunch" reserve exclusively for catering clients and large group orders.  Palmer's is one of the exceptions and they offer a nice deal. Approximately $9 nets you a full-size sandwich, deli salad, dessert, pickle spear and chips. I had "PJ'S Favorite", which was a rather large sandwich with a very nice portion of pastrami, ham, bacon, and salami.  The "new" (red potatoes) had bits of fresh chopped vegetables and was a nice accompaniment  to my meal.This location in particular has limited hours (8 AM-4PM) and I believe they are closed on the weekend, which is unfortunate.  I understand the nature of their business is the weekday lunch crowd--but the location limits opportunities to visit.  The staff is friendly and truly seems to enjoy their work.
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,3/7/2014,86,27,1,6,4>Favorite record store in Des Moines. Dan and Nate are always super helpful. I've been collecting records for almost 10 years now and I love stopping in here once or twice a month to check out new arrivals. Every April this is my go to spot for Record Store Day - unless I am out of town. Miss the old location in the East Village - it's interior had a more classic record store vibe - the current location feels like a bedroom in your parents house with posters on the wall - not a horrible thing, just a little stale, but it doesn't hinder the quality of records they take in and great place to buy local records. 5 stars.
<review# 264,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2014,3/6/2014,49,17,2,3,4>Great start to a business trip. Parking is easy, and it is so calm in the terminal. Enjoying some time with my husband before I leave, thought we'd grab a coffee before I go through security. But, there's only a self serve Dunkin Donuts station, and poured just a swig of the coffee and it smelled not so great. So we went to the bar next door (inside), and ordered a coffee, and he went out to the station and got my coffee. And it's a medium. Whereas, if I had poured my own, I could have chosen the small. Cream and sugar? Yes, please.
<review# 265,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2014,3/5/2014,73,520,2,7,7>Great downtown place to work up a yoga sweat.  Classes are very structured and repetitious (they love crow a little too much for my liking) though I feel this will change as the instructors grow in their teaching practice and within the community.  The location has 2 studios, nicely equipped with dressing rooms, water fountain, and plenty of storage cubes.  A plethora of times for anyone's schedule.
<review# 266,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2014,3/4/2014,0,2,1,4,2>Plainview New York to Maquoketa Iowa, it went without a snag.We packed all our  boxes on hand trucks, the ones with the folding handles.  When the pod was delivered, it was a wood frame interior which turned out to be a plus, there were eye hooks I used to put loops in to make it easier to strap the boxes in.We had to change the pick up date because when we sold the house the closing date was up in the air.  Was not a problem and I changed the pick up date with the chat feature on the Pods website.We drove to Iowa which took longer because of the winter storms in the states from Iowa to New York.  Staying an extra day in a hotel worked out well- we missed the worst of it and saw the interstate littered with cars.The day they dropped off the pod it was windy and around 1 degree outside.Sadly they couldn't park the pod in the driveway- low hanging wires.The night before we moved the cars out of the driveway, my wife's Mini wouldn't start it wouldn't even recognize the keyless ignition.  My Kia started and stalled out before I could get close enough to give the Mini a jump ... so glad we have great neighbors who helped us push the cars so the truck could drop off the pod.The next day it was warm enough the cars would start and we put them back in the driveway- over to one side to have a clear run to the garage.  Just in time too, the police showed up, my car had been parked on the wrong side of the street for the failed attempt at giving the Mini a jump.  We should have gotten permission from the town to park a pod on the street, but we explained it was an error that we missed the low hanging wires.Unloaded the Pod in two hours- just us two and 3 of the hand trucks collapsed (packing mishap).  We called that afternoon and the Pod was picked up the next day, we called the police (small town) and the town administrator and everyone was very happy.Add a star if you go through life as an optimist remove a star if you can not be pleased.
<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/10/2014,3/3/2014,4,106,3,4,1>Never been here for dinner but have hit the lunch buffet all the time.  In my opinion this is the best all you can eat pizza buffet out there.  The pizza here is cracker crust thin which i love and they keep the pizzas coming out every 10 minutes or so.Their parm/garlic dressing is more addictive than crack.  i could guzzle it down by the gallon.Bottomline, if you are looking for a mondo carb coma, come here because you will overeat, but you will be happy while you do it.
<review# 268,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,3/2/2014,14,29,,5,3>I've been going to this Farrell's location on and off for the last few years. The current manager Javier is doing an incredible job. Instructors are very helpful and care about your progress. Kickboxing is fun and really challenging. Bands/strength training can be a little monotonous but is great for seeing results. Early morning classes and right after work can be pretty full, but not to the point that it diminishes your workout.
<review# 269,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,3/1/2014,30,16,1,5,5>This is my all-time favorite running spot in Des Moines! It's nearly two miles to do one loop, so you can choose your number of laps accordingly. Don't miss it at sunset when the rainbow-colored lights come on along the paved path that runs over the lake! Beautiful.Be sure to take advantage of the free yoga and/or Zumba in the park each Saturday during summer. Each week a new instructor from a different studio around town leads a class, so you're able to sample several different styles.
<review# 270,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,2/28/2014,2,3,2,7,6>My family and I went to Blue Tomato for the first time tonight. We have two little girls (aged 3 and 6) who know spaghetti, pizza and Mac-n-cheese inside and out. My youngest and most picky loved the spaghetti with meatballs. My other daughter liked both of the pizzas we ordered. Blue Tomato is family friendly!The food is fresh and a lot of it is locally sourced. I had the pork piccata and my wife had the short ribs. Both were excellent and the portions were perfect.Beers may be seem overpriced, but they are craft and imports that are priced appropriately. The wine selection is good and reasonably priced.Service was very good. Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well enough to make some very good recommendations. I would highly recommend trying Blue Tomato Kitchen. If you want fresh, local and good food for a good price Blue Tomato is your answer.

<review# 272,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/11/2013,2/26/2014,63,40,1,6,4>The inconspicuous location and storefront of Sakari do not appropriately convey the goods inside. From my repeated lunchtime experiences, the bento boxes offered as a lunch special are an excellent variety of sushi, salad, and stir-fry. The rice is even top-quality and always perfectly cooked. The tiger shrimp are deadly and decadent - it's a good thing only two come with the lunch bento box!Excellent atmosphere and very attentive, friendly staff.
<review# 273,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2014,2/25/2014,36,209,,4,1>Classic arcade games in a bar atmosphere.  Good times with friends guaranteed here!  Get there early for the occasional game token deals.  Prices on games are only a quarter each.  The drink selection is nice also.  Good location downtown.  Recommended!  From Rampage and Dig Dug to Playboy Pinball and Mario Cart, the place has plenty of entertainment to keep you having fun all night.  Skee Ball and more!
<review# 274,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/23/2013,2/24/2014,1,7,,6,4>Went to Akebono for my second visit this weekend and cannot wait to go back for more! My first visit was with a large group of around 20 for a birthday party. We arrived in waves, and the staff was courteous, helpful and did not make us all wait for the entire group to begin service. We ordered a huge amount of food/drink and they did an amazing job of circulating the various rolls around the table, keeping us all well hydrated and happy and also encouraging the party to have a lot of fun. It felt like we were the only ones there the service was so attentive, and yet it was packed. The sushi was also absolutely fantastic. For my second visit I was with just one other person and we went for happy hour. Wow! The prices and happy hour offering is astounding, as is the service. The regular dinner menu comes with soup and salad and we were happily surprised that the happy hour menu also included this perk. I love visiting a restaurant where you aren't entirely sure who your waiter is, because every single time a service person walks by your table, they notice if you need something and just DO it. We stayed for several hours, and tried about everything on the menu. Everything from the mussels to the cocktails, to the 'house' wine was fantastic. I cannot recall visiting another restaurant in the past five years that has it all down, in multiple visits. Food, service, ambiance, fun. What a great addition to Des Moines, now please come to Ames! HIGHLY recommended rolls: oishi, tazmanian.
<review# 275,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2008,2/23/2014,161,81,1,4,4>Sad that yet again someone not from Des Moines wrote the first review for a Des Moines Fav.Star Bar is still a fairly new bar in Des Moines after talking with the owner his concept was to open a bar with really good bar food. With that said he surly surpassed his goal. In my opinion it is a really good restaurant with a really good bar.After a stroll around the neighborhood I like to pop in here to get the Edamame's or the Stir Fried Green Beans with ginger & garlic both around $5 you can not go wrong.Their brunch on Sundays is really nothing to write home about and that on its own would only get a three star.But if you never had a tenderloin or want a really good one stop in and get the "Boss Hog" pork fritter, ham, bacon, Jack cheese & grilled onions! My fav!The services is not the fastest at all times but they do make a really good drink. The bartenders are pretty good and the wait staff could use some training and guidance.The Decor is really nice the walls are adorned with local artist and rotate out from time to time. They should really change the umbrellas on the patio to class it up a bit. Get rid of the free ones from the distributor and put up your own custom made umbrellas.
<review# 276,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2013,2/22/2014,9,3,,4,2>I went here last night and had a great experience. This was just my type of restaurant: small, family owned and good food.  I had the steak tacos and they were excellent.  They were just slightly smaller than normal so if you are really hungry order at least three but don't worry on spending too much they are $1.25 each ($.25 more to add cheese).Chips and salsa are not free.  I liked this because then I don't gorge myself on chips ahead of time before my meal comes. My friend who came with me got the quesadilla and thought it had a little too much cheese but was still pretty good.  Oh and the salsa was awesome.  If you don't like hot salsa make sure to ask for their mild stuff.I definitely would eat here again and recommend it to anyone else.
<review# 277,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/22/2013,2/21/2014,2,78,6,8,3>This isn't just an amazing cheese shop, this is a -world class- cheese shop with delicious cheese and meats coupled with service that is beyond compare.  The selection of cheese here is simply unbelievable.  In addition, they make their own rillette and pate - and just for the record, the beef rillette that I tried is one of the most delicious things I've ever had.   Support your local cheese shop and help small business prosper.   Des Moines, you need to get your butts in here and learn about how to eat and enjoy fine cheese.  You have no idea how lucky you are!Oh, this is also probably the best selection of beer that you're going to find in the city of Des Moines.  They're not playing around - it's top notch and high quality.The final bonus: no hipsters.  If this was in Chicago you would need to spray to get rid of the hipsters.  I'd give it a 6 star review if I could.
<review# 278,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/21/2013,2/20/2014,25,90,3,5,4>This place is old, needs updating, and they don't even accept credit cards, but... they have the most amazing donuts I have ever had in my life. No other company even touches them in flavor and quality. Just wow. One star deduction because it's a business for gosh sakes and I'd like to see them make it more convenient and nice for their customers. But again, you won't find a better donut, they are the Donut King for a reason.
<review# 279,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,2/19/2014,51,69,4,5,3>After stabbing a hole through my convertible top in a recent ice storm, my usual car guy referred me to Iowa Auto Top & Upholstery. He called ahead and told them I'd be right over; I missed the driveway on the first pass, but found ample parking in front of the less than impressive brick building. Joe made me a quick, free estimate, gave me a timeline and business card in case I decided to pursue it. Really no pressure at all. Then cue my frustrating insurance company wanting their own people to do inspection/estimate, which ended up being about a hundred less than what Joe had said. The claims adjuster made things sound really complicated when I called to tell her the prices didn't match; so I called Auto Top back for help. Lyle was reassuring on the phone and then again when I went in person  to show my insurance paperwork and make an appointment/deposit. They offered to call and deal with the insurance people... thank you!It gets better! My school schedule is hard to plan around and I had some other commitments to complicate things, but they set me up for the VERY NEXT DAY. Lyle gave me a ride home after I dropped of my car at 8am and offered to come back for me at the end of the day. Very courteous. I just picked up my car with its new vinyl top and plastic window -- it looks amazing. I'm quite pleased. Moreover, the price discrepancy went away! Very happy customer, thank you!
<review# 280,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2010,2/16/2014,17,12,,4,3>Dos Rios is a regular dining and drinking stop for us, especially turning the warmer half of the year in Iowa when we can enjoy the patio on Court Avenue.First of all, the bar - especially the tequila selection - is top-notch. Excellent margaritas along with mojitos and other libations. Second, I've honestly never had a bad meal here, whether from the super-cheap ala carte tacos to the higher-priced entrees.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was occassionally the wait staff isn't as attentive as they could and should be, but that's an exception and not the norm here.P.S. I have to laugh at the low reviews Dos Rios has gotten from "big city" people on Yelp. Please, who do you think you're fooling? I've been to plenty of fine restaurants in Chicago, NYC, DC, LA, etc and Dos Rios would be right at home.
<review# 281,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2011,2/15/2014,14,33,,5,2>We got here around 9:30 on a Friday night and the place was already packed! I was in a large group (bachelor party). Took us about 20 min. for everyone to get bier at the bar and another 15-20 for a large table to open up. Even though it was crowded it was a good atmosphere for our "warm-up" stop. We proceeded to go through about 6 or 7 boots of beer in our time there. Our waitress was nice and timely, never had to really wait for more bier. Enjoyed the Spaten Lager, Bitburger, and I think the Warsteiner Dunkel. By the time we started in on some of the dark beer, my mind was not in retention mode. I look forward to coming back and trying some of the food and definitely more of the German biers!

I always get their Guinness stew over mashed potatoes which is perfect on a cold winter day. I do however wish they would become the dedicated soccer bar of Des Moines. We need a good soccer bar and this should be the place!! What do you say Royal Mile you into soccer? We are still enjoying our Westy 12 (XII) that they were able to get in, very cool that you guys participated.Read more about Westy 12 here: huffingtonpost.com/2012/

They did have a handful of newer items the last time I visited so give it a chance if you don't find something you are looking for the first time you visit as he's always adding inventory. I did find their prices more reasonable on used albums than ZZZ (which is contrary to the other review) your mileage may vary. The owner is super nice and gave us a few perks for spending a decent chunk of change there. There is room for two (or more) excellent record shops in Des Moines so if you like ZZZ give Wayback a shot to help fill out your collection.
<review# 284,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/20/2013,2/12/2014,1,8,,2,>Zuzap was chosen on a whim based on other great reviews here. I had heard of Cool Basil, but Zuzap was closer to me. It's right behind Granite City in a hole-in-the-wall type of place. We went right after 5 on a Saturday when they opened and were the 2nd pair of people there. It's a cozy, and nice little place and not at all sketchy! We were immediately greeted warmly, and brought water. The menu has lots of options, but since I've never had Thai before, I don't know how authentic it is. All I know was it all sounded delicious! I chose a  dinner combo and picked a soup, egg roll, and entree. I got Coconut Soup (different, yet amazing!), a vegetable egg roll, and Green Curry. You could choose a spicyness level if you wanted, but I went with the basic which was just the right amount of kick. I also got young coconut juice, which was made with roasted coconut. The food was all completely fantastic! The service was incredibly warm and speedy. By the time my aunt and I left, the place was almost filled!I have absolutely no complaints! I will be a repeat customer!
<review# 285,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2012,2/11/2014,0,8,1,4,3>I visited Lemon Grass as part of a birthday celebration over lunch. They were very accommodating to our group and set up a large table ahead of time. From the lunch menu, it appears like a pretty typical Thai place with a few random favorites from other cuisines (fried crab rangoon!). I had drunken noodles and they were delicious. It was a bit saucier than I would like it, but just for drunken for the noodles I suppose. I also had the Thai Iced Tea and was delighted by it. I attempt to visit restaurants multiple times, so I hope to be back soon to try something else.

I would recommend trying a few different items, good to get the full experience.They have a unique menu that changes so there will be always something new to try, so if you feel like trying something different that tastes great Proof is the place.
<review# 288,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/22/2013,2/8/2014,41,129,,3,1>Without a doubt, one of the coolest places I've been to for beer. The 125+ taps are awesome enough, but add an incredibly hip yet down-to-earth vibe and really knowledgeable and cool staff, and you've got a winner. We've only lived here a month and have already been here four times.You can count on greasy bar food, beat up bar stools, a wide variety of ages and walks of life, and most of all, plenty of beer to keep you happy...and coming back for more.Update: If their products alone garnered this review, it would unequivocally get 5 stars. But time after time we go here to experience shotty service, which really irks me. Staff needs some serious work.
<review# 289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2012,2/7/2014,173,148,2,6,2>YUM.So I went on a Wednesday at around 12:30pm and it was super crowded, but the line went fast. These people really are efficient! On top of that, the staff was super nice and friendly! I bought a foot long turkey sub and split it with a friend. It was about $9. I wasn't expecting much because it looked pretty normal to me, but wow was I wrong! This thing had a lot of flavor for such a simple sandwich. I was impressed!On Monday, the Vito is $4. I would definitely go again and try that out.Word of warning: the lot is really small and lots of spots are reserved for employees.
<review# 290,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2013,2/6/2014,11,191,1,5,3>Outstanding in every way - food, service and hospitality.  We visited the Flying Mango based on the reviews we saw on Yelp; 4.5 out 5 is pretty impressive!  But I would like to meet to the person that claimed this place was less than a 5, because I would like to know how realistic their expectations were.  This BBQ/Beef restaurant is simply the finest, most reasonably priced restaurant I have enjoyed since moving to Des Moines from Atlanta in July.  The choice of wine is excellent, the staff is sincerely friendly and the food .... geez!  Out of this world delicious.  I will be coming back often, especially when I have business guests asking me "where can we go for a great meal?"  I have finally found an answer!
<review# 291,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2013,2/5/2014,3,50,,2,>This is one of the most expensive places in Des Moines to get a steak.  Our steaks were well worth it as we savored every flavorful, juicy, tender bite.  Our server was also fabulous as she tipped us off that they would scale down the portion sizes for us.  Our bill even stated that percentage, however, I did feel that those percentages should have gone down a bit more.  BUT, we didn't come here to have sides, we came here for the steak and it was well worth it.  Our wine choice went well, it was a random choice of the VERY select few least expensive bottles.  The majority were in the triple digits.  Ordering the souffle is a must and hopefully your server tips you off to order before your meal as it takes 40 minutes.  The size was perfect for the two of us (even more but we were feeling greedy) accompanied by 3 sauces. Very glad we ordered it and comparatively the price was amazing.If we had the $$$$ to, we would dine her more often, alas, this will be one of our special occasion locations.
<review# 292,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2013,2/4/2014,41,8,,2,1>You might die this place is so amazing! You will literally want everything in there. Full lines of amazing and hard to find products. Want to pamper yourself? This is the place to do it. Staff is always friendly and helpful and have great ideas for gifts, the best gifts! You wont regret coming here, your new addiction awaits! Oh, and they throw some amazing parties too!
<review# 293,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2013,2/3/2014,39,137,,4,2>Yummy yummy yummy burgers!!!!! Prices are on the cheap side for incredibly fantastic burgers. Fries are so-so. Thin, but decently seasoned. Definite cool throwback vibe. My new eating joint/date night with my love.
<review# 294,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/13/2013,2/2/2014,110,444,6,8,6>I heart this place!I've dined here 3x now and have enjoyed each visit.Breakfast is wonderful.  They have simple dishes that pack lots of flavor & utilizes seasonal ingredients.  I did eggs & toast, which is normally boring, but I was very content.  Dinner is where it's at--they have a fairly large wine list, including several affordable  selections by the glass.  Also noteworthy is their cocktail list (get the elderflower drink!) and beer list, which includes various local beers.  Normally I don't get salads, but the beet salad caught my eye--goat cheese, candied nuts, roasted beets & greens.  Sooo good!  Sweet, salty, crunchy.  Most recently, I got an entree of flank steak (which was a perfect med-rare) and it included a side salad, so I went with the kale caesar, which was tasty.  Although, it's hard to beat the beets :)Everyone knows I'm a huge dessert snob, since it's my profession.  Naturally, I had to get the chocolate salted caramel tart.  Divine!   Luscious caramel, silky dark chocolate and a hint of salt.  The gold leaf was an elegant touch, but I was too scared to eat it.  I should have just thought of it as doing a shot of Goldschlagger.  The tart shell was a little too thick and difficult to cut, but other than that it's a fabulous dessert.I've dined with co-workers and family, but I think it'd be a really nice date spot.  Skip the chains in WDM and dine here!!
<review# 295,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2013,2/1/2014,57,271,,5,3>Zombie Burger is fun, fun, fun. Yes, it's ridiculously popular so you'll probably have to wait. Well, don't you WANT to eat somewhere that so many people obviously love? And it's not just for the clever concept, the cool decor, the spiked milkshakes, or the funny menus printed to resemble newspapers with zombie stories (I really enjoyed last week's menu spoofing RAGBRAI). The food is actually pretty darn good.When Zombie Burger first opened, I went crazy and ordered a ton of fried food (it's sort of their specialty). Ohhhhhh was it ever good, but ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh did my stomach hurt. I actually didn't go back for a long time because I started trying to eat healthier, and I just didn't think ZB fit into that plan. Then I took a closer look at the menu. No, you don't just have to get the cheese-slathered burgers between the deep fried mac & cheese buns (though I won't judge if you do, that stuff is delicious). ZB also has two kinds of veggie burgers OR a grilled portabella which you can sub for any burger on the menu. Even more, you can sub a bed of greens for the bun and make your own improvised zombie salad. Maybe not QUITE as fun, OK. But my stomach thanks me for making more responsible choices. I'll still indulge in one of those insane burgers every once in awhile, but it's nice to know there are options! Other good stuff at Zombie Burger? The Brussels sprouts. The fries. The fried pickles. The awesome beer selection. The servers, most of whom have been there since the place opened (our server last week told me they have zero turnover because they all love being there so much). Oh, yes. The spiked milkshakes. Delicious.I love this place! So does everyone else! You'll love it too.
