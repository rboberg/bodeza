<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2014,11/26/2014,3,2,,1,1>My favorite thai restaurant around.  Chicken Pad Thai is my norm and it is wonderful here.  Prices are good, the staff are very polite and entertaining.  For the value it is a win.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2014,11/25/2014,2,19,1,2,2>This bar is awesome to watch the Cats play or listen to live music! Their food is really good for bar food. Bartenders and waitresses are friendly and efficient. They have good drink and food specials throughout the week. Gets packed late night but that just means it's the place to be! Very fun college bar!
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2014,11/24/2014,1,3,3,4,3>The atmosphere is very nice. We have ate a few times and love the pork dishes.  If you never had Cuban food you should try. If you like Mexican food you will enjoy Cuban food. Plus on Saturday during happy hour, yes happy hour on Saturday!  Half price drinks, very good deal!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2014,11/23/2014,0,15,1,5,2>Attended opening night of new store. Of course was crazy as expected. Waited 2hrs but knew I would. Lexington has been craving this forever. A beautiful place like all. The staff very attentive to us. Food awesome  as knew would be. Had a new check in system which I'm not sure of. Took your cell # and text you. Ok I guess but the flashing pager is hard to beet. The hostess girls had to come into crowd and ask out people's names from check in slip. It's a noisy place and you couldn't hear them and they shouldn't have to holler! So maybe need to think over check in. Small problem to fix. Cheesecake Factory is an experience worth the wait. It will do great here, should have been bigger built maybe. Do go and enjoy!! The food selection is wild and amounts real nice! Thanks for choosing Lexington Ky!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/24/2014,11/22/2014,4,29,1,2,2>Great place to watch games and drink some beers.  They have some dartboards also.  It's a pretty chill laid back place.  Would definitely recommend.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/26/2013,11/21/2014,2,7,2,3,2>This is a beautiful place to visit.  I like to take my kids there for a picnic and then let them play at the park.  The kids favorite part is a little cottage that the kids can play in.  They pretend to make fires in the fireplace and cook food.  I like to take my family there for pictures.  The grounds there are very pretty and the old building make for great backgrounds for pictures.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2014,11/20/2014,54,97,3,4,3>All chains have their consistency. This location has the quickest drive through and super nice staff. They have always gotten my order correct. Plus they will even fresh grind a pound of coffee beans for you, even if you are in the drive through. New food options are wonderful. Not cheap, but also not cheap ingredients. More flavor and filling than McDonald's with a healthier menu overall. Food, cakes, treats, and wonderful coffees.
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,11/19/2014,5,28,6,6,6>I think of myself as a fairly expert food-picker-upper.  I call from the car, know exactly what I want, and I'm usually in and out in minutes, if not seconds.  This is a great strategy when one is covered in dog/cat/horse hair, mud, sweat, and various other substances I don't even want to think about.But this strategy just doesn't work at Curry House.  When I arrive, I am given a warm cup of Elixir Of Life...I'm sure THEY have another name for it, but that's what I call it. It's some kind of tea with sugar and some other magical ingredients.  I'm not usually a fan of tea unless it's cold and has mint in it, but this is so delicious that I almost always ask for a second cup to go.I am then directed to have a seat at a table to wait for my food; often there is another person there waiting for food and, like two people who know nothing about each other we forego the pleasantries and launch into a discussion about a variety of random subjects.  I have had great conversations at this table about soccer, the Founding Fathers, the possibility of making Lexington a car-free, horse-only community, where to stay in Greenland, and, most recently, how to make a truly delicious chili relleno.My food always comes quickly, but I'm never ready to abandon the tea or the conversation, so it is rarely warm when I finally sit down at home to eat it.I should mention that I have never partaken of their buffet.  I don't think buffets are ever a good indicator of a restaurant's true worth.  I have also never actually eaten AT this restaurant, though I have spent plenty of time there.  The chicken tikka-masala, lamb vindaloo, mattar paneer, and garlic naan are my go-to favorites...I could eat the lamb vindaloo every day.So, thanks, Curry House, for cold food.  Delicious, perfectly spiced, always plentiful and with plenty of rice, napkins, and naan, but cold. And I wouldn't have it any other way :-)
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2014,11/18/2014,7,82,3,7,5>Great idea for a lunch spot.  I had the Santorini salad, very mediterranean inspired, with  quinoa, feta, chick peas, tomatoes, cucumbers, red peppers, toasted pita chips (Did I miss anything?).  I opted for the creamy lemon vinaigrette dressing. It's a healthy portion for $7.95, served in a large stainless bowl.  Lexington's own Ouita Michel Chef designed the menu -- is there anything she does that isn't wonderful?   I also had the blueberry basil lemonade -- very refreshing.  Seating is limited as the place is small so, if you can, go after the lunch rush.  Service is fast, and Bryce (one of the owners) and his staff are super friendly.  A new Lexingtion lunch gem!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/8/2014,11/17/2014,39,64,4,5,4>Have to be honest, this is probably one of my favorite grocery stores ever.It's small, so it's easy to get in and out of and it's easy to learn where everything is (with some variation of course, as what's available changes from time to time).It's dirt cheap.  You can find a Tombstone pizza here for $1.99 where it would cost you at least twice that at Kroger.There isn't much staff here to speak of, but the staff that they have are very pleasant and always hardworking.  Honestly, I kind of prefer it this way.  No one to bother you while you're shopping.I have nothing but good things to say about Aldi.  I try to make it a habit to come here at least once a week every Wednesday after work.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/29/2014,11/16/2014,19,119,4,3,3>It's okay, but I think it's fallen a lot from its peak.If I'd written a review 10 or 15 years ago, it would be 5 stars.  There was a time when this was the best Mexican in Lexington and I'd eat here a few times a month.  Last week I went here with my family for the first time in maybe 5 years.  I had very fond memories of Rincon, and thought I'd enjoy it again.I didn't.  Not really.  It's still the same place, but the service was a little slower than I remembered, the portion sizes a little smaller than I remember, and the food was actually kinda bland and nondescript.  Now it's much like any other family-owned independent Mexican eatery in Lexington, which we have many of.  It's adequate, but either it's lost that spark it once had, or my tastes have changed a lot.  For what I paid for lunch and a drink, I think I would have been happier just going to Chipotle.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2014,11/15/2014,17,16,2,3,2>I went to this place as an invitation from a good friend.  He said and I quote "I only brings my good friends here, so you should feel special."   This place is a hole in the wall establishment, located right next to University of Kentucky's campus.   It's definitely in a prime location for foot traffic.  This place is fairly small, so keep that in mind if you have a large group of people.  The decor is simple and tasteful, and the music is casual.  The menu is small but it makes sense.   They focus on their strengths and honestly you won't be disappointed.   I asked my friend what he suggested and he said "Everything here is amazing!"Their menu has authentic Korean BBQ and other dishes, as well a nice selection of sushi.   I started out with an order of a Dragon Roll:Crab, avocado, eel, shrimp.This roll was expertly made, not only did it make for a wonderful appetizer but it allowed me to get a taste of what was to come.  Bulgogi:Thin, tender slices of beef are marinated with soy sauce, sesame oil, and other spices.   Sautéed potato's and onions.   It is served with a bowl of white stick rice.  This was amazing, the flavors just jumped off the plate.  The dish had several layers of textures and flavors that I just couldn't stop eating it.  I wanted to try their dessert options but I was too stuffed to eat anymore.  This restaurant is epic, I'm surprised I didn't hear about it until now.   I highly recommend everyone to at least try this place out.  You won't be disappointed.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2014,11/14/2014,8,70,4,4,3>Wonderful food and atmosphere! Everything I tasted was wonderful. It's inside Dudley square so if you go to the right you go to the restaurant if you go left you can sit at the bar. The patio is also really nice - recommended on nice days! Their specialty cocktails were really tasty and they have a menu just large enough for there to be something for everyone.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2014,11/13/2014,12,59,2,3,2>Awesome date night meal. We had the burger and the Korean chicken sandwich. Both were really well done, but the chow chow on the chicken sandwich was the perfect touch. Crunchy pickled veggies with a ginger-kind of spice. The house chips are good, but the fries are better. Be sure to try one of the house made ketchups or rosemary mustard.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2014,11/12/2014,0,1,4,4,3>If your looking for a good local dive bar, this is the place! Heard good things from the locals so decided to check it out. Wasn't disappointed. Good food and friendly people. Came for lunch so it wasn't busy yet. Can't wait to come back for a peak hour experience! *cash only
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/12/2014,11/11/2014,3,23,1,2,1>I love this place already.  I like the thin crust because it reminds me of a Chicago thin crust.  The pizza again is great and I really have no complaints.  The only knock is that I have to drive 20 mins to get there!  That is not their fault though.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/23/2014,11/10/2014,1,4,1,1,1>A friend introduced me to this place, and I've gone back 4 times this month!  I LOVE the tacos.  The corn tortillas are made in house and are delicious.  I really enjoy the simple, yet flavorful tacos.  Just meat, cilantro, onion and a lime wedge.  My favorite is the pollo or parson (pork on a red sauce).  Many of the patrons are Spanish speaking, but all of the staff I've come in contact with have spoken very easy to understand English which is a bonus for me as I unfortunately don't speak Spanish.  The woman who is usually there taking orders is very friendly and seems eager to introduce you to her food.  She answered all of my questions and even gave all of my party samples of some of the interesting drinks at the counter as well. (i highly suggest the rice water, it's sweet and is a nice cooler if you use the spicier sauces.Upon entering the store it can be a little confusing.  Have no fear. Just take a seat and they will come to you to get your order. (If you're getting it to go, just head to the counter on your left to order).  Once finished, just head to the counter to pay. No need to wait for a bill.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2014,11/9/2014,0,20,4,3,3>Pops is an experience, it changes people one visit and you want to keep coming back, especially if you're into anything vintage/retro. One warning though, don't come in looking for a record by The Beatles/Floyd/Zeppelin/The Doors, etc on a weekday always come on a Friday or maybe a Saturday to get them before someone else does.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2014,11/8/2014,7,13,3,6,1>My wife and I were first time patron's today.  I'll start with "WOW" on the size of the potatoes.  Those things are really big.  My wife had hers with chicken and it was great.  I had the medium original Petro.  I had never had corn chips in my chili.  I'm a convert now.  I took a photo of mine.  I had mine without sour cream. The chili was the right amount of spice and flavor. Another benefit is that most of their food is gluten free.  WE WILL BE BACK SOON.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/22/2014,11/7/2014,1,11,2,2,2>Love this place!  They have quite a selection of vintage apparel and decor. You never know what you'll find. If you like vintage you should really check it out.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2014,11/6/2014,1,19,3,4,3>Wanted to leave an updated review. Clothes Mentor has recently expanded their store and the inventory is definitely larger. With the expansion, there is more room to walk between and around racks. Before the expansion, customers were sort of on top of each other while browsing. The racks are not as crowded with the extra room, so it's easier to see everything. There are more fitting rooms.  I can't upgrade my rating to 5 stars until I shop here while not being pregnant and see how I feel about the rest of the store aside from the maternity sections. I have sold a few items here since my first review and it was a good experience.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2014,11/5/2014,3,10,3,4,4>So delicious it's ridiculous. Every item on the menu is great, the staff is friendly, the atmosphere is fun and you're sure to see a friend or coworker while eating. This is a must and a welcome gem on Main Street.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2014,11/4/2014,0,6,3,4,3>I love the people behind the counter, they're always super helpful and maybe they're busy...but they will get to you.  I don't need to be coddled, I know what I want and they have it.  TRY THE RAISIN AND NUT BREAD!!! HOLY PAJAMAS!
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2014,11/3/2014,2,19,1,2,2>Great food. Had the healthy egg white breakfast pita for lunch and it was very filling. My three year old had the kids chicken pita and it comes with a drink a side (too much for her to eat and so I got to enjoy some of it) all for $3.99. I rated it four instead of five due to the long wait to get our food when the restaurant wasn't that busy. I expected fast casual speed at a counter service but it was slower.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2014,11/2/2014,1,5,3,3,3>I was very impressed with the prompt and professional service I received.  After a horrible experience with another company, I called Comfort hoping they could help me. My furnace was replaced within 48 hours from my initial contact. They didn't try and make me feel pressured into anything or try and sell me stuff I didn't need. They took care of my request and I now have heat in my house and it was at reasonable cost. Thanks again guys
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,11/1/2014,18,58,4,3,4>I've loved their food ever since I had it off the food truck in front of West Sixth. The tacos are amazing. Be bold and try the cow's cheek taco. It's delicious.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/9/2014,10/31/2014,17,18,1,4,2>I go to the movie tavern all the time, because, who doesn't like to eat greasy food while enjoying your favorite movie and a glass of wine?  I must say that the first time i went i was super impressed.  We were in a theatre that had reclining leather seats! and even though the movie we had gone for "wasn't working" so to speak, they gave us another movie and refunded our tickets. Since that time (over a year ago) i have been to the movie tavern at least 20 times, and i swear i have never been put back in that same theatre! I'm starting to think that i made it up in my head!! The other theatres are ok with rolling chairs and typical movie chairs, but the reclining leather seats were BOSS.  The food is ok, I always get the cranberry chicken pita with fries, my favorite thing on the menu! The only thing that stinks is that since i had been going (over a year ago) i would ask for my pita with no pecans and they would oblige. Recently, ive been told that they cant do it because now they prepare everything in one big batch to expedite service :/ .  The first time this happened i was visibly sad so the waitress talked to the manager and they said they would do it for me "this time." I've been back 3-4 times since then and just had the pita with the damn pecans :/... Last note - some of the speakers in some theatres seem to be blow because you hear a rattling noise when the bass gets real loud....I gave this 4 stars because im not going to stop going, but if there was a better place in Lexington I would go there instead.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2014,10/30/2014,13,13,6,9,4>Downtown Lexington now has soul... Food, that is. House of Soul recently opened in the former "House" location on South Limestone between Maxwell and High streets. Their description: "Fine dining with soul." I arrived at approximately 5:30 on a Friday evening and was the only customer. I was not surprised as they are new. I was greeted promptly by two friendly employees who invited me to sit wherever I wanted. My server was attentive throughout my visit. I was immediately drawn to the Chicken and Waffles--one of my favorite items when I can find it. Although the menu states all entrees come with two sides and cornbread muffins, the Chicken and Waffles actually does not. I did order the cornbread muffins separately but it would have been a nice touch had a cornbread muffin actually come with the dinner. That would seem to be a natural expectation in a soul food restaurant.The food arrived soon thereafter and consisted of three large full fried chicken wings and a Belgian Waffle. And it didn't disappoint. The fried chicken wings were hot and crispy and the waffle with syrup was tasty but nothing special. All in all, it was delicious. The restaurant was filling up quickly as I left so the word already appears to be getting around. There's a nice selection of items on the menu, including Kool-Aid. The decor is comfortable and I hope they offer outside dining in the future the same the previous tenant. As with the previous tenant, parking is an issue until after 5 pm and on weekends. Prior to 5 pm weekdays, parking is available street parking only. After 5 pm and on weekends patrons can park in the large lot on the west side of South Limestone, just prior to the actual restaurant. I did notice the lyrics of the music playing throughout the restaurant of at least one song contained completely inappropriate language for a restaurant serving a diverse audience including a potentially downtown business crowd and community visitors. I would recommend that the restaurant's owner/management review the music selection and ensure it does not contain questionable and potentially offensive language. Judging this new restaurant on food and service however, I would recommend it when you want to enjoy tasty soul food in downtown Lexington.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/8/2014,10/29/2014,144,100,5,4,2>I love the Common Grounds for the space. The coffee is A-OK, not the best coffee you would find in Lexington. However, there are PLENTY of space to sit down to study, chat, play music, etc. Karma is experience, and experience creates memory, and memory creates imagination and desire, and desire creates karma again. If I buy a cup of coffee, that's karma. I now have that memory that might give me the potential desire for having Americano, and I walk into Common Grounds and there is spotty karma about it. Improve the coffee and keep it consistent in terms of flavor, take a lesson or two from the Cup of Commonwealth, Daily Grind or North Limestone Donuts in coffee brewing, then it might give you good karma. I think we are living in a time where the consumer has lots of choices, whether it's coffee, newspapers or whatever it is. And there is parity in the market place, and as a result of that, the consumer is beginning to make decisions, not just on what things cost and the convenience of it. For that, I give other coffee shops the nod, but give Common Grounds an A for space. Elite A-Ok......
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2014,10/28/2014,93,398,1,1,2>Love this place.  It is a great treasure hunt for those odd hard to find items for the home.  For anything from glassware to linens this please is where to start.  They have glass decor, pet supplies, cookware, lamps, rugs, some furniture, pictures, linens, and outdoor decor.  I am certain if you are looking for something special or unique then this is the place for you.  Staff are helpful and nice and never in a hurry to rush you out.This company also owns TJ Maxx and Marshals, but  no baby stuffs, shoes, and clothing.
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2014,10/27/2014,48,135,3,5,5>Small little liquor store with a drive thru section. Excellent service in my humble opinion. They have a great selection of wines, beers and liquors, especially small batch bourbons. Whenever I'm traveling out of town, I take a bourbon as a gift. I usually come here because the staff are knowledgeable and willing to help. One time I went to a larger liquor store and felt less confident with my purchase. On my last trip here, I needed to get a bottle of bourbon that wouldn't be available in any other state but was still comparable in taste to a bottle of Woodford Reserve and they gave me at least 4 options from different price points. I enjoy the fact that they take their time helping customers. I just started following them on Facebook and realized that they have frequent tasting events in store and they even have in store beer taps and growlers. Looks like officially I have no reason to go to a bigger store because they got everything I need!
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2014,10/26/2014,30,77,6,5,5>Growing up in Lexington I would drive by this place occasionally and feel like I was seeing a restaurant stuck in time.  Up until a few years ago the sign said Burger Shake 79 cents.  Now it's 99 cents.  I started a new job half a year ago and I now pass this place everyday.  Curiosity won out last night and I stopped in for a cheeseburger, small fries, and large coke for just over $4.00.The restaurant looks like it has remained unchanged inside and out for at least 30 years, and not in a cute Parkette Drive In kind of way!  This isn't the type of place where you would take a girl on a first date (unless she has specifically told you that she wants to experience an authentic Lexington dive), but it's a great place to go with friends and family.  Burger Shake beats other fast food restaurants in the area hands down.  As one reviewer has already mentioned, it tastes a lot like In and Out Burger.  Their fries are the same thin style you find at I&O and the ingredients tasted fresh.  The meat on the cheeseburger was real meat and not that faux meat stuffed with fillers you find at chain fast food restaurants.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/4/2014,10/25/2014,13,39,2,2,3>I've eaten at about every restaurant surrounding this establishment for many years, I don't know why I avoided it - I was just never struck with the "Ohh, yes.. Pizza" thought while i'm out and about. However, this weekend I decided to walk in and have a pie.Upon entering, I liked the ambiance and atmosphere. It looks great inside, and the bar is positioned enough away from general seating to allow noise to damper, should you not like to be around it. I chose to sit right in the middle of it, as I kind of like the craziness.The pie itself was great, a nice Thai infusion that left my taste buds dancing. The beer selection is incredible as well, leaving out no one.
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/26/2014,10/24/2014,0,2,,1,1>We love the pizza, meatball sub, chicken Diablo, and spinach/artichoke dip.  The gluten free menu is extensive and was a big hit for our family who was visiting from out of town.  We wish the owner would add TV screens for the UK sporting events.  I understand the NO TV policy but please this is Kentucky and there should be a small leniency for the basketball and football games. :)
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/22/2014,10/23/2014,163,88,3,5,3>I am enjoying the reboot of this franchise. Now complete with table service and a much improved menu. The place itself is new and modern compared to other older establishments. The burgers and cheese curds are a welcomed auditioned. I hope they keep the concept of this store alive.
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/28/2014,10/22/2014,12,25,3,5,4>This is a great spot for fast food lovers. Very inexpensive, $4.99 combos come with two sides! Unexpected! Cajun grilled chicken was really really good! I loved the onion rings! My husband loves the fries! He also got the chicken strips. Alot of meat in them but too much bread for my taste. But no complaints about it! The milkshakes are amazing! Tons of options! Give it a try!
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,10/21/2014,38,72,2,2,2>I love going to Bella Bronz. They are super friendly and knowledgeable. They make sure that you have your eyewear and there is always a deal on lotions. They make tanning a fun experience! Very clean as well.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/23/2014,10/20/2014,50,82,2,2,2>Stella's is the oldest restaurant on Jefferson Street and remains a delicious downtown lunchspot. They get their food locally. They have delicious burgers, decadent pies and a really cute outdoor area. The yellow facade and diner decor inside make the place irresistibly cute. I can't wait to go back.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2014,10/19/2014,32,41,2,5,4>A great place to have a glass of wine/cocktail & a light bite to eat with friends. If you check in using YELP you get a free Patatas Bravas ;)I went for a special event and was able to sample many of the Tapas and one dessert. We had:  Chorizo (mild, paprika salami from Spain), Chorizo Puffs with mustard sauce, Patatas Bravas with Aioli, Meatballs a la Madrilena and Chocolate bourbon Almond Stuffed figs. There were three cheeses. I preferred the soft, mild goat cheese which I simply cannot recall which one it was on the menu.My favorite, the Chorizo. It was thin sliced; the perfect diameter to settle on your tongue. It was smokey, not spicey but very flavor-full. My least favorite, The Meatballs. Although the Marinara was wonderful the meatball was just average. Nothing to rave about.The figs were amazing and the Bourbon not too strong. It's recommended to pair it with a cocktail, Fig 46 (see the posted photo of the menu), which is made using the Bourbon from soaking the figs for this dessert. When I go back, I'm making sure I'm not the one driving home so I can drink more, I'm eating mostly the Chorizo and I'm trying the Panna Cotta (Lemon & Raspberry). Sit on the lower pation, weather permitting, it was very charming.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2014,10/18/2014,71,112,4,4,4>I love Costco. So many great savings on everything. Especially good for frozen foods and toiletries because they come in such large quantities. The fruits and vegetables are always fresh. They offer a great variety of fresh meats including seafood. I always like going on the weekends when there are many samples available. Another great perk is the gasoline! I usually save at least 20 cents per gallon compared to regular gas stations!
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2014,10/17/2014,20,75,2,5,4>I love this place. I've had their chicken tacos in the past and they were tasty, but it's really all about the burritos here for me now. They're huge, like what you'd get at a Chipotle or Qdoba, but the flavor is amazing compared with those chains. They use black beans and their rice has some kind of orange spice on it; the flavor combination reminds me of what I get at Old San Juan's. Big chunks of chicken, very filling, and they grill the outside of the burrito a bit, too. I also like their tamales. I prefer Farm Market's tamales because of the green tomatillo salsa that comes with theirs, but Ellos tamales are good too. One perk here is that they have more options for the tamale filling on the menu. Their tamales are a little on the dry side, so it helps to use their hot sauce.This is a good place for lunch and now that LexEatIn delivers it, it's convenient for dinner, too. I haven't eaten at the restaurant for lunch in several months, and I've only gotten it delivered for dinner. Prices can be a little much for tacos, but you get a lot of food.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/28/2014,10/16/2014,1,6,3,2,2>I agree with Ken K. This is a pleasant surprise for Versailles. Great food and it's more a burger seafood place which suits me just fine. So far, tried the Fish and Chips for lunch. Sunday brunch had Cajun Shrimp and Grits and hubby had the BLT. All delicious- we'll be back as regulars.

<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2014,10/14/2014,14,28,5,4,3>Seriously, the best fried chicken in Kentucky.  Obviously the parking here stinks and the drive-thru can get pretty clogged but it's pretty much worth it.  Richie's over on Georgetown Road is the same place, same food, different name.  And their parking/drive-thru is a bit better.  We love the potato wedges as well.  My husband and I will split a 3 piece dinner box, substituting the chicken for all 3 breasts.  Oh, and we *love* the spicy.  It really sneaks up on you and be warned.... it'll come back at ya the next day but after eating it a couple times, your body grows accustomed to it.  But that first time eating the spicy.... YOWZERS!  It was super painful the next day.  ;-)
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2014,10/13/2014,3,15,2,3,2>Food was Outstanding. The prices were amazing. Atmosphere was fun. We had a great time. Service was a little slow, but to their defense it was packed. If you are looking for a fun place with great food reasonably priced, I totally recommend this place. I loved the atmosphere, I got lost reading the little signs all over the walls. Freat way to end a wonderful day with the family.

Just got a chocolate chip cheesecake and we were very impressed. Can't wait to try a pie. They now serve lunch. We bought a pint of pimento cheese. Very good.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,10/11/2014,126,65,5,8,4>I was impressed with the building when I saw the front door.  It appears to be a custom made wooden door with very uniquely shaped windows that gave a almost "Hobbit" feel.  Upon entering, you see a very nice wood floor that appears to be original.  to your left is a table then a short setting bar that is a solid piece of what appears to be Maple that is about 25 feet long with a modern furniture sitting area, dart board, and bathrooms behind it.  To your right is a couple of tables and a small window between the two main rooms that has been opened to be a small bar area where 4 people can sit there drinks and talk.  Straight ahead are stairs that lead up to a Reservation section that would be great for Birthdays, hint, hint.  Under that is a small area with a Pool Table.  Going into the next room is the main Bar area.   The bar itself is beautifully designed wood that is very tall in the old European style.  There is a monitor over the bar that shows what beers/sizes are available.  Growlers are also available for purchase or you can bring your own.  The beers are all fantastic.  At the time of this review, they had 11 beers of their own brewing.  My wife and I have tried each one and found them each to be amazing in their own right.  The Smoked Lager is probably our favorite.  It has just enough smoke flavor and scent without making you feel like you are drinking a pork shoulder.  I would imagine that this could quite easily be overdone so much care must have went into making this beer.  Taste are available so that you can find out if you like a beer before buying.  One of the lighter beers was the Munich Helles.  it was not, however, light on pleasing crisp flavor.  It had a IBU (international bitter units rating) of 17 so it would be a great beer for people who do not normally drink beer.  They do not serve food but I have not been there when a food truck was not available on premises.  You can feerly bring in your food and enjoy.  BTW, when they make a European style beer they obtain the grains and yeast from the country of origin.  They are also the smallest producer at this time but they have plans to expand in the future.  FYI, they do have a few beers from outside companies but what Douche goes to their family dinner and eats cheap take out instead of his Mothers home cooking?  I almost forget, this business is dog and child friendly.  The floor area is very large and most of the seating ares will accomodate your children a play area.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2014,10/10/2014,9,41,4,5,3>This is a smaller market than the one held downtown on Saturdays but there are still plenty of vendors and lots of variety. You will find fresh pasta, homemade cheeses, local meat, herbs, fruits, fresh cut flowers, and veggies here. I always being plenty of small bills, but you can also use your debit card at the Farmer's Market table and get wooden coins that can be used just like cash at most of the vendors.My favorite part of my visit today was Roger and Clay, two older gentleman playing guitar and fiddle and singing for tips. Dogs are welcome at the market and one vendor even sells bones (real bones not baked dog treats)!
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2014,10/9/2014,16,56,4,5,3>I had a very good meal at Noodles & Company tonight.  For the uninitiated, Noodles & Company is a fast-casual restaurant that serves all sorts of noodle-based dishes as well as soup, sandwiches and salads.  There were two of us and we went the Asian noodle route, opting for the Indonesian Peanut Sauté and the Japanese Pan Noodles.  I added chicken to the Indonesian Peanut Sauté, and my dining companion added beef to her Japanese Pan Noodles.  Both dishes were really flavorful and good.  Other options that we passed on this time but eyed for a future visit were cavatappi with pesto, mushroom stroganoff, Tuscan linguine and Pad Thai.  Service was quite attentive.  While we do not expect a lot of tableside TLC in a fast-casual environment where you order at the counter, we were delightfully surprised when we got it.  There were employees working the floor, delivering orders, checking on us after the food had arrived and promptly offering to clear dishes from our table as we finished.  When they were not checking on tables, they were tidying up the dining room.  I so appreciate the attention to detail.  It bugs me to no end to eat in a  restaurant that is messy.  This can ruin a meal and usually just boils down to a complete lack of effort.  This is clearly not the case at Noodles & Company, and this patron applauds the extra-mile that they put forth in this category.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying more of the innovative menu, including the soups and salads.Well done, Noodles!  Keep up the good work!
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2014,10/8/2014,21,31,5,5,4>Homemade pie, friendly staff, great food and 2 for 1 happy hour = WIN!  My first hot brown had to be from Ramsey's and wow.  I would think a restaurant would need to have a special permit to sell that much unhealthy but heavenly goodness on one plate.  I even got fresh, buttered, white corn on the cob for a veggie which was a delicious complement to my already cholesterol dripping feast.I'm definitely coming back.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,10/7/2014,37,136,4,5,3>Came here with a coworker and sat at the bar. The bartender came up to us and ordered my drink. As she was doing that she asked if we would like to try half off appetizers. I said yes please. I got the bacon and cheese fries and my friend got fully loaded potatoes. Both which were soo good. I also got a burger that was pretty good. Over cooked it a little. Over all for two people it was only $30 for 3 drinks, food and tip. Will be coming back down the line.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2014,10/6/2014,7,13,3,3,4>I have had my eyebrows waxed here a few times and have always been impressed with the service. Not only are their stylists professional and very qualified, they are all super sweet! I've never been in a salon where everyone is just so nice and welcoming! A big plus for me. This week I got a cut and color with Nermina and she was WONDERFUL! She listened to exactly what I wanted and gave me the perfect look! (I have blonde hair and like to go a little golden in the fall). She is very talented and easy to talk to. I will definitely be back to see her! The pricing is good too, you pay for good service but they don't overcharge! I'm excited to try out more of their services!!

The verdict is still out on the recently opened Crust, a slightly re-imagined, somewhat re-conceived, modestly re-decorated, rendition of a certain particular previous pizza place. This version isn't so... different. Let's see... this one has table service, a wall of wine, a few additional decorative embelishments, and a few more items on the menu. They claim to have tweaked the dough recipe; I think I can taste a difference. Lunch specials are much the same (pizza and a salad anyone?) and still around seven bucks. The menu grows more adventurous, and priced, from there. The service was a bit dodgy, but I'll chalk that up to beginners' nerves. I trust the owner, of the Smashing and Bella Notte empire, will shape this ship, and then it shall be on my well eaten path.
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2014,10/4/2014,0,17,2,2,2>Love this place!  We use the butter olive oil on our oatmeal, pancakes, popcorn...!  The green chili oil is amazing on popcorn too.  The maple balsamic vinegar is good as a tangy pancake syrup.  Walk up to Graeter's and get some chocolate ice cream.  Bring it back to Stuarto's and they will put some yummy salts on it for you :)
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2014,10/3/2014,1,3,1,2,1>My favorite bar in Lexington!! This is a true Irish bar, none of the gimmicky stuff you usually find in an American "Irish" bar. Owned and operated by a nice fellow from Limerick.Try the Guinness, it's not only the best in town but the best Guinness I've had outside of Ireland! Great local draft selection and quite a massive selection of bottled craft beer. Great liquors as well. Bartenders are very nice and attentive.All in all - it's the best!!
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,10/2/2014,0,93,,2,2>Went for brunch with extended family and one parent when I moved down here for a job. This was one of my first dining places in Lex and it was exceptional. Staff was great, food was well done and while I haven't eaten dinner here...I have been to the bar a couple times and made poor purchasing decisions on glasses of stuff not offered elsewhere in this town....because hey...18 year old single malts are awesome or something...idk. Point is, place has great ambiance, great atmosphere and its great to bring a date for drinks and small plates to enjoy the people walking by. Need to get here for dinner, but it feels better as a date night for a special occasion rather than a regular place to hit up. For my one time eating, I've not had much better. Dudley's and Coles remain, in my opinion, the best places in town for an upscale fine dining experience.
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,10/1/2014,4,31,,1,2>Had the Lemongrass Ginger Pork Bao Bun at Blue Stallion. The combination of flavors was incredible. I grew up in Chinatown, New York so I've eaten a number of pork baos from different places in my life, and the one from the Fork in the Road was pretty darn innovative and good. The bun was fluffy and moist with a hint of sweetness.  I hope to try more stuff there.

I have bought my running shoes there over the last several years and yes I probably pay more here than I would at a big box store but the personalized service I get is beyond compare. It's not just simply good service but knowledgable service...they know the sport of running!  They can answer your questions on shoes and gear and will honestly tell you if it would be good for you or if not. One thing I always do is take my current pair of shoes in so they can see where I am hitting and what the wear is.  This always helps them get me in the shoe that is best for me. A long time ago I remember bug shoes based on a cool color or design but now I rely on these shoe experts to guide me on what is best for the type of athlete I am.

The bed has proven to be very high quality and I can tell that it will last for years to come. The mattress is still the most comfortable mattress I've ever tried. I am so sad that we have since moved out of state and can't go back to get another set for our son.
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/8/2014,9/27/2014,6,95,1,2,1>Cant beat it for the money. My favorite casual lunch spot in Lexington, KY. The Maque Choux is my favorite dish. If you are really hungry try a half and half plate. You can get two different dishes, but be ready to re-notch your belt or just wear stretchy pants because after all it is casual.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2014,9/26/2014,10,21,1,1,2>I've been here several times and every time the service and the food have been exceptional and fast. I usually get the general Tso's chicken.

<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2014,9/22/2014,43,64,3,7,3>My initial review mentioned somewhat sub-par service but great donuts.  After the initial growing pains of opening and sustaining a small business, it seems that these folks have completely figured it out.  Their staple donuts - glazed and chocolate - somehow go to another level than any other donut purveyor in the city. Also, many of their specialty donuts are delicious - they appear on special occasions and the more popular ones come back monthly and weekly.  The folks running the social media outlets are excellent with getting the word out about their daily specials, as well as making everyone's mouth water with good pictures of their confections. The coffee is local and good, and the vibe in the small dining room is always inviting and never snooty. The service is sometimes slow - but only when the crowds are huge - especially on the weekends. It's worth the wait. Trust me.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2014,9/21/2014,45,95,4,5,4>We decided to grab brunch today after the farmer's market this morning. I had eaten here for the first time on the 4th of July. I had the chipotle grilled chicken sandwich that day. It was good, but it ended up being too spicy for me as I am I picky on how much heat is one my food. I wouldn't let this alter your opinion if you try that sandwich. I'm just a wuss when he comes to that kind of stuff. This morning I had the chocolateCovered strawberry French toast. OMG!!' This was to die for! Picturesque too! My husband had the breakfast brown and it looked amazing and he said it was great. My daughter had biscuits and gravy with two sausage patties. She seemed to enjoy it too. Nice little place. They gave out frequent diner cards today too. When you visit 8 times you get the 9 free of 8.99 value. Nice addition to the downtown area!

<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/31/2014,9/19/2014,12,9,2,5,4>This restaurant kind of looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but it is pleasant and spacious inside. We held a going away party there, and there was plenty of room for our large group. The place was clean, staff was friendly, and their pizza was the best I've had in Lexington!
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/10/2014,9/18/2014,24,28,3,2,2>The Asuka was my first trip to this style of restaurant primarily specializing in Sushi. As an up and coming fan of Sushi I really liked what I had ordered. The atmosphere was very nice and classy. I also found my waitress to be helpful as I asked questions. Overall I was very very pleased. My only complaint doesn't really reflect an issue with Asuka technically but I just didn't feel as if the amount of Sushi you got matched the price Sushi seems to cost. As far as appetizers go, I enjoyed my deep fried green beans and deep fried tempura. My dining mate was really happy with her steak as well.  If you like this style of food, I think you will enjoy Asuka. But if you know a better place, I'd love to hear about it.

<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2014,9/16/2014,22,9,1,8,1>Growing up in western Kentucky, I learned that great BBQ wasn't about the sauce but about the basics of salt, pepper and smoke.  Blue Door Smokehouse believes this as well and have easily earned the title of best BBQ in central Kentucky.  I've had their pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket and all have been perfectly seasoned and cooked!!  All melt in your mouth and have the perfect balance of spice and smoke flavor!!  Their sides are great as well and complement the BBQ nicely.  In fact, their potato salad rivals that of long lost favorite Stanley J's Deli. I used Blue Door Smokehouse to cater my KY Derby party this past year and they did a great job of working with me to make sure my needs were met.  I asked if they could offer a vegetarian main dish and they knocked it out of the park with smoked tofu!The staff is extremely friendly and grateful.   I can't recommend this place enough!  Go!
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/16/2014,9/15/2014,45,25,3,2,2>This is definitely my favorite Thai restaurant in Lexington. The food tastes delicious, it's always hot, and the ingredients taste fresh. For starters, try an order of Mai Thai Rolls. You get two that are filled with little translucent noodles and vegetables. On top, is a sweet and spicy sauce that is just amazing. (Think of a spicy duck sauce.) The soups are also good here if that is what you're looking for. For dinner, I stick with Pad Thai. I get mine without onions and choose chicken as the protein. The chicken is tender and flavorful. And you can get it as spicy as you can handle it. I typically go 3-4 out of 5. The portion is huge, so I doubt you'll leave hungry. Must try!!

My middle son is a pain to fed, he's picky and this teenager said, "I cannot suck in my gut".  Enjoyed meeting the owners and learning how they cooked their meats, sides and desserts. That was my highlight of the evening.We will be back.

The facility is clean. The staff is friendly. The animals seem happy and healthy. This shelter gets it right and they are able to do that from wonderful people's donations. If you are looking for an animal please check the LHS options first!
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/20/2014,9/11/2014,12,84,3,7,6>My husband and I went here for the first time to celebrate his birthday and really enjoyed it.  The atmosphere is very nice while also being comfortable, service was prompt, the food was great, and prices were VERY reasonable.  It did get a little it loud with so many people and music playing at a considerable volume, but it didn't bother us and we were easily able to have a conversation.I had the Turkey Cobb sandwich and my husband had a pizza with steak, pesto, mushrooms, etc.  Both were very flavorful.  They also had a really good beer selection with 16 beers on tap, including quite a few from local breweries, which we always enjoy.  Since it was his birthday, my husband was able to get a 5 oz. beer of any on tap for $1 and receive a discount on his entree (for however old you are, you get that percentage off).  Because we were there on a Thursday, they were also offering half-price margaritas, Coronas, and fish tacos.  Additionally, Saul Good is a sponsor of the Iron Horse Half Marathon (a local race) and we are always happy to spend our money at places that are invested and involved in the community.  I'm really impressed with Saul Good and look forward to returning!  Right now they are also offering a deal on Amazon Local, which essentially cuts their already low prices in half (it's $11 for a $22 credit that you can use on both food and drinks).I absolutely recommend them!
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2014,9/10/2014,4,38,1,2,3>Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon (before the post-church rush hit) so we practically had the place to ourselves. Our waiter started out very attentive and prompt, so we had our food in no time. I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga and I can probably say that it was one of the best I've ever had. Everyone else in my group was equally satisfied with their food. The complimentary chips & salsa were also better than a lot of other Mexican restaurants. (the salsa was pretty heavily pureed, which is exactly how I like salsa--NO CHUNKS) The longer we were there, the busier it got, and the slower the service was. Our waiter was still polite, but it took a looong time for him to bring us the check. And we were originally going to pay with a card, but when it took him more than 5 minutes to come back, we just ended up using cash so we could leave. But, all said, the food was excellent, the lunch prices were great, and I definitely plan on returning.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2014,9/9/2014,9,4,3,3,4>Stopped here today for an early supper. Wow! Great atmosphere, service was phenomenally fast and the food was excellent. Granted, I was thirsty and hungry but still. I've been to my share of Mexican restaurants & this is one of the best. I had a Saurita (sp?) margarita and the Seafood Burrito with rice & black beans. Burrito was huge, was only able to eat half, so I have lunch for tomorrow. Salsa had good fresh flavor; my only suggestion would be to add a tad more onion and/or jalapeno. Chips were warm & not too salty. This is now my 'go-to' place for authentic Mexican food. Ole!
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2014,9/8/2014,203,177,5,8,6>This is a quintessential Kentucky deli, quietly tucked away in the rolling hills of beautiful horse farms outside of Lexington. As a previous reviewer said, Windy gets busy, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings. That might take away some of the enjoyment, but I'm glad so many folks have discovered this gem.If you're looking for an upscale dinner, this is not your place. If you're looking for a quick, cheap meal, this is not your place. If, however, you're looking for a laid-back, home-cooked, locally-sourced meal... well, Windy is just the right place for that.I'm in my last year of grad school at UK, and I suppose that Windy might be my last meal before I leave Lexington next spring. It's really that good.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2014,9/7/2014,54,97,4,6,6>This is the new location so they are still getting things set up. The location is handy with a wonderfully decorated patio and indoors area. While they do have TVs to watch games at the bar they are playing a nice variety of background music constantly. The menu is vast. There is a large array of drinks including wine by the bottle. However today I was impressed with the service. Knowledgeable and pleasant.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2014,9/6/2014,24,54,3,4,4>I'm willing to admit that I tried this place because Sahara was closed for their long summer vacation. I'm so glad I did. We've been back several times both to eat in and carry-out. The prices are really reasonable. For $7 you can get a really nice lunch, including a fountain drink. The falafel is great, and the hummus is better than Sahara. Everything I've tried has been great. The spices are somewhat different than your traditional Mediterranean carryout, much more complex and less mundane. The owner/chef was very outgoing and clearly has a passion for making great food. While we ate lunch there most recently we heard him having a very in-depth conversation with a customer (who was also a chef) about saffron and its use. It isn't is the best location (for me, at least) and is just a little storefront in a strip mall, but don't let the front fool you. Go for the food and you won't be disappointed.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/1/2014,9/5/2014,53,24,4,7,4>Stopped in for an early dinner for my first visit to Tom + Chee. I'm a huge fan of Shark Tank, so I was excited about stopping in here. First, I ordered the Bacon + Blue grilled cheese and a bowl of Creamy Tomato Basil. The sandwich was superb. The bread is great quality, it was PACKED with flavorful bacon, just the right amount of blue cheese and was perfectly grilled. The soup was okay. It had a good basil flavor and a good texture, but was a bit thin as if it was not quite ready.I wasn't stopping there, though. The meal I already finished was plenty, but the signage on the walls talked me into trying the Grilled Cheese Donut. Sounds gross, I know - I urge you to give it a try though! It was very good. However, when I went to order the sweet and savory creation, the lady at the register was on her cell phone having a conversation about how one of her friends or relatives was just arrested. Pretty rude and inappropriate. The food is pretty good here. I'll be back.

<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,9/3/2014,2,7,2,3,3>Extremely friendly staff and all natural ingredients makes for an excellent blend. The free samples they offer is a great idea for people who are unsure as to what to expect. Cant wait to try it again!
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,9/2/2014,1,9,4,3,3>Excellent, healthy food. My go-to place near Beaumont Circle. Personal favorites are the Thai Chicken Wrap and Chicken Salad Sandwich. For smoothies check out the Blimey Limey or Get Up And Goji.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2014,9/1/2014,17,3,2,4,3>So well done! We had the Tuscan salad and the chicken taco salad, both were tasty and fresh. The interior is peaceful and the service is great. You must try the blackberry mint lemonade. Only suggestion I have is to offer half portions to reduce food waste. If you aren't starving you could easily split one of the salads.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2014,8/31/2014,2,8,3,8,5>We enjoyed our first meal in the new Chatham's on opening night.  The former Ramsey's location has been remodeled with bar renovations, carpet added, and best of all new chairs and tables that look better compared to the former tenant. The chairs in the restaurant & outside on the patio are a huge improvement and seat customers much more comfortably.We split the fried banana peppers which came with sour cream and a tomato jam. They may very well offer the best shrimp & grits in town; theirs is served with bacon and other goodies along with the shrimp and the grits are thick and cheesy. It is tough to pick from all the sides but most dinners come with two options. We sampled sweet potato casserole (Melty marshmallow atop) and their Mac & cheese -both seemed homemade; quite good. There were more offerings such as broccoli casserole, other "greens". The She Crab Soup on their menu is homemade and was the best surprise in this inland city of Lexington! I enjoyed that perhaps most of all.  We also sampled the chicken wing appetizer - many choices of sauces given; we picked an Asian chili sauce that was not too spicy (Not going for the "oh my God" anytime soon). Overall this was a delicious basket and had a generous amount of celery, carrots, blue cheese dip. Our bellies were too full for desserts (they named a lot of homemade pies, bourbon bread pudding & a cheesecake) but all was such wonderful food and tastes that we are going back again tonight!!During the next three days they will have their liquor license. Once they have their full bar open, expect a long wait with crowds who have heard about this fabulous new spot in the former original Ramsey's near downtown and UK!I noted good choices for their Sunday brunch. And the fact that they boast that they're open until Midnight - and 1 AM on Friday and Saturday nights - is a huge bonus.  Sometimes it is hard to find a full-service restaurant of this caliber after 10 PM in this town. Just wait till football season starts....
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2014,8/30/2014,1,13,6,11,9>I am so impressed with this place that I can't help but get right to the point:Red Bang Bang is, in a word, phenomenal. In two short days, it has managed to become my favorite sushi spot in the entire city--and possibly the history of ever, but I guess only time will tell! I originally heard about it from a co-worker who had seen a flyer for the restaurant in our break room (I work at the mall.) Excited about the prospect of make-your-own sushi, I popped in after my shift this weekend... I won't lie, I pretty much expected greatness.However, what I got was far from great. For me, it was near perfect. I walked in and right away noticed how clean the place was; I was also greeted immediately by the friendly staff, who practically made it their personal mission to assist me in my choices (going so far as to provide samples, which was awesome.) I ended up going with an avocado/cream cheese veggie roll topped with spicy mayo and tempura crunch and a seaweed salad on the side. Let me start by saying that at Red Bang Bang, you apparently get a LOT of bang for your buck. The rolls are massive in size and come in 10 pieces, and...well..you definitely won't be hungry after eating one. Mine was no exception, and it was absolutely delicious--the cream cheese/avocado combo was devilishly good without being too rich, and the seaweed salad was wonderful. Even better: everything tasted fresh despite the fact that it was made at 7pm on a Sunday. It's almost too good to be true.I'll end my love letter on this note: try Red Bang Bang if you like food. Yeah, if you like food... you will love it here. The concept of getting to pick what's in your sushi roll is innovative and generally amazing and even if you don't like sushi, I'm fairly sure you'll like what you get!
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,8/29/2014,39,64,3,5,4>I visited here originally when it first opened, and forgot to review it.  I will say that the prices have gone up considerably, but when it first opened up it was dirt cheap.  The prices are actually appropriate for the quality now, which is acceptable.  Service was amazing, the aesthetics are awesome (reminds me of a alternate universe Cheesecake Factory), and the music is at an appropriate level.Food is awesome.  Our party had two orders of fish tacos (one crispy, one grilled), Chicken Monterey, and Enchiladas.  Everything was amazing.And I got a free sample of some amazing gelato.I will be back.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2014,8/28/2014,1,21,2,2,2>Super fun especially the dodgeball section. But bring a towel and a change of clothes. It was my first time so maybe the AC was on the fritz but it was hot. They need to add some fans in the back.Pros: very fun, doing flips, little kids section, foam pits, hitting kids with dodge ballsCons: hot, not much air flow, a bit priceyI would give 5 star if it was not so hot inside
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2014,8/27/2014,19,119,3,2,2>I have driven by this place hundreds of times going to or from work, so today I decided I would try them out for lunch.The burgers are great.  Their signature dish, the Meadowthorpe Burger (or just "Thorpe") is a cheeseburger topped with the normal burger toppings, but also bacon and a fried egg.   It was tasty, fresh and appealing.  The fries were simple mass-production crinkle cuts, which was a little disappointing given the quality of their other dishes.  The place has a charming, down-home ambiance, but seating is a bit complicated as it looks at first like it's got a tiny dining room, but there's a side corridor that opens into another tiny dining room, which has a door which leads to an alcove that opens to another dining room, ect.  It was a little confusing.The biggest downside came from the actual service.  The employees were friendly, there was no problem there, however it does take quite a while to get your food.  I waited 28 minutes from the time I ordered and sat down until my burger showed up, and it wasn't a packed house either.  Also, while they bring your food to your table, you order at the front counter, and there is no table service for things like refills on drinks.For the outstanding burgers and nice atmosphere and generally friendly service I'll give it 4 stars, but it misses out on 5 stars for the slow service, lack of table service and a internal layout that is somewhat confusing or daunting to a first-time visitor.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/2/2014,8/26/2014,8,70,2,4,3>Love the menu, atmosphere, and service. This is a place I recommend for taking people who are visiting from out of town. They have a wonderful patio and the atmosphere is light and fun. The waitstaff and hosts are very friendly. Just try and save room for dessert - It's not the easiest thing to do.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2014,8/25/2014,0,2,1,1,2>I've been a gyro fan for quite some time, and after slugging down the near insufferable, imitation crap you find at the local fairs and craft events for years, I am soooo beyond thrilled to have something legit nearby.  Really nice people who run this place and enthusiastically prepare the food. Large portions, great value, and best of all; damn it tastes good. While the city clamors about the Athenian Grill, this place is really over looked. Ignore the minimal decor, enjoy great food.
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2014,8/24/2014,5,28,2,2,3>I love this theater.  I love the movies they choose to show - you won't see Transformers or Scary Movie 15 here but you will see something beautiful, something thought-provoking, or - my personal favorite - something old that needs to be seen again on a big screen.  The Kentucky's classic movie series is one of the things I most enjoy about summers in Lexington, and if you think people aren't interested in seeing Mary Poppins for the 50th time, just try getting a ticket!I even love the concession options...Lindt and Ghirardelli chocolate bars, beer, wine, mixed drinks, and popcorn that they will be happy to put butter on for you.  After a recent renovation, which left us with nice new seats and, thankfully, not a lot of other changes, it is even more enjoyable to see a film here, and parking is free in the lot behind the theater.Here's a tip:  if you are coming for one of the classic movies, don't wait until the last minute to show up, like everyone else seems to do.  The ticket line stretches waaaaayyyyy down the street and you may not get popcorn until after the movie has started....then you'll be climbing over people in the dark to get to your seat...which makes some people grumpy...and they may or may not "accidentally" trip you on your way by.  I'm not naming names...guy with the fedora and the sweater vest...but some of us had dogs to feed between work and going out so give us a break!I love this theater :-)
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2014,8/23/2014,0,4,1,2,3>Great food! Service is consistent; yeah they're not overly attentive but they have three floors + a patio and one kitchen. Considering the volume of guests id say they do alright. Just know if you go here, be ready to indulge. Dieters beware, pretzels be comin for ya! (They're awesome with ranch!)
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2014,8/22/2014,0,26,1,1,1>The Kentucky Salad is tops.  The steak selection is top drawer, too.  Always a great place to dine with family and friends.  Professional service staff, too!

<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2014,8/19/2014,5,21,4,4,4>This is one of our favorite restaurants in Lexington. the service is consistantly excellent and so is the food. We love going to the buffet on the weekends. I eat mostly asian foods because of my food allergies- its a good place to go for anyone with gluten allergies or intolerances. I haven't had a mediocre dish there yet. I also recommend the dolsot bop. It is awesome.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/16/2014,8/18/2014,43,20,3,4,4>Always a treat.  Great meals and great setup.  Particularly enjoyed the music tonight as well as my meal which included:- truffle fries roasted garlic aioli, fine herbs, parmesan- wild greensroasted pear, warm cheese gateau, crispy onions, balsamic vinaigrette-lime bruleed scallopscreamy corn, bacon and okra chowder, jalapeño polenta.Fantastic environment where the chef is never a stranger.  A true Lexington classic and a MUST for all out of towners!
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/9/2014,8/17/2014,6,19,1,4,3>I've been eating here for years, and it's still one of my favorites.  The lunch buffet is a GREAT deal, and I love that they offer it on the weekends.  I don't know the names of all the items, but I can say that I've tried everything on the buffet and like them all!  I can't give them 5 stars because I have had better Indian food (Deep India in Cincinnati - OMG YUM!).  But for Lexington this is the place to go.The one thing I don't like about this restaurant is the perfume smell.  The last few times I've gone there has been a perfume/air freshener/incense?? smell that is WAY too strong.  It was so strong once that I thought I was going to have to leave.  Like so strong you can't taste your food.This restaurant has changed management since the beginning of the year.  I miss the older man who was always so friendly, but the food has not changed at at.  (Only the new fragrance has changed.)
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2014,8/16/2014,24,33,1,4,2>My bf turned me on to Great Bagel and now it's our weekend morning routine. My usual: toasted everything bagel with plain cream cheese, spinach salad, and coffee with skim milk. Always fresh and delish! Their bagels have a great bite on the outside, a soft chewy middle, and they're always toasted perfectly. My bf gets the American with Lox, and my 6yr old loves the cheese pizza bagel. I've tried a few of their flavored cream cheeses and they're all very tasty. There's a handful of other items I'm excited to try but my favs keep bringing me back:) awesome place to get breakfast or brunch. My bf usually makes the breakfast run so I can't comment on service personally, but he tells me it's always fast, friendly, and with a smile.
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,8/15/2014,18,58,1,2,1>This place is legit. I had the same barber since my dad lifted me in his chair over 30 years ago. When he retired, I was worried. I've been all over several towns in central Kentucky looking for the right cut, getting messed up, and I found the right place here. The price is good, the staff friendly, but most importantly the job was done right. No more bad haircuts for me. I found my barber. I would advise you try this place out too.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2014,8/14/2014,17,22,1,1,1>I have not had better bread anywhere including all over Europe. As a matter of fact this is one of the few places you can get European style / quality bread around here.In Europe (all over Europe) you have bakery on just about every street corner. You can stop in first thing in the morning and buy fresh baked crusty hard breads that are worth of poetry writing. Sunrise does a superb job of bringing those flavors and textures right home here to Lexington.I had the old world sandwich and opted for sopressata & caciacavallo cheese on baguette. It was like a brief return to a deli in Paris. My next trip I want to try their "just make me a sandwich" offering to see what they dream up for me.I took home a baguette, and was able to enjoy my little taste of Europe for a couple day longer! I cannot wait to go back!
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2014,8/13/2014,18,7,2,4,2>I made my first actual visit to this restaurant today and I couldn't be happier! The decor is awesome and it made me feel like I was in a much bigger city! The person who waited on me could not be nicer!! I had one of the best sandwiches of my life..the Caprese! I get this sandwich at different spots in NyC and this one trumped all of them! The bread was fantastic! A garlic focaccia with actual garlic cloves baked on top...plus it was salted! The pesto was perfect as was the mozz and tomatoes! I had another salty caramel cookie...seriously to die for! This has to be one of the best restaurants in Lexington!!
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2014,8/12/2014,13,13,4,4,3>Perhaps the best part of discovering a new option for lunch, dinner, or brunch with really good food, friendly service, reasonable prices, conveniently located and an engaging decor, is that you have many reasons to return--all of them tasty. Such is the case with my latest discovery in downtown Lexington, Limestone Blue. I had heard good things about LB and am pleased to report that those reports are true. I had the Cobb Salad and Raymie Hot Brown Sandwich with a side of BLT Mac 'n' Cheese. For a first time visit, it was a hit on all levels. The Cobb Salad was delicious and you better be hungry--the portion size is more than ample. It is really enough for two people (or one VERY hungry individual). Either one of these selections was more than enough but I was in a sampling mood and as a bonus, now I can enjoy the remaining portions for lunch tomorrow! The Hot Brown was also a great choice and the BLT Mac 'n' Cheese was warm and wonderful. I am looking forward to returning to try other sandwiches and the brunch menu. The server was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is interesting with the various artwork and the overall experience is not trying to be over the top--and I appreciate that. It was a very enjoyable experience and I recommend that if you in downtown Lexington and want a casual, comfortable, good food experience, Limestone Blue is for you.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2014,8/11/2014,144,100,4,4,4>This is your Seattle Coffee Shop right here in Lexington, it is definitely Woohoo! As good as it gets! The owners are beyond extremely friendly and always interacting with the customers. The aroma of coffee can be spread across the shop easy. This shop is across the street from Thoroughbred Park which seems an uncommon area but they have made it work to cater to downtown and UK residents plus businesses around there. They have TWO huge pay it forward walls where you can "pay it forward" for coffee, there are some wacky cards on the wall that would challenge people to sing or dance in front of customers. But that is what makes this place fun and electric. I frequently have Mocha and Americanos and they really taste good. This place is definitely in the top 3 coffee shops in the Lexington area. The only downside that I can think of is space, it can fill up quickly during peak hours forcing you to share tables with others, but hey you might make a new friend here and there. This shop will get you right on the track as a thoroughbred and win the Keeneland race handily ;) *slurping some Mocha right now*
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,8/10/2014,1,10,3,2,2>Consistently a great place to eat!  My Junior Art Vandalay was perfect, and I love the new Pineapple Cucumber salsa.  My (unsweetened) Northern iced tea was great, as always, and the customer service was excellent.  At the salsa bar, it's always fun to mix and match your own salsas;  it's also fun to recommend your favorites to someone who hasn't been there as often.  While my drink of choice is always tea, adults and kids alike love the many selections in the Coke machines.  This restaurant gets 5 stars from me!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2014,8/9/2014,2,2,4,2,2>Laid back atmosphere, great music, fantastic people, and the best steam shave money can buy.  The Nest houses people who love what they do and are damn good at it.  Beyond just haircuts and shaves, you can pick up all you need to learn to shave the "right" way.  Make your grandpa proud and shave like a man.

Mars is my stylist and I have been going to her for over a year now.  She always gets my hair color just right!  I add highlights to my dirty blond hair to make it brighter.  When she shampoos my hair she also does a relaxing scalp massage.The décor is modern and the music not too loud.  This is a great spot to get your hair done.  Ask for Mars!
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2014,8/6/2014,3,10,4,5,3>Once you go Salsarita's you won't go back - to Moe's, Chipotle, or Qdoba. Same concept but fresher and tastier. I was skeptical, "really, another fast casual burrito place?" But I was pleasantly surprised. Had a burrito with chicken, pico, rice, lettuce, jalapeño, and cheese and it was delish. Got the medium salsa for my chips - just enough kick and super fresh. Wife had the Quesarito, basically a burrito buried in queso (can't go wrong with that). And the kids meals come with queso and chips and a dessert doughnut hole dealy. We loved it so much we went back two days later. In sum, go. Especially if you have been a fan of the fast casual burrito genre. You won't be disappointed.

I have been a client of one of the owners/stylists , Nikki, for almost 3 years now and, this is the longest commitment I have had to any stylist! All the staff are very friendly and ready to take care of your hair needs. The salon is small yet has a very open layout with modern/rustic decorations. It's definitely the place to try if you want a stylist who will listen to your hair needs.

You can also choose from 7 shelters for your next event. They rent 7 days a week, the largest shelter accommodates up to 100 people! You can even do it online for added convenience.Its really cleaned up in the past 10 years (new entrance and less parked cars) and, I think, much more inviting for families now.

We had a group of eight and our orders came out correctly, though one lady's burrito was cold.

<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,7/28/2014,37,136,3,3,2>Second best Mexican restaurant around. I ordered the pork tacos with a tamale and cactus. I loved the pork tacos came with rice as a side. With was different to me. Though it was weird the tamale came with sauce on top but I've had places do that. The cactus in the tacos made it so much better! The drinks were a little too strong for my liking. I mean I understand people sometimes want strong drinks but the average person who goes to places will order more than one drink if they can't taste the liquor. Sadly that was one of two fall backs I had about this place. I didn't know they had outside seating till we left because know one asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I still think this place is pretty awesome and will come back for the food.

I get the #1 Smoked Turkey Sandwich on the Rosemary Foccacia bread. The combination of flavors with the turkey, cole slaw, and rosemary bread works very well together. I usually get just the half sandwich and I get the red bean and corn salad for a side. The only downfalls to Courtyard are how busy it is during lunch (great for the business I know, but the wait makes for a short lunch hour for me) and that they don't serve Coca-cola products anymore. The staff are always friendly here and they know a lot of customers by name which is always a great
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/10/2014,7/24/2014,126,65,5,7,3>Its been toooooo long since I've been here.  Home Country cooking in the middle of the city.  They have a huge selection of items including my favorites of kraut and wieners, pinto beans, pickled beets and fried cornbread.  It is real cornbread folks not that sugar infused excuse for cornbread.  The corners of my mouth are filling with saliva right now.  Good God I can barely type!!!!!!   Do get there early because parking can be a little tight at times.  Its not that there isn't enough parking, the place is just that popular.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/9/2014,7/23/2014,44,21,2,4,2>One of my absolute favorite places to get sushi! (I could care less about hibachi)...my only complaint is it's soooo cold. Bring a jacket ladies (and gents). I wish they had a patio.

<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2014,7/21/2014,31,9,3,2,2>Bleu Plate Tours offer a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the rich history and culinary flare of Lexington. As a native Lexingtonian, I truly enjoyed the tour as it allowed me to learn more about the Jefferson Corridor's lovely history. Each tour is unique as it features a different area of town and boasts its culinary strengths. Laura creates an experience for her guests! She structures her Tours to provide walkers with fun surprises along the way. My group visited several establishments that I had yet tried. This feature was definitely a highlight as it kept me engaged and curious of where we would end up next. Laura conducts her tours with a high level of professionalism and is very educated in the history of the city. I would recommend this Tour for entertaining out of town guests such as clients, family, etc. Offered on Saturday and Sunday and lasting about 3 hours, Bleu Plate Tours are worthwhile way to spend an afternoon!
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/29/2014,7/20/2014,6,9,2,9,3>Great atmosphere! Modern contemporary look in the dining room that comfortably holds a large crowd. Quick service from an extremely friendly and knowledgable staff. They are very conscious of food allergies and could accommodate me very easily. I had the Thai Hot Pot and it was wonderful as every bite was full of flavor with the perfect blend of spices. My lunch mates enjoyed spaghetti and meatballs, beef stroganoff (that would rival a mom's recipe), and Alfredo MontAmore (which was had a sweet and hearty flavor).  It is a great new addition to the Lexington food scene with a great price point and lots of options.

<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,7/18/2014,72,175,2,7,2>Open Friday the 2nd of May. Tried it Monday. Very cool place to have a drink of beer or beer and meal. As of right now just Beer, but everything else is coming. I had a Pork Burger, very very good. I also tried three beer you would not find other places around town and liked them all. From the mind of Table 310 operation so that can tell you a lot. Have cheese and meats to try. ( I had country ham shaved and was great ) They also have a set menu Special M-F I think it was. Wednesday Special I might even go try tonight! They will only be adding more and more as they grow. Win for them and Lexington...
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,7/17/2014,43,64,2,5,3>Since it opened a year ago, County club has endeared itself to the culinary community. The decor and atmosphere is casual but hip, and the menu is limited but outstanding. Johnny has a fresh salad composed every day, which ranges from eclectic to nearly predictable but always contains a delicious and tantalizing twist. The best salad I've ever had in my life came from this place. Main courses - along with the sides - have all been perfected and road tested. Of course, there will occasionally be a new addition to the menu, and every day (such as the rotating salad) will feature a new daily special. The helpings are not gargantuan but are worthy of filling you to the point you want another beer, dessert, or both.  Smoked wings are spicy and ample; the pork and brisket are tastefully flavored and served so you can add sauce at your leisure; the poutine is perfect and the burger? One of the best in the business. Craft beer selection isn't extensive but manages to be palette-ranging, eclectic and pairs well with the food. One of the better restaurants you'll run into in these parts....I highly suggest a visit.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2014,7/16/2014,45,95,3,6,4>I struggled between a 4 and 5 star. I would probably have to say 4.5. This was opening day for Wild Eggs here in Lexington. Very clean of course. I sat down at the little bar area in the front. Staff was friendly and manager checked on how people were doing as well. I ordered the Sweet Home Apple Bourbon crepes which were fantastic. Just enough hint if sweetness to them. I had a side of traditional grits which were some of the best I have had. I would rate this a 4.5 due to the pricing. I'm comparing this to first Watch becuase they are similar. The OJ at at First Watch come in a much bigger glass and has the pulp for the same price of around 3.49 I think. Most of the meals are in the 9.99 range before you add a side. That's really my only downside to this visit.  I did enjoy the bar area as I was able to strike up conversation with other patrons as I was by myself. I would definitely go back and try it again. They do have a lot of options!
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2014,7/15/2014,0,1,3,5,4>Everytime I come to Lexington from Memphis I make a stop to pick up some wine. Gary (the owner) is friendly, makes suggestions based off your likes and dislikes. Prices are great and selection never disappoints.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/9/2014,7/14/2014,3,1,,2,1>Ordered the crab rangoon and General Tso combination. It was the hottest food I have had delivered to me. Clearly fresh out of the kitchen with prompt delivery. Also very reasonable price. My only slight complaint is that the chicken tasted more like chicken on a stick rather than general tso (it had no spice to it), but it was still very good. Probably best Chinese delivery place for price and quality of food in town - and that's a lot coming from a crab rangoon connoisseur.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/5/2014,7/13/2014,28,4,,1,>I just left Hibachi Express- my stomach is full and so is my wallet. I got the Hibachi Chicken and Shrimp, it came with rice and veggies. The portions are large, and the service was fast. I paid for my meal as well as my friends and it totaled around $15.00.The restaurant was clean and the employee I spoke to was friendly and helpful. I'll go there again when I'm near campus. The only downside is parking, but that's UK's issue.
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,7/12/2014,12,9,4,6,5>This place is awesome! I usually choose to visit this bar over others because they make the best white Russians, it's clean, staff is friendly, they have live music (excellent live music), and the crowd is of mixed ages. I never feel as if I've stumbled into a frat party, nor do I feel too young. People dress in everything from jeans to suits, so it's very welcoming to everyone. Oh, and they have free popcorn!
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,7/11/2014,106,322,4,8,4>As a fully certified tea nerd, I was a bit worried about how much tea I'd have to order online if there wasn't a local place when I moved here. But enter Montea, a quaint shop that offers an impressive array of loose-leaf teas. Black, green, oolongs, white teas and Rooibos as well as herbals were represented. As a heavy black tea drinker, was impressed with their selection including Kenyan, my favorite Scottish breakfast tea and even Lapsang Souchong. What surprised me pleasantly was how much of a blended tea selection they had. Certainly a gem to have locally and a place I'll frequent. Staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable, too.

They were closed and at first I was sad.  Then I hopped on Yelp! and found Pete's.  It's a further drive from our home but luckily the husband was coming back home via Red Mile, so not too far out of his way.I called and spoke w/ Pete.  He was friendly, answered all my questions and I ordered the following:-General Tso-Kung Po Chicken-Pho-Pad Thai-Fried Dumplings-Crab RangoonTotal order came to around $38 and my husband walked in with two bags of food!  So. Much. Food. Everything we had was fresh, hot and fantastic. When I asked for extra spicy Pete listened and it was perfect.  The Pho was fantastic and I horded it from everyone.  I totally played the, I just had dental work this is all mine on them.  Even though they're out of our way, we will continue to make the drive for Pete's food.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,7/9/2014,8,5,,3,1>Always one of the busiest nail salons in town, and there is a reason. They not only provide exceptional service but it is efficient. There are no TVs (so don't come on game day) and for as busy as it always is, I still seem to find a way to relax. They have 14 massaging pedicure chairs, and 9 manicure stations.  Most of the time I never even have to leave my pedicure chair to get the manicure, as they bring it to me. I've been to several places on the east side of town and I keep coming back here because it's the best.

I usually change it up, and I've never had a dish that I wasn't thrilled to devour every ounce of.If you're craving Tex-mex, look no further. For REAL Mexican food though, definitely try Tapatio Ranchero.

It's a good place to go with a large group just bc the portions are large and sharing isn't totally out of the question. The service has always been fine. Nothing extraordinary but efficient and professional. Great place to have a glass of wine, some pasta and relax after hot summer day

<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/21/2014,7/2/2014,12,84,3,7,2>The service here is friendly and prompt, and definitely the best thing about the restaurant.  The atmosphere could use some improvement.  There were two large TVs loudly playing music videos, fake flowers everywhere, and some odd color choices.  The food was fine, but I prefer the food at other Indian restaurants in the area.  There are pita-like chips served while you wait and they had virtually no flavor.  We ordered Naan and the texture was very strange to me.  It was crisp and flaky rather than the soft, pliable Naan that I'm used to.  The entrees were alright.  The meat and vegetables seemed cooked well, but the sauces were very thin (enough that even with mixed with a LOT of rice, it was hard to eat with a fork).  I really liked the owner and would love to see the restaurant do well, but their food is priced the same as the competition and the quality is lower, so I doubt I'll return.

Known for its exquisite handcrafted selection of gifts and jewelry, this place is nationally known for its selection of both Kentucky crafted and American made jewelry and gifts. The selection is vast and the options are perfect regardless of your budget. They also offer complimentary gift wrapping and will work with you to customize your special gift.

<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2014,6/27/2014,92,166,,2,1>This is a pretty good American Chinese restaurant. They don't put a lot of sugar in everything. I am not a fan of really sweet Chinese food. The gf liked the Kung pao which is great news for me because there are very few restaurants that serve sushi that have anything that she likes. Really enjoyed the hot and sour soup and they have the Chinese mustard that will blow your head off.

They have their own parking lot so don't let the fact that they are located downtown scare you off. When you walk in, the place has a very homey touch. The owner, who lives upstairs, has her dogs in the back and the decor is very "spiritual chick" I read some of the reviews that some customers thought this place was dirty. No it is not. The building is older and has concrete floors but it doesn't make this place dirty.I always want help deciding what I should do with my hair and most hair dressers shy away from discussing it. I guess because they are afraid the customer will hate it and blame them. Angela discussed options with me and told me what she thought would look good. It helped validate my decisions.Angela massaged my scalp with scented oil, shampooed my hair, cut it, thinned it out and it only cost me 35$ I'm definitely coming back.If you want a hair dresser who you can Facebook and make an appointment, will remember your name and talk to you about any subject while you are in her chair go to The Hive.
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,6/24/2014,53,24,2,5,3>This is a great local firearms store that offers full service sales and maintenance, concealed carry and weapons safety courses, and has a great indoor shooting range for rifles and handguns. I bought both my Smith & Wesson M&P pistol and CZ Mallard shotgun from Semper Fi. Nick Huzl helped me out both times and was very friendly and knowledgable. They had to special order my CZ shotgun, but that was at no extra cost to me and it arrived very quickly to the store. The main floor area of the store is very open and clean. They have a wide variety of firearm accessories including holsters, cleaning gear, replacement stocks and grips, lasers, fibre sights, scopes, etc... There is even a few couches by the range counter for your lounging pleasure if you have to wait for a range lane to open. Speaking of the range - if you've ever wanted to try out an AK or maybe a different style pistol, they have various weapons available for you to borrow. This shop is superb in my opinion, and I have been to quite a few firearms stores. I cannot see myself purchasing another firearm from any other store.

<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2014,6/17/2014,23,4,2,5,2>Love that Lexington has a really good Latin fusion restaurant however, the mojitos and caipirinhas are lacking. Caipirinhas should knock your socks off. Secondly, I LOVE the Argentinian Steak Chimichurri. It is phenomenal!  The queso fresco is awesome and I crave it sometimes. Definitely one of my favs. Lastly, the Cuban Sandwich. Please please please order some REAL traditional Cuban bread. I'm from Tampa and I grew up on Cuban sandwiches in Ybor City. This is what makes the sandwich complete!  Other than that...great new place and I know they are still fine tuning things.  We will visit often. Oh and where's the Key Lime Pie??? ;-)

I am not sure if it is the dry rub that they put on the chicken before grilling but it is so tasty. I do not usually like chicken dishes but my Mom kept insisting on trying this chicken. The owner is extremely nice!!! We usually go on Wednesday because they have a deal, buy 1 whole chicken, get 1/2 for free. You can get just the chicken that comes with corn or flour tortillas with salsa or you can get the Family meal with chicken, tortillas, salsa and sides like refried beans, cabbage. The chicken is made hot so you may have to wait just a bit for piping hot food. Please check this place out.

If you are limited on funds and hunger to go here cause you get awesome amount of food for the price. So I went there afterwards limited on funds and was surprised that anything on the buffet was a $1 a heaping scoop and drinks only $1.39. The food was really good tasting. Its a place where you have to go into it cause from looking outside it dont look like much of anything. The staff is friendly and its always clean. Good Food.

<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/1/2014,6/9/2014,6,9,,2,2>Today's trip to The Pub brought some fun new tastes. I had a black bean burger with the Young's Chocolate stout BBQ sauce. This was a delightful marriage of flavors that mixed the spicy heat of the burger with a sweet tang of the sauce. Add in caramelized  onions, cheddar and bacon and it became a tour de force on the palette. No, the mix of a vegetarian black bean burger and bacon is not lost in me, however the flavors are very complementary.Add in a nice IPA from the wide beer list and it makes a yummy meal!

The have super sumptuous spinach naan, fantastic Rogan Josh, and heat ratings that make sense. I think it's a great place.Here's a few things I'd change: Turn off that damn TV. Most people want to talk to each other at dinner. Not watch television. It's VERY disruptive. Replace it with some light Indian music.If your staff wants to watch television, that's fine, but put it away from customers. Or better, buy them an iPad and let them watch TV at the register. A couple of the booths have weak backs, meaning that when another patron behind you moves, you get bumped forward. Repair the booth seats.Here's an idea-Why not pay the staff to repair and clean while waiting for customers, rather than having them sit back and watch television. If you improve the shop, you'll pull more customers, if you DON'T manage to pull customers, when you have to liquidate your stuff it'll be worth more.Overall - Great food, pretty decent service, fix the environment, please.

Bourbon n' Toulouse is a definitely local staple that Lexington can be proud of!They have several options for people to work with which are: full order, half/half order or just one half order. This is an absolutely heaven if you are a vegetarian or a carnivore. This place works perfectly for my rabbit eating girlfriend and this guy with a chicken saber tooth. Obviously, the goal is to be Cajun as possible but the food can tailor to those that don't like spicy food like me.I usually opt for half/half order which composes of black beans/caramelized corns and chicken creole. It goes on top of white rice and their delicate homemade delish bread with some kind of butter.We came here on Fat Tuesday, they do sell Kings Cake!!!!Some tips: Download the Campus Connection app and get $1 off your meal which would be either 6.50 or 7.50 and Moocho to pay for your meal and collect points, you can even knock off $3 with 3 moochos.This place can stir up some drunken NOLA memories you had or want that experience. Who Dey???? The Best of Lexington Cajun's joint and cheap eats!

<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,6/2/2014,0,2,,2,1>This winery is located on a beautiful spot. The decor is lovely as are the workers. They gave great recommendations! For $5 you can taste six different wines. It was a wonderful stop on our way out of Lexington. The workers were setting up for a wedding while we were there but still gave us full attention. I would definitely stop again.
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2014,6/1/2014,13,13,1,5,3>Hall's has been a favorite of Central Kentucky diners for more than four decades. Located approximately 25 minutes from Lexington in nearby Winchester, Hall's is legendary for its "beer cheese" dip---one of the most popular brands in Kentucky. I had not been to Hall's for several years but decided to check it out to see if it is still worth the trip. I am happy to report my experience did not disappoint. The drive from Lexington is scenic and due to the somewhat remote location, Hall's is definitely more of a destination restaurant than an impulse visit.On this particular evening, the weather was ideal for outside dining so I opted for a table on Hall's large and spacious deck which overlooks the Kentucky river. Hall's is large and can easily accommodate crowds and large parties of 8-10. Watching people canoeing along the river and the perfect weather definitely added to the experience. In addition, my server, Ashley, was warm, friendly, and attentive. The manager (owner?) also stopped by twice during my visit to make sure everything was OK. I ordered the Fried Banana Peppers--a Central Kentucky favorite for an appetizer. They were served hot with cocktail sauce and were large and tasty. If you like Banana Peppers, you will definitely like Hall's version.I also ordered the Cornbread Salad and instead of the recommended dressings I chose the Bourbon Orange Vinaigrette. This salad consists of mixed greens with homemade cornbread, scallions, and bacon. Two thumbs up!For my entree I went with the Fried Frog Legs with "Smashed" Potatoes and Onion Rings. I was curious about the onion rings and they were lightly breaded and delicious. The potatoes were also quite good with bits of potato skins throughout. The frog legs, four of them, were plump and also lightly breaded and very filling. Hall's is clearly Southern comfort food and I enjoyed everything I sampled and had lots leftover. The combination of good food, scenic view, and excellent service makes Hall's worth the trip and I plan to go back soon and try other items on the menu. I was somewhat surprised that Hall's apparently does not offer desserts. I did not see any listed on the menu. Nor do they serve any type of bread with the meal. A bit surprising for Southern comfort fare. I would recommend that Hall's consider serving their cornbead with each meal. It was a nice touch to the Cornbread Salad and would make for an excellent stand alone offering. If you have never been to Hall's, the beer cheese platter is a must to indoctrinate you to the true Hall's experience!

<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,5/30/2014,18,58,,2,1>This is one of my favorite things about Lexington. Open year round, the Farmer's Market is most vibrant in the sunny seasons. It's a great experience.
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/30/2014,5/29/2014,30,77,3,4,3>The atmosphere is the best part of this restaurant.  You walk into a former church with stained glass, dark wood, and typical pizza place red booths. It's not an annoying hipster contrived look, it's a place that has character.  It's a great place for a casual date or to hang out with friends and family.  However, the bathrooms are in desperate need of a remodel.Yesterday I had the spaghetti with meat sauce lunch special.  For $6.95 that included the pasta, one of their huge garlic breadsticks, and a small green salad-a great value for that price!  The breadstick was thick, warm, and served in a metal tin with the garlic butter sauce underneath.  This breadstick is what Joe Bologna's is famous for, and deservedly so.  My salad looked on the brink of going bad, but still fresh enough to eat and the pasta was good.
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,5/28/2014,0,12,,2,1>I love eating at Smashing Tomato. It is a great place to eat when you aren't looking for upscale but don't want fast food. The service has always been prompt and the pizzas are great. If you are looking for traditional American style pizzas this is not the place for you. The pizzas are very thin crust, wood fired, very traditional Italian style. Usually my wife and I split two pizzas and wine for less than $30. Two thumbs up from us!
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/24/2014,5/27/2014,163,88,2,3,2>Certainly better than the Richmond road location as far as ease of access and parking. The staff here seems to be slightly better trained as well. The food, upscale Denny's esque. Nothing more to be expected from a chain really. The facility is nice and new. Easy access to Winchester road and I75.
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2014,5/26/2014,48,135,3,8,4>Great barbeque, packed full of great flavors. The meat is smoked daily so they are likely to run out at the end of a busy day. This only makes me more excited knowing that I'm getting served something of good quality. Ribs and brisket are my favorite. I enjoy the three sauce options provided on the table; spicy, sweet and tangy.  Spicy BBQ sauce is a must try! I personally like mixing all three of the sauces for the meat and for the potato salad, I like adding a little bit of the tangy sauce to hit the right spot!  I like the simplicity and the quality offered at the Blue Door Smokehouse.
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,5/25/2014,7,3,2,4,3>I've been to Blossom several times this year. They are so helpful to a Dad-to-be. The staff is personable and very knowledgeable. Especially when you feel out of water just being in there as a Dad. :)
<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2013,5/24/2014,5,58,,3,2>Very impressed with this place! The fried green tomato salad had one of the best FGTs I've ever had. I had the scallops, cooked perfectly with a generous helping of mashed potatoes and buerre blanc. My husband's duck was mouth-watering. And the chocolate fondant for dessert was decadent without being overwhelming. The portions were just right - I wasn't quite able to clean my plate but I didn't feel like I was wasting food either. We were there on a slow weeknight so there was no problem with the service. This will definitely be at the top of my special-occasion restaurant list.
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/1/2013,5/23/2014,3,8,,9,2>Very professional iPhone repair service. The quality of the parts and the expert installation are as good and much more cost effective than any other iPhone repair service available anywhere. Including Apple.Excellent customer service. I texted for an appointment time. They responded right away and my iPhone screen was  replaced  like new in about 15 minutes while I waited.I highly recommend this business if you need any Apple device repaired.
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/13/2014,5/22/2014,0,11,,5,2>Soo good! We love Italian, and this is definitely the best in Lexington. It's pricey, but the atmosphere is great, especially when there's live music playing. The food is always wonderful--especially the gnocchi. I'd give Guiseppe's five stars except we've witnessed a couple of issues where hostesses have been snotty to people for no other apparent reason than the customer's appearance. There's no reason to behave like that ever, of course. Especially for a place with food and service this good, the behavior of the hostesses is hard to reconcile.
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,5/21/2014,0,8,,3,2>Great food, great atmosphere, you can never go wrong. I had dined at Dudley's multiple times and I cannot remember one single day that I didn't like what I've ordered. I think with the decline of other "upscale" restaurants in Lexington (had a bad experience in a couple lately that used to be great), Dudley's is in a level of his own, now. Oh, and for beer drinkers who like their beer very very cold, Dudley's is also the best place. And the wine list is the best in town.
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2014,5/20/2014,203,177,2,6,4>You know that scene where Dorothy emerges from her house and enters the technicolor world of Oz? Yeah? Well that's how you might feel when you enter the front door of El Gran Tako. It's a whole new world, a dazzling place you never knew.Here's what you need to know: 1) Tacos are legit. SO legit. These folks don't mess around with the junk that Americans stuff in tacos. El Gran Tako serves up simple, double layer corn tortillas stuffed with juicy, well-seasoned meats. Cilantro and salsa are the only toppings you might want to add. The homemade sauces are excellent. The tacos are cheap (two bucks each) and delicious!2) No English. Of course, some of the employees understand basic English words, but Spanish is dominant. I was the only non-Spanish speaker in the restaurant at lunchtime. Menu, TVs, signs, EVERYTHING was in Spanish.3) Seat yourself when you go in. I made the mistake of assuming you have to order at the register when you go in. False. You actually just grab a seat anywhere and a lady gets your order. I didn't see anyone ask for a menu, as everyone seemed to be a regular. But I'm sure someone would bring you a menu if you look confused enough. You might think this area of town is scarier than a Kansas tornado, but give it a try. You'll find yourself following the yellow brick road back to El Gran Tako again and again.

<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,5/18/2014,45,25,1,4,3>The food is really delicious and they use fresh vegetables. The portions are huge so you definitely won't leave here hungry. The atmosphere is nice, the restaurant is clean and I've never had a bad waiter at this location. I had the Hot Brown. It's smothered in cheese and has tomato & bacon on it. Definitely a unique dish to try if you've never had it.

<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/16/2013,5/16/2014,0,4,,3,2>Came here for lunch and had a pork BBQ sandwich, small portion of potato salad and a drink. It was good, however a little over priced for what you get I thought. ($10.32)   Might try to come back for dinner sometime to see if that's any better. Food was good though.
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,5/15/2014,18,134,2,4,3>A couple friends and I saw Les Miserables here a while back.  It was a great show, but this review is more concerned with the building/staff.Getting tickets was easy, and the student discount were great.  The box office staff were friendly.  The seats we had were a little nose-bleed, but the acoustics were fine even up in the balcony.The usher staff there were friendly, and they helped us find our seats, like you'd expect.The beauty of the main room was noticeable.  It's amazing to see such a gem in Lexington.  The ornate room was wide open, and you could easily see the whole stage.  When you go, take a moment to look at the interior!I definitely want to see another show here, before I graduate.  I'll be back!
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/7/2014,5/14/2014,16,56,2,4,3>Excellent pub grub in a pleasing and well-maintained environment.  Service is usually top-shelf.  A bonus is that you can order off of the Malone's menu or the sushi menu, so if someone in your group is jonesing for a steak, and you want a California roll and edamame, no problem:  everyone can have what they want.  My favorites from the Harry's menu include mini cheeseburgers, nachos and the buffalo chicken quesadilla.  Harry's has lots of TVs if you want to catch a game, and they have an awesome enclosed patio area that is open year-round.
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2014,5/13/2014,7,25,,4,3>Food grown and raised just down the street. In the old broomcraft building (in front of Seabury Center), very nicely renovated. Students appear to be involved in every facet. Watch through the window as lads and lasses in lab coats make sausage! Besides its own meats, veggies, grains, legumes, honey, and baked goods, offerings are rounded out by some regionally produced cheese, pasta, misc sauces and condiments, as well as soaps and other products for the epidermis. And seeds! Awesome idea, well executed. Way to go, BC.
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,5/12/2014,0,1,,2,1>Easily the best beer selection in Lexington. Great atmosphere. The Manager, Kevin Patterson, is THE source of beer knowledge too.

<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,5/10/2014,37,136,,5,3>So I came here with a few friends yesterday and I've never been before. Well I was impressed just walking in the door. They lady at the door had a big smile and said welcome to cheddars. While walking up to her I notice in the air how they had this cool paddle looking thing just spinning in the air. Like come on that's awesome! We sat down and the server came up and asked us what we would like to drink. I ordered a dr pepper. She came back in less then 2 minutes with our drinks. Next we ordered out food. I got the smokehouse burger, or it was the steakhouse burger. But over all we got the food and she asked me if the food came out just right. I looked over the burger and fries and everything was cooked just right. I took a bit of my burger and I was so in heaven.. One of the nest flavors all put in one burger. The onions and sauce they use on it was just right. The server came by every 5 minutes or so to make sure we had full drinks and to take the plates way. This will be a place I will be coming back time after time.
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,5/9/2014,9,41,2,5,5>I love the salad bar at Village Host! It is always very well stocked with lots of veggies and a variety of other toppings. The Parmesan Peppercorn dressing is very good and I appreciate that they provide small containers to allow me to have my salad dressing on the side. We have also tried several pizzas and sandwiches all of which were good, but I go back for the salad bar!
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2014,5/8/2014,126,65,1,9,7>The menu items are consistently fabulous.  The rotating menu keeps the menu fresh and interesting.  The wines are made by the winery and have never failed to please my palate.  They encourage you to walk around the vineyard while you're waiting on your meal. Occasionally you will see the Jean Farris chickens wandering around the vines.  The sunset always looks wonderful from the patio and the staff will remember who you are.  We have never had bad service and always enjoy talking to the staff.  A Kentucky gem not to be missed.
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/14/2014,5/7/2014,142,104,3,6,5>Noodles Galore! From Caramelized Udon to sweet and creamy coconut  rice noodles! Holy Moly  you could die and be in noodle heaven in the blink of an eye!!!. You absolutely can bring everyone to this restaurant! There is a dish for all discerning tastes! Creamy luscious sauces and Wonderful toppings! The shredded pork was super Yum ! One of my Favs is the Med Sandwich and the Med salad. The dressing on these is savory and tastey.  Even better is there commitment to investing in the community by using local fresh products and donations of food to local shelters! Hats of to you Noodles and Company!!!
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/21/2013,5/6/2014,72,175,2,7,3>1st trip to County Club for me and it was for Brunch. first let me say, for sure I would be back as what I had was very good. Was a open face egg sandwich with gravy and such. Coffee was good ( big deal to me ) but I did not have a easy time getting refill. Also the couple I was with got OJ and it was in a glass that each sip you needed a refill and they also had a hard time getting refill. I look for the best I like to think. New place its hard to judge how much traffic you will or will not have, so hard to staff. This day they had a large party and not enough people would be my guess. So I gave them a break, now the couple I was with not so much. Also  being new I would say is the reason the menu is limited right now, I hope so, I don't eat a lot of meat but like the place, maybe just a brunch place for me
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/29/2014,5/5/2014,20,75,,6,3>This is our new favorite Indian restaurant in Lexington. You'll recognize a lot of the old staff from the original Beaumont Masala here, and I think the great chef must have come over, too, because the food is wonderful. I've eaten here a few times now and the flavors are great. I tend to get the vegetable patia with some kind of naan bread. I end up with leftovers because there's plenty of food, and the vegetables turn out very nicely cooked: they're not mush but they're not undercooked, either. Good spice level. It has an open-feeling interior with good lighting, and the staff are friendly. The waiter was attentive to our drinks, always keeping them filled, and the server is the same bubbly, smiling face I remember from Masala. The prices are what you see at Tandoor, Masala, etc; I think it was $10.50 for vegetable patia.
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,5/4/2014,1,1,2,4,3>Love the food and the environment is really cool! Great service and great food! The spicy beef is legit and the fresh orange juice is fantastic. Check this place out; you will not be disappointed!
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,5/3/2014,45,95,2,5,3>Still my favorite fro-yo place in town. They have some new flavors when I went into today. They always have the white chocolate wonder which I always get. They had a pink lemonade sherbet, Rice Krispie, pecan peanut butter which I tried all of these and they were great. They have always had 100 rating on health inspection so that rates top with me. The gentleman that is always behind the counter when I go is one of the owners and he is very nice and friendly, something you don't always get with other places that have high school or college kids manning the register.
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2014,5/2/2014,28,161,2,9,4>Let me start off by saying our small party of five had plans to eat at another Italian eatery near Bella Notte, but the wait time was 45 minutes.  I was not too keen on the other place since their greeters were a bit rude and stand offish when we walked in.  I got the "pfft more people, really" vibe.  We decided to head over the Bella Notte to try it out and I am so thrilled that we did.Fresh Mozzarella Fritto - Family Size - The breading was very good and did not over power the mozzarella.  The sauce was fantastic as well.Smoked Salmon Croquettes - OH MY GOODNESS!  - Very savory and very good and did not last very long.Alfredo - was the best my husband has ever had and he's rather snobby when it comes to his sauces.Aha Tuna - was perfectly cooked and the smashed potatoes was a real treat.We had drinks, fed a party of five for $115, we never felt rushed and the waitress was a delight.  The atmosphere was casual and had a personal feel.  Noise level was perfect, we could carry on a conversation with our dinner without yelling or having to lip read most of the time.All in all we had a very enjoyable evening and look forward to visiting again in the near future.

Having discovered it at North Lime Coffee and Donuts, I fell in love with several blends, my favorite being the Guatemala Blend. It is a very smooth coffee with a wonderful aroma that you'll love waking up to. My mother tried Nate's Coffee and now makes a point to stop by and get more whenever she's in town. lol.. It's just that good.
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/14/2013,4/26/2014,0,5,2,6,3>I first tried Windy Corner Market early in 2013 and was immediately impressed by the quality of food. The baked goods in particular deserve mention: the bread in everything I've tried complimented the dish and was delicious in its own right. The seafood (I've tried the fried oyster po' boy and the shrimp and grits) was surprisingly good considering the location in the middle of Kentucky farmland. The barbecue is tasty and like most menu options is sourced from in Kentucky. There are many healthy options: the steamed dishes are well-balanced and well-cooked.The walls are lined with local market products and bulk foods, and while I have no interest in buying a gallon of mayonnaise there are many hard-to-find delicacies like canned possum and Screamin' Mimi's Salsa to browse and buy. There are also many baked goods on display behind the counter. I look forward to trying all of their cookies, pies, and scones; every one I've had so far has been great. Their menu is large, but everything I've tried so far has been good and I look forward to returning.

The service was cordial and efficient and the food was good. The decor and atmosphere were quite tasteful especially for the price also. While I would not consider Coba my favorite Mexican restaurant, I would consider it an excellent value for the money.
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/17/2014,4/24/2014,10,7,,3,2>What I love: The elegant atmosphere is perfect for date night. I'm a sucker for the sushi conveyor belt gimmick. The waitstaff is very professional and efficient. Although I haven't tried the French options on the menu, they look great and helped convinced anti-sushi friend to eat at a sushi restaurant.What I like: The sushi itself is okay, not bad enough to complain about, but not so great that I crave it. The standard rolls and sushi are done competently, but lack the freshness of a great sushi restaurant. The special rolls are better.Verdict: School is good, worth eating at, but not a favorite.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/19/2014,4/23/2014,12,84,,3,2>Doing the bulk of our grocery shopping here would devastate my family's grocery budget, but they do have some great items and their bulk section is a very affordable option.  Shopping their produce sales also works well for us as the sale prices are often quite reasonable for high quality produce.Their staff is amazing!  They are always friendly, helpful, and seem truly happy to be at work!  Also, their special events are fantastic.  My husband and I frequent their "Flights After Five" ($4 gets you generous samples of 5 beers and paired snacks), and have attended a couple of their lunch events that raise money for charity.Honestly, they are so much more than a grocery store, and I have a lot of affection for them.

<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2013,4/20/2014,19,119,,5,2>Wow, an instant favorite.I was nearby having my car worked on at Greens, and was hungry for dinner.  This was the first place down the street that was there.It's a little hole-in-the-wall taco joint.  The menu is in English and Spanish (and the English menu omits about half the meats they offer.  Admittedly most English speakers wouldn't want tripe or tongue tacos, but they do have chorizo and lamb if you ask, even if it's not on the English menu).It's tasty, very authentic, and pretty affordable ($1.75 per taco).  I haven't tried the tortas yet, but they looked very tasty too.  They also have that nice Mexican coca-cola.A very good place to pick up a tasty meal if you're in the neighborhood.

<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2014,4/18/2014,19,27,,5,3>The food is great. Mexican places usually fall either in the bleh category or the great, and this one is definitely good. The extra sauces they bring out really help out with the taste and the wait staff was friendly. For the price, you can't do much better than this.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2013,4/17/2014,5,99,,3,2>The hominess, awesome food, homemade sodas, good service, and reasonable prices makes this place a must. I thought we had it made up here in Cinci for a burger scene but the lamb burger with Kentucky blue was perfect--nice bun, good tomatoes, perfectly seasoned juicy lamb...DANG! My wife got the hot brown which was great too--super rich cream sauce.Wanted to try all the sodas they had, but will have to come back.
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2014,4/15/2014,53,24,2,5,3>I always have a good time at Tin Roof.  Most recently, I was there for the NCAA Championship basketball game.  Unfortunately I didn't get there early enough to get inside the actual bar, but they had a great setup outside with an enormous LED jumbotron type TV and another 70"+ screen under a huge outdoor tent - think "outdoor wedding tent."  They had beer available at the outdoor bar, but unfortunately they were not prepared to accept debit/credit cards outside.  Various times throughout the year Tin Roof hosts some decently known bands, and it is very cool to see such performances for a significantly lower price than a ticket to a standard concert venue.They usually have some sort of drink special - especially during the summer months and during football season.As this location is pretty much across the street from a major university, there should be no surprise about the makeup of the patrons here.  But like I said, I always have a good time at Tin Roof!
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/2/2014,4/14/2014,7,12,2,7,3>Homemade food, relaxed atmosphere, nothing too fancy, friendly service. I like the fact that I ordered from the lady who makes the baked goods - a truly small local business. The menu is not huge, but everything I have tried has been good. I'd recommend the hot chocolate - it is rich and chocolatey the way this beverage should be.
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2014,4/13/2014,6,9,2,5,3>This is my lunch and occasional dinner, go to spot and has been since they opened their doors. The food is consistent in quality. They allow for many variations and customizations to most things on the menu, which keeps it interesting. The avocado fries are a unique find and worth a try. Their made to order pizzas, especially beer cheese and fried green tomato w/ bacon, are fantastic. The service is always fast and friendly and they remember their regulars and orders. The beer taps serving local and a few regular drafts and wine make a nice touch.
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2014,4/12/2014,7,13,3,5,4>Awesome wings, never small in size.    The homemade bleu cheese rocks, I always buy a jar to take home; best stuff ever (and I used to hate bleu cheese!).   My daughter loves the mac n' cheese bites combo meal, definite fave.   If you love Greek salads, this one is a must try, as is the garlic Italian dressing that goes with it.   Plenty of huge tv's to catch your favorite team too!   In a nutshell, yes, we're fans of Rooster's!    GO BIG BLUE!  BBN!
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,4/11/2014,14,25,1,4,3>Thank you fellow yelpers. I read your reviews and once again they led me in the right direction.  The first thing I need to comment on is the atmosphere.  Low lighting, minimal design,  and very intimate.  It would be a great place for a date. The owners were very friendly, and suggested a sake for me that almost knocked me out of my chair it tasted so good.  The food was very good and the ingredients were obviously of very high quality.  Unfortunately, I had eaten just a little while before being invited out on the spur of the moment, so I didn't get to really sample the much of the menu.  I'll definitely be going back on an empty stomach so I can give it a fifth star.
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2014,4/10/2014,8,48,,5,2>Great food and a really good atmosphere!! The house dressing is very good its a honey mustard and hot bacon together!! They give you pretty big portions because I'm always taking some home!!!  It's a definite try and just a short drive from Lexington!
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/4/2014,4/9/2014,12,25,,4,2>Good clean restaurant!! Burgers were great! We really enjoyed it alot. We will go again! Only one way to make this five stars, the fries were not HOT! I like my fries straight out of the grease. If the fries were hot along with the great tasting burger then they would have been spot on. We did have a bit of a wait, which wouldn't have been an issue if we had gotten hot fries...
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/6/2014,4/8/2014,4,28,2,7,4>Really good food and a nice atmosphere.  Didn't realize it was set up to be able to order off of 3 menus.  We started with Spicy Shrimp Roll from Aqua which was good but cut poorly (different sizes).  My wife had a gnocchi special that she loved.  I had the Kobe burger which was one of the best burgers I have ever had! I thought it was really cool that all 3 restaurants were available to order from...we sat in Malone's and ordered entrees off of their menu, but you have choice of Aqua (sushi) and Harry's ( bar food) too....you can sit where you want depending on what type of atmosphere you are looking for.  All in all it was a great choice!
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/31/2014,4/6/2014,24,13,,5,3>This place rocks! My husband and I went for breakfast, and everything was amazing. We ordered the ham and cheese croissant, a chorizo goat cheese pastry, a sweet and salty cookie, an eclair, and this really cool baguette that consisted of a bunch of miniature baguettes made into one large one. The cookie was one of the best I've had--very dense and chewy with pretzel pieces, chocolate, and toffee. Oh. Em. Gee.It's a beautiful space, very industrial and modern. Also, they have a bunch of fun jams, chocolates, and coffee to browse about. I'll have to go back for a cake. They're dead on the type of cakes you see at Milkbar in New York. The only problem is they don't do slices, so you have to justify spending around $30 for a whole cake, which wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2014,4/5/2014,9,4,,5,2>My husband and I decided to try Enoteca on a Friday night. We got there around 6:45, and while all of the tables were taken we easily found a spot at the bar as soon as we walked in. I have to say, I'm a huge fan of the atmosphere. It was quiet enough that I was able to talk to my husband without raising my voice at all. I was sitting next to a couple of women but didn't feel as though I was eavesdropping on their conversation. The bartender was very friendly, and the service was great. In addition to a few glasses of wine (all red, all delicious) we tried 4 of the tapas. The stuffed mushrooms (which were one of the tapas of the day), brussels sprouts with a manchego cheese sauce, the meatballs madrilena, and the chorizo puffs. Oh my god, the mushrooms. We ended up ordering a second round of those because of how delicious they were. Savory with an amazing white wine, butter and garlic sauce. So good. The brussels sprouts were roasted and the manchego cheese sauce was rich and creamy. The meatballs were good, but not great - the tomato sauce they came with was delicious, but to be honest I'm not a huge meatball fan so I'm not the best judge. The chorizo puffs were also ok. The mustard dipping sauce was good, but I would have liked more chorizo. That being said, we'll definitely be back. I liked that there were stars next to the wines you could walk across the street and buy. Can't wait to come back when the weather is nice and we can sit outside and enjoy a glass of wine and some delicious tapas.

Reiki has added so much to my life and my work as an LMT. Vickie's personable and easy-going disposition makes her very approachable and she's always willing to help. I can't wait to try an akashic records session!
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,4/3/2014,12,5,1,6,4>One of my favorite spots in Lexington.  Typical bar food, but the atmosphere is fun.  Love the Irish Nachos and the burger is among the best tasting in Lexington.  Great local crowd, good music, trivia nights, and great food make this one of my go to places in all of Lexington.  If you're visiting from out of town and want good food, good drinks, and a great local atmosphere then you need to stop in.  Menu recommendations:  Irish Nachos, Burger, Chicken thingies, Cajun Grilled chicken sandwich, BLT, Chili, and the Club.  Buffalo chicken dip is also a great appetizer. One more thing, if you're in Lexington on St Patrick's day then this is a must.
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,4/1/2014,4,31,2,4,4>Super fresh lobster rolls!! Shared  the shellfish extravaganza and was able to try the lobster, shrimp and crab. It was more than enough for two people.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,3/31/2014,15,28,2,5,4>Great food and really good service. It was actually a bit more upscale than I had thought it would be. Everything was delicious and the bill was very reasonable.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2014,3/30/2014,11,26,1,4,2>One of my favorite brunch spots in town!  It has a definite KY atmoshpere and is a wonderful spot to bring out of town guests.  I would recommend the 2-2-2  which has 2 eggs any style, 2 pancakes, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage.  It is a tasty breakfast that provides a great start to any morning/afternoon.  The dining area is on the smaller side, so there is typically a bit of a wait on the weekends.  It is well worth it though!!
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/23/2014,3/29/2014,0,3,2,6,4>Pete's Wok from the outside looks like a no-frills, run-of-the-mill, Asian take-out place. Even on the inside the plastic table cloths don't do much to elevate expectations. However, once you place your order and start to smell the fresh chopped onions wafting from the kitchen, expectations are transformed into anticipation. This BiBung is a refreshing vermicelli with sliced pork and a delicious mound of fresh vegetables topped with a light  spicy, sweet, and tangy (maybe even pungent but in a great way) sauce. My roommate had the KungPao Chicken and it was far less syrupy than anything around and was full of vegetables; it was a welcome change.  Pete's Wok has definitely joined my regular restaurant rotation. You should try their Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine sooner rather than later. #sharethelex #vietnamese
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2014,3/28/2014,22,65,2,5,3>Saul Good has quickly become on of my favorite Lexington establishments.  They have clearly built a successful brand with 3 locations open now, and it's not hard to see why.  The burgers are very flavorful, the french fries are unique and well executed, the appetizers I've had are a nice twist from the typical fare, the wedge salad might be the best in town, and even the tuna salad on pita bread is excellent.  And dessert?  You cannot go wrong with any choice.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,3/27/2014,44,21,2,5,3>As far as donut's go...this is the place! Always have fun, interesting donut options on the menu, like maple bacon or lucky charms.I personally am a good ol' fashion glazed kind of gal. Staff is always friendly and quick! The place is small and can get packed quickly.
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2014,3/26/2014,6,8,2,7,5>I've never had a bad experience here. The food is always fantastic, the service is quick, and the prices are very reasonable. Also, great atmosphere.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2014,3/25/2014,144,100,1,5,3>This place is definitely Paris in Lexington, our own Eiffel, Louvre, Champs de Elysee landmark. This lovely place is right across from Woodland Park which can certainly give you a French feel in a historical home and you can be led to be believed that you are in Paris but it is in Lexington. The crepes come with plethora of choices of vegetables, meats and cheeses which can delight any savory mouths with a saber tooth. The dessert crepes can just make an evening divine, I personally love the chocolate gauche and bourbon sauce (How can we deny some Kentuckian flavor here?)The place has hardwood floors and has candles all over making the decor romantic and a very good first date location. You can not really beat the crepes here and I would not hesitate to name this the best Crepe place in the Commonwealth. Paris ooh la la is pretty much alive here, so put on your French fedora and turtlenecks on, head over here and you will be singing "Bon appetit," after dining here. A definitely five star local jewel that everyone must try to dine here if they live or visit Lexington.
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,3/24/2014,6,19,3,6,5>This is the best froyo place in Lexington.  The other places around town might look snazzy, but Fro-Jo tastes the best and is most affordable (their peanut butter is SO GOOD!).  At other frozen yogurt shops I always think, "wow, this is $5 worth!?" but at Fro-Jo I'm always pleasantly surprised it ISN'T costing me $5.My only complaint is that they use styrofoam containers.  Really???  It's 2014...
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2014,3/23/2014,1,7,1,7,4>A hidden gem. International meats and cheeses (goat gouda cheese!!!), great wines (the owner is a sommelier), excellent selection of craft beers in bottles, delicious macaroons, interesting/unique sandwiches, Friday wine tastings and to top it all off - I think the staff is exceptionally friendly. Given the ambiance of the place, you might expect to walk in to 'snooty' folks, but not true here. It may have some French attributes, but not the attitude! Would recommend for lunch, a nice charcuterie tray for a gathering or a nice bottle of wine.

<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,3/21/2014,92,166,4,10,3>When you go to the back of an American grocery store you will find fried chicken and meatloaf. When you go to the back of this grocery you find bib im bop, ban chan and other Korean favorites. I like fried chicken, who doesn't, but how many fat Koreans have you ever seen. Ok, besides Psy. This grocery was the cleanest Asian market of any kind I've ever been in. Floors, walls, ceilings all very clean. Someone cares a great deal about this place. My only suggestion is that I wish they had a lunch menu. Slightly smaller portions for a little less. I usually have lunch alone and these portions are huge. I don't mind having two pounds of leftover pork bul goke so this isn't a hanging matter.
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2014,3/20/2014,48,135,2,4,3>Francesca's always has a colorful and unique selection of clothing and accessories that I don't find in other stores. That's probably the first reason I keep going back because I know something unique is waiting for me there. I also enjoy looking through the fun novelty items they carry in store, such as random silly coupon books for friends or couples, girly drink cozies, etc. This is the second Francesca's in Lexington. I definitely prefer this location because it is away from the mall crowd. Because of the laid back atmosphere, the staff seem to have more time to help costumers with questions. This is one of those places I would enjoy going back for a relaxing shopping experience.
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/15/2014,3/18/2014,4,38,3,6,5>Went here on a recommendation from a coworker. Definitely went far and above any expectations I had. I could NOT stop eating the chips and salsa...even after my food came out and after I was completely stuffed. I just kept shoveling it in because it was THAT good. Not chunky and just a little bit of spiciness to it. Perfection. The food itself was also delicious, but everything was eclipsed by the chips and salsa. The service was great. The prices were awesome. TONS of menu options. I almost felt a little overwhelmed because everything sounded so good. I probably could have just closed my eyes and randomly picked something on the menu and it would have been delicious. I have no complaints. DEFINITELY check this place out!
<review# 250,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/6/2014,3/17/2014,32,41,,6,3>Only a few things on the menu I haven't tried, yet. My favorite is the Rueben and it's the "special" every Thursday. The Pot Roast Sandwich is a must-have. Truly whatever you order will be delicious and leave you looking forward to the next trip!
<review# 251,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,3/16/2014,11,17,,4,2>I LOVE their Singapore noodles!  They are definitely the best ever!  I don't even know of another place that has this.  Perfectly spicy and meat is very tender....kids love chicken noodle soup and lo mein.  Also egg rolls are good and they deliver fast!
<review# 252,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,3/15/2014,13,13,1,6,3>The original Furlongs Restaurant in Lexington opened in 1993 and over the years, it has developed a cult-like following among the horse racing industry crowd and  those who love authentic Cajun food. Now located in south Lexington on Tiverton Way just off Nicholasville Road, it is a great place to enjoy delicious food--and most recently added to the offering, a weekend brunch menu. One of my favorite items on the menu is the Blackened Chicken over Jambalaya. I have enjoyed it more times than I can count. But there is also an extensive list of other flavorful choices on the menu that will challenge your ability to pick just one. (A great reason to return again and again.) On my most recent visit, I opted to forego the many enticing Cajun dishes and instead try the Furlongs Burger. I had been curious about it for sometime and I must say, I wasn't disappointed. It was thick and juicy and full-flavored. I chose the steak fries as the side item and they were crispy and the perfect compliment to a good old fashioned, nothing fancy burger. In fact, it was refreshing that Furlongs serves their burger without any odd toppings or gimmicky presentation. Lettuce, onion, tomato and a tasty and tangy rémoulade sauce are the perfect parring. This burger stands on its own. Simple, sensational, and certainly satisfying. The way a burger was intended to be. So the next time you want a really good burger and fries, served by an always friendly staff, I recommend Furlongs. Furlongs food is consistently top shelf and one trip there and I suspect you too will become a fan.
<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2013,3/13/2014,203,177,5,7,8>Proclaiming anything "the best" is an absurd declaration and one that Yelpers must only hand out to the most deserving of establishments. With that said, Spalding's Bakery is cranking out the best dang donuts in the Commonwealth. English words miserably fail to describe the deliciousness that is manufactured each morning within the holy confines of this bakery on Winchester Road. Perhaps the best descriptors are sounds like "MMMMMMM" and "YUMMMMMM" and "AHHHHHHHH." It's easy to see why this bakery caught the attention of the New York Times. Those rich guys on Wall Street only wish they had donuts this good.
<review# 254,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,3/12/2014,38,72,3,5,4>Surprised they don't have more happy hour options. I would think with the younger crowd that they draw in they would have more options.I went on a Thursday and it wasn't packed, but it was busy. The waitress gave us our drinks, checked on us twice within five minutes and then didn't come back for almost 30. We, of course, could order from the bartender.
<review# 255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/2/2014,3/11/2014,18,134,2,4,3>Victoria Square just so happens to be one of my favorite places in Lexington.  There's food.  There's shopping.  There's the pedestrian pathway through downtown Lexington.This building is an amalgamation of older buildings--bridged together via some clever architectural planning.  The details of the interior are reminiscent of  fancy upscale arcades (like Grove Arcade in Asheville, NC) where metal fixtures, fancy tiling and retail space combine for an aesthetic appeal unmatched in Lexington.But the best part of this shopping center is the indoor courtyard.  It's open to all the floors, and it preserves the exterior brick feel well.  The balconies and skylights only serve to enhance the feeling that you're in a movie set or Disney World.  The appealing geometry of the courtyard is what keeps me coming back.Walk the pedway.  Hit the shops, then relax in the Victoria Square courtyard.  This place is truly a hidden gem in Lexington's downtown.
<review# 256,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2014,3/10/2014,16,56,3,7,4>Lexington's brunch scene just got a whole lot better.  The food was delicious.  I had the Mexico City Maria's Chilaquiles, a Mexican style breakfast casserole, and it was superb.  I asked if I could substitute the breakfast potatoes it came with for an everything muffin.  The waitress immediately responded with a cheerful and confident, "Sure."  When the meal arrived, it was hot, flavorful and my order was accurate.  Pitchers of water and coffee are placed on your table so you can top off your own beverage, a nice little touch that I like.  Portions are generous, but at least in the case of my Mexico City Chilaquiles, not overwhelmingly so.  There was a slight wait for a table when I arrived at 11:00 AM on a weekday.  I was quoted a 10- minute wait time, but I was being shown my table well before the 10-minute mark.Considering it was only Day 2 of being open for business, my experience was pretty much glitch-free.  It was evident the staff was well-trained and knew the menu.Welcome to Lexington, Wild Eggs.  Keep dishing up good eats and Lexington will love you.
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2014,3/9/2014,21,31,3,7,4>I wanted to watch the Bengals playoff game at a sports bar so I decided to give Winchell's a shot.  Both the interior and exterior are not "polished" but do have a "lived in" appeal.  It looks like a family restaurant with a bar plopped in the middle.   There are a number of TVs showing a wide range of sporting events.  The place was probably 80-90% full which is pretty good considering it was Sunday and the game was locally televised.I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by one of the bartenders.  They were pleasant and fast with my drink which is always a good sign.  I reviewed the menu and was surprised by their diverse menu of  comfort foods.  I ordered the loaded potato soup and the country fried steak.  The soup came within minutes.  It was luke warm at best, but had decent flavor.  The rest of my order came 5 minutes after when I was only 1/2 way done with the soup.  The meal had normal sized portions and had great flavor.      It was just as good as mom could make so I guess that is saying something.   Everything here is reasonably priced with entrées ranging from $9-12.If it weren't for the soup and not waiting to serve the entrée, I would give 5 stars.  I would still recommend this place to friends and family.
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2014,3/8/2014,106,322,3,4,3>This is more like it in every way. It's all about the space and the vibe of a place and Third Street Stuff does that. An eclectic coffee shop with some tea selections, they weren't crowded when I came, which made me endeared to it even more. Their soda selection was helpful when I'm not always in the mood for tea (or coffee) and makes it possible to stay longer and veg. Win. win.When you show up to a new city as a person who spends more time than is prudent on computers -- for work -- it's important to have a place you can go when your own couch isn't getting it done. For me, there wasn't a place to do that. But from driving up to walking in, I could pretty much tell that Third Street Stuff was going to be precisely the place that'd appeal to my newly relocated soul.Stays up open late, good offerings and tunes are playing to boot. It's awesome, but don't think that means you need to start showing up and making it too crowded for me to come when I want.

It's one of those places where you save room in your stomach for the day (also smart to save room in your wallet) in preparation for the enormous amounts of fish, chicken and beer you're about to cram into your stomach.Don't expect to get a ginger dressing salad and hibachi chicken & shrimp.It's a hole in the wall that pushes out some of the finest sashimi & nigiri in the region.. and I'll go ahead and lump in outside of Japan... why not.

<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/27/2014,3/4/2014,9,41,2,6,4>Dined here with a party of 9 girlfriends tonight. I'll admit I was hesitant to eat here again due to a poor first experience right after the place opened. Tonight's experience was much better!!  I had the shredded pork tacos and they were very different but very good. The salsa served with the tacos was very sweet with an almost marinara taste. I don't like any spice at all so I loved the salsa but others might be a bit surprised by the sweetness. I didn't save room for desert but will return to try both the beignets and the plantains.
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2014,3/3/2014,126,65,2,11,7>I know that the Food Truck scene in Lexington is growing but I had no idea how far that it had evolved.  Formerly my favorite hotdog was the Sonoran Hotdog in Tucson, AZ.  I must admit that now my favorite dog is the Haute Dog from here.  Dear God the play of flavors is outstanding and almost sexual on the taste buds.  The toppings included - crispy pork belly, mustard caviar, celery root relish, green tomato confit, sambal oelek, cucumber noodles, and pickled red onion.  This was served on a soft and delishish BBC callah poppy seed bun.  You could choose from a all beef frank or a spicy carrot dog for a vegetarian taste.  This is one of Lexington's MUST tries.  The staff was very friendly and engaging.  The menu is very creative and extrememly visually pleasing as well.  I can't wait to try some items from their other menus, especially their Okonomiyaki and Ramen.
<review# 264,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/5/2013,3/1/2014,163,88,1,14,4>The food is a welcomed addition to the area but I'm afraid, as most places in this spot have, it will fail spectacularly if some changes aren't made. The staff is less than friendly. I've visited on the opening day and two subsequent times. The experience getting worse with each visit.  The checkout process between the hours of 11-3 is just painful. Most of the time they only utilize one of the two registers without a clear line or direction. They also have minimal seating and groups often take a table before ordering. Thus inhibiting any ability to gather a seat if you're not a complete douche. Lastly, they obviously could care less about restocking anything with any speed. Both of my last two visits have yielded an empty ice machine, no straws, and no napkins. I like the food, but the management is horrible. Spend your money elsewhere for the time being. They have no interest in serving their customers.
<review# 265,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/26/2013,2/28/2014,72,175,2,4,4>After eating all the Christmas food  for the past two days I made my way to the one place I new for sure that was open and had Food on Christmas day night. knew it was open from my yelp friend Heather checking in herself earlier. Thanks Heather.  So I had a nice white Russian ( or couple ) and then moved too a beer or two. I finished my beers off with a nice Turkey Burger with beer cheese on it with a Pretzel bun. I would be back for sure for another Turkey burger and or maybe next time the black been burger. Did not know they had either but great options for me who does not eat red meat or chicken. Thanks for the other options The Pub!
<review# 266,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/9/2013,2/27/2014,45,95,3,6,4>This was my first visit to Panda Express. I know it was just another fast food Chinese place so wasn't expecting a lot. The place was very clean as was the food prep areas. They were out of a coupleDishes and hadn't refilled them yet. I had the sweet and sour chicken. It was okay. I wasn't impressed with the food. The sweet and sour sauce seemed to have a taste of heavy vinegar. I would much rather have Golden wok on Richmond Rd than here. To me it was just mediocre.

<review# 268,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/10/2013,2/14/2014,43,64,4,7,5>Will update the review after they're open longer than a week. It's too early to make a call, but this place amazingly doesn't duplicate the feel of any other bar in the area. The main bar is huge and the setup is very stylish with illuminated quartz sheets providing a background for displaying the impressive array of bourbon. Tv's adorn the walls, but it's not sensory overload, and he vibe lends itself to social interaction.  The Upstairs lounge has another smaller bar in the far corner, and the seating is both couch and bar top table. The exposed brick appointments are warm and don't make the place feel too industrial. I'm excited for what this place will provide for bar patrons in the Short Street area. As for now, it may take them a while to get its sea legs but it seems to be off and rolling on the right foot.
