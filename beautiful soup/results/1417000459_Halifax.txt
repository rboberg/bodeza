<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,11/26/2014,6,10,,2,1>After a few visits I can safely say this is my favourite All You Can Eat Sushi place in the Halifax area.  The Sushi is tasty and fresh, there is good variety on both the lunch menu and the full dinner menu.  Traditional, and fusion selections.  The thing that makes Wasabi House stand above other all you can eat places I have been to is the cooked/hot menu.  The quality of the meats and appetizers is quite good.  The fried rice is the closest I have come to having authentic Japanese Fried Rice since leaving Japan.  Just remember to pace yourself and start small and keep ordering.  If you don't finish what you order there is a charge.  A practice I am totally on board with as it reduces waste and we've only run into the issue once and ended up with a delicious lunch the next day.  Service is great and the staff is friendly. The 10% discount for paying with cash is a nice treat too.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,11/25/2014,66,321,1,2,2>Hmmm.... burritos....What? I should write more. Fine!Take everything I love about the original Burrito Jax and transplant it to Lower Sackville. In fact, I think I might like this one a bit more because a) it's less busy; and b) it's less noisy. I have found that a lot of businesses that start experimenting with expanding have quality control issues; their new sites' menus can't match up to the original's. Not the case here. I had burritos from the original and Lower Sackville location in a 48 hour period and they were both deliciously good! Heck, I essentially ordered the same burrito and it really was the same - it's not like one site skimped on serving size and the quality was equal. The folks who served me were pleasant and the place was spotless. I'll definitely be back soon.
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2014,11/24/2014,9,42,3,5,3>My wonderful fiance has been on a bit of a quest to find the perfect spot for Fish and chips lately. Fish and chips have never been my favourite meal, but yesterday,  I was more than happy to tag along and sample the wares at Willman's, as I have read so many fantastic reviews. I have to say that I was not disappointed! I opted for the 2 piece "Lucien style" and he for the 3 piece "traditional" After our order was a placed, we chatted and noted how nice and clean our surroundings were. A short time later, our meals arrived. The portions were perfect. Mine had two lovely, lightly battered pieces of fish. The fish itself was moist and flaky and tasted nothing but fresh. The Lucien style batter allowed the fish to be the star of the meal. The fries were nicely done, and I admittedly ate more than I thought I  would, not really being a "fry" person either. His batter, was thick, crisp and golden. With each bite of fish I could hear the crispy snap of the batter. He chose to have a poutine as side and it looked delish. It was topped with a nice portion of yummy looking cheese curds. I tasted the gravy and it was wonderful. We both had a side of coleslaw, as well as some homemade tarter sauce. I have to say, that this was a fantastic dining experience. From food, to surroundings, to service. For a girl who is not crazy about fish and chips, I was left wanting more. Wanting more to the point that I am considering heading back for a repeat performance this weekend. So light, crisp and fresh, mmm.... We noticed something on the menu called "the gigantic seafood platter" This will likely be our next victim.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2014,11/23/2014,5,9,2,1,1>I am really impressed with this place. It's a few dollars more than the average gastropub but honestly it's worth it. I had the lobster club sandwich- it was SUPER fresh and served at the perfect temperature. My boyfriend had the Nutella Boar Burger.. which is literally the best burger I've ever had in my life. The taste is so unexpected and I would pay for anyone to have it, it's just that good. I went another time, and we shared a pizza. It took about an hour before we were served, but our server was attentive and let us know any updates on the food. The pizza was amazing, but a bit small for the price. It was more of a personal size, a good snack for two. The live music is always great, a little loud but I can't even complain about it since it keeps the place lively, people dancing, and excited to be in the atmosphere. I will definitely be going back, it's a real treat.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/18/2014,11/22/2014,1,62,1,1,1>I am so happy that this cafe is in my neighbourhood :-) Chuck Norris couldn't get it away from me. Go on, try.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2014,11/21/2014,5,47,1,3,3>One of my favorite coffee shops! I love the atmosphere! And the big shared table. And the coffee of course. This is what I buy for my home coffee beans as well.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/20/2014,11/20/2014,1,12,1,4,2>A cute little cafe... you can grab a bite there or take your food to go. My favourite thing about the place is their grilled veggie paninis - SO good.
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2014,11/19/2014,4,11,2,2,2>I love this place. Love the atmosphere, the selection of games & the food/drinks are very good price and were amazing. Can't wait to try this place again.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/17/2014,11/18/2014,0,4,2,4,1>Went to Krave a few days back and have nothing but good things to say.  Both myself and my wife were able to get a great meal at a great price.  The mac and cheese was one of my favorite items on the menu and if you like goat cheese -- I recommend the "Smoking Goat"  - what a fantastic creation!  My Wife had the Spinach Salad -- and to my surprise it came with two DEVILED EGGS...WOW what a treat - so fellas -- make sure you remember to point her to the spinach salad so you can steal an egg or two lolThe employees were friendly the place is nice -- I could see myself taking my laptop and working there for the afternoon.  The USB ports at every table were helpful (My phone was dead and they even had several different chargers to use as loaners)I would say the value for dollar is important and you will be more than full with great food for $15Krave is definitely the nicest Burger Joint in Halifax -- and without a doubt has the best food of all the "gourmet burger" places in our city!!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,11/17/2014,0,3,1,3,5>First review for anything, hiiiiii. Anyways, I just had my first shower post haircut with Krista, and the samples she sent me home with wowed me for sure. Not to mention the cut itself which I'm so so happy with. Krista took away from the photo inspiration I brought along with me exactly what it was that I liked about the cut, and then went on to figure out how to translate that to what was doable with my thick, damaged hair. I'm a quiet, kind of niched conversation person and I really enjoyed myself. I got a super accurate book recommendation ("Ready Player One": dystopian future, video games, sci-fi.. check check check) and I'm relieved to have found someone within walking distance of home. Anyways, I'm so pleased and just wanted to say so.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/13/2014,11/16/2014,1,7,2,2,2>I eat here not once, not twice, but 3 times before I wrote this review. It was so good the first time I thought maybe it was a fluke. But no, each time I returned it was consistently amazing. Honestly, the first time I went it took my friend some convincing to go as he had never heard of it before. But afterwards he proclaimed it his new favorite sushi spot in Halifax. Everyone I've taken there has been blown away.I don't pretend to be a sushi expert, but the sashimi at Alex Oh was the best I've ever had. Their sashimi menu changes a lot, and they have really interesting options like tuna belly or flounder (in addition to the usual stuff you'd expect). Not only was the quality of the food amazing, but the presentation is cool too. Even the miso soup was slightly different than other places. I strongly recommend this place. If you go, get the sashimi dinner and a bottle of sake and you'll leave very happy.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2013,11/15/2014,6,4,2,4,3>First time here - great atmosphere, wonderful food and friendly staff. Would be a great location for a first date or catching up over dinner. Mezze platter highly recommendable.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/14/2014,11/14/2014,1,47,2,2,3>I've been here a few times and it's always been pleasantly good.  Few times on the upper patio and a few times for breakfast and supper.  The pubclub doesn't and hadn't disappointed me yet.  The atmosphere is generally pretty electric since I'm usually there at peak hours. My breakfast experience was quiet which was nice. And the service is generally speaking pretty on top of things.  It's usually pretty jammed later at night...  Especially on the weekends..  So go early to get your spot
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/28/2014,11/13/2014,0,3,2,1,1>Well I think I finally found my favourite pizza place!! After almost 6 years in this city I found a pizza that is up there with the infamous Pictou county pizza. To earn the fifth star this place needs to upgrade their pepperoni to brothers, then it would be completely sensational. Also a little more sauce would add to it's appeal, but you can just request that when you order so it's no big deal. I couldn't believe the heaping amount of topping added! It filled me up fast which is just what I needed after a long night at work. It may be pricy but it's definitely worth it because it's absolutely delicious!! Definitely returning for another round at Peter's!!
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2014,11/12/2014,4,41,1,2,3>"What's that shadow place over there?""That's DARTMOUTH simba, you must never go there"We've all seen that spin-off, spoof meme right? You thought Dartmouth had a bad reputation but Eastern Passage definitely has had it's fair share of bad publicity. Then you drive along and you reach this beautiful and quaint boardwalk with boutiques, seafood stores and lobster restaurants. I came here with my boyfriend last night right as the sun was starting to set; it was warm and right on the ocean. It's so nice to have this little place, it's almost like an oasis in the midst of Eastern Passage.As we were waking we got the rumblies... aka, we got hungry. We weren't in the mood for a sit-in restaurant and, lucky for us, we stumbled upon What's the Scoop. Contrary to what the same suggests, this little almost chip-truck type deal, doesn't serve only ice cream. You can order hot dogs, lobster rolls, fries, seafood, etc.There's a little seating area so we sat down and waited for our food. I ordered the pan-fried scallops and my man ordered the 2 piece fish-&-chips. We took our food, sat in the trunk of my truck and gobbled down our feast. Fresh, hand-cut fries with absolutely delicious scallops  and the fish was crispy and perfectly battered. YUuuuuuummmmmyyyyA definite must-go.
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/19/2014,11/11/2014,6,3,,2,3>This place is a must-try.  I went in for the first time and just bought a whole bag of goodies (I was tempted to say "one of everything!" but I limited myself to 6 items, around $15).  This is the way to go. I loved it all, especially the almond ring, cream horn, and pretzel.  Their "Elephant Ears" are just like the pastries I've had in Portugal. Their buttercream cakes looked amazing, as did the variety of sourdough breads and baguettes, so I'll have to try those next time.  I took my items to-go, but they do have a small seating area.  The only thing that could use improvement is the cafe area, which seems a bit cramped and could use more space. Time to expand?  I will definitely be back!
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2014,11/10/2014,9,2,2,3,1>I have been to Edna countless times since it has opened and have not once been disappointed. I love the atmosphere of the place. It's very nice inside but it is also casual. The food is amongst the best I have had in the city, if not the best. The menu is constantly changing, keeping things fresh. The only let down (which isn't a let down really) is you go in one night and are blown away by let's say the beef carpacio. You tell all of your friends about it and go back a few days later and boom, its gone. But something else equally as delicious will be there. The staff are great, friendly and knowledgeable about all the menu items and drinks. It's my first place to reccomend to anyone looking for a night out whether it be dinner or even just to grab a drink.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,11/9/2014,0,14,2,3,3>Loved it.. Tasty food in big portions very friendly and lovely people.. The only thing I didn't like is the lack of parking spots
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2014,11/8/2014,0,4,1,3,2>Great shop. Excellent selections. No filler here. The owner was pleasant and very eager to talk music, and give some great recommendations. Very fair prices!
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/13/2014,11/7/2014,8,63,4,3,3>My friend and I were eager to try a new restaurant and thought about Clay West, but he had heard from one of his family members that Canadiana was a decent spot, so we decided to check it out.The restaurant is large and a little outdated; however, they have a wide variety of options on the menu from seafood to chicken to burgers to different types of pasta.  I decided to go with the roast chicken and this came with carrots, corn, rice, and a baked potato (you had a choice as to what type of potato you wanted).  My friend also ordered the roast chicken, but decided on mashed potatoes.We did not have to wait too long for the food and it was a decent size for $12.95; I could tell the kitchen staff put a lot of thought into the meal and it was just enough to fill us up.Despite most of their desserts being in the $5-6 range, again, we were both impressed by the size and quality of what they served us.  In the end, I ordered the New York Cheesecake, while my friend had the Banana Cream pie.One funny moment occurred earlier in the night when I went to the bathroom and noticed a chair and table close to the sinks.  I had an immediate flashback to some of those old 80's movies where you would have some guy walk into one of these fancy bathrooms only to have an older gentleman actually hand you a towel after you washed your hands, but; alas, there was no such thing here.Canadiana will not win any prizes for its decor or even its service as I found it average at best; even so, it delivers on price and quality and that's what truly matters.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2014,11/6/2014,3,19,1,2,2>Oh yeah! Hole in the wall, classic Western style Chinese food done right! From the 70's decor, to the classically simple and inexpensive menu options, the Silver Dragon is a very fun experience. But the kicker? The food is wicked too! I don't eat Chinese food too often (mainly because I'm too picky), but this place is great. They got everything just right, and the staff are super friendly as well! I will be back for sure!
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/9/2014,11/5/2014,20,226,1,4,3>What a lovely little spot.  I've lived in Halifax my whole life and never even knew it existed until I found reviews of it here on Yelp.  Then of course I forgot all about it until now.  This park is a well-hidden gem in the north end.  Quiet, peaceful, chock full o' trees (with swings in them!) and a small playground at one end, Fort Needham is like the city's best-kept secret to me. Of course I had to hit the swing set first. :-)  When you don't want to pound the pavement downtown or drive all the way down to Point Pleasant, don't forget this park exists, nestled between quiet, tree-lined residential streets in the north end.  Play fetch with your dog, learn a bit of history, sun yourself on the grass ... enjoy some tranquility in the middle of the city.

<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2014,11/3/2014,2,27,,1,1>Love this place. One of the bartenders is a bit of an odd ball (guy with the blonde greasy hair) but this place has a great brunch, boasts super cheap drinks and is right down the street from my girlfriends place so it's a great close hangout.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2014,11/2/2014,0,16,1,1,1>I was there the first day it opened and have been back a 1/2 dozen times. After a few hiccups in the beginning they seem to be finding their way. The food, and service is better now. The price may be still an issue for some people though.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/22/2013,11/1/2014,2,7,1,5,2>Went in here for the first time the other day and I have no complaints. Phat's a really nice guy and provides a great service. I was in here on a Saturday and just sneaked in before a rush (thankfully) but the people behind me didn't have to wait long I'm sure because Phat works very fast. I was in the chair for about 15 minutes maybe and this was my first cut in about 3 months. Not only is the cut good but it's cheap as well. Tip him well, he deserves it. Highly recommended.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2014,10/31/2014,0,9,1,1,1>I wish I lived closer to this location, as I prefer it to closer-to-home South Park cafe. The balcony space overlooking trees on Agricola,  the art, the comfy seating nooks all add up to a very welcoming and relaxing space. I'm a fan of the muffins, ice cream, and the tea selection. Although I am a huge fan of espresso coffee I try to avoid getting coffee at Humani-T because it inevitably disappoints every time. Humani-T lattes inevitably come out weak and scalding hot, and I can usually tell it's too hot the moment I touch the cup and it starts to burn my hand. Milk should never be frothed above 65 degrees celsius (or 150 F), which I would expect anyone making espresso coffee for a living to know, but unfortunately this is a common problem in Halifax. I commend Humani-T for offering resonably-priced and healthy lunch options.  I have had the soup on a few occasions and enjoyed my meals most of the time. I ordered the 'Polish Borscht' today which to my surprise did not seem to contain any beets at all. I've never had a borscht in my life that did not have beets as the primary ingredient. If it had been called a cabbage and tomato soup I would have had no complaints. It was tasty and filling. All in all, I do really like Humani-T at this location, and I make a point to stop in whenever I am in the area (if they are open).
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/14/2014,10/30/2014,0,21,1,3,2>Good place and good prices.  This would a great spot for a healthy meal.  If you are a carnivore you might not get your fill but for good variety of food and a friendly spot.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,10/29/2014,3,27,1,3,2>Based on the really good reviews on Yelp, I decided to give this place a try, as we were looking for a change from the chain pizza stores.  I ordered by phone, great number 479-7979, and my husband picked it up.  We ordered a 3 ingredient large.  The pizza was ready on time and the man on the phone was friendly.  My husband paid cash. The location is just up the Bay Road from the Rotary.   So we opened the box and dug in.  I liked the crust which was medium thick, chewy and fluffy.  I also noted the tomato sauce which had a sweet and tangy flavour.  The cheese on top was thick and gooey.  The green pepper and mushrooms were garden fresh.  And I savoured the salty taste of the big black olives.  This pizza was a delicious treat and we enjoyed every bite!
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/21/2013,10/28/2014,1,14,,3,1>One of my favorite places ever! I really enjoy the "Roasted Chicken Panini." They are very efficient with their job. I recommend this place if you wanna enjoy a nice lunch. :)
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2013,10/27/2014,27,128,1,7,2>Fruition is a raw vegan eatery located in the Halifax Seaport Market. Although the menu looks simplistic, the food tastes divine and puts a new spin on classic dishes. I admit, I am always skeptical when trying raw prepared food. I haven't had a lot of luck enjoying the places I have tried but Fruition is an exception. I absolutely loved it. It was flavorful, filling and just plain delicious. I had the gardenburger and a blueberry macaroon for dessert. Both of which left me satisfied. I also felt extremely honored that Seth recognized me from The Vegan Peach. It really made my day and felt like what I am doing is impacting the vegan community. On top of the delicious food, we were given a cute little pin (which is now permanently on my purse) and a discount card for next time in. I officially declare Fruition the best raw vegan restaurant according to The Vegan Peach!
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2013,10/26/2014,10,7,2,2,1>The girlfriend and I were in here last week, and were pleasantly surprised!  The restaurant is small but very clean, the food is delicious and somehow lighter-feeling than usual westernized-Chinese fare, the prices are very reasonable, and the staff were just excellent.  We live in Halifax, just around the corner from another major Chinese restaurant (Look, it's right o-over there!), but I expect we'll be making the trek across the bridge much more often in the future.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2014,10/25/2014,22,150,3,4,3>When these guys moved in to their weekday lunchtime home a short walk from my office, I was happy. After my first visit I was estatic. Being in Burnside without a vehicle doesn't offer a great deal of options for lunch but Poppasmokes is about all I need.  I have tried everything on the menu now except for the Nate Dog, some items more than once. The fries are fantastic, always best right out of the fryer with just the right amount of spice added. It's a tie between the pulled pork and the MWA (Meatballs With Attitude) for my favourites, maybe it's because of Poppa's Sweet Heat Sauce, a nice balace of heat and sweet. Just about everything else has Poppa Rush Sauce. If you're not into a lot of heat on your Reuben, chicken or burger, you might want to have them go easy on the rush sauce. The bacon mac & cheese is almost is good as mine. Of all I've tried, the Lil Chicken wowed me the least but still a solid choice. I usually go for the 6" combo - any 6" hoagie, fries and a beverage, a good deal for $10. Not sure how much longer they'll be open this Fall but once they do I'll be counting the days til they return in the Spring.

Super awesome.  The beef salad was a flavour explosion.  Officially now my favourite Thai in HRM....  although Canadians would call it a 'Thai food restaurant' rather than just' Thai'.  That's two words too many.
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/25/2014,10/23/2014,25,117,3,3,3>How have I not written a review for TIBS yet?!TIBS is a wonderful, local cafe that is almost always busy. My last visit happened on a rare quiet afternoon, when they were about an hour from closing and there were only about 6 of us in the place. It was a beautiful day so the large front windows/doors were open and the breeze blew through. The atmosphere was calming and the breeze and quiet neighbourhood made you feel like you were somewhere far from the city. We both ordered delicious teas, delivered in a glass mug with strainer full of leaves, and split one of their GIGANTIC chocolate chip cookies. It was great, a little dry, but great. Oatmeal raisin, from a previous visit, is fantastic and I'd recommend it. One of my favs!The place is clean, modern, and has a great menu. The prices are very reasonable and staff are friendly and helpful. Now, if you'll excuse me, I feel the need for one of those cookies...
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,10/22/2014,13,25,3,7,3>This review is going to be short and sweet. If you really want to know how good this place, you need only look at the line up out the door. Atmosphere - this is primarily a take out kind of place - a few tables around but I  wouldn't consider it the kind of place to really catch up over a leisurely lunch. The success of the place means that there are probably always going to be a lot of the lunch time crowd standing around waiting to pick up their sandwiches. There is no patio, nor are there any picnic tables to eat outside. I was feeling like more filling less bread - the Bahn Mi sandwiches are served on some pretty thick and crusty rolls. I went with the fusion tacos - the spicy chicken and the bulogi beef. The description: Korean Tacos - Served in a warm flour tortilla topped with Asian coleslaw, pickled daikon, cucumber, bean sprouts, citrus mayo & sriracha. The flavour was other-worldly. KaPoW - extra deliciousness. I could probably have just eaten one. But why eat just one when you get two for $7.45. A bargain for the buck. Service was as short and sweet as this review. Despite the line up we had our food fairly quickly.Don't go to this place if you have an addictive personality. I'm warning you. (Plus I don't want that lunch line to get any longer)
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2014,10/21/2014,3,3,1,2,2>Great beer. Great food. Great atmosphere. If you are looking for a bite to eat with friends or a night out with your sweetheart, this is a great choice. The FG offers a very lovely patio in the summer and a great large front booth for friends. If you are looking for a hide away with your love, just head further back into the bar and there are a few dim, passion filled tables. The everything about this place is great. They cater to all tastes and have many options for vegetarian. The service is great and the staff are friendly. Certainly a great place for a bite and a pint.

The atmosphere mixes both class and relaxation, depending on which floor, and the servers are hyper knowledgeable about the food and drinks that are offered. I have yet to be disappointed.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2014,10/19/2014,0,2,,1,1>Nice atmosphere, pricey drinks (but totally worth it!)  and they have the best cheesecake ever... And when I say ever.. I mean EVER.

I found a dress that looked like a dress my grandmother owned it made me smile for a good hour after. Some people would find the fact the ceiling is full of hats and bags irritating, and the floor being covered by shoes agitating but I love it! it makes the store what the store is!the first time I take any of my friends in, the first thing I do is show them the racks, then point out the shoes and then finally I point out the ceiling and they all are in awe! To sum up, its a really sweet store, with knowledgeable staff, and unique fashion to the store!I will be bringing more people here!
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/22/2014,10/17/2014,13,104,5,9,2>Got a teambuy for this place for an app, two shawarma plates and dessert. One fish shawarma platter and one falafel platter for take out later....First I should note that I have a lot of experience with chicken shawarmas (see my last kababji review) but I've never had (or even heard of) fish shawarma. But it was great! First, as soon as I picked up my container I thought how much food they stuffed into the container - and I was right, I couldn't finish all the food in one sitting.The fish was battered and deep fried served with rice, hummus, salad and pita bread. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. Once I dug in, I couldn't stop eating it tasted so good. The fish was spiced and battered perfectly, and the fish to batter ratio was done just right. Just thinkin' about it now makes my mouth water. Haha. The greek salad consisted of the usual stuff but the thing that always gets me for greek salad is the dressing and the kalamata olives - both were present and delicious.After I finished all the fish, I think I got half way before throwing in the towel, again - it's a lot of food for $15. Would definitely recommend the fish shawarma!

The chicken skewers rock. If you're anywhere near Hollis at lunchtime, pop in! This isn't a fine dining experience, but it is delicious, fresh food with friendly service.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2013,10/15/2014,20,72,1,5,1>While Chives may pip the Pressgang on the menu front, the ambience of the latter still gives it the No.1 spot in my book. My wife and I visited 10th August 2013 for her birthday, not having been here for over eighteen months! The menu has had a significant revamp in the meantime, though the old favourites are still there. Why change a winning plan? I started with the seared scallops, which were cooked to perfection, with a delicate sauce. For mains, my wife chose the scallops, while I opted for the prosciutto wrapped halibut. Both dishes were perfectly prepared and presented. Halibut done well is as fine a fish as you can find in the ocean, and this was halibut done well, with vegetables and potato medallions. Goodly sized portion, as well. My wife's scallops with basmati rice and some interesting and very tasty veggies met with her entire approval. For dessert, I had the raspberry Crème brûlée, which was good, but a little more aggressively flavoured than the old lavender version. The spiced apple cake was reported as "delicious" and devoured to the last crumb. Drinks-wise, I kicked off with the blueberry martini, which while a bit girly to look at, hit the high notes. I eschewed the wine list, being the driver, but we did treat ourselves to the Jost Ortega icewine with our coffee. Eye wateringly pricey, but an ideal closer. The Friday/Saturday piano player has been replaced by the Mike Cowie trio, with piano, trumpet and double bass. Given how tight the room is, I was pleasantly surprised at how tolerable the volume was. Some great arrangements of well known tunes, too. All in all, an excellent night.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/24/2013,10/14/2014,13,213,1,9,4>Brunch was packed. We waited for a table at the bar. Once seated the server took our order quicky. We tried a whole bunch of the sides and one main dish. Everything from the food to the space to the open kitchen and the overall look and feel of the place were way above expectations + lots of local star chef sightings. You know you are in the right place when you notice local chefs taking up tables. If you follow that crowd you will never go wrong.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,10/13/2014,5,7,4,3,5>Ashlee's baked goods are AMAZING! Everything is so fresh and delicious. Have you tried the carrot cake? 'Cause you should. Muffins? Best in town. The baristas are friendly and the espresso beverage are always made just how you want them. They also have mugs, glasses & plates for you to stay and relax. Also their Bodum selection is admirable.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/5/2014,10/12/2014,46,10,2,4,2>TL;DR - The freshest, tastiest, consistent Chinese in Halifax. Staff are friendly and helpful and the restaurant is very clean and comfortable. If you are here for supper don't get the usually Canadian Chinese fair, go for something a little different. Really want your sweet and sour chicken balls? well you can have it.. But why when you can have the pineapple chicken, with fresh tomato and lightly breaded chicken. So good.. The menu is full of great dishes and the staff are very accommodating when it comes to changes and special requests. (Eg. Vegetarian dishes)Weekends are for Dim Sum! And by far the best in the city. Fresh, not frozen like a few others I have had in town. My personal favourites are the turnip cake in xo sauce, a nice spicy twist on the regular turnip cake. Shrimp spring rolls, pan fried dumplings, all the steamed buns, fresh made soy milk, it's all great. It's not served on a cart like you see in some big places in Toronto, but it's still quick. Come early as it gets very busy after 12:30-1:00. Great for groups too, a bit of a trek for the peninsula folks, bet well worth it.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/6/2014,10/11/2014,4,4,1,3,2>Fast service, friendly staff, similar pricing to the gourmet burger shops that are common now.Lots of options: grilled sandwiches, chicken, ribs, wraps. Had the poutine and grilled chicken club - both were excellent. Especially the poutine.They don't fry in peanut oil and they have gluten free options if that is important to you. Big plus to me was that they are a local business.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/4/2014,10/10/2014,1,13,1,3,1>Best Thai food in downtown as far as I'm concerned.  The spicy noodle is really good, their spring rolls are great and as a vegetarian, I can eat almost everything with tofu instead of meat.  Their curried fried rice is awesome.They have an all you can eat lunch during the week and an all you can eat lunch/supper during the weekend.  I've never tried it but the price is fair and if you're into eating a lot of food, this would be your ticket.  No wi-fi.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/4/2014,10/9/2014,1,12,1,1,>I'll start by saying that I hardly take cabs at all. I walk or bus everywhere I need to go. However, the other night I needed to visit the ER and a cab was the most efficient way for me to get there. There was no particular reason I called Casino; it was just the first one that came up when I googled for numbers of Halifax cabs. The cab arrived at my home very quickly. The driver was a very nice, polite and soft spoken middle aged man. When we arrived at the hospital, he wished me well. I tried to tip him in cash but he wouldn't accept it because of the circumstances. I just added a tip when I paid with Visa because he really deserved it for his great service, in my opinion. Later that night, when it was time to go home, I called Casino again. Once again, a cab driven by a good natured driver showed up almost immediately. Based on this experience, I'll definitely be choosing Casino the next time I need a cab.

Go here

I've never had a bad meal here! Consistency is important to me and they do not disappoint. I would recommend everything on the menu.. and don't forget the hazelnut gelato for dessert! Stay open on Sundays and I'd love you even more, a Mano :)

I had the meatloaf sandwich and my hubby had the supreme clubhouse with fries. We split each sandwich so we could each try both and both were excellent! Perfect amount of food! The lady who served us was more than helpful with choosing out items and when we inquired about high chairs when we come back with our daughter ( they have both high chairs an booster seats folks). Will be back for sure to try something else from their menu!
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2014,10/3/2014,7,14,1,3,3>A pretty great little neighbourhood joint. I recently moved into the neighbourhood, and having been a patron at the downtown Freeman's, I thought I'd check this one out. It's quite a bit smaller, and more intimate (I don't think they do any live music, but they do have a jukebox and 1 or 2 VLTs)The food is just ok, but the service, atmosphere, and adult beverages more than make up for the mediocre food. A great place to go with a group of 4-5 people, or to grab a beer with a friend. Relaxed and casual: my kind of place! :)
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2013,10/2/2014,1,4,1,3,3>This place is quickly becoming my new favourite place in the city.

<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/26/2014,10/1/2014,17,31,2,6,3>What a great place to grab a pint or some quality irish pub food. The Incredible atmosphere and service keep me coming back. The staff are more than happy to make my favourite off-menu dish every time I go for a meal.I love a warm hearty bowl of traditional irish chicken curry and fries, but its not on their menu. The few times I have asked if they could whip this up for me, they ALWAYS have been very gracious about reassuring me that it was indeed their pleasure to make it and also comment about how good that sounds, etc. Now, I've been to other restaurants where going off menu is an immediate annoyance (or at least they are smiling insincerely through their teeth when they tell you "of course that's alright"). At Finbars, I've I never felt like I was asking a favour or embarrassed to go off-menu because they seem to be genuinely happy that I came to their restaurant for something unique.Usually when I write a review, I like to talk more about the food's quality (which is great here), but I gotta say: the service and atmosphere here are absolutely first rate. I don't know what their hiring/ training/ managing strategy is for front of house, but they are doing things right! The staff are charming and very knowledgeable about the food. They are interactive and funny when appropriate, while providing invisible service when appropriate. My glass has never been empty before being either refilled with water or another pint being offered.The owners are charming and funny. I am on their email list and I look forward to hearing from them. Sometimes I get updates about just how they are doing and how much fun they are having with the restaurant. I attended a "cooking class" night at their Bedford location years ago (which I heard about through the email) and it was a great night!
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/23/2014,9/30/2014,40,216,4,4,4>This relatively new Vietnamese place out on the Bedford highway popped up on my radar after hearing about it on the interwebs and passing by it on the bus. Being that I am vehicle-impaired, it is difficult to make it out to try places like this as it's hard to justify the long round-trip bus ride just for a meal. However, after coming out to adventure in Hemlock Ravine park, I figured this would be one of few opportunities to eat here.When my girlfriend and I arrived in the early evening, there were just a few tables occupied inside, but it was nice out with just a slightly cool breeze, so we sat out on their patio to enjoy what vestiges of summer were still hanging on. The view of the basin was nice, although that of the Bedford highway somewhat less so. We were in a bit of a blind spot in relation to the front counter, so I went in and grabbed us menus, and water soon followed me out. The menu has a good selection of Vietnamese standards like pho, banh mi and fresh rolls, but also some not so common items including banh xeo (Vietnamese pancakes) and banh cuon (Vietnamese crepes with pork pate). I was here to try their pho though. Their special pho comes with beef brisket, beef balls and tripe. A certain local food critic for a certain newspaper, both of which will both remain nameless, blatantly wimped out on the tripe, but not I! I was a little worried about the beef balls as they were fairly bad - chewy and bland - when I had them the last time I had pho elsewhere, but I gave them a go nonetheless. My girlfriend went with what was effectively their take on beef and broccoli - the aforementioned items with baby bok choy on wide rice noodles. A veggie spring roll rounded out her meal.The spring roll came first and we were warned that it was fresh out of the fryer, so it was quite hot. Once at a tolerable temperature, I snuck a bite; the wrapper was wonderfully flaky and the veggies inside were seasoned nicely. There was no mushy layer of soggy/undercooked wrapper between the filling and outside either, which I find to be an issue with spring rolls. Our mains came out a little while later, just when the question of "I wonder where my food is?" began to creep into my brain, from my stomach. A large bowl, albeit not as huge as some bowls of pho I've seen, came with a side plate with bean sprouts, cilantro and basil that you can add to your own liking, as well as bottle of hoisin and what tasted like sriracha. I gave the broth a taste before putting in the add ins. It was really good - slightly rich, not too salty and an even consistency. You could taste cilantro and a light herbiness of basil in it as well. It was good on its own, but I preferred the additional depth of flavour from the sweet hoisin and spicy sriracha. The beef balls and brisket were quite obvious on top, but the slices of tripe blended in a bit, only distinguishable by the little bumps on one side. As soon as my girlfriend saw these, she rescinded her request to even try the broth, however I wasn't off put and soldiered on. The brisket came in large but thin slices, which initially seemed unwieldy, but they were easy to tear apart with my chopsticks. It had a nice flavour and wasn't tough at all. Unfortunately the curse of the beef balls struck again; with a very fine and dense consistency, it was like a chewy beef hotdog. Beef balls, you can pho off.  The tripe was fine, it just had the flavour of the broth and had a slightly spongy texture, but it was very thin so it wasn't difficult to chew. The rice noodles were quite plentiful and made me glad that I wear glasses and would be washing clothes soon.My other half's beef and broccoli was quite tasty. Everything was it should be at texture-wise - tender beef and crisp veggies. The sauce had a little peppery hit and stuck nicely to all of the food and noodles - no soupy mess at the bottom of this plate. All in all it was a nice meal, and quite affordable at $35 for two after tax and tip. My mind and taste buds weren't blown away, but it's nice to know there's a dependable Asian restaurant in the area even if I may not be able to stop by very frequently.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/6/2013,9/29/2014,26,201,1,3,3>This is one my favorite cafes ever. Although the spot is a tad cramped and maybe not the cleanest...don't let this discourage you. With lots of different seating options, I usually opt for those by the removable windows.The variety here is awesome! And the coffee is delicious. I have never been disappointed by any of their tasty food concoctions- their bagel sandwiches are great, and they offer really creative compilations. The lattes never disappoint- and they have a large drink menu- any one would love this place, not just coffee lovers.I love this space. It's a great place to people watch and have some variety for your lunch!

<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2013,9/27/2014,42,100,3,2,2>The traditional record store may be dying but Taz is thriving - having just opened up a new second location in Bedford (that I have yet to visit but I'll be there soon). Meanwhile, this location on Grafton Street (with the storefront facing Spring Garden Road) just opened a few months ago. All is well.I can't tell if this new location is actually bigger. I think it is as there seem to be added rows of vinyl. Things can get tight in here (Record Store Day was packed at 10am...) but the selection is as good, if not slightly beyond what they offered in the previous location when it was just a few blocks away. I do miss their $1 room, however, which is now just a few shelves but I suspect they were able to get rid of most of that during their closing sale before the move, much of which was eventually offered for free.One of the first things I do when I travel to a new city is try to find record stores that offer new and used titles. I'm going to be completely honest when I say Taz beats everything I was able to find in NYC and is perhaps on par with Sonic Boom in Toronto. Of course, Taz is able to order things in so if you don't see it, ask, they'll get it and probably start carrying it so you're not only doing yourself a favour, but whoever else who may want what you do.Tip for fans of CDs and vinyl, Taz posts a list on their Facebook page every week with the selection of new arrivals. Some might say it saves you a trip but it's almost guaranteed that something on that list catches my eye and I'm coerced into venturing downtown for that pretty vinyl to add to my collection (and play, of course).PS: They sell record players too.

The room itself is cozy but does not feel small and the service seemed to be amazing, attentive and personal. The one thing that blew me away was the sound quality, and the talent of the girl working the sound board. Even allot of the performers were going to up to her to let her know how good she was after their sets. I am really looking forward to going back to the Company House very soon to hear some good music.

It was amazingly good!  I also had the Deli sandwich (one of about 5 options I think) and it was soooo good!  The homemade bread was great and I just can't say enough good things about the sandwich as a whole. I loved the decor and all the plants and flowers.  There's not a ton of seating, but I imagine a lot of people take out and return to work with their yummies.  I did notice a high chair if you happen to meander in with a little one.  I really recommend supporting this great local business!  Go in early to avoid disappointment because I hear sometimes the options get slimmer as the day goes on as they run out of certain items.

<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2014,9/19/2014,0,7,1,1,1>I went with my fiance and his parents and younger brother. We were a bit early for our reservation (15 mins) but they seated us anyway. The lighting when we started was okay with the light from outside but once the sun was gone it became extremely dark - when we asked about the lighting after our meal they said they were having trouble finding a good setting as there was four light switches and they were unsure which ones did what. It was constant changing every five minutes or so and very annoying. Our servers were lovely and polite and we felt doted on even with a supper crowd. We had the calamari at the waiter's suggestion and were blown away with how yummy it was. The other started we got was the bruschetta. For my main course I got the chicken and spinach pasta, my fiance got a lobster stuffed ravioli. I have dreamed of pasta as yummy as that dish was. I was so pleased it. All of our food was rich and delicious. Our water glasses were never empty which was a nice plus.For dessert we all tried different things, I had the lemon cheesecake which was rich without being overpowering and I was really pleased with the dense creamy texture. My fiance got the bailey's brownie and the bailey's cream could have been nicer, it had little water crystals which took away from the taste. Overall I would go back and order the exact same thing in a heartbeat, it's definitely a new favourite spot.
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2014,9/18/2014,9,42,,2,2>When in the mood for pasta, this is always my go-to. The prices are beyond reasonable and the portions are great.  It may not be as swanky as some of the other Italian options in the downtown core, but that is not what I look for in a restaurant anyhow. For under $20 you get some yummy fresh baked bread, soup or salad ( I always go for the spinach) and more pasta than you can eat comfortably. In the past I've tried the  Southwest Fettucine, Garlic Chicken, Red Curry Chicken, and the Chicken and Mushroom pastas. I have never been disappointed. Pasta, to me, really is comfort food. That is what you get here through and through.The service can be hit or miss. There have been times I have not been told the specials before ordering, only hearing them when the server at the next table was informing her guests. I have sat far too long without receiving my drink, or being attended to at all. There have been times when the service has been fantastic.I do have one particular memory that stands out from my last visit to Vinnie's. We were seated at a table against the wall, closest to the kitchen. After a short time my boyfriend asks me if I feel like my chair was moving. Indeed it was. By the end of the meal our chairs had slid from beside the wall, to the other end of the table. It was so bad that I had to be sure my chair was not sliding into the aisles, and in the way of the servers. As you may have surmised, there was quite a slant to this area of the floor. It really only is at this particular table, as we've never had this issue before. Being the laid back person I am, I thought it was quite amusing, especially as I watched my boyfriend's face become a deeper and deeper red, the more irritated he became. Ha! Anyhow, we will avoid being seated at this table next time, and I suggest you do too!

<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2014,9/15/2014,2,23,,,1>So after many recommendations of friends to go try this place out, the 2 of us went! He ordered the mushroom Swiss burger & I ordered the peanut butter burger. Everybody gear up for a messy surprise! Man, these burgers are big, sloppy, & tasty! (For the most part) The mushroom burger wasn't packed full of flavour like other restaurants I've had. Not the best choice. If you're going to have a burger, get the peanut butter! Now, it is a combo type of meal so you do get fries, but they don't give many. I would have liked to see a lot more, especially since the price is over $12 per meal. Also, the drinks are about $2-$3 which is a little much.... It's just pop!

<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/22/2014,9/11/2014,10,70,3,4,3>When deciding on where to go for a nice anniversary dinner, I wrote down a list of at least five places I wanted to try.  The husband made the choice (being I want to try them all eventually), and it was a great choice.Upon arrival at 5pm on a sunny Wednesday, we were the first customers of the day.  Small entryway when you first come in, a few stairs to your left to enter the main restaurant area.  Here, it's again divided where you can go to the windowed section on your right, which would be nice for lunch I think (although it seems this place isn't opened for lunch?  I may be wrong, but it wasn't yesterday anyway).  The main interior part of the restaurant is a bit darker but with lots of nice color on the walls and generally nice décor.  Maybe a dozen tables in all, some two seaters with a bench on one side, some four-seaters.  By the time we left at 6:30, it was about half full.In lieu of free bread, two delicious warm tea biscuits served in a brown paper bag with side of whipped butter and molasses.  I could easily eat a dozen of these if I let myself. Amazing MUSHROOM, LEEK, & GOUDA CHEESE TARTLET ($11) (red onion marmalade / crisp cheddar pastry).GRILLED P.E.I. BEEF TENDERLOIN (8 ounce) (sour cream and onion fork smashed potatoes / chantrelle mushrooms / urban blue cheese / buttermilk onion rings / savoy styyle beef jus reduction) ($39 this day, market price varies obviously) - cooked to perfection. Very satisfying and delicious MARKET MAYHEM (fried green tomato with ratatiulle & eggplant "baba-g" / chilled summer vegetable quinoa salad with feta / wild foraged mushroom sauté with our best market vegetable)Excellent attentive service.  Very good bottle of Lamberti pinot grigio always prompty topped up and kept chilled for us at the bar vs in an ice bucket. Absolutely will be back, maybe to try the market salad and a dessert, since they are probably just as excellent as what we had.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/6/2013,9/10/2014,4,4,1,3,5>I've been in and out of this place so many times in the last couple years on the hunt for my 'dream bike'. While they didn't have an option that was close to what I was looking for, they went over so many options with me, answered so many questions, and gave a lot of good advise. Eventually, I had two bikes that were both close to what I wanted and they took parts from the two bikes and put them together into something amazing, and it was very reasonably priced. The guy who did it let me sit behind the counter and watch him do it, to make sure it was what I wanted, swapping out pieces that he had back there that might be a better fit.I have since gone back numerous times to discuss rust issues, paint jobs, tire replacement, handlebar configurations, seat options, special orders, and many other bike-related issues. They have answered my (at times tedious and repetitive) questions with patience and confidence. There were times where they didn't have what I was looking for and they referred me to other bike stores around the city that they knew would have what I was looking for. Not many businesses out there will send you to their competition, taking your satisfaction over their own profit.I can't say I've ever had a bad experience, and I can be a pretty annoying customer at times, I'm sure, and I've definitely been here more than enough times to account for a bad experience or two, but they are just great, every time.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2014,9/9/2014,2,6,,2,2>great little irish place.The staff is very nice and fun.We sat out on the patio. even with the cars it was a good experience and not distracting.I had the curry and chips... not great... not horrible and my friend had the Shepards pie, the portion seemed tiny but once he finished he was satisfied.The beer is very reasonablemy only draw back was wishig they had some acadian music or any music playing for that matter.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2014,9/8/2014,1,11,1,3,3>Stopped in on a whim this week and was pleasantly surprised! The atmosphere is bright (as the name suggests), clean and inviting. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My partner and I shared the fish tacos and the parsnip maple soup. Both were modest servings but very tasty. I would go back for the food. My partner had a coffee which was also good, and local. I found myself wanting to try their drafts and sweet treats, which is a good sign that I should come back. The space feels very communal and it's easy to move around, a feature that is important in a neighbourhood like the North End where many people know each other and want to socialize, although I suspect it would get quite noisy in the evenings due to lack of sound absorption. Lion and Bright are doing a lot of things right, and it is a place that I want to continue to give my business. Support local!
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2014,9/7/2014,6,28,1,2,2>I went to EM for the first time today to celebrate my friend's birthday over brunch. The food was delicious, servers attentive, and the new pub has a great atmosphere.I had the tomato pesto sandwich with prosciutto and my friend had the French toast.  Both meals were very good.  I topped mine off with chocolate chip and chocolate decadence cookies and she had the carrot cake muffin.  There wasn't a crumb left on the plates!!I'm looking forward to my next excuse to drop by EM :)
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2014,9/6/2014,29,84,1,6,4>Great selection of beer-type beverages & the staff are happy to make solid recommendations!The place looks great, very comfortable, rustic, and it has been super busy both times I have been in! Last night we tried a Moscow Mule - so delicious - and an Old Fashioned, very nice and definitely not sweet. It was so busy that there wasn't room to stand at the bar, and we just had a cocktail to see if anything opened up in the meantime. It didn't, so we headed on - I'd recommend getting here early!I was here recently for dinner and tried a thin crust pizza with avocado, bacon, and cilantro I believe it was. Apparently it's the most popular pizza on the menu. It was very good, and the crust was really decent. The dishes and serving platters are really cool, lots of wooden platters and cast iron macaroni dishes. I like the variety of seating areas, and the popularity of the place is well-deserved. I think I counted 11 different kinds of speciality mac 'n' cheese!
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/20/2014,9/5/2014,1,10,3,3,4>Mom and I ate here Sunday. Ordered calamari and oysters to start. Delicious! Calamari were perfectly seasoned and there was plenty to share. I had fish & chips and mom had fish tacos. The fries were AMAZING! They came in a wired basket that was really creative. Fish was tasty. Mom loved the fish tacos. Service was cheery and helpful. Overall, we would highly recommend Five Fishermen and we will be back!
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2014,9/4/2014,0,17,1,3,3>This is my absolute favourite sushi place in Halifax! Love the service, employees, atmosphere and of course the food :D I haven't been back for a while, simply because i know it will cost me a fair bit if i do. But hopefully this summer i can make a much needed trip!
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2013,9/3/2014,3,51,1,2,4>no candy is sold here.howeverawesomeness awaits you-also the owner seems to be really cool people. I broke a piece on my bong after I bought it from their store and they offered to give me a discount buying another. . . even though I broke my shit.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2014,9/2/2014,20,71,1,2,3>Sweet little spot - try out the cupcakes (and check out the reviews for Layers). Also, the 'bite me' snack mix is delicious.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,9/1/2014,9,33,3,6,4>I work in the CIBC building and walk by this place almost on a daily basis as I head over to Scotia Square. It's located right before you cross the pedway from CIBC to Scotia Square - prime location but they never seem to be busy. Which is too bad because everyone walking by is missing out - not only on delicious food but amazing customer service.I decided to stop today because I forgot my lunch at home. I may have to start forgetting it more often ;)I order the daily special which was a bruschetta chicken melt and I got a side garden salad with it. A nice fresh sandwich and salad that filled me up - all for under $9! That is just unheard of!!The customer service was second to none. There were lots of laughs all around and they really cared about what you wanted and were more than willing to make substitutions if you wanted something a little different. I didn't get the names of the two working there but they told me that they aren't in the food service, they are in the people service. And that showed not only to me but to the other customers who were enjoying their lunch too.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/6/2014,8/31/2014,3,12,1,4,5>I can't wait to try this place again! I don't eat pork and so it was nice walking into a place and knowing I didn't have to worry about forgetting to specify no bacon on something. I had a really hard time deciding what I wanted even after much online perusal. I've always wanted to try matzah ball soup but decided to go for the smoked meat and corned beef sandwich with a side of potato salad because I loooooove potato salad but can't make it for my life. As it turns out I much prefer corned beef to smoked meat, but both were really good. I also tried deli mustard for the first time, was just a Heinz brand, but I enjoyed it anyway. The only thing I didn't care for with the sandwich was the rye bread. It didn't withstand the weight of the meat and fell apart easily. I'd go sourdough next time. The potato salad was good, huge portion though so be forewarned. They also serve a proper cole slaw, none of that creamy, sweet crap found everywhere else. The hubby and I split a chocolate milkshake. Complete with cherry on top, but not meant for one. Old fashioned, with real ice cream and whipped cream on top. Yummmm! I wish I'd taken a pic of mine not you can partly see mine in the pic of my hubby's plate. I highly recommend the French fries!! Hands down, they are the best fries I've ever had included homemade and the ones I love from The Battered Fish. If I wasn't so stuffed I would have kept eating them, hehe. There are so many things I want to try off the menu, getting back there is a top eatery priority. Out server was fantastic, she was quick, friendly and made suggestions and answered the few questions we had. The bathroom was clean and adorable. The place is kind of small but charming with its old timey Hollywood pictures and the like. Definitely give this place a shot if you're kicking around Halifax's north end
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/26/2014,8/30/2014,1,7,1,2,3>My office went here for a lunch. I've heard many great things about Nectar so naturally, I was pretty excited that we were going! The decor was lovely- the inside is so classy and clean looking. We sat out on the gorgeous enclosed patio they have tucked away upstairs. It was the perfect day for it and we were all thrilled to be dining outside. On to the menu- for the majority of us we had already decided what we were going to get so I couldn't say much about the rest of the menu BUT, as far as what I did have: Cucumber Watermelon Salad - this came out different than I expected. It was really a "salad" in the context we would use it but I was told this was European style, so I'll go with that. Nonetheless- this dish was INCREDIBLE! Chunks of juicy watermelon with finely chopped cukes, radish & feta drizzled with balsamic. The common comment was that it felt like a "clean" eat. Very light and refreshing. A1 starter! Next was main- I had the Thai Curry Penne (mild with seafood) I really really liked it. It wasn't too spicy (one of our coworkers wanted to attempt the spicy but was intimidated when our server told them it was internationally hot and couldn't be returned to the kitchen if they couldn't stomach it) it was in fact a touch of sweet. Very yummy! It was a good portion size as well. Next we embarked on dessert. After googling what Banoffee was- I decided to give it a try. Well- being a HUGE sweets lover I was surely not disappointed. It was a HUGE hunk of pie and I ate every last piece. So tasty and creamy. I would honest consider going to Nectar again just to have a plate of desert! Drinks- I had an I Love Dartmouth and Orchid martini. Both were delicious. I don't like the taste of alcohol and neither of these made my toes curl so that was nice. My reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found it took a long time for things to get underway food wise. We had 2 hours and it took more than that. We were a bit of a larger party however we had the reservation made a week or so in advance and there were maybe 4 other patrons there besides us so I feel like it could have been better planned out.Turning a negative into a positive- the food is all worth the wait and I enjoyed the time there! Thank you Nectar for a great experience!!:)
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,8/29/2014,3,18,,5,>This to me is a great (and interesting) drinking spot. Super yummy cocktails. A little on the expensive side but well worth the treat.Young 20 something crowd keeps this place fresh and fun. Great music. Best selection in the city in my opinion but that's relative.Fun and different meaty small plates to share - if you are into that. I would love a larger menu myself.Spot on service. Cool decor and warm ambience.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2014,8/28/2014,20,226,,5,4>I've never had a Scanway cake, although I did drool over their wares when they had a storefront on Quinpool.  I ordered a cake for Father's Day/my mother's birthday.  Their website is easy to navigate with a list of all the scrumptious-looking items they offer.  I chose a chocolate fudge cake with chocolate buttercream icing.  You are able to order by email, which I really appreciated.  The prices were actually more reasonable than what I was expecting.  Pickup was a breeze.  We were approached as soon as we entered Saege and directed to the bar.  A few minutes later the cake was brought out and the box opened for inspection.  Beautiful chocolate cake with kiwi and berries on top.  (It was very good, by the way!)  While my experience with Scanway is limited, I had no problems, everyone was friendly and helpful, and I would absolutely order from them again.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/5/2014,8/27/2014,28,259,,3,3>The Board Room Cafe across the street had a private event on the go, so the girlfriend and I headed over to pop a squat and have a drink. It's a neat little place with a few of the "usual suspects" in it. The laptop user, the friend of the barista chatting it up as we ordered, and then me, who doesn't know how to do the ordering ever. We were offered a slice of cake (which was delicious) and ordered a HC (for the GF) and an Italian soda, watermelon, for me.Both options were incredibly delicious, the seating in the cafe, although a little soft, was very comfy too. Great spot with all kinds of options to choose from.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2014,8/26/2014,12,118,,4,2>I haven't ordered chinese since moving from Dartmouth to Halifax back in February, mainly because I didn't know where would be the best spot and my usual would be way to far to order from (in Dartmouth). My boyfriend was feeling a bit down on Father's Day so I decided to cheer him up by ordering his favorite cuisine. I decided on here mainly because of proximity to where I live on Washmill, fair pricing, and pictures on here of their menu items.We ordered a combo 5 and 9 for pick up. It was ready within 10 minutes. We were shocked at the amount of food - we could have easily bought one combo and had enough for the two of us and some for leftovers. The quality was good - rice was average but good, chicken balls/sauce were yummy, the meat egg roll was delicious, the veg egg roll was also delicious, and the chow mein was plentiful. My only critique was that I found my chow mein lacking in flavour, but I ordered it without onions/leeks so that may have contributed to the reduced flavor. They also accomodated our requests (no onions, packaging certain things separately) without issue.Overall, we were quite pleased. My boyfriend is amazingly picky when it comes to Chinese food and he said he would definitely order from here again, so that says a lot.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/6/2014,8/25/2014,3,19,1,4,1>My new favorite pizza place! Amazing pizzas (and salads), great service, fun atmosphere, and even great beer! This place really is a fun dining experience. It is not the cheapest pizza place in town, but you get what you pay for. Great for a family night out, or a fun date for two. There is even a beautiful beer made by Garrison, exclusively for Mother's (aptly named Mother's Brew)!Although there are other good pizza places in town, Mother's is just a cut above. The pizza bar has officially been raised Halifax!
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2014,8/24/2014,5,10,2,6,2>Great Things in Store is a magical gem of a thrift store. The proceeds go to the Parker Street Food Bank, and I love that it supports a charity directly in our community. The prices are beyond reasonable! For instance, one time I picked up a blank journal and asked the price- it was only 10 cents. I often pay more than they ask just because the prices are so good. It's great that not only do the proceeds go to charity, it also offers an affordable place for people with low income to shop. Too many thrift stores nowadays are charging high prices for secondhand goods.I often stop by to pick up baskets for 50 cents to use for gifts. It's also a great spot to grab cheap stuffed toys for my pooch. I'd recommend stopping by if you're in need of inexpensive kitchenware to furnish a first apartment. If you like weird, cheap stuff, this is the place for you!
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2013,8/23/2014,6,4,,3,4>Petite little cafe located on Agricola.  Was really excited to check out both the bands playing here for In the Dead of Winter, as well as the cafe itself.  First of all, I really loved the Mexican folklore-style decoration.  We ordered a pot of loose leaf tea ($3 for a big pot), which we split between the two of us.  At the time, the local was set up to accommodate the artists so, naturally, the cafe looked a bit different than I'm sure it does on a daily basis.If you enjoy, for lack of a better phrase, that North End charm, do yourself a favour and check this place out.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2014,8/22/2014,1,4,,3,2>I have been the many times over the past 20 years.   Food always consistent.  Takes fried seafood to the next level.   The place is a hole in the wall, but don't let that stop you from experiencing the best I've had ever anywhere.  One time I went there as a teen with my father and there was a crew there filming a documentary for Martha Stewart!  What does that tell you.   I must add I have a palette for fine food, both parents cooked professionally.
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2014,8/21/2014,0,8,1,2,2>Their beef tacos are amazing!  It's not ground beef it's like roast beef, so good!!! The place is awesome, family owned and operated and very authentic Mexican. A Mexican friend of mine was very impressed that they could have such perfect quality Mexican food all the way up here.
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2014,8/20/2014,27,128,,3,2>The Nook is a cozy, classy little coffee shop that offers so much more than coffee. The atmosphere is lively and the decor is quaint and stylish. Their display case is filled with delicious look treats including lots of vegan options such as cheesecake, cookies and energy bars. They also have a menu, which I didn't got a full look at but it has many vegan options as well. I got the smoked tofu and an energy bar, both were simply delicious. The staff was friendly, helpful and welcoming. Probably my favourite coffee shop I have been to in the HRM.
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,8/19/2014,25,117,3,3,4>This place is awesome! We stayed after the Elite event to play some more games and we were not disappointed. The place got busier as the night went on, and we did see a few people waiting - a good sign for good times!There are SO many games! We couldn't decide what to play first. We tried some Shark Bite, which was fun and quick ; some lumberjack game, where you knock over pieces (I got a little over zealous and they may have all ended up scattered...); a dragon game with tiles; a train game, where you try to get as many lines going across North America as possible; and a few other gems. We were wondering if they had Kerplunk but ran out of time to ask. Next time!The atmosphere when this place gets going is loud and fun. It's great for a group of friends and they've got some delicious treats - sandwiches, dips, candy, local soda, and more! My one complaint is that good service was SLOW and not attentive. We ordered a dip plate and it took almost 30 minutes to get it. After that we asked for more naan to finish the dip, it was fantastic and needed tone eaten, but after ordering it twice we have up. When we went to pay it was clear they'd totally forgotten our (two) orders.  But that's the worst that happened... No biggie!Other than that it was a fantastic experience and we will all be back!!
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2014,8/18/2014,29,166,3,1,2>Great new location on the Halifax waterfront boardwalk! The place has a great feel with windows all around for people watching. And of course the coffee can't be beat. Can't wait to make it a regular stop strolling along the harbour.
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2014,8/17/2014,8,15,1,2,2>Loved the food.Started off with some excellent Chicken Satay abd moved on to some spicy Thai noodles and chicken fried rice. Waitress offered the hot sauce which turned out to be pretty good.Guess I'll be going back again!
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2013,8/16/2014,9,76,,1,2>After driving by this food truck located in Bedford Hwy all summer long we finally made the decision to stop in & grab lunch this week. This food truck specializes in Frites. Not just any Frites but really really unique recipes! I have to say it was an extremely hard choice to pick which ones we wanted. Luckily I was with my husband so we got to try 2 different variations.I ordered the Queso Frite- filled with pico de galo, creamy cheese and a few other yummies. I loved it! No complaints. The Frites themselves were cooked to perfection!My husband went for the Butter Chicken Frite. Keeping in mind he is very( I mean VERY) picky. So I was iffy if he would enjoy it. Anyway he thoroughly enjoyed every last bite & raved about it for some time after we left. I tried it also & agreed the butter chicken sauce was delicious, with small bite size pieces of chicken hidden within.Price point was good... Thinking it was about $8.00 per Frites? And the portion sizes were perfect. We were both able to finish our lunch, but left not feeling like we needed to be rolled out of there. Props to the Tin Pan Alley for not contributing to the increasingly high obesity rates from serving ridiculously large un-necessary portions!  Will we re-visit.... Oh yeah!! Cant wait :)
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2014,8/15/2014,48,65,3,4,3>I'm really impressed with this place so far! The food has been great (I eat a LOT of falafel, and there's is some of the best I've had in Halifax), and the owner and staff are just wonderful. It's very pleasant place to spend a few minutes in, and their huge variety of veggie options is a welcome change to what's currently available in the neighborhood.I'll be stopping by often!
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2014,8/14/2014,3,13,,2,3>Delicious, soft, homemade marshmallows in a multitude of flavours! My personal favorite: the toasted coconut marshmallows. They also offer Vanilla, Lemon coconut, Maple, Honey Barberry w/Pistachio & Coconut, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Swirl, Root Beer Float, S'mores, Beer-Mallow, Chipper Mint, and a variety of seasonal flavours! They also offer an assortment of chocolate dipped marshmallows. Milk chocolate covered toasted coconut is my all-time favorite. I cannot walk by the table without purchasing one (ok...two)! They offer more delicious treats as well. I would recommend stopping by their booth (upstairs) at the Halifax Seaport Farmer's Market on Saturday or Sunday. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2014,8/13/2014,13,104,1,4,3>I grew up eating lots of garlic in most of my meals - so when I go to Ela! if there isn't enough garlic, I start to question the establishment. So far so good, that's never happened to me yet!I love their souvalaki, their shawarma (even though it's very different than the Lebanese kind I'm used to), and the lemon potatoes/greek salad are so good!I'd like to do a review of one visit here - but to be honest, I go to this Ela at least once or twice a month. So it all kind of mixes together - but what stays the same is the food quality and service. They seem to have this great consistency about those things that I expect every time I go there and they never let me down.I'm trying to go through the entire menu and try as much of it as I can - the last thing I had was the Chicken Breast Riganato. It's a pretty good sized sandwich. Very flavourful, delicious bread and tasty secret ela sauce! The greek salad and the lemon potatoes like I said before are just so friggin good....I could eat platefuls of those two things. Service was consistent, attentive and super friendly as usual. Will definitely be continuing my tradition of eating here and loving every minute of it!
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2014,8/12/2014,2,8,1,1,1>The best Indian food I have ever tasted. The butter chicken is very nice and creamy I visit here about 2 or 3 times a month and every time I'm welcomed by amazing servers and great customer service ! I recommend this restaurant 100%
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/28/2014,8/11/2014,11,44,4,4,3>Price- Great!Selection- Not badQuality- Pretty GoodCleanliness- Good!Atmosphere- Better then someMenu Layout- ConfusingService- GoodOK! The Summary of my review is at the top of my review! (in simplest terms) so that your saved my long Ty-raid about things like toilet heights and soap dispensers...(For better understanding read my other reviews)First thing I'm gonna say is, this was not an originally planned outing! I did not eat in, I had take out, So there will be no Toilet height or Soap Dispenser reviews in this one... sorry guys! I know thats critical (yes Im making fun of myself!)Here we go!My friends and I popped in out of randomness to pick up sushi for our (soon to be regular) Ladies who eat sushi night. We weren't staying so we told the waitress we were planning take out, we were given a menu each and a table to sit at so we could decide.She gave us a good length of time before asking us if we knew what we wanted, it took us a while to review the menu because the layout is a bit... confusing.its an older style menu, with to many pages and they're all out of what would be viewed as a natural order.. if you want a combo the first and third page were where ya looked but if you wanted Maki it was the fifth and seventh page... That could be refined!Also, the specials being hand written on bristol board and taped in the windows do take away a level of sophistication this place could use. (The papers weren't there when I was younger.)The tables are cute, have the feel of a traditional Japanese place with a western practicality. I really like it, instead of the blatantly western looking Sushi places! (you know what i mean by that, the places that look more like a Cafeteria then a Sushi place?) The feel of being Traditionally Japanese gives Momoya in my mind a different place in the Sushi Scene in Halifax!Now, on to the important part of the review, the FOOD! (and subsequent price there of)I had a combo and their spicy tuna roll, I also ordered my friend a Dynamite Roll and another Tuna Roll.My combo same with extra salad as I cannot eat Miso Soup! (to many people put the vile evil tofu in it)Now! (since I accidentally submitted without finishing here's the rest of the review!)The Spicey Tuna Roll was just as delish as other Tuna Rolls I've eaten!! The Salad was alittle over dressed, but it was still delish! The veggie combo platter i had was really good to!!all of my friends said they really enjoyed their meals as well, we barely talked for 20 minutes because our faces were being stuffed with sushi, salad, soup and dumplings! oh and Tempora veggies.oh, I was going to say something about price!The price is Great, less then 20 bucks for my combo and Tuna roll, less then 20 for the other two! So its REALLY affordable, which is big in my world! Good food for less!So I hope you enjoy my LONG winded review! maybe on my next visit, I will get that regulatory Bathroom Review! (its funny that I do that i know!)
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2014,8/9/2014,3,3,3,3,3>The overall vibe is lovely! All the staff are amazing, the waitress' are helpful and quick, the cooks serve amazing tasting food and the cashier is always lovely to talk to. I would recommend anyone to go to Mary's 2!!!! AND THE GREEK SALAD IS AWESOME!!!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/24/2014,8/8/2014,3,10,1,1,1>Was walking through the Alderney marker when surprise! Beer!Asked buddy a few questions and a couple samples later found myself leaving with no groceries and holding a big bottle of beer!The brewery is easy to find and has friendly staff.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,8/7/2014,1,4,1,4,2>This review is for the beer, as I didn't order food.As a craft beer lover, this place was right up my alley. They have a great selection on tap and  the wood handles on said taps are arranged from light to dark if you don't know what the descriptions are. That being said if you're new to craft beer, the staff is also very helpful and guide you to something you'll like. I had the Uncle Leo's smoked porter and it was delicious. Also had Dieu Duciel, a nice light fruity brew with hibiscus which had a "grapefruity" colour and taste.The prices are pretty reasonable for what you're getting so go check it out.Just get there early to beat the rush as it can get crowded.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/17/2014,8/6/2014,5,40,1,1,1>As I am not a beer drinker, I really enjoy their beer, I enjoy the Tall Ship Amber, but the possibilities are amazing, with friendly staff, as well knowledgeable about the product is awesome. I have wanting a growler of the stuff, but I have been procrastinating. But need less the say its an awesome place to hit up in the summer and have a few laughs with friends or surf the web while having a cold one.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2013,8/5/2014,0,5,1,3,1>Decided to try Pipa tonight for Dinner. I had to make a fast decison about where to eat and it was A.) close to work, B.) Close to an event I was going to later and C.) There seemed to be lots of  dishes that weren't covered in great gobs  of cheese. (newly diagnosed dairy allergy...*sob*  )Being a big fan of dining alfresco, my friend and I grabbed a table in the hot, scalding sun..and then wisely moved to another shadier table within five minutes(.There were plenty of seats available ) We were greeted immediately, presented with menus, offered drinks and read the specials.My friend ordered the seafood rice, which she said was delicious.It looked it. I almost had it myself, but I am one of those people who can't bring myself to orderthe same meal as my dining companion , no matter how badly i want to.It had some lovely looking mussels and scallops served with rice. I had the veggie stew, which really was wonderful. ..a very flavourful, gently spiced blend of beans, mango, sweet potato, some zuchinni, i think..served with steamed rice. We also both had sangria which was delicious.The service was quick and friendly,and i felt welcomed ,Unfortunately, we were pressed for time and couldn't stick around for dessert. I had checked out their menu online prior to going and there are plenty of  items on the linch and dessert menu that will entice me to go back. Soon.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/4/2013,8/4/2014,8,31,1,2,1>Since I haven't eaten at a restaurant for a little while, it was a wonderful treat to get to go to Heartwood! I adore them, despite having not been there in about a year and a half. They've really grown up into one heck of a cool restaurant. It feels like the place to go when you have a little extra cash and want to splurge while you go out with friends, or maybe impress a vegan date.The Heartwood coconut curry bowl was yummy -- spicy, but not too spicy for this wimp, and very delicious. Fresh local veggies and all! I was also impressed by the hot cocoa (made with soy milk, and the waitress asked if I'd prefer soy or regular without needing to be prompted!).The bill's a tad high to come here regularly without the aid of a Groupon, but I think I'd still visit this place as a treat, given that the standard restaurant meal that I can actually eat costs about the same as a meal here!
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2014,8/3/2014,27,83,1,1,1>Every Saturday, hundreds of Haligonians congregate at this fine local establishment. Whether it is to enjoy the local fares, search for local arts and crafts or to buy the local produce, there's something for everyone to look forward to here at the Seaport Farmers' Market. During the non-winter season, you could head up to the roof top and enjoy the view of the water. Or sometimes just relax and enjoy the music that variety of buskers come to share for everyone to hear. I myself would go over there to buy bacon from Getaway farms and once awhile search for some interesting craft to adorn our apartment.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2014,8/2/2014,18,151,1,5,4>My family and I thought we'd give Cole's a try - my father had heard great things about their fish and chips. I'm not interested in fish and chips, but I thought it was worthwhile to give a little business to a local establishment.Pros:- Friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful server. My nephew, who recently had oral surgery, needed a few modifications to his meal since he cannot have anything hard or crunchy. Our server recommended the fish tips from the Kid's Menu - and soft they were. I was impressed by the amount of food included in the $5.99 kid's meal.- Comfy, down-home decor. Nothing fancy, but welcoming and well-spaced. - Good food. My parents both had the haddock special and really enjoyed it - generous portions and great seasoning. The batter on my nephew's fish tips was quite thin and soft, which was unusual but rather nice. The sweet potato fries were done to a turn!-I had the chicken wrap with a tossed salad. Most tossed salads suck, but I liked this one - it had the usual iceberg lettuce and tomato slices, but also slivered carrots, cucumbers, green peppers, and broccoli. The chicken wrap was very fresh-tasting and soft, albeit a little plain. I wisely ordered it with curry mayo.- Reasonable prices.- Vast and varied menu.Cons:- The bathrooms, as others have noted, could use a little sprucing up.We were rather pleased with our experience at Cole's and will certainly be back the next time we're in the area. Well done!
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/25/2014,8/1/2014,6,3,2,2,2>I absolutely LOVE this place!  It is my favorite sushi restaurant. The staff is friendly and it has a great atmosphere.There is an awesome little room with one table in it that is perfect for dates. It's very private and the lighting is incredible.We come here with fiends, with our kids and when we have a night alone. Sushi is our favorite dining out food, and it is AMAZING here!
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/9/2014,7/31/2014,59,150,1,6,3>I am beyond impressed with the transformation from part of The Dome to The Auction House! Wow! They managed to turn a bar that you're use to having your feet stick to the floor into a classy, up-scale eatery! Unfortunately, this was my only stop for Burger Week this year, but at least I made it a good one! Their 6 oz ground beef and sausage burger was topped with honey-infused goat cheese, chipotle aioli and arugula on the perfect choice of artisan bun was mouth watering. My friend and I each got the burger and shared a side of their truffle fries, it was a perfect combo!I'm excited to go back to The Auction House to try more of their menu, and see how their 'Auctions' actually play out!
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2014,7/30/2014,20,178,2,3,3>The beef brisket or "rib" burger was awesome. This was my first time at Bearly's since Ace moved in and I enjoyed myself. The same friendly staff, locals, and musical talent with a fresh menu. The brisket burger has three huge chuncks of tender beef with housemade coleslaw and onion ring...I wouldn't mind a whole side of these rings! A huge pile and fries and $6 Keith's draft filled up my belly while a two-piece blues band played.

<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,7/28/2014,6,10,1,3,1>I've been here now more times than I can remember and keep going back.  I won't pretend that I've had much on their menu as the first thing I ordered was a Prosciutto and Provolone croissant and I haven't been able to bring myself to order anything else since.  I hear good things from a reliable source about the cookies.  I stick to the coffee which I sometimes I find a little strong, but ordering it as a pour over is both worth the wait and much tastier in my opinion.  Service has always been good no matter how busy they are.I'd say the only downsides for me are the parking, there isn't much. It is usually a hunt around the side streets.  It makes for a nice stroll on a sunny day, not so much in inclement weather.  It can be hard to get seated on a busy day, but it's always worth the wait.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,7/27/2014,0,6,1,3,1>Christeen at Sykea is the only person in town I will let cut my hair. After years of hating and fighting natural curls, with Christeen's expertise, I now love them. If you want someone who knows how to really work with your natural curls, without requiring much fuss, she's your gal! Christeen is a great conversationalist, too.Excellent service, and friendly staff. I would most certainly recommend Sykea!

I love the small sitting,.. getting close to your partner and to swap the bbq sauce. I love the pull chicken sandwich and my wife loves anything there.

<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2014,7/25/2014,2,9,3,4,2>Bit pricey for cheesecake but I'll pay it all day! OMFG best dessert ever. For a celiac, trapped in a world of fruit salad or ice cream desserts this is a hella treat! They are so good, and staff is really gluten aware I really feel OK ordering from them.Took a friend (vegan and GF, poor darling!) For cheesecake celebrations on her birthday. And the staff didn't disappoint. She had vegan GF chocolate raspberry and I had gluten free double chocolate brownie. When they delivered the goodies to us they had lit a candle for her (so cute) and she got to have a real awesome birthday cake! Thanks for being fab and helping out the GF folks. We love sweet hereafter!
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2014,7/24/2014,5,8,1,3,3>Fantastic lemonade and wonderfully friendly staff.  The constantly changing variety of lemonades being offered ensures that every week you can turn in your old bottle and purchase a new and delicious flavour.  Some of the combinations may sound unusual, but these folks know war they're doing and you should not hesitate to believe in what they're offering.  I certainly do.
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,7/23/2014,0,7,1,2,2>A staple in the neighborhood. Great food and coffee. This place truly represents the area and I couldn't support a north end establishment more. Free wifi and is a very comfortable place to hang out and work or meet a friend. They also have great music on weekend nights.
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,7/22/2014,1,17,1,5,1>Ever since the expansion, I go to the Black Market Boutique much more than I did before. It used to be if I had time to go, but now it's a must!I feel as if the things there have got better than they were before. It could be my evolving tastes, but I have bought endless amounts of jewellery from there. It's become a store that I can't walk out of without something in my hands.A+, Black Market!
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/24/2014,7/21/2014,26,201,,6,3>I love our meal here! We went on Vday, and were promptly greeted and seated. This is a comfortable resto with a relaxed atmosphere. The menu provided lots of choice, and the prix fix menu was a great deal!Our cod was delicious, maybe a little on the buttery side, but cooked to perfection. The side veggies were steamed properly and the lobster mashed potatoes were THE BEST thing I have ever eaten. They were not just lobster flavor, they had huge chunks of lobster mixed in! So spectacular. The lobster bisque was also superb and the goat cheese crab croquettes were unreal.Overall we had a fantastic experience, with great service!
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2011,7/20/2014,29,249,1,5,3>A greasy spoon type place, that unless I had reviews of, I would never have visited. They always have the blinds down in the window, so you can't tell what it's like until you go in. You can help yourself to the fridge at the back for a drink, but I can't go to Westcliffe and not get a milkshake, thick, delicious and cheap. I don't eat red meat so I can't comment on the cheeseburgers, but my friend said his was delicious. I had the chicken fingers and fries combo, and while basic was very tasty, the chicken actually had some taste to it, and the fries were nice and crispy. The onion rings were yummy as well, they are the thinner diner style, compared to the thick battered style A&W and other places serve. The prices are incredibly cheap, which means they keep their costs low by not having any service staff, mismatched plates etc. If you're looking for a cheap, but delicious dive food, this is a great spot. Warning, they close early, around 6!
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2012,7/19/2014,2,6,3,5,4>A friend and I checked out Mezza on a whim last Friday night. We were in search of a nice spot to vent over some wine and when we saw the menu, decided to sample a few nibbles. We shared the hummus, tabboule, grilled halloumi and falafel. All were delicious, but the falafel totally knocked our socks off, yum! The tabboule was also lovely and the serving size massive. I was happy to discover that the leftovers made for a fantastic base for a pizza the next day.Our server was great. Friendly, knowledgeable and very sweet to present complimentary dessert at the end of the meal, saying that every girl dealing with boy troubles deserves a little baklava. So thoughtful! I'm looking forward to trying their dinner and a movie promo with Oxford Theatre sometime soon.
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/29/2012,7/18/2014,28,16,1,6,4>"My Big Fat Cape Breton Wedding" was the forth show that I've seen at Halifax Feast. I always enjoy it. The shows have an array of vibrant characters who can act, sing, dance and play instruments.The actors remain in character while serving and use your name during the meal, which is a nice, personal touch.  The quality of the food has improved since my first visit. The entree options include: Oven roasted salmon, roasted pork loin, seared sirloin, chicken breast, jumbo shrimp or vegetarian chili. The owner and director of the Feast, Jim Petrie writes all of the plays. They're full of comedic wit, pop culture and remakes of old and new songs. The Feast is an underrated little gem and I recommend it for all ages. Prices are reasonable considering it includes a 3-course dinner and a show. -Regular $42.70 + taxes $49.11-Children (12 & under) Half Price$21.35 + taxes $24.55(The Children's Rate Is Not Valid For Saturday Evening Performances)-Group (20 + people paid on one bill)$37.95 + taxes + gratuity $49.33
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2013,7/17/2014,9,3,1,8,4>In a student town like Halifax (and when I was a tad younger), 'getting in to a bar' discussions usually revolved around fake IDs, avoiding cover, and displaying as much sobriety as possible when you pre-loaded at a party. With those days pretty far behind me, the idea that a bar in Halifax has a password, made Noble seem all the more interesting. Keen to stop in and sample the notorious cocktails, we secured the fortune cookie-like password and trotted off to the Middle Spoon to utter the magic phrase... POOF! And we were in.Upon first impression, Noble is an intimate space - fairly small with dark corners, good spacing between tables, character finishes, and a cohesiveness in the look and small touches that makes you think someone's vision has truly come alive. The Cocktail menu is extensive, but not overwhelming, and the descriptions are thorough. I ordered a Bearcat, which was phenomenal, while some of the drinks at our table were a bit overpowering for my taste. To give you an example, a friend had a tequila based cocktail that pretty much tasted like a shot of tequila. But it was fun to sample a few concoctions and for next time, I will know what to re-order.   All and all, I would certainly revisit Noble for a cocktail or two. From my experience, the atmosphere lends itself to quieter conversation, or drinks with friends, and doesn't seem to be a place to mix and mingle with those outside your original table.Oh, and only one door in and out, folks... So for those who suffer from claustrophobia, perhaps you'll want to avoid this Halifax gem.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2012,7/16/2014,7,40,,13,3>I adore Antoinette's, after driving by many times a coworker recommended this spa and I am so happy she did. Antoinette is a complete sweetheart  and made me feel like I had known her forever the 1st time I was in.I have only ever had 1 pedicure, which was really good, affordable and we had allot of fun picking colours. She really took her time with the treatment and my feet felt brand new afterwards. Antoinette's is also a perfect place to pick up nail polish, I have a bit of a problem with buying polish (I can't stop) and she has one of the best prices in the city for OPI.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2013,7/15/2014,13,1,,4,1>This is the third time I have gone to the salon for a massage. I absolutely love the premises; it has a very relaxed and professional feel to it.RMT Lindsay Bendell is amazing at what she does. All aspects were 5/5, namely the atmosphere, music, scents and products used. I highly recommend Lindsay to anyone looking for a rejuvenation of mind, body and spirit. Her skill and technique are like no other. Check her out on Windsor St.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2011,7/14/2014,52,21,,10,3>Vietnamese spring rolls. That's really all I need to say. Because they're delish. My favourite in town, in fact. And I could eat 10 in one sitting, but fortunately for my mid-section, I have enough discipline to keep it at 2. Followed by an enormous bowl of beef Pho, which is equally tasty. Their vermicelli is also great, and while I've only had their Chinese food a handful of times (because I can't pull myself away from the spring rolls and Pho), it's also pretty good. All in all, this is a great location for a group that has varying tastes - Vietnamese for the more adventurous and standard Canadian Chinese for the more mainstream folks in the crowd. Oh, yes, and if you're a Pho takeout fan, their packaging is great - they keep the noodles and broth separate so there's no mushiness happening. And, perhaps most importantly, the serving is every bit as substantial as you get when you eat-in.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2012,7/13/2014,42,100,,4,2>I recently took a walk along the stretch of the Halifax Waterfront and boy, was I surprised. I've been living in this city for ten years and since my early days of exploring the downtown area of the city, I'd preferred certain parts of the waterfront to others, mostly because the focus of development along the waterfront was limited to certain areas so walking its length was met with some unsightly sections. That is no more!Starting at the Halifax Market end and ending near the casino is over 1km but the entire section is boardwalk or sidewalk. There is barely an inch where you don't have options for dining, sidewalk-meals, shopping, sightseeing or just pleasant rest. Bishop's Landing is home to some wonderful shopping and restaurants in a beautiful area just after the Market. From there, past Sugah, you pass a sight for Beach Volleyball before venturing into the resting spot for many tall ships and fast food and snacks, including the ever-famous Beavertail. Approaching the Halifax Ferry Terminal, you reach some licensed restaurants including Murphy's before nearing the end of the walk with Cows ice cream, in case you want more.The Waterfront plays host to many events during the year, especially the summer. Aside from the International Busker Festival, there's also the Al Fresco Film Festival, the Tall Ships every few years and more, depending on the time of year. The summer is always abuzz down here with tourists and lots of excitement and people.I definitely recommend taking the long way around, the boardwalk that juts out over the water rather than shortcuts that bring you in between or through buildings. If it's a nice day, there's so much to take in with the views and, for me, it's really the little things that make the Waterfront such a great place to pass through. The decor, the lamps, the random 8 foot tall red "1812" once you pass Cows. It's an impressive walk and one that I think helps push Halifax that much further into a city that I'm proud to call home.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,7/12/2014,13,213,1,4,5>While picking my wife up from a meeting at Dal and after a really long day at work. I was tried and wondering around in front of the sub at dal when I saw this hot dog stand. I knew of the dog father I have been around this city my whole life but never made an effort to visit his stand but since it was a the first real day of nice weather and I was standing around I thought why not. I ordered a veg dog and while I waited the dog father was telling me stories about politics, student life, everything. He was so friendly and nice to be around. I had a hard day and for the couple mins it took to grill up my veg dog he had a lot to say and took an interest in me. Where am I from, What I do what my wife does he was just as interested as a sales person on the floor at duggers mens wear would be in a client. I will be back for sure and even go a little out of my way for a dog father veg dog in the near future.
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2011,7/11/2014,1,10,4,9,4>We went here after looking on Yelp for beaches!We were not disappointed with the quality of the beach. It was of course, tremendously busy, on a Saturday afternoon, but it is quite a large beach to allow you to have a few foot personal space buffer. The cars were lined up down the road, and we followed suit. Since it was mid afternoon, as we got into the actual park, we noticed there were empty spaces closer to the beach entrance, and would try for those another time if we went in the afternoon. It is definitely a bit of a hike to the beach from the road (although flat), but it would call this more of a day-at-the-beach spot than somewhere to go for a swim for an hour.  There is a canteen and bathrooms, which were out of order, but there were still portable bathrooms.
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/2/2012,7/10/2014,34,12,1,10,6>Let me say right away. I was completely blown away by the Drawing Room. I had no idea this place even existed until last November when I took my boyfriend out for a few birthday drinks after hearing about this hidden treasure from a friend. Okay. So, I love this place, but I must warn you straight up. If you are looking for a quick, cheap drink, steer clear of the Drawing Room. Now, on the other hand, if you're looking for a nice, cozy, wood laden nook, complete with comfy, classy seating, wooden beams, brick walls, and a fireplace cracking in the background....BINGO. This place reminds me of the den in your rich Great Uncle's mansion (what?)...Anyways! This is such a classy, yet comfortable space to sit and have a few (delicious, fancy, extremely well-made) drinks. They aren't receptive to big crowds, so this is a place to go with a few (6 tops) friends. The most I've had with me is 6-7 people and that was okay with staff! This might seem strange to people, but they do this to keep the ambiance intact. They don't want people pushing tables together and carrying on loudly and whatnot. They don't want to disturb the atmosphere for others. And I completely agree with that notion. This is not the place for that kind of a gathering. This is an intimate setting, and is to be enjoyed that way! They close around midnight, and are only open on Friday and Saturday, so this leaves lots of time to go slam a few tables together with 10 pals and get rowdy (if that's what you're into....)The drink menu is divided up by era (pre, post prohibition etc), and as Paul B. mentioned in his review, the attention is in the details. From the glassware, to the shaved ice (they literally chip ice from a huge block at the bar) - the drinks take time to get to you, because they are the real deal! Pricier than most bars, the drinks are impeccably crafted, and they don't skimp on the booze in any of them! I've left here feeling warm and fuzzy more than once!This isn't the kind of place you go every weekend (unless you can afford it - in which case - we should totally do drinks?) But more, for a special occasion, or to have a nice drink or two. They create a seasonal menu every few months, with neat offerings around Christmas (they had some kick-ass egg nog and mimosas last year if I remember correctly.)I tried the Mojito and it was far too sweet for my liking but some might enjoy that. I really like the Amaretto Sour they offer. I can't go there without having one (or 4). An Amaretto Sour combines amaretto, bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, and it's topped with whipped egg white. This drink is pleasing to both the palatte and to the eye! My boyfriend usually orders a Negroni cocktail right off the bat. For those who don't know, a Negroni is made of one part gin, one part vermouth (usually red, semi- sweet), and one part bitters, traditionally Campari. Not for the faint of heart, let me tell you!  I've tried a number of things here and the drinks are generally well made, tasty, and strong (just how I like em.)As for food, they have a small menu with some apps and things for sharing. The goat cheese flatbread is amazing - I usually get one of those and some olives if I'm hungry when I get there. Holy Negroni Batman! I almost finished this review without mentioning my favourite part! If you find yourself at the DR for drinks, you HAVE to try the aromatic diffuser (it's only 2$ with a cocktail.) As if they needed anything to add to the ambiance this place oozes, you can order your very own mini dry-ice diffuser for the table. Essentially, choose a scent (comes in stick form I believe), and it's presented in a stainless steel mug/bowl, which then gets dry ice poured over it to produce 'smoke' which engulfs the table. I've tried the lemon (fave), the beach inspired one, and the pomegranate. The waitstaff can recommend a scent to compliment your cocktail and enhance the flavours of your drink! This is so neat and different so I urge you to try this out - it's not to be missed! To me, this is the perfect place to go for a date, a drink with a friend or a few couples. Intimate and classic, with a drink menu to match! A great place for a pre-dinner cocktail, or a post-dinner nightcap! I'm heading for a nice family dinner on the weekend, and we'll definitely be making a stop here after we eat!
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2013,7/9/2014,39,80,3,5,3>It seems Tara and I like to frequent the joints in the North End that offer caffeine. Dee Dee's is no exception. They have a full espresso bar and offer the most amazing Affogatto (their house made gelato of your choice with espresso on top). What I can't believe is that I've been here at least once a month for the last year and I still have yet to sample a burrito (which is hilariously the other thing Dee Dee's is known for besides their gelato). Recently they also added grilled cheese sandwiches (made with old cheddar and bacon jam), soups and vegetarian chili to the menu. All of which sound just as appealing as they smell when you're sipping your coffee. They don't have a whole lot of seating room for dining in, and they will happily make up your food or drink for you take to run, but the staff at DeeDee's are pleasant and sweet and enjoy some fun tunes if you're hanging out for a bit. Until I get to try the good eats on the menu, I will rave about the coffee and espresso selections and definitely recommend the gelato. If you go, do me a favor and tell me how good the food is? Maybe it will inspire me to branch out...
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2013,7/8/2014,39,130,,6,3>In my opinion, Mama Gratti's has the best lunchtime deals in Scotia Square if you're looking for something on the healthier side. Soups, salads, sandwiches, snacks, smoothies ... they've got it all and the prices are very reasonable. The line can get pretty long around noon, but they are very efficient and I've never waited more than a few minutes.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2012,7/7/2014,54,227,2,7,2>Great service and delicious tea? Need I say more? OK, I will. I'm not a huge tea drinker but I do occasionally like a hot beverage that doesn't come with the caffeine buzz of a late-afternoon coffee or the calories of a rich hot chocolate. Phil and his staff are always great for recommendations - the caramelized pear is a favorite of mine, as are the tea-ciders. There are also tasty treats available! I like to pair my tea with a Made With Local granola bar.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,7/6/2014,6,6,,2,1>Love this place.  I pretty much go here everyday for my coffee and it's always my first choice for a place to meet up with friends.  Staff are great and the food is really good. I recommend the strawberry scone.  I live in Dartmouth and will often drive here just for coffee.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,7/5/2014,8,168,2,3,2>I had a great experience here the other day.  I visited this touristy shop looking for some items to add to a wedding gift basket I'm making for a friend in Toronto who lived here as a child and has a special place for NS in her heart.  I made it clear I wasn't looking for any souvenier junk (read: tacky lobster magnet or lighthouse key chain), but for items that were Nova Scotia made and that she couldn't get in T.O.  The worker was really helpful and showed me some yummy NS blueberry jam, which I got and explained about some of the nice pewter ornaments they had and where they were made.  I left with a few items to add to my basket and was very pleased.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2014,7/4/2014,22,150,,4,2>My sister gave me a sample gift pack from Liquid Gold for Christmas and from the first time we combined the oil and vinegar for bread dipping, we were hooked. Finally got in to the store this past Saturday to replenish our stock.The set up of the store lends itself to making a circuit or two to sample the delicious offerings. It's hard to decide what to try. To sample everything in one visit would be too much. Thankfully, the staff will advise on good pairings for your particular tastes or recipes. They also will suggest nice pairings of oils & vinegars. Hence we left with a bottle of Blood Orange infused oil & raspberry infused vinegar for our spinach salads.There are very diverse flavours available in both vinegars and oils. You'll find fruity, herby, earthy or spicy. There are blends as well as oils from different countries and varieties, other condiments and preserves, including at least half a dozen types of mustard. And of course there are a number of accessories including spouts and drizzlers.It's all a bit overwhelming but I think it might be best to just keep going back and try a few at a time and build up a collection to suit ever occasion and recipe. And speaking of recipes, they have a great collection on their website and I already have a few on my list to try.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2014,7/3/2014,26,16,,2,1>I've had the distinct pleasure to experience this wine bar on several occasions. I have to say that the atmosphere and the wine selection is superb. Anyone looking to experience fine service with an exceptional selection of wine from places you may not even know exist ought to give this place a gander.
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2013,7/2/2014,29,84,,3,1>Great selection of music, good atmosphere, often packed. There are different areas to sit or stand so arrive a little early to get a good spot if that interests you. I've been here when there has been live painting going on, and the bands seem to often pull musician friends (aka special guests) up on stage, it's a flexible musical environment for sure. I've never been disappointed, the sound is good (consider ear plugs), the gigs are varied, and the cover is reasonable. The staff are friendly enough and you can order food from upstairs which is a bonus. Grab some nachos and a pint of local draft, and listen - or dance! - the night away.
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,7/1/2014,0,9,,3,1>My favourite pizza place in Halifax. Yes it is small and apparently they don't take reservations but honestly it is worth the wait. I love the pepperoni pizza and the salted caramel tart is to die for. If you are in the area definitely check this place out!
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2014,6/30/2014,13,8,3,7,4>I stumbled upon a gem.  Taco Del Mar.  As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted by one of the owners.    The atmosphere has a subway restaurant look to it,  but I assure you it is anything but a "chainstyle" establishment.  The fish tacos alone are worth the visit.   I ordered the special, two fish tacos  (one on a hard shell and the other on a corn soft shell.)  5.26 tax in.    They were amazing! Come check it out and support these young local owners.
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,6/29/2014,76,115,,3,3>The hallmark of a good ethnic restaurant? You are the only people not of that ethnic group who are eating there! We were the only non-Asian people eating at 9+Nine yesterday, so that tells you how authentic and tasty it is!We were hankering for some chinese food after a long hike and wanted to try a new place. We almost took our food home, but I'm so glad we decided to eat-in and experience the wonderful service and presentation. I believe it's a family that runs it - the mother and son (I'm assuming) were the ones mainly serving us and they were super friendly and attentive. Their timing was impeccable - each new dish arriving within minutes of us finishing the previous. It's a small place but very clean and well taken care of. You can tell they take a lot of pride in what they do.And the food! The best part of the food is that it's so much fresher than your average "Americanized" Chinese food - nothing is over-fried or loaded with salt and msg. The sauces all had just the right hint of heat and a great sweet/sour flavour mix. We ordered egg rolls, pork/veggie dumplings, Shanghai noodles, 3-mushrooms with beef and a side of plain rice. Everything was delicious and presented really nicely - the rice came in cute little stainless containers with tops and the noodles in a large wok - easy for serving. The beef and mushrooms were perfectly cooked and had lots of flavour. I would definitely recommend ordering a bunch of things and sharing amongst your table. Our bill was almost $60 + tip but considering the portions, and quality of the food and service, very reasonable (we took about half our food home). I think we found a new neighbourhood favourite!
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2014,6/28/2014,71,306,1,6,3>Amazing food and service, at a price.I'm conflicted with this restaurant. If it was in another city where restaurant competition was lower, I would probably give it five stars. But the lack of a star is due to their few dollars over the normal price of food in the area. Don't get me wrong, the quality is at least as good as all the other restaurants. I would place 2 Doors Down in my top five restaurants in the area for sure! But even two dollars less on almost everything and they would truly be a force to be reckoned with!Service - 100%. The staff are friendly, funny without losing their professionalism and quick. Atmosphere - Beautiful. The right amount of light and plenty of windows for natural light on the non-foggy Nova Scotia days.Cleanliness - Washrooms are very clean and the staff look like they are making sure nothing is left unchecked.Food - Very good. The burger I had was good but not "whoa I want to marry this!". I had the Smokehouse burger. But according to my friends, the Old School is wwwaayyy better. I might go back and try it, but I could be looking for a raise if I'm to venture in.Conclusion - If you have the money to burn, or want to at least try it once, go for it! Their deserts are fantastic (try the Chocolate Mousse. A photo I took of it is in here). The staff are great. Price could drop just slightly but that's the only thing I found that was a deterrent.
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2014,6/27/2014,8,31,2,5,4>Pho and Korean tacos... These are possibly the taste of Halifax summer for me. Service is great, price is fair. They just opened a new one on Barrington st. and I am very excited! You just know that the ingredients are FRESH and they put care in making your delicious food!
<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,6/26/2014,11,5,6,8,4>What to order:Deluxe burger and friesClassic burger and friesSingle deluxe burgerSingle classic burgerDeluxe burger and another deluxe burgerDeluxe burger and a classic burgerOr ANYTHING else on the menu!This place has the best burgers ever created!  They are made with local grown/raised goodness and you can tell that every burger that is made at this remarkable establishment is made with love and happiness!  You can actually taste joy with every bite.If you have never been to ace drop what you are doing and go now! And then thank me for fulfilling your wildest dreams (you know, that one you had when you finally found a burger that you never thought was possible in this life).Couple that with the fun gritty atmosphere of Gus' Pub and some of the best east coast local beers....  I just don't have the words to express the whole experience.....they only take cash.  But the extra work of going to a bank only makes the experience more rewarding!
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2014,6/25/2014,2,1,2,7,3>I just spent one hour and fifteen minutes trying on nine billion pairs of running shoes with the amazing staff at this place. I'm completely new to running, and have never owned a pair of legitimate running shoes in my life. The one thing I do know (and only because people always talk about it) is how crucial a proper-fitting pair of shoes is for running, to minimize the risk of injury. Going in with little knowledge, the staff spent immaculate time and care trying different models on me, fits, doing tests, consulting with other staff members, and bringing down the owner for his input. These people are INSANELY KNOWLEDGEABLE AND HELPFUL. I can't stress enough - go here. Don't bother trying anywhere else. I have, earlier today, and nothing has compared. The attention and patience of these experts will be hugely beneficial. They will guide you through the process, educating you and why and what, and never once make you feel like an idiot. Thanks so much guys! I can't wait to come back once I have shredded this pair. ;)
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2014,6/24/2014,3,6,,3,2>Probably one of my favourite restaurant is in town. The Bicycle Thief is that kind of restaurant which makes you feel rewarding as you dine in. Not only are the food they serve excellent, everything - the restaurant itself, atmosphere, the servers who work there - works in perfect harmony. I've been to the Bicycle Thief many times for lots of different occasions - birthday lunch dates (my first time with them), anniversaries, bachelorette dinner parties & family dinners. Trust me, if they can impress old fashioned asian parents with their taste, it's certain proof of their awesomeness. Every single experience with them was amazing. I recommend you to try jumbo shrimp, pistachio honey-crusted Atlantic Salmon (my favourite!), and their creme brulee! :)
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,6/23/2014,20,226,,8,4>So I pass this storefront on my way to work each morning. When I saw a chocolatier was opening here, I practically started salivating.  Finally stopped in on my lunch, and sooo glad I did.The space is small, neat and pristine.  Pretty, pretty chocolates beckoned me in the display case.  A very friendly and engaging staff (I assume co-owner?) gave me a sample of a hazelnut praline.  Lovely. She explained what they offer (chocolates, drinks, brownies) and I chose a plethora of chocolates for myself, my mother and a bar to share with my co-workers. Share the love!Prices are what one would expect for superior, handmade chocolates.  Which are delicious, by the way.  They melt in your mouth and you can taste the first-rate ingredients.  Nommy.You can even watch Julien make the chocolates in the next room.  Will definitely be back!
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2014,6/22/2014,28,259,2,3,2>Everyone remembers their first time. Rogue's will always have a special place in my heart.No, not for what your sick mind has immediately raced to... come on now.My first trivia night of course!Wednesday night trivia got my cherry. It's a great little bar, with some great mixed drinks (they make a hell of a long island). The atmosphere can be a bit loud, but that's probably the old man in me talking.It's a dark and classic feeling spot complete with it's own microbrewery in the back area where you can see the stills for yourself.The trivia unfortunately is seemingly infiltrated by iPhone users (could be the bitterness in me) and so it's tough to pull out a win most nights. There is plenty of topics, with a wide range of fun answers and fun to be had.A great bit of fun though, and not much beats the rush to get a question or two for your group.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2014,6/21/2014,15,91,2,3,2>Since my last review the Discover Centre they have added a few more new exhibits!As an aquarium enthusiast at heart I went to check out the new Tanked exhibit. I went close to closing time and I cannot recommend this enough. The touch tanks were closed and I was okay with that, but I learned SO MUCH just by being the only person there for the presenters to interact with.I honestly don't think that I could have had the same experience if I had gone with kids. The presenter was really excited to be able to chat with me about different things such as how a lobster eats, how they get funding to be able to have Atlantic Ocean critters, and he even showed me the gear that runs the setup.All in all, this is by far my favorite exhibit and is permanent from what the presenter told me. I definitely recommend going during quieter hours though.
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,6/20/2014,9,42,,5,3>The man and I ordered a few pizzas from Peter's last weekend. He had the Canadian Classic, which featured a lovely sweet tomato sauce. I chose the sundried tomato and garlic, as I am not a big fan of meat on pizza. It was scrumptious! After weaseling (is this a word?) a wedge of my pie, the declaration from Charles was "too much garlic" Too much garlic is not something that exists within the sphere of my existence, so I will disagree with him wholeheartedly on that point.The delivery was quick and the pizzas arrived hot. They also have a few unique combinations, especially if you are a meat lover. I will definitely order from here again!
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2014,6/19/2014,10,29,1,2,1>I really enjoyed my meal - the food was excellent. Everything I ate was wonderful. Spring rolls were perfectly cooked, the crispy chicken meal (combination plate with soup at the beginning included) I had  was yummy. I don't normally enjoy the free soup, but this I would have ordered separately. The only real issue I had was service. The servers were lovely, no problem there. But it took quite a while from when we arrived to when we were seated. After ordering drinks it seemed a bit of a wait. From arriving to leaving was 90 minutes for what would normally be an hour in most places. That being said, they looked kinda busy, and apparently they were working with one less stove than usual in the kitchen. Reasonably priced, lovely wait staff, huuuuuge menu with lots of choices, plus great eats. Would be glad to visit there again.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/4/2013,6/18/2014,1,21,,3,1>Pros: clean, great location, friendly staff, wonderful selection of drinks, excellent (secret) bar which makes the experience all the better.Cons: Drinks are pricey, but very strong (not overpowering mind you). I have only visited the middle spoon once, and was thoroughly impressed. I attended for a friends birthday. I was contacted with a "secret password" in order for me to gain access to the secret bar - I believe they promote the password on twitter and facebook, but I'm not 100% on that.Once I got to the bar and told them the password, one of the serves escorted me through what seemed a concoction of twisting hallways to an underground secret bar. When I went through the door I was pleased to find a warm, stylish atmosphere. It had nice furnishings, although slummish decor, however, very modern and clean. It made be feel like I was in the illegal underground bars back in the day. They only served mixed drinks, which were delicious. The drinks were pricey, but they used 2 or 3oz's per drink, so they were quite potent. Conclusion: Excellent and unique experience if you can get into the lower bar. This venue offers a twist on any bar I've been too, and I was extremely impressed. I would highly recommend this bar to anyone trying to impress, or wanting a classy night out!
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/21/2014,6/17/2014,12,118,,3,3>I cannot review the dine-in experience but I recently had take-out lunch from here courtesy of my work. I normally partake in Cha Baa Thai delights when it comes to Thai cuisine but decided to try something different.I ordered my usual - I am a spice wimp - so I got pad see ew with spring roll x2. The portion size was fairly large for lunch so I was happy with that. It is a pretty basic dish -noodles, brocolli, carrots, chicken (or shrimp, pork, etc), and a non-spicy soya type sauce. It was very comparable to Cha Baa Thai, and it would be hard to tell the difference visually and taste wise between the two. The spring rolls on the other hand were not as good as Cha Baa Thai and that is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Although they were good, I found the taste lacking, and they were not as crisp and fresh tasting as I am used to - I did not try the dipping sauce.Overall, a good meal and I would order take out again if the opportunity arises. I would like to try the dine-in experience at least once as that could sway my rating in either direction. But until then, Cha Baa Thai remains my #1 choice for dine-in Thai food.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2014,6/16/2014,2,9,,2,1>I was at Mustache recently for the first time in years.  I'm dating myself to say I remember when it opened.. and it hasn't changed that much.  It's a classic trendy pub type atmosphere with a nod to being a sports bar and lots of television screens throughout.  Most times you'll find a lot of students here, but you'll also see others - downtown workers, couples and friends.  There is more to try but I know from repeated personal experience that the burgers are good and so are the wings.  If you're there when it's not busy you can get a window seat (mid-afternoon it's a cozy and unusually calm spot). The summer patio is great too.
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/28/2012,6/15/2014,38,43,1,5,1>High quality meat that is affordable.That's not something that usually exists anywhere- let alone Cole Harbour.Gateway Meat Market actually cares about the way their meat is treated and presented. It is trimmed properly and is always presented in a clean, neat way. This is something I truly appreciate.Gateway is so busy that the meat has a very high turn over. They are very proud to say their meat is from local farms here in the Maritimes.Their produce is often cheap but I find can be quite sub-par. It is from across Canada- lot local.Rush in and rush out. That's how it goes. Don't stand there and dawdle over your purchase, you may get run over by another shopper. Patrons at Gateway are serious. In and out is the name of the game.There isn't a butcher counter here. You can't get anything cut or tied. But what you will get is very affordable, good quality meat.
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/4/2014,6/14/2014,25,117,2,5,3>I had any early morning so, with the extra time, I thought I'd treat myself to breakfast. One of my favourite things is a long, leisurely breakfast over the morning paper. It's something I don't get to do often, but I love it. With that in mind I decided to try somewhere new, and close to my office. I did a quick Yelp search and saw Nena's had some good reviews so I headed over. I was the only one there! It was lovely! The place is clean, modern, and had a lovely granite counter that I quickly took over with my paper, after ordering the special (two eggs, any style with 3 bacon and toast). I got a nice glass of cold milk and my breakfast was out in minutes. It was delicious. My scrambled eggs were perfect. Bacon was crisp but not over-done. It was also not greasy, yay! The toast was great and the milk super cold. It was excellent! About half way through my breakfast, an older couple came in and sat at a table behind me. The lovely lady who was serving me, I assume she may be The Nena...maybe?, knew what they wanted an brought over their coffee to start. I love a place with regulars!All told, my bill was only $8. Breakfast was excellent, service was fast and friendly and I've now found a new, delicious breakfast place!
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2014,6/13/2014,59,224,3,4,3>This place is awesome, but it takes iron willpower to not get carried away with yourself!They make money by charging you by the weight of the yogurt and toppings, which are all self-serve (allowing your inner glutton to easily triumph victoriously over your little inner voice that encourages moderation). Now with that many different kinds of yogurts to choose from, even more delicious toppings and an almost incalculable number of different possible variations and combinations per serving, don't be surprised if you leave the place with significantly less money in your wallet, and just a little bit more diabetes than when you walked in.Low fat doesn't mean low sugar...and the sugar free varieties are sweetened with sorbitol and maltitol which will make you fart gases so noxious, toxic spill alarms will trigger.  I usually deceive myself into thinking "oh I'll just have a little smidgen of this delicious flavor" or "oh just a couple more toppings won't make it THAT more expensive"....and yet....i still find myself that night curled in the fetal position clutching my belly and shaking my fists to the heavens, or towards my blank TV screen because after CherryBerry I can now no longer afford cable.So to sum it up: every decision has its pleasures and its price. In this case the pleasure is great, but you will most certainly be paying for it...be it cash wise or waist-line
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2014,6/12/2014,4,41,3,5,4>What do I love most about halifax? The fact that more and more businesses are locally owned - the cafes and restaurants. A few years ago, this strip of stores opened with a fresh look and open concept. So finally, after months of longing, I finally went it.Yes, the cafe is a typical hipster hangout but.. but.. there's oodles of goodness and just oodles of choices. You walk in and there's a gelato bar with different flavours and colour. I've been the Europe before, and this cafe serves their gelato exactly like they do over the sea. Walk slightly down, and you can make your own smoothie! It's slightly limited though, you can only choose one fruit out of a possible.. five? I think, it may be more.THEN. There's the baked goods. cookies, brownies, muffins, chocolates, cakes, oatcakes, etc. etc.THEN. You walk into the sandwiches and wraps which are made everyday with a homemade garlicky cream cheese sauce. What's also quite pleasant is that the sandwiches aren't just egg, tuna or chicken. They offer a unique and tasty variety.THEN. There's a variety of hot beverages to choose from; teas, coffees and hot chocolates.THEN. There's a nice long, breaky menu.Yup. I love this place through and through. I will come back ASAP!!!I CALL THE BOOTH.
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/28/2013,6/11/2014,2,30,1,6,1>Went here for our wedding anniversary.  Neither of us had been here before and we were told it was great.  While it sort of billed as an oyster bar there is plenty on the menu if that is not your style (it is not mine for sure).  While I don't recall what i had I know we both thought the food was great, the atmosphere was wonderful with the old exposed stonework and while not the promptest service we really were not in any hurry at all (perhaps our waitress sensed that) so it really didn't matter at all.If you're looking for a nice place to go for a special occasion I'd certainly recommend The Press Gang.
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2014,6/10/2014,2,14,,3,4>My husband made reservations at this restaurant as part of our Valentine's Day plans. It was my first time, and as Italian food is one of my favorites, I can be somewhat picky. This restaurant did not disappoint, it was excellent. Has a very nice atmosphere, and the service was perfect, very attentive, however, not to the point of annoyance. Our server was able to answer all of the questions about the menu items, which ones that she preferred, etc., and when she noticed that I did not drink my iced tea, she promptly removed it from our bill. Honestly, it seemed that all of the servers provided this level of customer service. The food was simply amazing, very flavorful, not huge portions, yet completely satisfying. We each had an appetizer: Calamari alla Gradese and Cappasante alla Pancetta, which were both beautifully plated and flavored perfectly. Our mains were ordered off of a special menu, and I can not remember the exact names, he had a veal dish, and I had a linguini in a white wine/pesto sauce with manila clams. It was the best clam linguini dish I have ever ate. We finished with a Trio di Sorbetti (selection of handmade Italian fruit ices) which were delicious.Now, it is a little pricy, but the quality is incredible. We did not order any alcoholic beverages, just pop, water, iced tea (which is the only thing that I didn't like), and our bill was approx. $105(+ tip). Any special occasions, if you enjoy Italian food, this place is a must.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2013,6/9/2014,5,25,,3,1>I love the chocolate, they give discounts to people who live or work in the neighbourhood, and the staff has always been very friendly. The snacks at the cafe are good/flavourful. The prices are much cheaper than many of the coffee shops in the neighbourhood. If you're planning to hang out here, though, be aware that the cafe itself has a very very quiet vibe. As in, you'll feel bad if you've got a loud or overly chatty companion. But if you're looking for a cafe to work from or read in, this is definitely your top choice.
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2014,6/8/2014,11,44,1,6,3>Price- Great!Atmosphere- okFood- Good!Bathroom- one of the best!Location- not horribleService- PassableSo, This one was an adventure! my parents randomly decided we were going out for dinner, and after an extensive Yelp search, we decided on this place!So thank you Yelpers!AtmosphereWe know my opinion on places that are a completely contemporary setting with little to none of the culture present.. This being a Chinese restaurant, when we walked in there was a tank with two huge (VERY CREEPY) fish in it.The walls are a beige color, there's a few (and I do mean few) pieces of art that have an Asian look but otherwise its a completely western restaurant..It kinda took away from the experience... but it wasn't a deal breaker!BathroomNow, I'm not sure why I have taken to reviewing bathrooms at every restaurant I'm in but I have!This bathroom was amazing! I wanted to take like 20 million selfies, it was clean, very modern feeling with normal height toilets (yes this is important to me), and the part that sold me on it the most the lighting was perfect to show off my highlights! (the ones that show up only in the right light) So this bathroom by its self would be a 4 star bathroom... oh and happy to report there is NO mickey mouse soap dispenser! (just a perfectly professional looking on!)Food!Now, we did real the menu for a long time! I did see a few Cantonese items but majority of the menu (for regular dinner hour) was all your standard Canadian Chinese fare.Chicken balls, beef and broccoli, and 25 different variations of fried rice, ya know the standards. so the menu kinda lets me down but goes along with the feel of the place.HOWEVER! there is a positive! The quality of the food is pretty good!!!Won-ton Soup, if you order a large they do mean LARGE! its a big enough bowl for 4-5 people to have at least one serving. there were 3 of us and we all had 2 bowls (and there was still a little more left) it was GOOD! the broth was very well seasoned, the meat perfectly flavored... basically I could write a book about how much I love good food! This would have a whole chapter! (in case we didn't realize something, when I say I would put it in a book it means it was GOOD!)Now, moving on to the "main course"We had the standard issue dinner for three, which consisted of Chicken Balls, Sweet and Sour Ribs, Chicken Fried Rice, and Chicken Chow Mein (pictures all added previous to my review)..Ribs the standard gooey mess coated in way to much sauce, our sauce had some strands of ginger in it which we enjoyed slightly more then the ribs..Chicken balls, well they are a standard Canadian Chinese food for a reason! (we even got the standard issue red dye goo!)Chicken Fried rice, well done, tasted better then standard issue food but yet was still under whelming.Chicken Chow Mein, when it was hot it was good!to sum up!Food is good! if you want standard non greasy Canadian Chinese food! however ORDER THAT WON-TON SOUP! you wont soon regret it!LocationFor the type of restaurant it is, its in the perfect location for its clientele.PriceThe price tag is fair for what you get, unless you go for individual dishes, then it gets costly.Combos were pretty well priced and were the standard issued combos of the Canadian Chinese market.So if you want the standard selections, by all means Combos are the way!Want certain things, be prepared to pay 10-15 bucks a dish.ServiceThe service is a little confusing...There were two girls serving, one who spoke very strong English and one who had a bit of a struggle.There was no sign to indicate it was seat yourself, so we stood there looking like clear new comers.There were a lot of orders flying out the door, which has a sign of both good and bad things, a lot of take out means there are a lot of people who don't like the service, but like the food enough to order it.. so hm..but anyway! back to the service.It was moderate pace, slightly awkward, but could have been better organized.. one came over and asked how everything was the other came within 2 minutes and asked again...to sum up, it appears they need a bit more organization but otherwise it is passable for the level of business they do.
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,6/7/2014,13,104,2,4,2>Not even sure why Yelp gives me the option of choosing anything but 5 stars for Darrell's. What can I say about Darrell's that hasn't been said a thousand other times? They have one of the best burgers in the city (PB burger), they have one of the best wraps in the city (Pump it up wrap), Darrell fries are amazing and my God the milkshakes.....the madness....!! They're sooooo good!We went during burger week (sort of a mistake) - I only say that because it was so packed - people every where and they even had a line up. Good thing there was only 2 of us, they seated us right away - score for not going out with a bunch of friends! Haha.If I remember the prices right, I think the PB burger and Darrell fries come to $12 on a regular day - but because it was burger week, it was $8. That's pretty good savings if you ask me! And it's not like they cheap up the meal because they're losing out on a few dollars, nope! You get the same great quality food!Ugh, I can't keep thinking about Darrell's, makes me wanna skip work and head down there right now!! So good!!
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2014,6/6/2014,2,27,,2,1>Awesome food! Had the mussles and a vegan donair. Both really delicious! The service was great as well. Our server (I think her name was Katelyn?) was great. She was very attentive, kept our waters full, and made great suggestions. Will go back for sure. The bathrooms could be kept a tad cleaner.
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2014,6/5/2014,0,6,,3,1>I had a lovely date night at Chives over the weekend and once again was very impressed with the impeccable service and near flawless menu.  We started with a Chilean cab sauv that our server recommended, and the foie gras pate.  The pate was in a cute little jar and came with crisps, apple compote, and balsamic onions.  I will definitely be ordering this dish again. I love how pate is making a comeback. One of my favorite pastimes as a child was eating Sunday snacks at my grandmothers kitchen table, which often included a dollop of pate.  For our mains we had the duck duo and the striploin steak.  My steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and had the most delicious red wine sauce. The onion rings, and spinach and mushroom saute which accompanied  were divine.  The only thing that was lacking was the mashed potatoes, which tasted as if they'd been sitting on the plate for some time. I tasted the duck entree and it was very moist and delicious. My date said it was the best duck he has ever had.  The service was very prompt and our glasses were continually topped off with wine.  It was such a great meal, I look forward to tasting the new seasonal options.
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2013,6/4/2014,70,95,3,9,7>One tire + one random nail = flat unfixable tire.Well crap! What's a driver to do with a tire with a slow leak and the knowledge that it can't be fixed and the need to purchase a new tire is in your near future?Hit up Yelp of course. Coast Tires comes up and after reading a few of the reviews I give them a call. It didn't hurt that this place was barely a stone's throw away from where I live but location is not the only reason I am giving this place 4 stars.I call to inquire about tires and the person on the other end gives me some of the best customer service I received in a long time. He tells me that if I want to get tires that day it would cost $XXX.xx amount but since it was a slow leak I could probably wait until tomorrow and he'd order another brand of tire just as good but come in almost $70 cheaper. He then proceeds to ask if I have a spare and if I wanted to swing by they would just swap out the slow leaking tire for the spare until I came back the next day. I go in that same day, wait about 10 minutes (they literally stopped what they were doing and put my Dusty up on the lift) and before I know it my spare is on and there wasn't a charge for the service. I go in the next day and in about 45 minutes I drive away with two new tires, some excellent customer service and a new place for all my automotive needs.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/25/2013,6/3/2014,12,27,,2,1>Came here with my girlfriend before a concert on a Friday evening - the waitress was friendly and the atmosphere was very relaxed. I had the red curry chicken pasta and she had the garlic chicken pasta - both were very good. Also had the bruschetta to start, which was also good. Prices were reasonable, all together it made for a very nice dinner.Highly recommend going here if you're looking for pasta, Italian food, or just a nice relaxed place to eat.
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/26/2014,6/2/2014,0,17,2,3,2>Went here to try the dumplings with a group of friends, and ended up ordering the dumplings and a very large bowl of ramen! Both were very good, be warned, the dumplings like to juice you :P So poke a hole in them with your chopstick before hand to prevent a nice embarrassing mess! The ramen was good as well, probably could have had that on its own instead of with dumplings, as it was very filling. However both meals were very salty, especially the ramen. I have never had authentic ramen before, i am assuming this is as close as i will get. But the saltiness made it difficult to want to finish the meal, and be able to enjoy it. I recommend the place, but be warned about the excess salt, especially if you have restrictions with salt.
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2013,6/1/2014,13,25,1,5,2>I love Mezza. So does my kid. She is always asking for it. Pick up some chewing gum. You are going to need it. I think without a doubt Mezza has the best chicken shwarma in the city. Garlicky, lemony goodness, marinated and slow roasted. We get the shwarma or the mixed grill plate usually. The mixed grill plate is always big enough for the two of us. It comes with kafta, chicken souvlaki, chicken shwarma, taboule, hummus, pita, rice garlic sauce and tahini sauce. I think the hummus is garlicky, smooth and delish. The rice, well it's just rice. The sauces, super garlicky too. I told you to grab some gum. The staff here is friendly. The food is reasonably priced. The portions and large in my opinion. The atmosphere is casual. This place is not to be mistaken for the dining restaurant on Quinpool, though it's owned by the same family. You can dine in, but expect more pizza joint kind of seating. Even better you can take out after a long day when you don't want to cook. They have the best take out containers ever. Easy to pop leftovers in your bag for lunch. Sadly, there are no leftovers where my daughter is considered.Mezza is probably our favourite take out in the city. Though we tried the Dartmouth location and we much prefer this one. If you need a quick lunch or dinner that is fresh, not overly processed where there are plenty of healthy options, be sure to check it out..
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/1/2014,5/31/2014,3,8,,5,2>Thank goodness for Yelp or I wouldn't have ever found this place.Even then it took a bit to figure out where it was. In the basement of the Mills Mall on Spring Garden Road. Quick, affordable sushi in an unlikely location. I had a combo with a cucumber/avocado roll, a sweet potato tempura roll and a piece of nigiri. The sushi was rather large (had to eat some with my hands straight up) and the rice was slightly overdone but all in all for $9 it was pretty great. My main quibble however has to do with how much waste is involved in their operation. The plates the sushi come on are Styrofoam. The salad comes in a plastic container and the dressing is also in a little plastic container inside the salad container. Just too much waste. I would like to go back to get some sushi sometime but the waste involved is excessive. They have what looks like a good amount of space as well so reusable plates and bowls should be an option for dine in methinks.Might have to come back with my own container sometime.
<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2014,5/30/2014,40,216,,4,5>Much to my shame, in all my years in Halifax I've never eaten at the vaunted legend of Haligonian pies, Salvatore's. Lately I'd be been holding out because I had gone so long without that I wanted to eat the pizza there in the restaurant, lest the delivery take its toll on the pizza, which always happens no matter how quick it is. Unfortunately, I'm just never up in the Hydrostones. With my girlfriend now working up there in the thick of the shops, I made my first of what likely will be many visits.We stopped in on a sunny Saturday afternoon, and luckily beat a somewhat delayed weekend lunch crowd and snagged one of the last remaining tables in the small dining area. It's a quaint spot, with a black and yellow palate, with the area around the counter and cooler designed to look like a little stone house like the many currently dotting hillsides around Italy. They haven't quite started their expansion into the neighbouring tenant which was recently vacated, but I'm sure both customers and the cramped kitchen staff will benefit.Beer seems to be a recent addition to the menu, and Salvatore's keeps it real by sticking to north end fare: on the craft side of things, Propeller PIlsner, and on the commercial side, Oland Export. Four wines are available by the glass, and a corking fee is applied if you want to take your own vino in. The food menu consists of about 15 specialty pizzas, a mix of tomato sauce and blanco pies, as well as a 'build your own' option. They all sounded so good that it was difficult to choose, but my girlfriend and I settled on a small pizza each, to maximize our tasting opportunities. I went with the pizza tutto carne, their meat pizza, while she went with one of their daily specials, the pesto pizza.While we waited, we sipped our drinks while the afternoon heat and pizza ovens heated up the restaurant and well to-do Hydrostone families came in.When our pizzas arrived, I was glad I saved some of my beer, as this isn't your typical meat pizza. The quality of the pepperoni and salami is immediately noticeable, not to mention their spiciness. They're cured the natural way, not whatever freaky process the mushy deli meats from grocery stores go through. The house-made bits of meatballs complete this ode to carnivores. The crust is thin and crispy, with an airiness to the cornicione. Alas, it still suffers the droopy tip curse of all thin crust pizzas.The pesto pizza has the pesto mixed in with the respectable amount of mozzarella  on the pie, and gets an additional boost of flavour from roasted garlic, and crushed tomatoes round out the pizza with a hint of acid. At this point, I'm not sure if I'd prefer that I'd had started eating at Salvatore's years ago, or glad that I waited for such a great experience, but either way I'm looking forward to the next pizza...and the next....and the next...
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/20/2014,5/29/2014,1,10,,4,3>Love this place! Lots of fun clothing and accessories to pick from. There are plenty of sizes to pick from. I'm not a small person, so it's great to know that she can custom make me clothes and it's not going to cost me huge amounts of money. The clothing is affordably priced and I always get lots of compliments when I wear her clothes. So happy to find Vivacious Vixen Apparel!
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2013,5/28/2014,3,99,1,5,1>Great selection, plus they have British chocolate bars. Win in my book! The prices are of course a bit more expensive, since it's all organic and local, but I can deal with that.I also had their stirfry on Tuesday (their stir fry day, if I remember correctly), and it was really good.Only complaint is that I bought grapes here once and got home to realize they were mouldy. No fun. But I was able to return them no problem.
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2013,5/27/2014,19,131,1,4,3>I have now been to Cheachies twice.. Within a week...My co-workers and I ventured over for our lunch break. On a pretty consistent basis our guests ( we are hotel managers) have asked us about this place. Neither of us had ever been there so it was time to see what all the fuss was about.When I walked in, the restaurant did not look as I expected it to..The decor is much more tasteful than tacky which is NOT the case in many of our "Mexican" restaurants.During both visits, my co-workers and I all had the same thing each time; two Taco Salad's with beef and beef tacos. That's how impressed we all were with our first visit.. I think that says a lot in itself. I myself had the Taco Salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. Lots of veggies, cheese, beef, salsa and sour cream all in a crisp tortilla bowl. (Don't forget to ask for some guac on the side) YUM!!Service is extremely friendly and efficient. Our server who we had each time had no problem conversing with us. She is awesome and so are the others. Thanking us each time for visiting. It was sincere and we appreciated it. My only qualm is the menu consists of mostly burgers and a select few Mexican dishes-which disappoints a little.. Perhaps I am missing something as our visits have been in the afternoon.. Is there a larger selection at supper time?There is not a whole lot of decent places to eat in the BLIP, besides of course the chains...So, I can now recommend  Cheachies to my guests with a good conscience and explain to them first-hand how awesome it is!
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,5/26/2014,18,151,,4,3>Palladium Family Restaurant is, undoubtedly, the best place to obtain authentic Greek food in Dartmouth...and possibly in the entire HRM. Our group of 5 made our first trip to this rather spacious restaurant last week. Here's how it went:Pros:- Expansive menu - this includes plenty of Greek fare as well as traditional North American dishes.- Excellent moussaka, souvlaki, horiatiki, spanikopita, rice pudding, coconut cream pie...the list goes on. My mother, who is something of a Greek connoisseur, said that her spanikopita was the best she's ever had. My dad said the same of his moussaka.- It's apparent that the dishes (including desserts) are homemade by someone who truly knows Greek cuisine - this was confirmed by our waitress. - Prompt and friendly service from each staff member we encountered.- Spacious restaurant - it's much larger than its modest exterior.- Reasonable prices - I got the moussaka combo plate, which included a starter soup or salad and roll, a generous slice of moussaka, horiatiki (you have to specify this; otherwise it's made with lettuce), roast potatoes or rice, and rice pudding or jello for dessert...all for about $20.Cons:- None that I can think of.I'm kicking myself for not visiting the Palladium earlier - after all, I've lived in Dartmouth for 5 years! If you're in the same boat (or even if you're not), I highly recommend giving this wonderful restaurant a shot.
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/4/2014,5/25/2014,18,17,3,7,5>Burrito Jax is one of the few restaurants I never say no to going to when suggested. Their burritos may not be truly authentic Mexican, but are truly delicious. This location matches the quality of the food and service as their downtown location, and you won't be disappointed. Choose your meat, then pick your ingredients 'subway-style.' Lots of options means loads of possible variations. I have found my ideal combinations in the Jax chicken with all the veggies, cranberry salsa and chipotle sauce. I am still trying to get it known as "The Ian."All their burritos are cooked panini style for three minutes, which (for the most part) keep all the deliciousness from leaking out onto your chin and hand. But when it does , I don't even care, such is my enjoyment when eating one of their burritos.They also have burrito bowls and quesadillas.though I have not them, I am told their burrito bowls are delicious too.So you can't go wrong. So get your burrito on!

Probably because I just moved over the bridge...After searching on Yelp to figure out where we wanted to eat, Evan's won! I love fish burgers, and every review pretty much agrees that it's a must order here. Add me to the list! Delicious fresh fish, sandwiched between an incredible soft bun, covered in (what I'm guessing is) home-made tartar sauce - at only $5.00, this is a must order! You can also order a spicy fish burger...We also got the lobster poutine, and some fried scallops (we were very hungry) The lobster poutine was super good, but, there wasn't very many pieces of lobster in it, for nearly $10 with tax, and it was fairly small.Their tartar sauce was the best I've ever had - I can't even explain it, you have to try it for yourself. The food was great, the service was great - however, we found the price (overall) to be quite high for just the two of us, considering, there was no seating (very limited and already filled) and we were still a bit hungry after finishing. However, I will definitely get another fish burger from here in the near future!
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/4/2012,5/23/2014,28,82,2,11,4>Fabulous store that focuses mainly on the needs of the model-making and miniature railway crowd. The male staff are knowledgeable if a bit taciturn in the typical way of model specialists. The store has a good selection of scale model-making supplies including dimensional basswood and balsa. If you need to build an architectural model or a theatre set model, this may be the place to buy your supplies. They have a small selection of specifically-milled 1:12 scale mouldings (baseboards, picture frames). Great railway section for HO/00 and N scale modelling. The rolling stock and locos are exclusively North American. They have a back room with used pieces for sale.The upper floor is mostly scale models -- vehicles, largely, and all the glues and paints one needs to put them together and finish them.They've recently added more crafty stuff -- some jewelry-making supplies, needlecraft, candle-making, etc. This takes up a very small part of the store, but whenever I browse it I'm really impressed by whoever has done the buying here -- it's tiny but extraordinarily comprehensive.

The package includes a couples massage & pedicures. This was my first time at Spirit & my first massage & it was a great experience for both of us!I was a little nervous for the massage but my therapist immediately made me feel comfortable & relaxed! We talked about some of my tension & back problem & I received an excellent, specialized massage.I've been to a few places in Halifax to get a pedicure & this was by far my favorite! They used a Dremel to get rid of any rough, dry skin on my feet which was very effective! I have very ticklish feet & I hate the feeling of having my feet filed so this was a great alternative! Spirit also has a large selection of nail polish to choose from, I had a hard time picking a color! My boyfriend has extremely dry, cracked heels due to eczema on his feet & the job that they did on his feet is absolutely amazing, his feet look & feel completely different! We were totally impressed with how knowledgeable & effective his aesthetician was, after all the hard work she put into transforming his feet she even recommended a great cream to help keep his feet in tip top shape! Overall we had a lovely day & left feeling totally relaxed & renewed! I can't wait to go back & try out some other treatments!

I have find memories of going to the "old" Brass Rail with my parents enjoying comfortable family dining.I wasn't disappointed with the re-birth of a great restaurant. The service was amazing, food cooked from scratch in the kitchen, and I love the local focus (they use local black angus beef). A local beer selection would be welcomed as an addition once they get their feet back in the soil.Decor... they need a brass rail. I'll give them the star for decor since they are only a couple weeks since they opened their doors. They obviously focused on what counts, great food, great service, comfortable atmosphere.

She was able to interpret exactly what I wanted for my hair cut, and then do it better than I could have imagined it. The hair cuts start with a head and shoulders massage, which typically wouldn't be my thing but it was pretty magical. I have super long hair, and for a wash + cut it came to about $53, which I found to be a decent price for such a great job.I also thought it was pretty rad that they have a selection of zines on the table as you come in rather than a stack of cliche hair magazines, and I liked the overall vibe of the space.
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2014,5/19/2014,4,11,3,5,5>Trident is a bookstore for people who know what a bookstore was before Internet culture took over. Trident feels more like a library with a hush hush quiet that I relish, and the actual smell of books - old books - and what a delicious smell it is. If you're looking to find buried treasure this is the place. If you're looking for a long debate about zombies or how many half-caf-cappa-chino-frappa-mochas you had yesterday - go someplace else. And stay there. This is for serious booklovers, not the coffee culture WIFI generation.
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/4/2014,5/18/2014,7,53,,6,3>I'm trying to think why I would give them less than 5star and I have to say - NOPE; nothing. Yes the place is small and the pick up for Take-out is not defined (haha) but it is great food and fabulous prices.  I had not been for some years and went about a month ago.  Since then I've been 3times and I love it still and maybe more.  I have gotten into an "always order" with the Rice Noodles & Egg Noodles with BBQ Pork & Shrimp as my go-to meal.  I just cannot get enough.  I have tried to look it up to replicate but so far not able. Service is good especially considering the lunch crowd and the small space but I've never had need to complain.Try them and you will keep coming back.

Especially the furniture and the curtained rooms. They have quite the selection of refreshments and snacks. I actually don't even think I got to pursue them all. As soon as I saw they were serving laughing whale, I was sold! The bakery case had great options for all dietary needs. I opted for the peanut butter choco cookie and it was phenomenal. Super sweet, reminding me of my grandmothers recipe. When I asked if I could have a flavoured latte the server explained that they don't believe in artificial so they can do real flavours like a real shot if maple syrup or a real dose of vanilla. Sooo impressed. This is my kind of place!!! My friend got the blueberry basil lemonade and said it was amazing! I saw they had bread plates and cheeses also on the menu. I'm going to have to make a trip back for these and some wine! The Nook, I love you.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2014,5/16/2014,27,107,,4,2>I've visited The Stubborn Goat on two occasions. Very similar experiences both times.  A couple of things I need to mention is that their menu in on their facebook page, you won't find it on the website (as of Jan 2014). Apparently they are redoing the webpages.We seated ourselves. (First time was a group of 12, second time a group of 2) and were welcomed by staff.  They have an extensive craft beer menu, with some regular offerings for those who prefer. Wine list was substantial as well.Now - before we go any further, how they bring out food is different.  It comes out as it is done.  What? For example, on Sunday the other person in my party had their appetizer and main before I had my appetizer. Did it bother me? Not really, but be prepared for that. I've only ordered beverages from their beer menu.  Some are atrociously marked up (650ml bottle of Boxing Rock U-889 @ $18, when you can buy at the market for $9.50), but most on tap are market priced. Lots of selection.The food is quite good with many interesting options.  I've had the brussels sprouts with bacon as a starter and the Chicken pizza with peanut sauce, fresh coconut, sriracha, and peanuts.  It was excellent!  Take your time and peruse the menu and share plates. I think it's worth it.Reasonable to upper scale prices.  Nice decor (previously Se7en?). Engaging staff.  All in all a pretty good spot.

Service was quick and friendly, and prices reasonable.  All in all, a good first experience!

It's very classy looking inside. The people who serve you are always nice and chatty and when waiting for your order, you get a basket with slices of their homemade Fachia Bread thats made fresh daily [has olive oil, rosemary and coarse sea salt and can be served with butter or special dipping oil.]I personally LOVE the spaghettini with slow simmered Bolognese sauce with grated cheese without pepper and I ALWAYS get piece of their high classed desserts. This place is going into my book of restaurants I look forward to coming back

The selection of bagels is phenomenal.  There are several cheesy options (who doesn't love cheese?) along with some healthier and sweeter options.  I grabbed a variety ranging from cheddar and herb and cheddar and swiss right down to cinnamon raisin and french toast (YES french toast bagels)They also offer a variety of house made cream cheeses.  There was nothing there that really tickled my fancy that day but I am  VERY picky eater and i already had some Philly at home.  All in all, the food is great, the staff was very friendly and pleasant, and the price was right.  Go here.  You will not regret it.
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2013,5/12/2014,15,59,2,5,4>I'm guilty. I visited the Seaport Farmer's Market for the first time this summer. Too long a wait I know. I'm also guilty of loving it! What an incredible amount of variety! I love coming here with friends because everyone can find something they like. Two floors of selection with some of the best local eats in the city. Last time we visited I had beer and cheese buns at The Seaport Beard Shop. The smells coming from the bakery are divine. Actually the smells coming from all the vendors are incredibly enticing. My friends had amazingly tasty wraps from Wrap So D, and picked up preserves from Pat's. I also visited the Cake Lady for some amazing carrot cake. I've heard there is pineapple in it, but the ingredients are a closely guarded secret. My imagination wants me to believe her cakes and treats are filled with magical fairy dust and happiness.The building is absolutely incredible. We took the stairs up to the third floor and enjoyed the view while we snacked. I love the local flora rooftop garden. The green onions have a wonderful scent when mixed with the salt air. It's a great destination to end up at after a long waterfront walk.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/30/2013,5/11/2014,1,11,,7,4>I will be a continuous Fujiyama fan, and let me tell you why. Their sushi is incredible. It is fresh and full of flavour every time I go. It is my sushi place of choice in Halifax, but here's something to consider about this place: their kitchen is slow. I don't know why, but as many other yelpers have noticed, they really seem to take their time. Because of this I don't choose to dine there if I'm in a time crunch, but if I have an open evening to relax with friends and I'm craving top notch sushi, I'm there. Even their sashimi is fresh and tasty, and that is something that is hard to do well! I usually get a dinner combo with one of their chefs specials and I totally recommend it... as long as you're not in a time crunch on a one hour lunch break. ;)
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2013,5/10/2014,20,178,,7,5>I'm gonna give a five star rating here because the lobster roll ($12) was full of big chunks of lobster. Chunks large enough that you could identify what part of the shellfish they came from. The lobster was mixed to order with just a little mayo and stuffed in a home-style roll that was freshly toasted with butter. The buns must have been made locally and they were awesome. The lobster roll came with kettle style chips, a local dill pickle and a wedge of lemon. Friends had the seafood chowder with roll ($8) and enjoyed their meal as well.You can find them on Facebook.
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/29/2013,5/9/2014,0,6,,4,4>Excellent food - fresh ingredients. Attractive location, in terms of "fast food". Service has been excellent and prices are unbeatable.Have traveled home with it, and it survives the trip just fine! You have the option to have a burrito untoasted - so when you get home you can put it in the oven quickly. This is not 'authentic' Mexican - but they are the first to tell you that. However, if you want to choose from an array of fresh, exciting toppings and create a taco just to your individual taste, this is the place!
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/26/2013,5/8/2014,21,55,,7,4>Hey, I like this place. Upon arrival it was packed so I set up shop at the bar. The bartender was prompt, poured a steller Stella and most importantly asked which Hockey game I wanted the tv tuned to. Saint in my books.About 20 minutes later we had a table. We got fast service, and the server listened to our questions even though it was bumpin' busy. We just had some apps, a few wobbly pops and some convo. The vibe is really an after work, loose tie, end-your-week- with a cold one type. Can't beat it.
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,5/7/2014,6,23,4,5,3>So, this was my second trip to Wasabi House in Sackville. I always save my appetitie because, honestly, the all you can eat sushi is just so good I want to eat everything on the menu...so most of the time, I come pretty close ;) Anyway, my husband is not a huge fan of sushi, as most people, he's afraid of raw fish... I explained to my sweetie that if he's not okay with raw fish, then by all means, try the sweet potato sushi (OMG YUMMY) or the mango/cream cheese sushi (also OMG YUMMY) or perhaps stick with other dishes. He ended up having a few servings of the deep fried sushi - okay, it's frickin' awesome, melt in your mouth good and some of their seafood fried rice. I, on the other hand, had probably too much, but whatever, it's sushi. Spicy salmon, butterfish, spicy tuna, spicy whatever I could get my hands on. Also, they'll give you an extra side of spicy mayo which just makes everything taste so much better. I love this place, I would like to give it more than 5 stars. You have to go there - it's a must for Sackville! Also, pay with cash and you get 10% off!!!!
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/30/2014,5/6/2014,10,70,,4,3>I had seen this place on Google maps a week ago and when I walked to the street to find it, it wasn't exactly where i had thought it was, so I didn't see it that day, and ended up eating elsewhere.  Today for lunch I was looking at the map again and discovered my mistake, so tried it after all.  (cool sunny Wednesday). Ten tables inside, with a casual but nice atmosphere.  Dark orange walls with reasonable Japanese decor and artwork (not all cheap stuff like you see in lots of restaurants).  The place was about half full when I sat at a two-seater and was greeted immediately.  In the half hour that I stayed, all the tables filled up with business people, but no one seemed to be waiting around for a table, so that was perfect for the restaurant i guess.I ordered the 9 piece vegetable tempura (eggplant, peppers, yam) which was good and the yam tempura roll which was good and reasonably-sized (where the pieces aren't too big or too small).  My bill came to $14 something.  Service was friendly and speed or order was great.  Although I wouldn't say there's anything unique about this place, I'd definitely go back and it just felt a little better than average to me.
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2013,5/5/2014,24,132,4,5,3>I've been back!It was even better this time.We got the pulled pork sliders! Oh ma gad!  fantastic!Then being on a burger kick lately, i scanned their burger menu!What's this?  Peanut butter?  banana chips?  on a burger?I AM IN! And it was on!Only down fall was the way too much cream cheese they add!so I peeled it off, and was in the Burger zone of awesome!I can't wait to go back, for A) that burger again.B) wing nightC) wing night for 1/2 price apps (aka pulled pork sliders)P.S. they also serve Barking Squirrel beer so good!
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,5/4/2014,13,213,,10,5>If you took the mango cake and dropped it out of an airplane I am sure it would float becoming one with the clouds. It was light, delicate and in other words tastes amazing. I can't wait to revisit the shop for more. I want to try at least a few more. The shop has a nice selection of cakes by the slice along with some Asian inspired stuff. It all looks great and I am also a fan of green tea which I have heard these guys add into a cake as well.
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2013,5/3/2014,6,54,7,7,6>Psst. Hey. Come closer. Are you a cop? No? Well, you look like a cop. Loosen that tie. Okay, you're all right.I wanna tell you about this place, this Speak. You know the dessert place on Barrington? It's under that. Underground. You need a password to enter, and if you don't know it, I'm not telling ya!If you're lookin' for unique, knock-you-back cocktails with complex flavours, then you'd best try Noble. At $12-$16 each drink, it ain't cheap. But if you're looking for an experience and you know what a real cocktail is (hold the pop, actually TASTE the booze) they're completely worth it.You never know if you're going to be able to get in, as there's no way to scope it out, and people leaving get escorted out the back way. Next time you're looking for a special occasion drink, try this Noble experiment.But don't tell nobody I sent ya.
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/18/2014,5/1/2014,20,71,,4,4>Fried chicken is GOOD. You don't taste the sriracha but its well worth getting. Hot, tender, juicy, delicious.I think that they have all the right ingredients to be a long-term success: the space is on the smaller side and the layout encourages people to stand, or share tables. It gets full fast so get there early. I don't drink beer but I like the idea that they keep switching up the kegs when one runs dry (luckily they have Bulwark on tap so I'm usually covered). We were there last night and a friend of mine pointed out that this would be a good first date spot - you have to order at the bar so it gets rid of the awkwardness of receiving a bill and wondering who will get it. If the person you're with goes up to get a drink and asks what you want, you immediately know they'll be paying for it. Also, the menus is small but delicious and perfect for sharing, so if you wanted to have a quick bite while you're having a drink, you can do so, without the commitment of needing to stay for a long time (if the date is going badly...)I've been meaning to try out their brunch egg sandwich but haven't had a chance yet. This is more my after-work spot :)
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,4/30/2014,7,14,3,8,5>I have been into Tess's so often lately, I'm afraid they're going to start turning me away for my own well-being. It seems like every Sunday, when my friends are looking for a brunch spot, we always end up here. And I am not complaining.The reason I know Tess's is great, is because I've been in there in just about every state of mind imaginable: Hungry enough to eat two breakfasts (that happened, and I regret nothing); Hungover and not able to eat anything except sourdough toast (that toast is the stuff hangover dreams are made of); Tired and grumpy (and the delightful staff and delicious coffee put a little spring in my step) and just about everything in between.The crepes benedict are amazing (I usually get it on a homemade biscuit with Brother's double-smoked bacon and brie *drools*) and the daily quiche is always a safe bet too. My boyfriend gets the "croissandwich" almost every time we're there, but they have a rotating list of specials that are always tempting.The restaurant itself is fairly small, so go early if you're trying to get a table for more than two on a Sunday morning. It fills up quickly!
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2014,4/29/2014,1,2,,5,4>When you're in need of a solid greasy spoon brunch spot that makes a tasty breakfast, Mary's does the trick.  Just don't expect anything too fancy.  Friendly and quick service are a highlight and there are some surprise dishes in the rather overwhelming amount of choices on the menu.  I haven't explored the Syrian side of the menu yet, but have enjoyed the fish sub, the breakfast special, and steak and eggs and have been pleased with the generous portion sizes as well.Remember, any breakfast is only as good as the company you're with, so as long as your meet good friends for brunch, Mary's will more than satisfy you.
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/20/2014,4/28/2014,2,14,1,5,4>This place has been on my "to try" list forever. I finally made it - and wasn't disappointed!I like that it isn't downtown. Parking is easier, which is nice for a change.The atmosphere is relaxed, which I really enjoy. No need to worry about what to wear or which fork to use here. And there are some cool decor items around - a green lantern sign over the bar, a Boba Fett helmet on a coatrack.They serve "pitchers" of water to the table in old milk bottles, and when I walked in to join my friends I first thought they had each been served a giant bottle of water to drink out of straight. Not so much.I had the wasabi Caesar from the bar. It's good, and the pickled snow peas are cute (but shhhhhh! I think I like the kimchi caesar at 2 Doors Down better.)The menu is written in several places on chalkboards. It changes daily so a printed menu is impractical. I've checked in on the daily menu online numerous times, and there are regulars on the menu that rotate in and out in different combos throughout the week. From the items on the menu there was one from each course starred on the boards which made up a well-priced prix fixe option if you wanted to go that way. One of my friends did and enjoyed the selections. The menu is meat heavy, and I only eat poultry and scallops in that territory, but there is always a vegetarian option for both appetizer and main. I have seen both a scallop app and a guinea fowl main on the menu at times, but neither were there the night I went so I did veg for both.Food was friggin' awesome! I had a grilled radicchio salad with grana padano, caper berries, and nuts and it was excellent. Not just your average salad - unique flavours with character, and the bitterness of the radicchio was offset wonderfully by the berries. Then for a main I had a beet, mushroom and goat cheese risotto with pistachios and let me tell you, it was fabulously rich and filling. Just thinking about it makes me wish I could go eat it for breakfast again right now. My non veg friend chose it not because she doesn't eat all the meat (she does) but because it sounded so damn good, and she felt like I did about it - fantastic!! I had a chocolate marquise and chocolate pavlova combo drizzled with salted caramel for dessert, and that too was tasty and well balanced. This well-enjoyed, satisfying meal of drink, appetizer, main and dessert came to under $50 with tax. The tip put it over $50, but for a full meal of food this great I consider it seriously well-priced!Of all the factors we use to evaluate a restaurant, in the end the food is queen, and the food here was just wicked. I'll be back.
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,4/27/2014,3,18,1,4,2>I have eaten here a handful of times and every single time it has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience.The pies are healthier (not greasy at all) than any other pizzeria in this city and they offer a fair amount choices (without being overwhelming) of great quality fresh toppings.The salads are really good and wine selection for just a glass is good. The space itself is very open and has a spacious and clean layout. There is lots of communal and non communal seating. I love the huge wrap around windows.The service is great. It's friendly and if you have kids (I have a 4 year old) they are so nice to them. They have markers and paper and candy for after dinner (a fun treat - I love the Charleston Chews myself). My daughter had to let out some steam and ran once through the resto (not something I condone but cannot always control) and there were no mean looks from the cooks (it's open concept so you can see them working away) or the staff and that made me feel really comfortable about bringing my daughter there.  They even brought her pizza first- little details like that really make or break a place for me. Our server was late with my friend's coke but besides that the service was perfect.I highly recommend this Italian style pizzeria!
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/10/2014,4/26/2014,8,63,,5,2>This was the third time I visited 9 + Nine and I have been impressed by the quality of the food each time.  Despite the cramped surroundings, you can learn to live with this inconvenience when you've tasted the authentic Chinese cuisine on hand.My friend and I tried the Dinner for 1 special at the low price of $10.95; this gets you 1 egg roll, sweet and sour chicken, rice, and fried vegetables.  The restaurant took the unusual step of serving the egg roll first; however, I could understand what they were trying to do as the food that came after was easily worth more than the $10.95 we paid.What I especially enjoyed about the food was the lack of salt as some Chinese restaurants pile on the MSG to hide their shortcomings; even so, with 9 + Nine you get the best of both worlds as you have tasty food without the salt.  The food on hand was not too much, but not too little as well.I was also impressed with the overall selection of food as you have over 100 different items to choose from; the service was terrific and we did not have to wait too long for the food despite the restaurant being filled to capacity.The only downside is the lack of space and the fact that there is only 1 small bathroom for everybody in the room.  I would definitely recommend avoiding the small table to the right of the main door as the cold air can hit you in the face like a Mike Tyson jab.After visiting 9 + Nine, you may just agree with me that this restaurant is one of Halifax's hidden gems.
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,4/25/2014,25,107,,5,3>When i saw that this hidden gem had yet to be reviewed, I decided to come out of my Yelp hiatus to be the first. Simply put, this place is amazing. Super fresh and very reasonably priced lunch and dinner options. I had the second best falafel pita of my entire life here for lunch. (#1 goes to the little place in Ljubljana  that made the falafel by hand and fried them individually in front of me, just to be that guy..). The ingredients were super fresh and super flavourful. They also offer a daily lunch buffet with tons of options that looked equally as mouthwatering.
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/28/2014,4/24/2014,66,321,,5,3>I don't need much from a gas station and this place delivers on all counts.First off, it's one of only a few actual gas stations downtown. Really, I can only think of one or two others.And it's a gas station. Which, I realize, sounds repetitive but I mean that it's not a mechanic's shop or a car wash or "power station." You drive up, you gas up, you pay and then you go. You can pay at the pump (and at certain times of the day that's the only option) or inside. The selection in the convenience store half of the gas station isn't huge but again, I like that. Play to your strengths!
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2014,4/23/2014,11,5,,5,4>Just got a sweet cut at this fantastic little shop!The quality of the cut (most important thing for me) was great.  I can't even begin to tell you how good I look!I walked in at 4ish on a Wednesday without an appointment and I was in a chair watching the man get to work in under a minute.On an unrelated note, I love boxing.  On a related note, so does the owner of this fine establishment.  Really, he knows a lot about a lot and loves to chat.  It's not like when you go to one of those chain hair dresser places at the mall and you can tell that they just want a tip, this guy actually wants to talk to you and values what you say to him.Price was 20 bucks.  Make sure you bring cash because they don't take debit.
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/11/2014,4/22/2014,8,168,,3,2>Babies crying, toddlers screaming, toys stolen, peppered with squeals of delight......sound like your idea of a good time? Then hop on over to Play Cafe!  This is a great spot for parents to bring small children who are old enough to use the indoor play area, consisting of a climbing gym and fun toys in a large play area.  My daughter is only 7 months old, so I only come here because there is a mom group that meets here every Friday at 12:00.  I wouldn't bring her here by myself as there really isn't anything for younger babies to do.  I definitely recommend it for children in the 2-5 age range.      I have to say I was sad when they upped the price for babies.  Now everyone has to pay the 6$ entrance fee.  It used to be that babies under 8 months were free as long as you made a cafe purchase of 2$.  Now I understand that times are tough and this is a lot of floor space, so rent is likely high and they have to make a living, but 6$ is a bit high for a baby.  It would be nice if there were a variety of price options.  I even think 5$ would be more acceptable.  No big deal though.      This spot is very clean and the staff are pretty friendly.  They do strictly enforce the no outside food policy though, however you can bring food for your little ones, but they have to eat it in the eating area only, not the play area, which makes sense.      Overall, a great spot for families to come have a good time and change up the scenery for their kids.
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,4/21/2014,4,8,,5,4>I have always wanted to try Sully's. I heard the buzz when they opened their old location. I even eyeballed the place a few times as I drove down to Seaview Park. The one thing that stopped me from going in was cash, Sully's was cash only and I am not that well prepared! To tell the truth, I'm kind of lazy...Fast forward to last week, I noticed the big awning of Sully's new location on Agricola St. Sweet new location, first sunny day of the year, hungry wife (she carries cash) and plenty of space to park out front. Done deal.When we walked in the place was empty. The dining room was quite spacious, with beautiful old floor boards and mismatched furniture. The walls were decorated with vintage framed sports photos. A vintage coke cooler and wind up record player completed the rustic/vintage look.The friendly girl working the counter got our eyes on a menu and gave some good suggestions in no time. My wife and I decided to split the smoked meat and the roast beef. Best part was, although we happened to have some cash on hand.. SULLY"S NOW TAKES DEBIT!After ringing up our order we grabbed our soda and took a seat in the corner. Sully himself came out to deliver the food. He chatted with us about where he sources his meat, pickles, sauerkraut, mustard..EVERYTHING,We really enjoyed our meal. So much so that we ordered the pulled pork to split as well. My wife instagrammed the whole affair, of course.The owner of this shop is such a friendly and welcoming guy. We were really quite impressed. We have been back a few times in the past week and will likely make this place a lunchtime staple.
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,4/20/2014,3,7,,6,3>Went there for my birthday dinner and The Cut totally exceeded all expectations. The waiter was very knowledgable about the various origins, marbling and cuts of the steaks available! Feeling the need to take advantage of my birthday present, I ordered the tenderloin and was very impressed with the accompaniment of dressing and seasonings. My butter knife was not over-used. The side dishes were exquisite, and the environment was very classy! Furthermore, though the meal was extremely expensive, it was worth it because I left feeling full and absolutely content-something almost impossible to succeed when fine-dining.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2014,4/19/2014,1,4,,4,3>We are regulars here - at least once a week.  Love the atmosphere  - nostalgic and quaint but with style!  Staff are relaxed but attentive and they remember you.  The focus on local foods is appreciated.  Burgers are a strong suit but so is fish.  This is a chef who really cares about the special.  We have started ordering it almost without first asking what it is.  You can tell the chef is having fun with the freshest ingredients of the day.  There is quite a vibe on Friday and Saturday nights but brunch is also recommended.
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2014,4/18/2014,2,1,,4,3>This was my first visit there and enjoyed it.  A small restaurant but warm and friendly.  There were 3 of us and we each ordered a different pizza and then shared, which was nice to taste them off. I was really appreciated when they said that they could omit cheese on each of the two as I am lactose intolerance and had goat cheese on mine.  A lot of places will not to this. I definitely would go back!
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/6/2014,4/16/2014,20,226,2,5,4>As a bookworm, I can't believe there is a second-hand bookstore in Halifax that I haven't visited ever.  Welp, that little problem has been solved.  While it's not exactly floor-to-ceiling books like Doull, it is ... floor to top of bookshelf.  :-D They do have good variety of a wide range of topics, including lots of Canadian novels and history books.  I didn't have a lot of time to browse that day, but it's not a large store so I don't feel I missed much.  A bit musty and not much order to the books (other than by topic), but that's fine by me.The owner didn't acknowledge us when we walked in, but became chatty when I brought a cookbook to the counter.  He seemed very nice and knowledgeable.  Books don't seem to be overpriced and I did see some titles I may have to return for.

They also have a few games and cute items in stock for kids or last minute gifts. I go in every so often to buy colored envelopes and stationary in bulk in so many colors. Duly Noted doesn't carry anything cheap or chintzy. Everything is good quality, usually limited supply for unique items, and fun to peruse.
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2014,4/14/2014,28,259,2,8,4>My mom's favorite cuisine that my dad doesn't like is Chinese food. So anytime dad heads out of town for something, Fan's is the go-to spot for us.It is some of the best Chinese food I have had in Halifax (which is like saying to dominated in a little league game at the age of 26..) It's a huge restaurant, with plenty of seating for you and your friends. The portion sizes are huge. We usually go with the sweet and sour chicken and the steamed veggies.. which are great staples.. and then follow that up with a new option every time, the most recent was the ginger beef which was a little greasy (not a bad thing) but highly tasty.It won't set you back an incredible amount either. The knocks against it, would be the lack of heating some nights (more my family, than me) and the location. Just not the greatest feeling to it in the parking lot at night. Wouldn't feel safe for my mom if she was there alone.
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/3/2014,4/13/2014,4,30,,9,3>Went there Friday (January 31st).Before going, we checked out their menu on their site (auctionhousehalifax.com), the site is awesomely designed and easy to maneuver.  Wanted to check out the menu to gauge the food.I only wish I could have tried everything because everything sounded awesome.We had the following...- Chedder Stout Dip- Truffle Fries- Sausage BitesThis is all part of their 'Bites' and we were very well pleased! I'm going to put this up a notch from other bar food appetizers! The sausage bites is a hot sausage that is flash fried... I'm not too sure what that means :) but all I can say is that they keep doing it.Upon entering the premises, we were greeted right away by a friendly staff member stating we could sit where ever we wish. Other staff that passed us as we made our way to the back were all smiles.... awesome.This place has three levels and are all layout out very nice like an 'upscale' pub.There is a bar on the first level and a bar on the third level. We went to the third level as it was quite busy.As soon as we sat down, we were brought food menus and asked what we would like to drink. My wife was eyeing the 'the red apple martini' but it had rye in it and she is not a rye fan. the server said he can put any type of alcohol that she would like. Turned out getting vodka and she said it was delicious. Very helpful.I ordered the 'RARE BIRD FULL STEAM' tap beer and it ranks up there with a lot of the stout micro brews you can find. It was very good. Love the fact that they have have local beers on tap.My only issue... and it is very minor... is that the walls on the third floor are white and it made the place cold and sterile. That's just my taste...We will be going back!!!Hope this review helps.Thanks

<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/18/2013,4/10/2014,9,42,,4,3>I like Bearly's. My fiance and I went here for our first date and we have been back many times since.Sometimes we go to have a few drinks, but more frequently we have gone for a bite to eat. On different occasions I've had burgers, spinach salad, wings and a turkey dinner. The turkey dinner was not their forte, but I've enjoyed everything else I've had here. I've not tried the ribs, but my fiance has. He did not enjoy them. He is a connoisseur of all things meat, so I am going to trust him on this one.I like the atmosphere, it is the perfect setting to listen to some fantastic blues music. The staff are friendly, and the price is right. Bearly's is a casual, unpretentious spot to throw back a few beer, grab some tasty, simple grub, and listen to some great music.

<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,4/8/2014,59,224,3,5,3>I recently went in to Daniel Daniel Dentistry for a cleaning and initial consult and was immediately impressed by the stylish way the office was set up. Very modern touches, making one feel as if one is going to be well taken care of.The washrooms were quite unlike any other I've seen in other dentists offices.. The walls are lined with all sorts of complimentary dental hygiene products such as toothpaste, floss, mouthwash etc. There was even moisturizer, hand lotion and hair styling products (for those whose hair gets scrunched up during the necessary X-Rays and having to lie back against a dentist chair for extended periods).. I thought this was very thoughtful and a good example of a business that thinks ahead regarding its clients needs.Dr. Daniel himself is super confident and encouraging and leaves little doubt that you're in extremely capable hands. He makes a personal connection with patients that I think would allay even the most dental-phobic's fears. I didn't have to wait around in the waiting room very long (almost a pity considering the snack and coffee bar at your disposal), before getting whisked away to have whatever ails your chompers taken care of in a professional manner. They seem to have all kinds of ultra modern machinery that, again, I have not seen at any other dental office elsewhere.. The really close up x-rays that they do in the dentist chair was a bit uncomfortable, but once I told them that they took steps to correct it immediately.To sum it up, I look forward to returning to Daniel Daniel dentistry for my follow up and would highly recommend this practice to anyone.

The mock duck was fantastic, crispy on the outside and soft in the middle with fragrant lemon sauce. I loved everything we ate, I will definitely be back. I thought the service was fantastic.
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/27/2014,4/6/2014,3,6,,7,3>Speaking as a Korean, Arirang probably is the closest restaurant that serves authentic Korean food in town other than Ichiban (bell aliant building in downtown). Right after I came here to attend university from Yarmouth, I was missing home a lot so I started to dine in every Korean restaurant in town. But what I noticed was lots of Korean restaurants here were a bit overpriced for the taste, especially considering that I was a student. Therefore, I stopped eating out for Korean food here, with the exception of Arirang. Arirang's taste is pretty awesome and they have a variety of food you can try. Quantity-wise, they give you a lot of food too. More importantly, prices are really fair and affordable. Another good thing about Arirang is that they don't only have good Korean food, their Japanese dishes are awesome as well! I always order a bunch of sushi rolls with Korean food when I go there. Combination of cheese donkatsu and house roll is my favourite. :) I highly recommend trying it. So If you are looking for affordable, good authentic Korean restaurant in town - or a sushi lover - you defiantly should check Arirang out.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2014,4/5/2014,42,100,,6,3>Since working downtown for the last X number of years, I've wanted a place that I could go to that had relatively quick service, wasn't fast-food, with space to eat-in that wasn't a full-service restaurant. Burrito Jax slightly expanded their interior last year adding a few tables and since then it's become a staple for me on my lunches.Their burritos are overflowing but never actually break open so they aren't messy. There are options for beef, chicken, pork, vegetarian and several others, along with the standard filling choices of beans, rice, veggies and a selection of sauces and salsas. Plus the highlight: they grill the burrito.I've yet to have a bad burrito from this place, and I go here more often than I know I should...This place is always among my top choices of places to eat when I'm downtown and when it's not, it's a great backup plan.
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2014,4/4/2014,25,117,,5,4>I have always loved Woozles, ever since I was a kid and mom took me into their magical store. This place hasn't changed much over the years and I think that's part of  why it still has me coming back. They have real toys and books - stuff I remember from childhood and the store just makes you feel like a kid again!Everything at Woozles is awesome. I mean it. Every room is stuffed to the brim with magical books, wonderful toys, games and trains and blocks and all kinds of amazingness! Every product is high quality, educational and fun - there's something for every kid, teacher and parent!The staff are also fantastic. They have great recommendations and can help find almost anything. They're very friendly and make it their mission to find you the right product every time. I have never been disappointed by their recommendations. I really don't know if I can put the greatness that is Woozles accurately into a short review, you really do have to go experience it for yourself. So get out there and enjoy it - it's the coolest "bookstore" I've ever been to.

Where brian's eating chocolate: I  LOOOOOOVE chocolate... but I can't eat it 'cuz then i'll get fat... but it's SOOOOOOOO good. This is my input on, yes chocolate, but BURGERS. Here's the kicker though; even though i'm on the constant hunt for burgers, when I walked through the doors of Cheese Curds. I REALLY wanted a, wait for it, hot dog :3I love the atmosphere of this place, it's clean and fresh with bright colours and a metal woman hanging from the ceiling. The service is superb, the guy at the register was very nice and went through the menu with me. Way better then most places that get pissed when you ask for no pickles. You are given a number and a buzzer. The thing will flash some red and vibrate and that's your cue to retrieve your meal. I'm not sure if the process I got is the same for the burgers but the dude asked me what I wanted on my hot dog and they put it on for you, right in front of you - subway style. And there's a nice variety of toppings to choose from. Fries? HANDCUT, PURE DEEP-FRIED DELICIOUSNESSHot dog? YUMMMM
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2014,4/2/2014,1,4,,6,6>Games People Play is a fantastic little shop to go to if you're a fan of card games and board games. They have a great variety of products to choose from, and they're especially my first choice for anything "Magic: The Gathering" related :)The staff are exceptional. Always friendly and willing to help you whenever they can. This is also a wonderful place to visit if you actually want to sit down and play a game. Every night they have a different event:Mon. - Dungeons & DragonsTues. - MTG draft/learn how to draftWed. - Casual MTG/learn how to playThurs. - Open board game day (all day)Fri. - Friday Night Magic, of courseSat. - Legacy MTG, and Game of Thrones LCGSun. - Pokemon League, and Ascension MTGSomething for everyone! All in all, I have never had any problems with this place, and would recommend it for all your gaming needs.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/21/2014,4/1/2014,0,6,2,5,4>Went for my birthday (declined the plate breaking though, regrettably, as it was cold and windy outside) and was very impressed. Excellent, friendly service, delicious food, and a nice small atmosphere. Skordalia dip is awesome (let's dip carbs into other carbs, yeah!). Spinach and chicken penne was perfectly cooked, if just a touch sweet for my taste. They've got delivery too. Definitely adding this to my short list.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/24/2014,3/31/2014,2,14,,5,4>Tried this place twice in the last month, both out of convenience and curiosity. The first visit we dined upstairs, and the second time stayed on the lower level. Staff was very friendly, and service was fast. Both visits, our servers provided information about the menu, advice on what was their favorites, and best toppings, etc. The atmosphere has a very casual and comfortable feel, however, a little more cramped for space on the upper level. Our first visit we had the pepper burger (with bacon), peanut butter burger, both with poutine, one coke, and deep fried pickles for an appetizer ($41.46 + tip). Everything was very good. The pepper burger was a little oily from the peppers (it is a burger after all), and the gravy on the poutine was not the best I've had. Aside from that, I honestly cannot say enough about the deep fried pickles, they are amazing. This is the only place that I have found that makes them this well - lightly battered, still has a bit of a crunch and not slimy like a lot of them get once fried. While we there, we noticed that the following week they would have the peanut butter burger for $5 and since my husband liked it so much, he wanted another and I wanted to try one. This led us to our second visit. We each had a peanut butter burger, he had a coke, we split a large Darrell Fries and had deep fried pickles again for an appetizer ($26.04 + tip). It was great. The burgers are made fresh, and are cooked perfectly. Everything is portioned nicely, so much so, that you are completely stuffed, which some may view as a bad thing. The Darrell fries are wedge cut and are seasoned nicely, and once again, the deep fried pickles are awesome! A must try for those that like this type of treat. Overall, I would definitely recommend, especially for a quick meal, or a casual get-together.

<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2013,3/29/2014,22,150,,7,2>Took us too long but we finally gave this lovely spot a try on a Friday evening. I love the layout and design of the restaurant. A cozy bar set up downstairs, modern & nicely appointed dining room upstairs. The menu had a good variety. Our understanding is they change the menu every 6 months. B started with the caesar salad and went with the tenderloin for his main. I started with the spinach salad and followed up with the braised short rib.The salads were very good, lots of good, fresh flavours. The mains were good but I felt the meat portions were a little on the skimpy side for the price. Having said that, the veg sides were outstanding, no less than 8 different veg on each of our plates and cooked to perfection. B's tenderloin came with grilled polenta as the starch and mine with a quinoa dish.Our server explained that substitution wasn't a problem if we'd like some other side but we stuck with the menu. I had contacted the restaurant when making our reservation asking if they could adjust the caesar dressing to allow for B's seafood allergy and they were very accommodating.The service was outstanding, Robin was attentive but not oppressively so. Both she and the other gal (didn't get her name) were helpful throughout our meal. Only 3 issues, one was the size of the meat portions already mentioned, another was that there was a salt shaker on the table and it was one of the rare occasions I found I needed to use it. And finally, the heat upstairs was oppressive, to the point my glasses were steaming up, not sure with the layout how that might be remedied.A little torn between wanting to give this place 5 stars but I settled a four and hope I can up that on a return visit.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2014,3/28/2014,0,4,1,7,5>Five fellow yelpers suggest Dhaba Express as probably the best Indian food in Halifax. Finding it was a bit hard, as we drove past the side street twice -even with GPS. DE is located in a strip mall but the inside of it is very nice.As you open the doors, the aroma of curries is great.  Very clean, nice décor, and fresh cut flowers at each table. The service was excellent. The server was knowledgeable and suggested the "Thali" which is three vegetable portions, rice, naan, salad served on a triangular silver platter. It looked amazing and tasted good. My better half went the safe route and ordered their butter chicken combo. He was more than delighted with his order but wished there was more naan to finish off the rich creamy butter chicken sauce. We were full, but I had to try the rasmali - my favorite Indian sweet. It was incredible.My fellow Yelpers were correct, Dhaba has the best Indian food in Halifax and a reasonable price. The only con against Dhaba would be its location in Bayers Lake. Ugghhh  But the trip is worth it for the food at Dhaba.

<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/15/2012,3/25/2014,24,41,2,5,3>Quantum is one of the younger Comic Shops in the city (not that there are many) but don't let that fool you into thinking they aren't top nerd-culture contenders. Overall, they're pretty great. I wouldn't consider them my absolute best/favorite, but they are up there to be sure!Customer Service: 5/5It doesn't matter who's on shift that day, you're bound to get friendly and knowledgeable service from any of them. Pat (the owner) knows what you need, maybe even before you do. If you're a long time card carrying nerd, they've got interesting dialogue to open up with you on topics that interest you. If you're a sometimes visitor to the life, then they've got the appropriate level of nerd info  the impart to you. If you're a first timer, not sure if you'll ever be a long time visitor, then they've got the answers to your questions to find out what you could be into, if there is anything for you. Products: 4/5They've got a pretty wide selection of anything one might be interested in, if you are the type to frequent these places. Like board games? They've got a hardy selection, from Munchkin to Catan! Like Sword/Sorcery table tops games? They've got you covered from D&D to Warhammer. Like toys? They've got your action figures, plush dolls, busts, and stickers ready to go! Do you like comics and graphic novels? They've got it all from Marvel to DC to Image to IDW to Archie. My only suggestion would be to bring in a larger selection of back issues (single issue comic books older than recent printings that customers would typically search out to complete collections). Their graphic novel / trade selection is pretty wide, so that's comparable to other stores in the city.Atmosphere: 3/5Don't get me wrong, the place looks more or less like it should. Walls of comics, statues behind glass cases, racks of boardgames, bins of marked down items... It's all there. But, maybe it's all there a bit too organized. Some stores thrive on organization, but a comic shop? It needs a little bit of chaos to really feel right for me. I feel comfortable when things are a bit out of place. It adds to the hunt of that one item, having to sift around a bit to find something completely unexpected you've been searching for for years, or something you never knew you wanted. I will add, however, that I love the large posters on the outside! Huge posters on the front and side of the building of Batman, Optimus Prime, and Wolverine... Talk about flying your geek flag proud! Impressive, and admirable! But then again, their parking lot is reallllly small... maybe 4 spots total, and a tight fit into the driveway too. Price: 3/5The prices aren't bad, and in fact they are pretty average from some other spots. That being said, there's nothing particularly impressive about them. Quantum doesn't often have sales (not widespread ones) and when they do it's usually something in the area of between 10% and 20% off specific items. Given how expensive it can be to keep up our line of obsessive collections and paraphernalia, it is nice to find a really inexpensive deal every so often. It's not a must, but it would be a big plus for me.If you're on Robie (or anywhere in Halifax since it's a pretty central location), give it a try. It doesn't matter what kind of nerd you are (long-time, short-time, new, or never been), you just may find the one thing that hooks you in, or the many things that confirm that you're not that into it.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,3/24/2014,1,1,,3,2>My experiences with Uppercutz have been nothing short of outstanding. I get a fade every second week at this place. The staff always has been professional and talkative. I have very thick, curly, hard to deal with hair that has puzzled many barbers/hairstylists before. I have paid for haircuts at expensive salons without getting the result of the more than affordable cuts at Uppercutz. From my first cut received by the lovely Christy, I knew I would be a regular customer at the shop... and I have. I leave the shop satisfied, sporting a fade that shows the quality and skills of their staff.This is the place you want for a great fade/cut.

My hair has actually gotten healthier since I've been coming here and I've always been really happy with the consistently great quality of the cuts and colour and the products and services are all top drawer. This salon is spotlessly clean and accessible in a great central location with lots of parking unlike downtown salons with higher prices and no parking. The tanning beds are clean and modern and the esthetic services, nails and makeup application are all of extremely professional quality. The staff are genuine and friendly, along with being extremely knowledgeable about products and services. I would highly recommend this business to men, women and children.
<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/8/2014,3/22/2014,40,216,3,6,5>After Tomavino's (sino's? I dunno) re-opened under the new, old ownership, my girlfriend and I stopped by for a mid-week meal. The basement dining room is pretty cozy feeling and we had it mostly to ourselves, other than one or two other tables. Not anticipating the large portion sizes that we would end up with, we ordered their foccacia to start, then a spinach salad and small con carne pizza for the main show.A very plentiful basket of foccacia arrived, thinner pieces than I expected but they packed a lot of flavour. With Asiago, parmesan, pesto, honey and olive oil, this wasn't your typical table bread. With a bit of friendly funk from the basil and parm, and the sweetness of the honey, this was a great way to start the meal.The spinach salad was an enjoyable variant from your typical egg/bacon/poppy seed dressing topped version. With egg, prosciutto, pineapple, tomato, bacon and Fontina cheese, and a honey Dijon dressing, the salad again struck all the good flavour notes and was generous in size as well.The con carne pizza came topped with meatballs, Italian sausage and pepperoni, so obviously not for you vegetarians or people with poor cardiovascular health. It's hard to go wrong with a meat pizza, and this one was definitely on track with quality meats and a thin, crispy crust and a nice sauce that had a good balance of tomato-y acidity and a hint of sweetness.More recently, during the #Halifax #Snowpocalypse, I was looking for food while in between my night shifts. Being that Tomavino's seems to be way too empty whenever I walk by, I decided to vote with my money. Their dining room wasn't open, but the take out window was so that's what I went with, ordering a medium combination (mushroom, onion, green pepper, pepperoni, bacon and homemade meatballs) and a side Caesar. Being that I was one of four or five customers that they'd had all day, it didn't take too long to get my food and was on my way back to my hotel to nosh away.The pizza had a wonderfully thin, crisp crust and unlike many thin crust pizzas, still had a ton of toppings on it. Fresh and plentiful, they were as good as you'd imagine that selection to be. The Caesar salad was huge for what I was expecting for only $3.50. Instead of a little container just a few inches by a few inches, this was a full sized take out container full of lettuce, light and crunchy croutons and pieces of thick cut, honest-to-god bacon, not that flavoured soy blasphemy. Coated with just enough of the dressing, this would have been a near perfect Caesar if it weren't for the lettuce being slightly passed its prime and being a bit limp. And while I noticed when I got to the hotel that I had been charged a few bucks too much, for a large instead of a medium pizza, the storm and sheer size and quality of the food that I did get didn't make it worth my while to go recoup my money.Tomav(s)ino's has some of the best mid-range pizza in the city - not quite fancy pants echelon, but in a  different league than your typical, sketchy generic neighbourhood joint - and deserves your business, whether dining in or taking out.
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/17/2014,3/21/2014,27,83,,6,5>We need more additions like this along Gottingen St. Thanks to Edna, there's a good spread of fine establishment bringing life back to this place. And on the plus side, Edna is a modern type of fine dining that has a class of its own. I went there with my spouse last night and ordered the oysters (they served 2 kinds, one from PEI and the other from Black Point, NS). At $2 a pop, it was worth it. Fresh and succulent. Also goes well with the shot of Bloody Mary we ordered.As for our appetizer, we had the crispy pork belly. Two thumbs up for the chef - the dish was prepared well. Nicely cook and the kale sides was equally delicious. As for the main course we had the NS Butcher's Cut which we ordered to be serve medium cook. I think the chef think a good job with that too but our only complain was that it went with fries which kind of brought the "fine-dining" experience a notch down. Would have been better to serve it with some more interesting and more refine side apart from fries.All in all, I'd say Edna is a great place to go for a unique fine dining experience here in Hali and if you're like me - looking for good oysters, then consider this place.

Well, I couldn't pick, he suggested sushi and we ended up here! I would have totally suggested sushi but it's one of those things that people either love or don't.Honestly, I wouldn't have suggested Sushi Nami, but I'm glad he did because it makes a nice change from my usual joint.The restaurant is classy/casual with a very cool atmosphere; it's clean and opening. Service is always fairy fast. We both ordered maki dinners; he got the deluxe and I got the assorted. They both came with a house salad (which is very good) and miso soup to start. Mine had 14 pieces; 3 California, 3 tuna, 3 spicy salmon and 5 chicken teriyaki rolls. I liked it all, but the chicken teriyaki rolls I found rather dry and lacking in flavour.I've had the kamikaze roll other times I've been there and it's one of my all time favourites. A deep fried roll with salmon, tuna, jalapeños, avocado and cream cheese - yum!

And they won't screw you. Though, as the name implies, they only do Hondas. Mechanics are one of those places that we all fear we will get fleeced when we go. There is a pervasive lack of trust for most in this industry, with many people just relying on pricy dealerships or cheap chains (Canadian Tire, Mr Lube).Well Civic Pride is the shop that bucks that rule and stands apart (in a good way).Run by Blake, friendly, but reassuringly no-nonsense, Civic Pride is a great mechanic's shop. When a car shop does a good job there's really little to say though.They know their stuff, and will fix whatever they diagnose in an expedient and efficient manner. Most of the time they have all needed parts on site, when not, they are ordered rush shipping. Prices are reasonable and you won't get cheated.Even the CAA tow truck driver said I make a good call taking it here!

I spent a good chunk of time volunteering for the HSHC back in my university days, but I've also come here as a patient. The good:- Pamphlets x 100 in the waiting room.- Posters for local events, services, workshops, etc. all over the place.- A wide array of free/inexpensive services - pap tests, STI testing, birth control (of all imaginable types, including Plan B), abortion counseling and arrangement, pregnancy tests, breast health exams, anonymous HIV/AIDS testing...you name it, they've got it.- A welcoming, respectful, and highly inclusive environment.- Awesome staff: empathetic, respectful, and highly discreet.- Fun events from time to time.Less good:- Wait times can be long.- Appointments may be difficult to obtain, especially if you're looking for something sooner rather than next week. In addition, clinic hours are limited after 4 pm, so chances are you'll have to take a morning/afternoon off to get checked out.Really, though, there's not much to complain about - certainly nothing that's out of the ordinary for a busy medical clinic.Don't be afraid to check HSHC out - you won't regret it.
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2014,3/12/2014,26,201,1,12,8>After hearing that the guy who brought you the delicious lunches at Kebab Kitchen was opening his own spot, we had to try. Upon walking in, the smells are amazing, the interior is gorgeous and cozy, and the lighting is beautiful. Being offered a spot by the window, we gladly took it. We love Turkish cuisine so we immediately knew we wanted so many of the appetizers, and we were very happy to see they had a mezze plate option for only $8.50. It was the perfect portion size, we a bit of everything: hummus, dill sauce, the red sauce, pita, helloumi, peppers, olives, feta, grape leaves, and lentils. It was delish. We also ordered a 1/2lt of house wine, and were extremely pleased by the presentation in a gorgeous glass jug and a price of only $13. It was a great deal.Then we moved on to the mains, both R. and I opting for a seafood option, as we know they get it fresh in every week. I got the seafood that is stewed in tomatoes and spices, which came with their amazing rice and turkish salad. And R. got the seafood kebab which comes with the same sides. Great portions! entrees all hovered around the $15 which is more than reasonable for what you get. All very delicious. Their white dill sauce is LITERALLY to die for. So amazing. Best part of this place is the owner/cook. He is friendly smiling from the back where you can watch him cook over a charcoal grill. All very clean and gets your mouth watering for your meal. Although small, it really doesn't feel small, they have laid out the place perfectly. This will definitely be my new favorite place. Much better than some of the other Hali Turkish spots!
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2014,3/8/2014,1,15,1,7,4>I give this restaurant a 5 star rating, but I must admit that I come here for one reason and only one: the pho, and in particular the #8 pho with the three types of meat. Total yumminess. I spent 2 weeks backpacking in Vietnam some years ago, and I subsisted on pho and spring rolls. And having had the real deal in Vietnam, I can honestly say that this pho is outstanding. The staff here are very friendly, and if you have a look around at the clientele, you will see Asian customers frequent this restaurant which certainly adds legitimacy to this place and its food. Bravo!  Hmmmm I'm getting hungry for some pho now lol
<review# 259,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/26/2014,3/7/2014,9,59,1,4,4>I like Ma Belle's. Their soup is tasty, their omelets filling, and their paninis are great. I'm not a fan of that little leek salad thing that comes on the side (coleslaw?) but everything else I've had there has been great. Staff are very attentive and prices are reasonable. The decor is... quaint... certainly not a polished, fancy looking place, but the kind of place that feels welcome and homey.
<review# 260,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/27/2014,3/6/2014,13,104,2,6,2>Stopped by here a bit ago and got my mom a nice turtles cheesecake for her birthday. She loooooves cheesecake and was this ever good!I love cheesecake too but to be honest, this cake is beyond any that I've ever had. It's so rich and decadent I almost couldn't finish my one slice. They even have GF/vegan options as well! I love it when I see that, even though it's not nearly as tasty as gluten goodness. I'm not sure what the going rate for a slice of cheesecake is but I think it cost about $40-$50 for a whole cake. Great place!
<review# 261,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,3/5/2014,13,44,2,9,5>I was told about this charming cafe by Fred while getting my hair chopped off about a year ago; it took me some time to make my way down for a first visit, and it's taken even longer to finally review it. I've long grumbled about Halifax's lack of a real pastry shop. I longed for small treats that were entirely decadent and not overloaded with sugar and shortening. My dream has since come true.The space is definitely small, and there is not a lot of seating. Don't let this be a problem though, I beg of you. First off, what space there is, is incredibly charming. I've never been to France, but I imagine this is what it feels like. Secondly, once you enter and gaze upon the case of delicious delights, you'll stop caring that you might not be lucky enough to eat it there (and come on, Grand Parade is so close, go sit there and enjoy the city), and instead just be thankful that you'll get to indulge in whatever you choose.The owner is originally from France, from what I understand, and is incredibly talented. His creations are both beautiful and absolutely delicious. His macarons should be famous (if there already aren't), and as far as I know, they're the only authentic ones to be found in the city. Yes, I realize other places may sell them, but none are this good. None! I challenge you, find me one better. Come here and try them, at least. You'll thank me.Not only do they offer lovely treats (as well as coffee! espresso! tea!), but at lunch they have sandwiches, they offer take-and-bake croissants, and pastry classes. So seriously. What are you waiting for. Get over there now.
<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,3/4/2014,0,1,1,5,4>I have been looking for a great pizza place since moving to halifax last June. I have tried so many places until last night I happened on Euro Pizza. Great taste and excellent pricing. They even make their own yoghurt and pita bread. I have only tried the pizza so far but when they brought a menu with the delivery I will definitely be trying more menu items.
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2014,3/3/2014,3,1,1,5,3>I went there last week, I made an afternoon appointment in morning, there was a small place which close to food count in Bell building. Miss Lee who is a young lady got me a new Korean hair style. We talked a lot  about lastly Korean drama, Love from stars. The new hair is lovely and they only charged $15.5 (not include tips).I will go there again.

<review# 265,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/23/2014,3/1/2014,13,213,1,6,5>I recently visited Palooka's with a group on pass. Impressive views and typical gym stuff like cardio and weights but this gym also has several heavy bags and fitness classes. I also saw people getting personal training as well. I took a cardio fitness class and it was great. We did some weights and a cardio workout. Overall I am pleased with this gym and if I lived closer by I would consider buying a pass.
<review# 266,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2014,2/28/2014,0,1,1,7,5>I convinced a co-worker to come to Wednesday night trivia with me a year or so ago and we've been going ever since. The group is now up to 4-5 people and we enjoy both our regular server Wendy who knows our favourite dishes/food allergies, and Dennis the trivia host with the most. Not everything on the menu is fantastic but there are a lot of really good options (Guacamole burger, great vegetarian burger, wings, slouvaki, ...so something for everyone) They also have local beer, which is a bonus. Also, the two times that I made it there for live music on a Sunday were a blast. Living in Fairview, I'm glad that I have a place like Freeman's to go to!
<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2014,2/27/2014,12,118,1,8,5>This place is awesome! Such a neat idea and very popular - a good alternative to spend time with friends outside of a restaurant/bar/home. There are many game options and if you are unsure what to play, the staff will make some suggestions, or even pick one for you.I love the atmosphere and $5 for unlimited playing makes it so affordable. There are also drink options and food options. I find some of the drinks a bit expensive, so I always stick with water. But how can you go wrong with a $3 bowl of candy or pita bread and hummus. The staff are so friendly and know their games very well. There are quite a few tables and chairs (I think they all fit at least 4 people). Also there is a comfy couch option, but that is always hogged by other people.I will say that I've noticed that there can be a super long waiting list to get a table to play some games (especially on a weekend), and with no gaurantee of when a table will be available, a lot of people just don't bother. There should be some sort of time limit (weekend nights), at like 2-3 hours to allow for other groups to get a chance to play. We were there this past weekend from approximately 7:30pm to 9:30pm and only one table left during that time, and I noticed a lot of groups came in and left after hearing the wait time of at least 1.5hrs with no gaurantee. Overall, I love this place! I wish I thought of opening a place like this myself. I highly reccommend giving it a try.
<review# 268,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2012,2/26/2014,8,4,3,7,6>When you don't know anything about something, trust is an important thing. I took my antique engagement ring to FireWorks recently to have it resized, and found out the stones also needed to be retipped. At first, panic alarms were ringing in my head and dollar bills were flashing in my eyes. From deep within my cynical side a voice yelled, "You'll never get my money!!!" But when the woman helping me out called another staff person over for a second opinion, I felt good about it all. I trusted their tag-team expertise. I am curious by nature, so I asked lots of questions and she was extremely informative, explaining why the retipping was crucial for an older ring like mine.  I left the shop knowing my jewelry was in good hands and when I picked it up only a week (!) later I was ever so happy to see my little diamonds and know they were firmly in place.My ring isn't worth millions, but it's incredibly special and the staff made me feel like I mattered. And isn't that the essence of good customer service?
<review# 269,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2014,2/25/2014,0,1,1,8,6>If you like great food and appreciate above average customer service then you need to stop in at Staggers Pub & Grub. The food is prepared fresh daily and made to order. The owners and staff are so friendly and courteous they make you feel right at home. Come on down and check it out.  You won't be disappointed!
<review# 270,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2014,2/24/2014,0,5,3,7,5>Had the pork with an apple type sauce and the Tomato Pesto soup. The soup was super!!  in fact, better than tomato soup ever should be.The pork came with baby potatoes and spinach. the pork although containing more fat than I would have liked had a fabulous taste. The veggies were also very good, crisp as they should be.We will definitely return.
<review# 271,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,2/23/2014,2,51,,4,3>I've been coming to daMaurizio since Maurizio and Stephanie Bertossi opened it what seems like a lifetime ago. Good friends Tanya and Andrew King have owned it for almost a decade and have done an excellent job of maintaining the quality and specialness of the resto. They have an outstanding staff who are knowledgable about the food that Andrew produces and the wines that rest in their cellar. While this is a destination resto for special occasions, it's accessible enough for a Tuesday night when you just want someone to feed you something wonderful. The menu changes seasonally and they have a prix fixe menu that changes monthly. You can't go wrong with the calamari or lumache to start. If you're into bitter salad, have the warm radicchio salad. Their take on a caesar salad is also excellent. If the veal chop with porcini crust is on the menu, get it. Anything with rabbit will make your taste buds do a happy dance. They have a deft hand with seafood, and the halibut is always an excellent choice. The pastas and risotti are all delish and come in an "appetizer" size (which I find filling enough) but you can also order them in a larger "main course" size. Desserts are decadent--their pastry chef is a genius. If you're like me and don't have a sweet tooth, you'll be pleased with the cheese plate.The wine list is extensive but lacks details so ask your server for descriptions and/or recommendations. And don't be shy about setting a price limit! They've got something to suit every budget. There is also a decent selection of wines by the glass. They have a full bar, so if wine's not your thing, there will be something available to quench your thirst.Special occasion or not, daMaurizio is a fabulous destination.
<review# 272,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2013,2/22/2014,1,4,,12,4>Unreal. By constantly rotating their beers they provide an outstanding and diverse selection of local beers, and their dedication to Canadian craft breweries shows. Their unique bar design doesn't make the selection intimidating, each tap coloured to be (more or less) the colour of the beer, so you can guess what you'd like based on the colours and descriptions. Prices are great, I like that they have smaller pours (5oz tasters and 12oz pours) to keep the price down (6-7$ per 12oz pour). This may upset some people, but keep in mind many of the beers are 9-10% so you're getting good value. And their food is exceptional and affordable. MY NEW FAVOURITE.
<review# 273,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2014,2/21/2014,7,53,,6,3>Well this little gem is really that.  I was looking for a place to take my friend for lunch that was not far from her work (Bayers Rd) and voila I came across this one.  I was lucky to have a friend at work that could vouch for it too.We both had (on recommendation) the man'oushe (not sure I'm spelling that right) but they are like a small pizza - flat bread type with a nice thin crust that is done perfectly.  We had the meat and cheese - there are many types.  You can get it with hot pepper and lemon juice and we did - Lordy it was so good.  I was for some reason expecting hot peppers chopped up but it was more like a cayenne pepper had been sprinkled on it.  The lemon was just the perfect ending.The man'oushe are about 6" in size and great for lunch.  It was $4.50 each with I believe and extra $1.50 for the lemon and pepper but my memory may not have that correct...regardless it was a very inexpensive lunch.It's a small place and I'm guessing it's the owner that is there serving/cooking etc.  He is very pleasant and helpful and there is not a long wait.  I am definitely going back and I suggest if you have the opportunity, to give them a try.

<review# 275,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2014,2/17/2014,5,10,,6,3>I had a great experience at 3D Miracles. I purchased the basic package and first visited at around 20 weeks, mainly for the gender determination. It was a few days after my 20 weeks ultrasound at the hospital, and naturally it was a completely different experience! At the hospital you are only allowed one support person, it was very busy and we had to use a room with only one monitor so I had to crane my neck to try and see my baby as the sonographer worked. The setup at 3D miracles was much, much more comfortable for myself and for my family, who were able to watch ultrasound along with me on a big screen tv while seated comfortably on plush couches. During my first appointment, The gender determination went off without a hitch and left us without a single doubt that we were having a baby boy. As much as you hear stories about people finding out the gender of their baby only to be surprised at the birth that it was a mistake, there was NO mistaking what we saw. Throughout the ultrasound, my baby was curled up with his hand cradled by his face and so it wasn't possible to see his face at all.  Kathy tried all of her tricks to try and get him to move, but baby boy was too cosy and stubborn. However, because we couldn't get a clear picture of his face, we were invited back for a second appointment free of charge. Despite his position, I still loved the pictures of him curled up and was really happy overall. I waited until I was closer to 27 weeks for the second appointment to give the baby time to grow. This time Kathy was able to get a variety of really neat pictures. She did an amazing job and is a true professional. I was skeptical about 3D ultrasounds in general and was actually given the package as a gift, but looking back I am really pleased and glad that I went. Having a glimpse at my baby's face was one of my absolute favorite moments during my pregnancy.

If you've never had it before, it's goat (or sheep, depending) cheese that is amazing. They serve it as an appetizer but I could just as easily have two of it for my main.But as for the rest of their menu: it's rock-solid. How many restaurants can you say that you've been to and you've never been once disappointed? That's been my Estia experience. (Or, if I ever was disappointed, it's been blanked out by delicious food.)I've gone with groups and with just one or two friends and each time service has been great. I haven't tried their brunch but it's a little less Greek and more North American.
<review# 277,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2014,2/15/2014,9,33,,4,2>I work next door in the CIBC building and this place is just TOO easy for me to run down and grab a snack or a lunch and head back to my desk. I am usually gone less than 5 minutes. Which means I frequent this place more often than I should admit to.My fave is the cheese biscuit. Seriously. It's huge. And amazing. And you can tell it's fresh and homemade because every day it's a different size and a different shape but still full of goodness.
<review# 278,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2014,2/14/2014,2,14,,4,3>I had a fantastic experience here. The staff were friendly, knowledgeable and willing to discuss the menu, and despite it being busy with people always waiting for tables, I never felt rushed. The menu is to the point but with good variety. We did apps, mains and dessert and everything was great. There were 5 of us and everyone liked everything they had. Yes, seriously. I also had a great cocktail - a kimchi ceasar, I recommend. I literally have not a bad thing to say about this place - other than you may have to wait a few minutes to get a table!Will return, no question.
<review# 279,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/2/2014,2/13/2014,27,128,,6,4>One word: COOL!!!!! This store is like a nerds paradise. I love the combo of vintage products and new game oriented trinkets and fun toys. The selection is good and love that they have so many unique products to offer. The store itself has a lot of cool features too. The painted ceiling tiles like old game titles and old NES consoles painted line the walls. There's a lot to look at and a lot to squee about too. :)

<review# 281,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/3/2014,2/11/2014,0,9,,3,2>So happy they came out to Hammonds Plains from Millcove Plaza. They have brought some of the best tasting pizza around, the crust is traditional, and can be cornmeal dusted if requested, sauce is key, and they nailed it. Better than the generic pizza places around here. The other guys should be taking notes... I won't drop any names.They have specials daily and the staff are real down to earth people! Happy to provide them business. I might just call them right now... :)
<review# 282,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2014,2/10/2014,2,3,,3,2>I lost the only set of key's I had to my 2008 Chev Cobalt Lt on Wednesday of last week in the snow. After 3 days of digging I still could not find them. So, I called MacPhee Chev where I bought the car and was quoted upwards of $450-500 plus taxes for one set (one key cut and programmed, a fob programmed) and I had to have it towed to them at my own cost. They broke it down for me and it worked out to $100 for the key, $200 (2 hours of work) to program it and $150 for the key fob and an hour and a half to 2 hours to program it ($150-200).My father called O'Regans and was quoted about $207 (for 1 key cut and programmed and one key fob programmed) plus taxes and I had to have the car towed to them and had to make an appointment. So I made one for 10:30 am.After a disastrous towing ordeal by Ace Towing the car finally got there 4 hours after my scheduled appointment at 10:30 am. I called O'Regans after waiting an hour and a half for the tow (30 min before my appointment) and was told not to worry about it they would do it when it got there, even though I was originally told I need an appointment. They were great about it. They took less then an hour to do the whole thing, I ended up with 2 keys (they came back and told me they had to do 2 keys to program it) and one fob all programmed and paid only $284 for it in total including taxes. I was really really impressed and will definitely take my car there in the future!
<review# 283,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2014,2/9/2014,5,1,,9,5>Definitely the best cookies and brownies in town! You have to try the Double Trouble: two cookies of your choice with icing sandwiched between them, you can also replace the icing with any ice cream flavor!Even better than all of that are the crepes, authentic European-style crepes, better than any crepes you've ever tasted before! There are breakfast crepes and savory crepes, then you finish off with any of the sweet crepes that can include anything you like, like Nutella, bananas, strawberries, and more! Or you can go wild and add all of that together...And if that wasn't enough for you, there is also a wide selection of frappes and smoothies, as well as the classic selections of hot chocolate, espresso and a variety of luxurious teas!

<review# 285,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/7/2013,2/6/2014,27,8,,4,3>This funky cafe is my new favourite sport to grab coffee in the city.  It is a place that looks more expensive than it is (their prices are on par with Starbucks or Second Cup) and has a bright and sleek atmosphere that is different that any other caffeine hub in Halifax.I strongly suggest taking an afternoon with a friend and sitting down in this cafe to really take it in. The decor is well coordinated and extremely eye catching. Customers can choose from a variety of areas to sit and sip their coffee (I'm a fan of the retro coaches by the fireplace). The space is also well kept and always feels sleek and clean.If you are in rush to get coffee to go - skip this place. The service is not the most prompt, but that is only because the staff really put a good thorough effort into whatever coffee drink they are making you. Speaking of which - the flavours of lattes here are so mouth watering! During Easter they had a minni egg latte...enough said?For gelato lovers - they have a wide selection of flavours to choose from and will even offer free samples of different flavours as well.One thing I love about Humani-T Cafe is their online presence. I follow them on twitter and if i ever mention I am there, they will always take the time to retweet or reply. This is a great way to win new customers and make current customers more loyal!Details matter! This is the perfect spot to catch up with a friend or ever go on date. You will not be disappointed!
<review# 286,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2013,2/5/2014,35,24,,5,3>This is a traditional neighbourhood pizza shop from like 15 years ago. They use an old style oven not a conveyor belt fed oven, the large flat pepperoni that goes under the cheese and the fatty white mozzarella and from someone that claims to hate that style of pizza, when you get it from Peters it tastes amazing. Something about the way it comes together with the rich sauce and soft crust just makes this place amazing.

The waiting room is relaxing and there is plenty of merchandise to browse through. I had a deluxe pedicure and a half hour massage. My only complaint was that I should have gotten the hour massage!My second visit was last week and I came in for the same - the deluxe pedicure, and this time the hour long massage. The staff has changed since my first visit. The deluxe pedicure is amazing, and they use products (like their Zoya nail polish) that is all eco-friendly. Ellen did an awesome job, she was so personable and I left feeling like I wanted to hang out with her! My feet felt so soft and the nail polish is beautiful. For the massage they have some nice essential oils and a relaxing atmosphere.I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else for an enjoyable spa experience!

Like LOTS.  Upstairs is an art gallery which we didn't have time to visit.  There aren't a lot of tables, but it reminds me of what cafes used to be like when I was younger; small, crowded, friendly, homey, the exact opposite of Tim's and Second Cup.  Humani-T has a great atmosphere.  And the guy who served us was really cute.  Always a bonus.  ;-)
<review# 292,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/22/2014,1/30/2014,1,16,,4,1>After my Physio, my wife and I decided to go to the Tea room, and we were not disappointed, or server was awesome, and the Bacon  Cheeseburger platter I had ( about 7-8$) and my wife chose the veggie burger (about the same price), heaps of I believe double fried fries, and a pot of tea between us, it came to about 21-22$. The atmosphere is a funky-retro greasy spoon, I love that feel, I do wish there was  the counter and stools like in one of the old photos.Back to the food, my Burger was very nice, juicy, and not alot of salt or pepper, very fresh, it allows the bacon ( BACON! CRISPY!.. err sorry) and grease from the meat to flavour it, wonderful. My wife's burger, as with most veggie burger IMO was dry, BUT that is my opinion, my wife enjoyed it. The tea was a nice touch, and love the pot it came in. :) Definitely a return with my whole family will be soon. Loved it!
<review# 293,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2014,1/29/2014,18,60,,8,4>I went here last night with my bestie for a "catch up" date. I really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was lovely. Many levels (much like the Old Triangle). Each level had open seating, or private booths - what ever your heart desired. The decor is modern mixed with the antique (my favorite) Most importantly, the food was delicious. My bestie has eaten here three times and is yet to be disappointed. We started with the deep fried cheese curds. They were delicious, deep fried enough that the cheese was warm, but still had its squeaky quality. It was served with a chili lime dip that was yummy as well. I had the steak sandwich. It was open faced, served on focaccia, with lots of steak and caramelized onions. It also had a tarragon aioli which was delicious. The only thing that was lacking was that my fries were a little cold. They seemed hand cut, but were just meh - nothing special. Oh, and I should add that everything was reasonably priced. I would say most meals are between 10-15$ (very reasonable for the city!) The other thing I should mention is the wonderful service. Our waiter was pleasant, offering any advise that we wanted. Had refills served to us before we even realized our drinks were low. Attentive, but not over bearing. A gem! And, a wonderful service is that they offer to call you a cab at the end of the night if you need it. Good job! ( I cannot remember the waiters name, but he had medium length hair that was pulled back into a ponytail)Keep it up Auction House and you'll have a "regular" out of me.
<review# 294,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2014,1/28/2014,0,1,,6,3>Excellent!! We dropped in for an early dinner before the Symphony on Jan 17, 2014, our first experience with this cuisine.  We ordered the Meze platter which gave us a wide variety of flavors and dishes, It was all excellent.  Highly recommend
<review# 295,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/19/2014,1/27/2014,9,42,,11,5>I have been here twice and on both occasions I had the Mondo Burrito. You choose what type of  tortilla you would like ( white, wheat, spinach, sundried tomato) You can choose from a variety of different meats ( I like the chicken) They also have choice of three different beans(pinto, refried and black) To top it off they have an assortment of fresh veg, sauces, salsas, sour cream, guac and probably some other things that I am forgetting.Now that the Cantina Mexicana is closed, this will be my neighborhood go to when a burrito craving hits!
<review# 296,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/19/2014,1/26/2014,1,1,,6,1>Championship Sunday in football is a big day. The lineup was long before the doors were even open. After being seated at one table expecting more, we asked our server if we could move the tables to allow us to sit together. She reluctantly agreed to let us do so. There was lots of cold beer on tap for the football game, our server was quick getting our orders to us and our order of wings came out of the kitchen soon after. The wings are amazing, pricey, but delicious.It appeared that some of the kinks the HFX sports bar had in their opening week are starting to iron themselves out. It was very busy and we had no issue with getting drinks or food all afternoon. Will definitely be back for the next big game.
<review# 297,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/13/2014,1/25/2014,4,41,4,4,3>HIPSTERS GATHER, FROLIC AND UNITE.baha, sorry.. but hipster is basically the word that sums this place up; from the menu written on a chalkboard, to the jam jar container for your water, to being attached to a secluded building in the middle of downtown dartmouth... it's the heart and soul of hipsters. though it sounds as though i'm making fun of the place, i'm truly not.  Because frankly, as i'm writing this review, i'm starting to notice that perhaps i'm a hipster too....I love the atmosphere in this cafe. I love how it's LOCAL with FRESH INGREDIENTS in an ocean of chains. Which it seems that's all Dartmouth offers. I'm not a coffee person but the baked goods are melt in your mouth, drool down your chin delicious. There's cookies, croissants, muffins, coffee, iced drinks...the service is superb, calm, relaxed but fast & efficient with big windows that pour in all the daylight.the only thing that's a downside is the parking. There is none. Either bring your bicycle and strap in to a pole or go on a quest in the side streets for parking!
<review# 298,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,1/24/2014,20,178,,7,4>Stopped in on Sunday afternoon for a treat. The shopkeeper was kind and told us about the different cakes. I got the light cheesecake; the texture was like eating a cloud and the cake had a delicate flavor. Impeccable attention to detail, looking forward to visiting again soon.
<review# 299,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2011,1/23/2014,4,15,,6,2>I found Landon online after to moving to Redlands.  He arrived on time, was friendly, and did a very thorough job tuning my very out-of-tune upright piano.  The price was amazing and he spent around three hours getting it just right.  He also told me to call if any notes slip out of tune in the near future. Professional and knowledgeable.   A+ service.
<review# 300,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2014,1/22/2014,9,13,,7,4>I really don't have enough good things to say about the World Tea House & I highly recommend it to everyone I know! The owner, Phil, is very passionate about tea & his enthusiasm is contagious! Every time I go there I receive amazing service & leave talking about how I need to go there more!The pricing on tins of tea might seem expensive in comparison to purchasing a box of tea at the grocery store but it's so worth it, there is no comparison! These tea blends are fair trade & almost all organic not to mention fantastic & oh so special!I can't decide if I enjoy getting a tea to go & exploring the downtown or sharing a pot of tea with a friend right in the cozy shop where I instantly feel relaxed & never rushed! And don't get me started on some of the amazing concoctions that they make in shop like the egg nog tea latte, soo delish!
<review# 301,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2014,1/21/2014,2,9,2,5,3>Let's clarify something first.  We're not talking about Lemon or Pumpkin pie here. We're talking about delicious, filling, meat pies-as-a-meal... like my favorite, the free range chicken pie. The back-story here is that Corrinne (the pie lady) is of Acadian descent, and these are traditional recipes with a French heritage. If that already sounds tasty - you're right it is. Can't go wrong. Shove a couple in your freezer for an easy and delicious, ready meal.
<review# 302,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2014,1/20/2014,5,93,,2,1>I have eaten here at least three time as the place is not in my hood. All I can say is, this is NOT your typical pizza place. If you want 2 large for $11.99 on a Thursday to feed the crew, go elsewhere. The pie is a taste fest! Authentic, fresh tasting perfection. Well worth any drive to get here. Mouth is watering now...:-) Recommended for sure.
<review# 303,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2014,1/19/2014,7,14,,4,2>An absolutely delightful little shop with an absolutely delightful little owner that you absolutely should check out. It's local and it's a bookshop, so it's a built-in-5-stars for me.It's small, but they've got a great selection and it's not congested. (They often put boxes of $1 books on the sidewalks when it's nice out, which helps.) There's a lot of science/speculative fiction, but there's a decent selection of contemporary fiction and classics as well. Not a whole lot of 2013-14 titles, but some fairly recent stuff and lots of old favourites. Nothing like the smell of a well-worn book. Yum!The price-point is where it's at: if you're a reader who devours books like I am, spending $20-30 for each new book is nearly impossible. And I refuse to go the way of the e-book. Enter Orphan Books AKA saver of my pocket book.
<review# 304,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2013,1/18/2014,22,150,,5,3>I wanted to spend some time on the waterfront on Canada Day just so I could try this place out. The day turned out to be crappy weather but we went anyway. The rain stopped as we arrived so all was good. Not too many around so no line-up.I was able to head right to the window and order. With only five sandwiches on the menu you 'd think it would be easy to pick something but it's not, they all sound so delicious. Finally having to choose something I selected the Simply Dill-iscious; peameal bacon, bacon strips, old Canadian cheddar, dill pickles, crunchy dill pickle chips and garlic mayo on a Kaiser .Listened to the staff shout out piggy puns, I didn't have to wait too long for my order to be ready. Biting into the sandwich I found a nice, unique combination of flavours in every bite. I like the crunch added by the dill pickle chips. Nice fresh bun and ingredients make for a tasty, hearty sandwich.At $9 for a sandwich & beverage, it's not something I'd be having everyday but I do plan on trying every sandwhich on the menu.... at some point.
<review# 305,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2013,1/17/2014,40,216,3,9,4>Being born and bred in small town Nova Scotia, it will come as no surprise to anyone that I had no exposure to Chinese baking until I actually traveled to China several years ago, and although there are many reasons to go back there, the pastries there are no longer one of those, with Kee Heong here.I'm no connoisseur, but the selection here is decent and the prices are great, with most items in the $2 range, give or take a bit on either side, depending on the item.I sampled a few different things - the egg custard tart, sweet bread, pork turnover and red bean turnover, all pretty standard fare .The egg custard tart had nice flaky layers and a smooth, slightly sweet custard filling that was pleasing without being in your face like many desserts these days.The sweet bread, true to its name, was just a bit sweet, with a texture similar to your regular dinner rolls, with some additional sweetness from a thin layer of egg custard inside, and a little pop of flavour from the sesame seeds on top.The pork turnover was a small, triangular pastry filled with tender pork, fried onions and a mild sauce. Crisp and flaky, it was a good one. Rounding out my container 'o' carbs was the red bean turnover, another tri-tipped pastry, but with a slightly tighter seal on it than the pork, which I can only posit was to contain the red bean paste inside. I've always been fairly neutral in my opinion of red bean paste; I'm not drawn to it, but I won't turn my nose up at it. This entry with a slight tang and smooth texture, didn't convert me, but nor did it sour me on it either. Steady as she goes, red bean paste, steady as she goes. Again, sesame seeds added a little more Asian-esque flavour.Kee Heong is a great addition to the food culture of Halifax, and with a solid line up of baked goods and dim sum I have yet to try, I hope they can make a go of it.
<review# 306,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/20/2013,1/16/2014,29,84,,9,2>Delicious, tasty, they know what they're doing! Worth investigating, with great atmosphere.Had a grand time chatting with the bartender, who really knows his stuff. He used to work at the Drawing Room on the third floor of the Henry House. The food is fairly unique and all very locally sourced and fresh. Try the Big Boss cocktail, we tried all the house cocktails between a couple of us and that was the winner. I also requested something with citrus and gin, a little sweet, and got a lovely custom drink I'd love to recreate at home!The staff were super friendly, and I may change this to 5 stars in the future, but when we got there with a group of 4 we were told there was a wait for a table (they only seat 35 or so including 12 at the bar) so we got space at the bar and waited and ordered some things. When a table opened up we weren't shown to it, though I thought we would get one eventually. It was opening night so service was likely still getting ironed out, not a big deal. This place has loads of personality!
<review# 307,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2013,1/15/2014,70,95,,6,5>You know you've found "the one" when you're still a regular over a year later. 15 months I've been sitting down in Rob's red barber chair and 15 months I've walked out looking sharp! The wait might be a little longer. That's what happens when word gets out. But the coffee (or beer) is good. The conversations are excellent and everyone knows Rob is worth the wait.Some changes since opening:* He expanded. 2 chairs. Still first come first serve but the space is bigger so more seating as you peruse the magazines and listen to his awesome selection of music.* He's no longer a cash only operation. Cards are accepted with handling fee (so leave a bigger tip for this guy!)He's seriously the best barber in all of Halifax! Go and find out for yourself.
<review# 308,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,1/14/2014,27,83,,8,3>If you're looking for your typical North American customized Chinese fix, then this is NOT your place. I suggest that you go to the ones you find in the busy side streets like Spring Garden Rd, Quinpool or near the waterfront. This place on the other hand serves authentic Chinese food. I know and I've tasted it myself. I read some reviews saying that food is bland, to them I say, its easy to put extra salt and call that food but finely crafted Chinese food takes acquired taste buds and surely not many people have that acquired taste. What amazes me about this place is that the cook is passionate about his cooking and changes his dishes from time to time. Have a little chat with the guy and his staff and you find out that he sources his ingredients from many places e.g. Farmers Market too. Little did I know that he went to visit my home country Malaysia 2 years ago and have incorporated some of the techniques from there. So yes, I'll come back to this place anytime whenever I miss home.
<review# 309,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/3/2013,1/13/2014,59,150,1,3,3>All it takes is somebody I'm with to order something I would never consider to get me hooked - I'm too easy!Burrito bowls, where have you been my entire life? Take a burrito, remove the pita and pile all of it's toppings on top of a bowl of rice - genius!They are the same price as the burrito, but I feel like you get more bang for your buck - you just have to eat the burrito bowl with a fork instead of your hands... unless you're in the comfort of your own home, then have at it!Get the burrito sauce - it brings  it up a notch from the regular sour cream!
<review# 310,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/30/2013,1/12/2014,1,11,,3,2>Alright I'm talking to the veggie burger enthusiasts here. This was taaaasty. As most of you know, veggie burgers are typically hit or miss. I ordered their veggie and bean burger which is actually wrapped as a springroll pastry as the patty, with their mango chutney, pickled onions, and a sweet chili sauce. the "patty" was delicious, maybe a little mushy but there was crunch in the shell which made up for it. My burger was a little too sweet, but that was partly my choice. My partner had the Moner Mozza Crunch Burger and couldn't stop raving about it. Here's some reasons why I'll go back to Cheese Curds: You get to pick your toppings, which is not something you're always granted in gourmet burger joints. Their burgers/combos are decently priced. The interior is clean and the decor is funky. They had the nicest staff I've seen in a long time. They were so pleasant and helpful! This was at the Burnside location.  They added guacamole to my poutine without hesistation and no charge! The burger pager is a fun little touch to tell you when your burgers ready. They lose the last star for me because I ordered the vegetarian poutine and it was just okay, although the guac helped! This is a veggie burger I'll definitely order again. I also want to try their breakfast. Good job Cheese Curds.
<review# 311,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/30/2013,1/11/2014,12,78,,4,1>I had always walked by this place when it had first opened, not really thinking much of it. But I came her one day about a month back and I'm in love. It's such a lovely hidden gem in Downtown Dartmouth. Hidden in the corner in the front King Wharf's building, it sits, full of caffeinated love. Yum!The interior is quite nice, it's relaxing, the staff is friendly also, which, when all combined creates a very nice respectable place to enjoy a coffee, tea or whatever it is your taste buds desire. There is even a somewhat hidden couch area, unless you go to the bathroom or are curious about the place, you'll probably miss it.Give this place a try for you coffee cravings, and bring a friend, or a laptop/book and sit for awhile. Enjoy!
<review# 312,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/30/2013,1/10/2014,0,3,,6,1>Definitely the best sushi in Halifax. My husband & I have been here over a dozen times since they opened and are always impressed with the food and service. Staff are so welcoming & friendly! My husband has tried a lot of different things & has loved them all. I always stick to my favorite - green dragon roll - wrapped in avocado with tempura shrimp - dipped in spicy sauce, it is heaven in your mouth!! :) the gyoza(dumplings) and tempura veggies are really good as well.
<review# 313,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2013,1/9/2014,17,5,,3,4>Everything seems to work well here - the food, the service, the acoustics, the bar, the location... it's such a pleasure to bring friends, and even with a full room, be able to have a lively conversation with everyone hearing each other.  It must be the high, rough-finished wood ceilings.  Maybe the many small speakers.  Or the choice of music?  I don't really know, but the warm sound of so many people enjoying each others' company makes everything taste so much better, don't you think?As someone else mentioned, meat-free selections are scarce on the menu (posted very helpfully on their website), but the kitchen rolls nicely with a request for vegetarian options.  The couscous is yummy, and ask for sides like the cauliflower and lentils, but make sure they hold back the bacon from the brussel sprouts.Reserve ahead if you can (they are a hit, after all), but if you're more spur of the moment,  the high tables near the front are good for 2 or 3, a little tight for 4 with plates.  Don't be afraid of the bar  - it's warm and friendly, and works nicely for a casual dinner for 2, as well as a happy hour social local.  I've heard the kitchen bar at the back is a great place to feel connected to the heart of the action, but haven't had the chance.  Also on my wish list - there is a private second floor seating area overlooking the kitchen, looks perfect for about a dozen people.A little tip?  Ask if there is a bartender's special cocktail when you're there.  Lovely surprises so far have included an espresso martini (yum!), an old-fashioned (and a chance to sample three different types of bitters - who knew?), and homemade eggnog.  You're in good hands.
<review# 314,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/19/2013,1/8/2014,26,201,,5,4>loved loved loved.Although only a small space with bfast/lunch options. This place should not be over looked. It's a wonderful cafe and has a super unique juice bar was great options for a healthy pick me up. The dessert case is divine. All house made and all creative. The avocado chocolate mouse is unbelievable! My favorite though, the CLT. With some sort of fried large strips I coconut in place of bacon. It is amazing. And that is not an overstatement. The house made sauce on the wrap is delicious as well. And the small side salad is always fresh and visually appealing. I can not speak the praise of this wrap enough. The loaded potato nachos are also delish. With some house made sauce I coat them in, it makes for a tasty meal. With the special and soup always changing, the wild leek offers a sure fire breakfast lunch spot that will please all of us veggie and vegans. But the best part? The service! The owner is super nice and accommodating. She makes you feel at home. And she's a Wonder Woman- baking, cooking, serving, etc. She does it all at once! Kudos!
<review# 315,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/19/2013,1/7/2014,20,71,,9,3>This place just opened and we went to check it out. They really went all out with the interior decor - it's beautiful - really nice wooden floors, details on the ceiling, thick beams, nice wooden bar, its super comfortable and light and airy but still really classy. I also like the idea of 'social dining'. Halifax needed a place like this and I'm happy we got it. We only tried out a few things off the menu and they were good. My only suggestion is that I wish they had more cider selection - NS makes a lot of ciders and it would nice to see a few of them on the menu.
<review# 316,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2014,1/6/2014,4,11,,3,2>The Coastal is as much an experience as it is a great meal. Just get there early if you don't like feeling like you're part of a political movement or eating on a crowded subway. Unquestionably the best breakfast in Halifax, tell them Elvis sent you for a dish you won't find anywhere else. But for me, it's the poached eggs and smoked ham. Also has great dishes for vegetarians and lots of things smothered in cheese that my doctor won't let me have.  But for those of you under 30 - enjoy!
<review# 317,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2013,1/5/2014,3,35,,5,3>Hand made and baked pizza right before your eyes by the endearing female owner, they use the freshest produce and materials for the pizza, have great prices and deals on their slices/pizzas and are always wonderful stories and chats when waiting patiently.One story I've heard from the owners was about a hurricane/snowstorm [not sure which one] hit all the power went out but during the outage they made pizzas and sold them for half price or give extra to help the surrounding area out.All in all, it may look like a small shop and not much parking but their pizza is fantastic with pizza sauce that has a bit of sweetness in it's spices
<review# 318,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2013,1/4/2014,18,151,,11,2>My partner and I waited far too long to try this fantastic AYCE sushi restaurant. As citizens of Dartmouth, we are pretty limited in our selection of sushi (especially since Hamachi House closed its Portland Street location). Normally we patronize Happy Sushi in Lacewood, but I think it's safe to say that Genji will become our new go-to for rolls, tempura, and other delicious choices.Pros:- Simple, attractive decor and lots of natural light;- Plenty of well-spaced seating;- A great variety of items to choose from, especially at dinner time;- Orders come quickly (with the exception of the BBQ beef rolls, which naturally take time to cook and create - they are well worth the wait!); and- Everything tastes great, is presently in an attractive manner, and is generously proportioned! We especially enjoyed the Black Dragon Roll, Fire Dragon Roll, Crystal Roll, and tempura pumpkin.- Service is fairly quick and the servers tell you which items they have just brought to the table (very helpful).Cons:- The Mango Dragon Roll, although good, is not as good as that offered by Happy Sushi.Needless to say, we will be returning to Genji on a regular basis.
<review# 319,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2013,12/29/2013,27,148,4,8,4>Impeccably clean and great service!  They were able to accommodate me right away as a walk-in one day and I received an awesome shellac application.  It has stood up better than any other shellac I've had done in Halifax and was also super reasonably priced ($23).  When I had a tiny chip in the polish of one nail they touched it up for free!  Definitely coming back here and would definitely recommend it.
<review# 320,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/22/2013,12/28/2013,13,17,,2,1>After about 4 months in Halifax, we've found our favorite bar. Tom's is intimate, quirky, and friendly. We were pulled in by the great 90's alternative music mix and stayed for a game of "Sorry!" Most of the booths are stocked with classic board games. Such fun! On a second trip, we sat at the bar and chatted with the friendly and informative bartenders, enjoyed some spirits, and a romantically cool night out. Next time- we hit the menu. They've got some intriguing options.
<review# 321,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/14/2013,12/27/2013,8,63,,2,1>After some disappointing experiences at the Silver Dragon recently, I decided to go back to the Great Wall as I recalled some fond memories of the place from previous work parties and a particularly memorable first date several years ago.The establishment itself is nothing too memorable, but the food is the main reason the patrons continue to vote Great Wall a winner in the Coast's Best Food category.  On this day, I joined a work colleague of mine to try one of their combination plates and I was not to be disappointed.We were smart in getting there just before noon as the place fills up quickly over the lunch hour.  I decided to go with combination plate #6 (egg roll, rice, sweet and sour chicken, and chicken guy ding) while my co-worker had combination plate #4 (egg roll, rice, sweet and sour chicken, and vegetable chow mein).  The service was good and we did not have to wait too long; in part because of our decision to arrive early.  I was impressed by the portions we received and the meal was outstanding with the slight exception of the egg roll which was not all-meat, but I knew that coming in, so it was no big deal.  My co-worker was happy with his meal as well and we both agreed that we needed to come back again in the near future to try some different delicacies.While I won't go on the record in saying that The Great Wall will be my #1 Chinese food spot from now on, it has left me with a lot to think about for the future.
<review# 322,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2012,12/26/2013,14,5,5,3,3>I dream of "firecracker dream"! It is an inside out roll with avocado, cucumber, tempura bits and a little spicy mayo. Their grilled vegetable maki, dynamite maki, the vegetable dragon roll, Philadelphia roll,the sweet potato.....*I drool as I type this........Whenever we have a deep, dark craving for sushi, this is the place we visit. Their rolls have a great balance of softness and crunch and each plateful arrives with artistic precision. When you arrive you are cheerfully greeted by the Itamae's and seated quickly. For those people who enjoy a late night snack, I recommend Tsunami hour(starts at 9:30 on weekdays),  you can get many apps and regular maki's for a great price .The staff are always polite and ready to help, I have not had bad service ever! Great Job guys :-)Now to balance the yin and yang. I shall be brutally honest about the wait time for the food. Some nights the food gets a seat on the concord to our table but there are times where we have waited a while for our food to arrive. The music playing in the background can also be up for review, maybe they should do a check of what other popular spots in town are playing to keep the ambiance up. These maybe the only little problem, but nevertheless, we will stay loyal to you SNR!I highly recommend sushi nami royale on dresden rowe and happy to say, guilty of dining there last night :-D
<review# 323,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2013,12/25/2013,14,2,3,5,2>It was a dreary Saturday afternoon, and after a morning full of moving heavy furniture, I was HUNGRY! That is an understatement.... I was HANGRY.... The crossroads where hunger fuels a case of the grumps. I needed some thing delicious and filling... And something that would fuel me up for an afternoon of finishing up on moving.And then I met Habeneros and it was love at first bite. I went with the chicken burrito on the sundried tomato wrap. Oh My! The super friendly staff recommended the lime cilantro sauce and helped pack it full of enough fresh veggies that I was surprised she was able to close it without a vice grip. It was the perfect sized meal and a great energizer (it didn't leave me feeling drained like many fast food options do).Highly recommended, espcially given that it was so quick AND I got the burrito and a drink for $10!

<review# 325,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/5/2013,12/23/2013,13,44,,14,4>Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love the premise behind this place. I've loved board games for a while now, and it's a passion that only increases with my ever growing collection. They're pretty darn expensive, though. Now, however, there is a lovely place where you can pay a small fee and choose from a very expansion library of games for you and your friends to enjoy! The Board Room is a nice space on Barrington, with lots of light and ample seating for groups of people. We were lucky enough to grab the large leather sofas, but the regular chairs looked plenty comfy as well. The entrance fee is $5, which is added on to the bill for any food and drink you order. This fee allows you use of any of their 500 (REALLY!) games they have on offer, which range from old favourites like Scrabble and Monopoly, to some very interesting options you might never have heard of, and some that are even in other languages. They helpfully employ "Gamemasters", who stroll around the cafe offering assistance and tips on games you've never played before, and chatting in general with the patrons. I found all of the staff to be incredibly friendly, and they were a big help in explaining of the games we chose. While they offer paninis and freshly made coffee and espresso beverages, we stuck to pop and a bowl of candy (aw yes), being late night visitors. They will also be obtaining a liquor license sometime soon, so there will be some more boozy beverage options on the menu. Also offered is a retail section when you first enter the store, which has quite a lot to offer! They are also the only store in Atlantic Canada (as far as I understand) to sell Cards Against Humanity, and they also offer it to play; I highly recommend, it's a fantastic game.All in all it's a really great place, and one I can't wait to visit again. It's something our city definitely needed; reasonably priced entertainment that can appeal to a diverse crowd. Next time I'll have to grab something to eat, too.

That happens to me with good meals and movies - I know I struck gold whenever I think/dream about my meal/movie days after.I ordered the 7 oz tenderloin with a side of spicy fries.I can't even believe this is my first time eating here - I feel like I've wasted so much time and money on so many other sub-par restaurants and meals. It saddens me. :(But now that I've found this treasure trove I can't wait to go back again, and again, and again. Seriously though - I can't believe how tasty and perfectly cooked my steak was. And it was much cheaper than the equivalent at The Keg (which I also really really love). The 7 oz tenderloin is $16 at Mic Mac, at the Keg it's $32 - legit, I just looked it up.Either way, it's a great restaurant with amazing food and unbelievable prices. I can't wait to go back!
<review# 328,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/7/2013,12/16/2013,0,2,,2,3>I have been going to Ace since it has opened and Gus' Pub even longer! As far as quick, cheap, and tasty eats go in Halifax it's a small group and Ace is at the top of the list. While all they have is burgers, that is ok, because they sure are good at it! They have a small but full menu and the Deluxe is always my go-to. They switch out menu items keeping things fresh but also keep the classics (like the classic!). I would highly recommend it for anyone, sometimes the wait can be brutal around 5 or 6 when folks get out of work, but it is usually worth it. Don't be discouraged if they hang up when making a pick up call because they will likely answer in 15 minutesTL:DR, great neighborhood eats place. The fries are the best in town hands down.It is cheap and delicious and that is so,SO hard to find around HFX.Enjoy!!
<review# 329,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2013,12/15/2013,25,117,1,5,4>How have I not written a review for this place yet?! Where do I start? The Sweet Hereafter may have the best cheesecake in the world. My husband and I will venture down to Quinpool for a cozy date night in their cute dinning area or we'll grab a whole cake for a special occasion with the family. They have tons of flavours and if you want something that's not on their list, just ask and they'll attempt it. Everything is always delicious and fresh! The white chocolate raspberry is AMAZING!They are a little on the pricey side -$25 for 2 prices of cake, tea, and coffee - but it's a great occasional date night. And really, cheesecake should be an occasional thug anyways!
<review# 330,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/9/2013,12/14/2013,6,4,,5,3>I wanted to take a minute to write about my experience au pairing in Spain with the help of Scotia Personnel.I left for Madrid at the end of August in 2010, after having decided on Spain and au pairing after speaking with the staff at Scotia Personnel. I was really ecstatic to have found an economically savvy way to live extensively abroad.The first months in Spain were incredibly rewarding and challenging at time, as is the case with anything new. I took language classes, explored the city and made many friends (many au pairs, as nearly all au pairs are eager to meet up and as such, getting to know people is not a problem).In November, I decided to switch to another au pair family as I was interested in au pairing with a different age range. I continue to stay in contact with my second family. The mother regularly emails me photos of the girls and we exchange Christmas gifts by mail, she also offered to pay for my flight back to Spain should I ever want to au pair for the family again!Around the same time, I met Alberto, who just so happens to be my husband as of last November!Had I not au paired in Spain, my life today would be totally different, having never met many of my very close friends, new families or husband. Nor would I be able to speak the high level of Spanish I do. As a result of my time in Spain, I have also been able to expand my resume as a child care professional, tutor and ESL teacher.Obviously, I recommend au pairing with Scotia Personnel to anyone who is looking to travel
<review# 331,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/2/2013,12/13/2013,34,91,,9,2>I had been waiting for the new beer bar in town to open for sometime, especially after meeting the owners at an event earlier in the fall. A trip with friends to Stillwell Beer Bar on Barrington Street in Halifax happened during a Saturday afternoon. We arrived shortly after they opened at four o'clock and it was already starting to fill up. On entry you see a low key bar with tables, chairs, light bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and of course the bar. As I explored a little further there was shelves in the corner with a bunch of vinyl records, a collection of "empties" and downstairs there are some old school video games and even some old city bus seats. I liked the decor, it made me feel at home.The bar takes up the bulk of one of the walls and behind it is twelve taps of primarily Maritime craft beer with an odd wildcard thrown in. The wall containing the taps is used like a chalkboard with each tap labelled with all its information and wiped and the next one added. One thing Stillwell is arrange the taps number one to twelve with the beers going for light to dark.The snack fare was varied and different from the usual pub grub, the dozen items varied widely and is changed often they tell me. I got the oysters and fries with "atari" sauce and both were absolutely delicious.The staff and owners were very friendly and attentive and kept us satisfied. My first experience there was extremely positive and I will be back again soon.
<review# 332,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2013,12/12/2013,9,76,2,4,1>How long have I lived in Halifax???? Forever!! And I cannot believe in all my 34 years I have never visited Salty's up until a few weeks ago!We were able to make reservations on a Sunday night for the dining area upstairs. Our table had a spectacular view of the harbour which made the experience even that much more enjoyable Our server was diligent and friendly, made recommendations at request. I think all 3 of us ordered based on bus recommendations & we were all very pleased with our dishes.I ordered the Lobster Fettuccine. I never ever order lobster dishes. However given the fact that were we at a place that specializes in seafood, I figured.... Go big or go home!! I was not disappointed either. The dish was delicious! Portion size was perfect, I was able to eat it all-- which I rarely am able to do at restaurants.I squeezed in room for dessert. Lemon Brûlée.  Again baked to perfection, the crunch was perfect. I found it a bit to lemony, but not to sure I can complain about that as it was called "Lemon Brûlée" hehehe
<review# 333,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/30/2013,12/5/2013,13,1,,2,2>A hidden little family run restaurant I've driven by hundreds of times. Finally decided to stop in for breakfast on a Saturday and was pleasantly surprised. Friendly staff and basically zero wait time plus a really great home style breakfast means I'll definitely be coming back!If you're a Maritimer, you'll dig Jacks.
<review# 334,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2013,12/4/2013,54,227,3,7,2>I like to say that I was the saddest person in Halifax when the downtown Il Mercato closed. It was my favorite spot in the city with so many dishes I adored - and don't even try to suggest I go to Bedford, because, no.But what a relief - I was very impressed with my first visit to La Frasca. The bread basket and garlic butter on the table was lovely (though maybe not if I'd been on a date!), the service was great and though the restaurant was very noisy (Il Mercato always was, too) the atmosphere was fun and trendy. My main course was fantastic - a gnocchi unlike any other I've had. It had plum and cinnamon and browned butter. The only reason this review isn't five stars is because the dish is no longer on the menu. (DEVASTATING.) It's been replaced with a meat gnocchi that I'm not super interested in. My dessert was also fantastic, a caramelized peach tart. One downside is that I didn't find the menu particularly vegetarian friendly. I'm not vegetarian, but I'm not a big meat eater and I think the Il Mercato menu provided more options on that front.
<review# 335,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/22/2013,12/3/2013,13,25,2,4,3>I tried it. I LOVE IT. So a friend recommended this place last week. My friend and I checked out it out today after we went to Fujiyama for Sushi and it was already at capacity. Best thing that could have happened to us!First, let me start with the service. The waitress was a sweetheart and I wish I could have taken the cook/owner home. She was not only so sweet, but she had so much pride in her food and she really just wanted to make sure we had the best of everything. The veggies were getting low when we got there so she made sure to let us know she was going to make some fresh one. Then sent our waitress let us know when they were ready. She was friendly and helpful, telling us what to have with plum sauce and what to have with vinegar. "This is not Chinese food," she said. "We make everything fresh. We make everything from scratch." They even make their hot sauce from scratch, so she told me. So we listened to her suggestions and off we went with our loaded plates. So this is my first time having Filipino food and it was right up my ally, literally. I would describe this as comfort food at its best. Fresh, hearty and flavourful, nothing processed, no additives. There was a noodle dish, a rice dish that were just your garden variety fried rice and noodles but good. There was a chicken dish that was so moist and tender, the chicken just fell off the bone. There was a beef dish with pineapple that was also super tender. There was a curried shrimp with green beans. There was a sweet potato cake that was complemented nicely by the vinegar. We had dumplings and spring rolls which were also really tasty. We went up for seconds but we really shouldn't have. So FULL! My friend capped her meal off with homemade coconut ice cream and mango ice cream. i confess to sneaking a spoonful. It was good.The ambiance of this proverbial hole in the wall is warm and cozy. It might be a little dated but that adds to that feeling that you have discovered a hidden gem that no one else knows about. We tucked ourselves away and a small little table for a good chat and laugh. While we were there a man came in with his friend and some kids to celebrate his birthday. I got the feeling they were regulars. Well, it seems that they were not the only ones that are regulars. This place is so hidden it seems that only the regulars know it exists and strive to keep it that way.  As we were leaving we spent some time taking to the owner. I see from some of the other reviews her name is Luda.  I told her about all the good reviews I read about her. She seemed unaware. She said many of her customers have been coming for years and bringing their friends. It seems this sweet little place survives by word of mouth. So when you are craving a heartier lunch that feels like it was home cooked just because you were coming visit Mabuhay. You will leave with a full belly and a smile.
<review# 336,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/9/2013,12/2/2013,0,11,,6,4>The restaurant itself is quite large with lots of tables. I went for lunch one day and tried the meatloaf, which I was told was the chef's signature dish. It was quite good, and considering if was stuffed with cheese, how can you go wrong! I'll definitely be going back and trying some more of their dishes.
<review# 337,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/23/2013,12/1/2013,1,14,1,4,1>I really enjoy taking my dog here. Dr Bail has always always always given our dog Zoey the best care. I can not even express how good she is with both people and animals.  She is very fair. She is not the type of vet to try to sell you expensive treatments, food, or services. You do not walk out of there gasping for air over the bill.
<review# 338,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/24/2013,11/30/2013,2,23,,6,>My husband & I thought we would go try this place out as it was "all you can eat." Anyway, my husband is not a sushi fan & we weren't familiar with how the menu worked so he sat that time out (he wasn't hungry anyway) & I enjoyed the food. I took what seemed to be familiar to me & I had no complaints!We returned a couple days later & he thought he would giver a go. After all, there is more than just sushi on the menu! My non-sushi-loving husband is now a sushi lover! We always order chicken skewers, calamari, spicy crispy roll, crispy salmon roll, crispy tuna roll, Toronto roll, salmon avocado roll, & California roll. However, I wanted to be adventurous & order the soft shell crab, but they're always out of it. The service varies to being fast & slow. They begin to know who you are if u go a lot and they're always welcoming. I give this sushi joint all 5 stars because they're always simply amazing!
<review# 339,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2013,11/29/2013,27,107,,3,2>Another local craft brewing company in Halifax. I love Garrsion I won't deny it for a second.  They have a good selection of beer types that should satisfy most, an opportunity to purchase samples @ $2/ sm glass, and a spot to sit, drink and be merry.They have growlers (large containers ~2L) that you can have filled for less than buying at the store and lots of swag.Very conveniently located next to the Seaport Market.Also active in the local brew/food community and typicially have an event or two in the mix.
<review# 340,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/16/2013,11/25/2013,13,213,,3,2>I had the club with mashed potato. My wife had the lamb burger with mashed potato both were great and came with cole slaw as well. We also shared an apple pie nice big portion with crumble topping. The coffee is really good better then alot of local coffee shops. This place has new ownership so I suspect they brought in new ideas like local this and that with really high end coffee beans overall the only thing that can make it better? Let me check my schedule becuase the answer is how soon can I return?
<review# 341,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2013,11/24/2013,7,53,,3,2>I think Halifax should be so grateful for a place like this.  It's unique and the concept of tasting the different products is very smart.  I find that people will most always tend to buy something that they have tried; unless it terrible of course.  Service - really the best part of the experience in our case as the young lady who helped us was upbeat, informative, and generally just nice.  Products - one of the best I've seen locally and it might very well be the best.  I can now get Truffle Oil at a decent price without going to the typical places (no names mentioned here) or Italy itself.  The Truffle Salt is really very, very good and beats the last one I did get in Italy, hands down.  They have shaved enough of the truffle into the salt to make you see it each time you grab some.  The other mushroom/fungus oils are incredible - very earthy, which is what I like.  I'm not into all into the Balsamic Oils but this place has them in spades.If you bring back the bottles you get a discount on the refill.  Another great concept not just for saving $$ but for the recycling.
<review# 342,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2013,11/23/2013,20,226,,3,3>Yet another local business I don't visit nearly often enough.  It's been years since I've stepped inside Doull, and while it has changed locations, it's just as I remember it:  wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling BOOKS.You haven't seen books until you enter this store.  The clerk gave me a quick tour when I asked about a certain section, which is a good thing 'cause otherwise I'd still be in there looking for it.  :-D  This store is a mess, but it's a fabulous mess for bookworms like myself.  As someone who is always afraid she's going to miss something great, digging through the piles on the floor for some missed gem is great fun.  As others have mentioned, give yourself plenty of time to peruse the many, many, many sections. They have every subject you can think of, plus some you didn't know existed.  In my experience, staff have always been friendly, super-knowledgeable and helpful.  Their current storefront leaves something to be desired (at this writing they don't yet have a real sign), but it's all about the interior, the chaotic, watch-where-you're-walking, book-lover's-fantasy interior.
<review# 343,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2013,11/22/2013,39,80,2,3,1>I've frequented John David Shoes on an almost seasonal basis over the years. I've always had attentive, quality service from their staff - this is made all the more remarkable because I like to go when they have their seasonal sales and I can get my favorite designer shoes (MizMooz anyone?) for half price or less and the store is almost always busy.You will get especially lucky at sale time if you have small or large feet.My very average 8 and a halfs don't always have the best variety for a sale. But John David does sales well. They mark everything down 50% except their new arrivals and their staff will pull anything from a line they have left in your size if you like. I lucked out today and got two pair of MizMooz for the regular price of one. It was 50% off the original price plus an extra 20% off. That's a smokin' deal for my favorite shoe line.
<review# 344,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2013,11/21/2013,76,115,,4,2>I finally got the chance to try this food truck out on a recent Sunday trip to the farmer's market. Everything on their menu sounded delicious but I opted for the pulled pork burrito with garlic mayo. It was delicious! And super filling, stuffed with tons of pork, rice, veggies and sauce. I honestly find their prices a tad high (my burrito was $8), but considering the freshness of the ingredients and the portion size, the extra cost is pretty much worth it. The staff are also really friendly and they made our food quite quickly (although it wasn't busy at the time we visited). My boyfriend had one of their meat sandwiches and he enjoyed it, although didn't love it. Think I need to try a few more of their menu items before I rave too much, but I enjoyed my first experience enough that I will definitely go back!
<review# 345,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/6/2013,11/20/2013,3,1,,4,2>I am a fan of the Red Stag and their sister property the Lower Deck. My boyfriend and I enjoy these properties enough to be Royalty Rewards members. If you think you'll be back, sign up! They're always sending postcards with free entree deals on them. My favorite meal here is the Digby Scallops. Cooked to perfection and served with rice pilaf and veggies, the portion is just right. The fish and chips are some of, if not the best in Halifax. What sets them apart is the house-made chipotle tartar sauce. Gives it an extra zing that's fantastic. The lobster chowder is also delicious, and I'm a chowder enthusiast. ;) My favorite of favorites, however, are the nachos.  Again, one of, if not the best in the city. Whatever you order, you really can't go wrong at "the Stag." Although it's not really my place, I would like to address the review below about being discriminated against if you have children. This is not the case. The Red Stag, and all restaurants in Nova Scotia, let alone Halifax, must abide by the Nova Scotia Liqour Control Act, which states that minors can enter licensed premises  (until 9pm) if accompanied by adults, ONLY if the adults are there for purpose of a meal. Should there be an exception for babies? Probably, but there isn't. Should this be posted, or at least somewhere available for quick reference? Yes. However, they were only following the law. If a liquor inspector were to have entered and found the restaurant in violation, the restaurant could have lost their liquor license. And well, for a restaurant inside Mr. Keith's very own brewery, this is simply not an option.  Here is an excerpt from the Liquor Control act, and link for further perusing if you wish: Minors in Licensed PremisesDuty to prevent liquor being sold to, served to or consumed by minors44   (1)    A licensee must ensure that a person who is under 19 years old is not sold, supplied or given liquor in their licensed premises.       (2)    A licensee must ensure that a person who is under 19 years old does not consume liquor in their licensed premises.When accompanied minor may be in tavern, lounge, beverage room or cabaret45   Except as prohibited in Section 47, a person who is under 19 years old may enter and be in a premises for which a tavern license, beverage room license, lounge license or cabaret license is in effect until 9:00 p.m. if all of the following conditions are met:                (a)    the person is accompanied at all times by a parent, legal guardian or spouse who is 19 years old or older;                (b)    full meal service is provided in the licensed premises;                (c)    the person enters the licensed premises for the purpose of eating a meal.Source: novascotia.ca/just/regul

The coffee is always great and the selection of baked goods they have changes every time I go in. The ladies that work there are very nice, the inside has lots of comfortable seating, and the place is very cozy - check it out if you're looking for coffee, baked goods, or for lunch (they have wraps and sandwiches I have yet to try).
<review# 347,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/9/2013,11/18/2013,27,21,,5,4>My Bestie and I arrived around 10:45 pm - maybe because we're over 35 maybe because we're cute. Either way the bouncer ushered us past the line and in the doors. Yeah for us! Cover charge is the norm for the city $10. Inside we were "WOWED" this place is really nice, as mentioned in other reviews the atmosphere is like being in NYC. The first room has plenty of table and VIP area off to the side of a large dance floor. There are 2 other rooms with various types of music and each has it's own vibe. The clientele dress to impress, which is always a welcome treat! Drinks are less expensive than the Liquor Dome and the staff is MUCH nicer!!!! I highly recommend for anyone over 35 that wants to go out in Halifax. This place has something for Everyone.

<review# 349,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2013,11/16/2013,15,59,,5,3>As a member of the Club, I love how I've been able to reconnect with my Portuguese roots. The Portuguese Social Club of Nova Scotia was founded in 1974 and has continued to promote Portuguese culture and heritage throughout the province. Initially founded by a small number of close knit families the Club has expanded to a large membership that hosts a number of events throughout the year. A non-profit the Club is entirely run by volunteer members and a dedicated board of directors.Throughout the year we celebrate a number of important Portuguese events. Christmas, our big New Year's Party, summer picnics, beach days, and a safe Halloween for families. Our biggest and best known event is definitely Fatima. Every May the Club hosts Fatima, a weeklong celebration of a traditional Portuguese holiday. It's definitely worth checking out. There is a dance, delicious Portuguese sweets, a dinner, crafts, and a parade. Every year we have visitors from across the city come for our imported Portuguese sardines, BBQ bifana, and scrumptious almond tarts. The kitchen is packed with a ton of very talented cooks that produce enough food for a couple hundred guests! I've been lucky to be a part of our Rancho dance group as well. Open to anyone, our dance group practices weekly and focuses on traditional Portuguese folk dancing. We've performed at cultural events throughout Halifax. Be prepared for 1, 2, 3's!The Club has also offered Portuguese language classes to children, liaised with local universities in offering Portuguese courses, and been visited often by a temporary mobile consulate for Portugal. The consulate will be returning in the fall.The Club features a hall for rental that can hold up to 350 people. I've seen some fantastic wedding, anniversary parties, birthdays, and event a Celtic fiddle shindig! It's reasonably priced and has a full service kitchen. Probably some of the best pricing in Halifax for its size and offerings. We have a full bar staffed with free bartenders. If you visit try the delicious Portuguese expresso! Tiny cup, huge taste!I'd definitely recommend joining the Portuguese Social Club to any local Portuguese folk and Maritimers. I've found such a great community here!
<review# 350,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2013,11/15/2013,66,321,,3,2>Mozza sticks, peanut butter & chocolate milk shake, and peanut butter (veggie) burger with Darrell fries. That ^ is my meal at Darrell's. You don't have to "go big or go home" at Darrell's but it's awfully tempting. I can't get it every time because a) that's a lot of food; b) that's a lot of unhealthy food; and c) that's a lot of expensive unhealthy food.I've been coming to Darrell's a long time (since it was "My other brother Darrell's") and always walk away satisfied. If you asked me what the one thing I recommend on the menu is, I'd tell you, plain and simple; the mozza sticks. I think Darrell's was the first place I ever had them and to me they remain, hands down, the best in the city. Which isn't to say the peanut butter burger isn't awesome - it's just messier. I should say: the menu is quite extensive and they have specials that are always of note. You can see them on the top floor's giant chalk wall. And that's a point - they have both an upstairs and downstairs (trivia downstairs used to be a laundromat) dining area. But everyone knows upstairs is where it's at. Actually, their patio in the summer is THE spot. It's outdoor but with a bit of shade so you get all the patio experience without being blinded by sunlight.
<review# 351,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2013,11/13/2013,22,150,,2,3>One Saturday a few months ago, I noticed a new table set up at the Alderney Farmer's Market. There were bags and bags of these fluffly little morsels of varying flavours & hues. I walked by many times. And then one day I stopped and I sampled and then resistance became futile.What a treat, once you've tried one of Kelly's light and airy, sugary, homemade marshmallows, you will never want another one of those store bought, mass produced, jet puffed thingies. She has some basic flavours, Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Swirl was my favourite til I tried the Honey Barberry w/Pistachio & Coconut last night, what a flavour punch! She does mix it up a bit now and then with some new flavours and loves to hear of any suggestions to try.She's at the Alderney market on Saturday and the Seaport Market on Sunday. She also has a website on which you can order for pick-up or delivery.They are not cheap, but neither is perfection! If you want to treat yourself to something special, try them, but be careful, they are addictive.
<review# 352,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2013,11/12/2013,20,178,,3,2>So many choices are packed into this little shop. Coffee, snacks, desserts, and meals. I bought the chocolate hazelnut torte and it's divine. Chocolate mousse on a Ferrero Rocher crust covered in ganache! I also picked up a veg breakfast biscuit that I'm looking forward to for tomorrow.
<review# 353,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/2/2013,11/11/2013,0,6,,3,1>My favourite place to get pizza and garlic fingers. The pizza sauce is perfect (can't stand overly sweet sauce, always a dealbreaker) and there's no skimping on any toppings here! The garlic fingers are likewise awesome. Crust on either is never undercooked. I have ordered multiple other items besides pizza and garlic fingers though; poutine is great (but get the extra cheese), nachos are piled amazingly high. And everything comes at a very fair cost. The staff are always super friendly, and their online ordering is a breeze; I've used it many times now. They seem to pay close attention to orders as I've never gotten anything incorrect, and mine always involves a bizarre ingredient swap. Highly recommend this location; can't speak to any of the others but Fairview is a winner in my book.
<review# 354,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/3/2013,11/10/2013,13,71,,3,3>Do bars get any cooler than this?  I think not.  Figuring out HOW to get in here is not that difficult, but it's still fun.  When we walked into the upstairs bar, we were told to sit anywhere but then said we wanted to go downstairs and uttered the magic words.  A couple sitting nearby gave us extremely puzzled looks.  Others downstairs looked at us as we were escorted through the kitchens, dimly lit corridors, and through a rugged door into what can only be described as the coolest, old school meets contemporary bar.We sat at the bar and perused the menu while talking to the mixologist, Anne-Marie.  Being my second time here, she recognized me and she gave us suggestions on drinks.  Since I was in the middle of binge watching Mad Men, I opted for something not on the menu, an Old Fashioned.  So classic, and so fitting with the space.  Except Anne-Marie mixes it up a bit, adding vanilla syrup and Lillet Blanc to the bourbon.  Wow, what an awesome drink that was (I have since replicated at home, minus the vanilla syrup... delicious).Yeah, the drinks are expensive but where else are you going to see someone hand-chisel a block of ice because that's what an Old Fashioned calls for? Where else are you going to see multiple house-made flavoured simple syrups? Where else will you get house-made bitters? Go have two impeccably made drinks instead of downing six Coors Light at a random bar.

<review# 356,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2013,11/8/2013,59,150,3,6,5>It's no secret that I love fish burgers. They're so my thing. And, pretty much any one I try immediately becomes my favourite. I'm either easy to please, or know where to eat - I think they both apply!2 Doors Down was no exception; I decided on this dish before our server, Andru, told us it was one of the more popular menu items - Awesome! I was concerned about two things; bacon on a haddock burger and mustard pickles. I like mustard and I like pickles, and I like mustard pickles - but I don't normally like them 'on things'. I'm adventurous with food lately - so I took my chances, and I'm really glad I did.Nothing like your traditional haddock burger, 2 Doors Down uses a haddock fishcake for the patty. The burger was incredibly juicy and flavourful and left me thinking that the two concerns I had going in were my favourite parts!My bff and I also had an appetizer - or bar bites, I think they call it. The tempura Zucchini stuffed with goat cheese made me want to lick my plate clean. We shared this dish, 3 pieces, and it was such a tease! It is such a light dish you can certainly have it all to yourself, and for only $5.00 you're not breaking the bank.I am beyond impressed with the service we received last night, Andru was very attentive and friendly - and the food still has me drooling. I'll be back!!
<review# 357,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/14/2013,11/7/2013,40,216,5,4,2>While EDNA wouldn't have been my choice of old lady names for my restaurant, it was one of the many new restaurants I wanted to hit this summer. With some planning I drug my south ender butt up there to meet my girl friend for dinner.The interior of the restaurant oozes a sort of relaxed, modern cool with lots of blacks and whites that are softened by the plentiful re-purposed looking wood boards which run along part of the ceiling and down one wall in a garage door fashion. A large communal table sits in this spot as well, under some elegant, but not over the top, chandeliers. The bar area dials the fancy back with shelves made from black pipes and boards, with plenty of nick nacks strewn amongst the more useful items (re. booze).Our friendly and professional waitress saw to us quickly and we soon had drinks in hand while we perused the menu. The menu is compact, with only five or six starters and mains on a given night, although the menu changes constantly so it doesn't get old. When I saw the duck on the menu, I was pretty much set at that point, but I was drawn in further by the quinoa and snow pea salad,  seasonal veggies and a rhubarb and orange relish. Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner. I also ordered the soup of the day, a beet and peppercorn soup with mango chutney, which sounded great on a hot evening.The soup turned out to be a bit different than I expected, as it was apparently a golden beet and not your regular purple beet, but this was probably all for the best, given beets' infamous ability to stain everything. It had a smooth texture, and a mild beet flavour with some fruity sweetness from the mango and a nice little pep from the peppercorns.After a little bit of a wait for our mains, we eagerly dug in when they arrived. There was a good amount of duck, a drum stick and thigh, with thick, crisp skin that must have been finished after being confited, and that great duck flavour that makes it stand above the more common fowl. The snow peas still had a pleasant crunch and buttery flavour, and the seasonal vegetables appeared to be some spring mix and broccoli rabe. The red quinoa didn't add much flavour wise, but it's a "super food" so I'll cut it some slack. The orange and rhubarb relish added a sweet and tangy burst of flavour to nicely round out the dish.While not normally a dessert person, it was hard to turn down the tasty offerings that they had, especially the butterscotch that our waitress raved about. We settled on that and the strawberry shortcake. The butterscotch definitely lived up to the hype and was far better than your run of the mill Jello butterscotch cup that only the really young or really old eat. Smooth and rich with a caramel-ish finish, this is what butterscotch should be known as. The strawberry shortcake had great local strawberries and real whipped cream, but the biscuit was noticeably on the dry side. I really hope EDNA isn't leading the wave in a trend of restaurants with old woman names, because eventually it's going to be a turn off. Do you see yourself dining regularly at GERTRUDE or AGNES? Are they all in capitals because they're hard of hearing and yelling at us? Luckily, EDNA is a one of a kind, and has the atmosphere, quality food and service to keep you coming back.
<review# 358,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2013,11/6/2013,29,84,,4,3>The cupcakes are a little pricey but they will definitely fix your sweet craving. The flavour variety is nice and things appear to be done in small batches, so you never know quite what you'll find. In need of a sweet treat recently I popped in on a total whim and got a chocolate mint cupcake that was just the thing. It's so sugary you might not want to eat all that frosting in a single sitting - or a giant glass of milk might help - but they offer a nice little single serving plastic takeaway container to help with that. Worth it when you want to treat yourself to a little something. Will have to try some of their other treats after reading the excellent reviews on them.
<review# 359,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2013,11/5/2013,1,17,,3,2>I moved to the neighborhood in 1983 (!) and Peter's, being just down the street, rapidly became my go-to pizza shop. Back in those days I was still in go-out-drinking-downtown mode and often would get Peter's for take-out on the way home. It was always great but even better cold out of the fridge for breakfast the next day! Seriously, cold Peter's PSMG (hold the onions) is the best breakfast food ever. So in '97 I moved to Dartmouth and tried to find a comparable pizza place. No dice. Even the highly recommended ones didn't come close to this. So my pizza consumption went way down, but when I absolutely had to have pizza, I would call Peter's and make the trek over the bridge to Inglis St. The best part was the drive home with those heavenly aromas in the car. And the pizza never changed, it was and still remains the best around. Peter's is the best.
<review# 360,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/3/2012,11/4/2013,7,8,1,5,3>Wasabi House is my new favourite sushi place in Halifax. Granting that I live around the corner, and the typically long waits are tempered by not having to drive & park, the food quality, selection, and... just... pow... is second to none.There are fancier places around town, and if you want your servers to be turned out to the nines, elbow room, or even to get a seat in less than 20 minutes, then you know where to find it.High quality food, high quality presentation, high quality selection, good prices, and an amazing happy hour menu.

I have never had falafels like Tareks, soft, moist and garlicky! I have yet to try the pizza. I need to convince myself to go for the pizza instead some time. The restaurant is not beautiful but it's clean and you're there for the awesome food anyway. It's definitely a big yes!!

<review# 364,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/24/2013,10/31/2013,12,118,,5,2>This location recently opened, in September I believe, and has been my go-to lunch spot since. It is situated across from Olly Fresco's in Purdy's Wharf, which just so happens to be very convieniently located to where I work in tower one. And I love sushi, so this may be dangerous.I have never seen someone make sushi so fast. You place your order, and it is literally in your hands within 60 seconds. It is qutie the sight. They have a decent variety of items to chose from, including combos. I usually go for the sweet potato roll and shrimp roll or avacado roll. Pricing is decent, usually coming in under $10. They also have a stamp card for a free lunch after a certain number of stamps. The sushi itself is pretty good, very fresh as sometimes the rice is still very warm. My only complaint is that some of the roll pieces are huge, like 3 bite huge (ex. Shrimp roll, spicy sweet potato roll). They also only give one soy sauce packet per roll (25c extra per additional packet); this is usually fine for me but some have mentioned it is an issue for them.Overall, I definitely reccommend this place. It beats the sushi Olly's used to offer on Thursday by far (which had pineapple in all of the types, very weird). And since I only take 1/2 hour lunches, the speed of this place still allows me a solid 20-25mins of eating/relaxing time. I give it a big thumbs up!
<review# 365,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/18/2013,10/30/2013,3,35,,4,1>My first time being there, I was dressed a bit casual and by my lonesome but it was an unforgettable experience, the setting was very posh with an elegance, soft music and my waiter was highly dedicated in serving me.here`s what I orderedStarter:  Caesare: Grilled hearts of romaine with a lemonanchovy and roasted garlic vinaigrette, fried capers, cheesy crouton. - This shocked my system with the flavor because I`m so use to regular cesar salads and the sharp taste threw me off balance, It was tasty but I think I`ll stick with my regular cesar saladsBolognese: Spaghetti, veal meatballs, meat ragout, parmesan. Also ordered some garlic bread with it - I didn`t eat the meat balls but when I tried a fork full of this spagetti and nibbled on the bread, I nearly cried, it was breath taking, the texture, the spike of flavor and the smell gave me warm and cold shivers and made me want more. I highly recommend trying it along with the garlic bread.Creme Bruilee Italiano - My first tasting of Creme Bruilee, and it was sheer bliss, I mean the top layer is a bit thick of it`s caramelized sugar and it did give me a little bit of a tooth ache but it was well worth it especially once I tried the custard underneath. it was heavenly.All in all, I loved this place, it is pricey but it`s well worth it and I`ll be trying to be a monthly regular when I can

<review# 367,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/18/2013,10/28/2013,3,8,,5,2>Of all the food trucks in Halifax, I think I love it the most. If you want a party in your mouth, find this truck. It isn't very hard to find, they post up a schedule on twitter that tells you exactly where they'll be in the next few days by mid week. Fusion Mexican Korean food that warms the belly with its varied textures and levels of heat. The K-Dog. with bacon, kimchi and spicy mayo is legendary and some times you can't have just one. Bring a friend or two and you can enjoy more of their offerings. (Although sometimes I don't care and order a few things all for me). The crispy flavouful Pa-Jeon, a Korean scallion-onion pancake, amazing the next day with breakfast if you can manage not to eat it all. The menu changes often enough to keep it interesting (Vegan Pho, Mapo Tofu, chicken fried steak!!!)  but they always have favourites like the K-Dog (which can be made vegetarian friendly at request). I think they also try to use locally sourced ingredients (especially meat) as much as they can. I once had the best spicy meatball sandwich there after a Wailers concert and still try and bug them to make it again when I see them. They also do a brunch run at the old farmers market location on Saturday mornings and on Falkland/Gottingen on Sunday mornings but I haven't been conscious or had the time to make it to one of those for the Bibimbap Benny. One of these days...Good prices for the quality of food and the care you can taste that was put into making it. Food Wolf, I'll be seeing a bunch of you this winter if I can help it.
<review# 368,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2013,10/27/2013,20,71,1,6,2>This is my favourite place to go to in Halifax. Even though its pricey, I absolutely adore The Drill. I've never had anything I didn't love. Fresh oysters on a half shell with a bit of white wine to start off, then the main event comes and after that the dessert and you're rolling home fully satisfied and stuffed. So good. But definitely a bit pricey so its more of a 'special occasion' thing.
<review# 369,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2013,10/26/2013,46,16,,10,3>Popped in here to treat a friend for his birthday. Between the three of us we ordered three 16" Pizzas, (From the menu)Sausage Pizza - Peasants Pantry Summer Sausage with tomato sauce, mozzarella, White pizza -  Smoked Peasants Pantry Chorizo sausage, arugula, walnut with mozzarella, smoked gouda, honey, balsamic reductionMushroom Pizza - Our own blend of roasted mushrooms and garlic with tomato sauce, mozzarella, swissWe also had two french pressed coffees and a beer. In case you are wondering we are chubby but there were lots of leftovers!Service: (5/5)Our server, Ryan, was quick and brought us a bottle of water and filled out glasses on a number of occasions.  It is nice having the water at the table so you don't have to wait but it is also nice to have them fill your water when they come to check on you. The server also let us know that the mushroom was his favorite once I suggested it.  After bringing the water and drinks our order was taken and food took about 10 minutes with a total meal time at about 45 minutes. I consider this important so people on lunch can come have a good dining experience within a hour lunch break.  With the current amount of seats I don't see it very difficult to serve even a packed house with two servers.Food:  (4/5)The menu seemed to be in its early stages with salad, pizza, and desert options. The pizzas come in a personal pan 9" and 16" sizes.The pizza here is thin crust and cooked in an oven at the back the of store. There were flames in the back of it so maybe its wood fired, maybe not but it was pretty good pizza.  The pizza had  a nice crisp yet chewy give to it and a really nice gestalt on the bottom. The server offered us chili flakes and chili oil which I accepted and enjoyed the spicy boost. We all agreed that the Mushroom Pizza was the best tasting, followed by the white pizza, and the slightly disappointing sausage pizza. The mushroom pizza had a perfect texture and it was the pizza with the least slices left after dinner. The white pizza tasted good and never "weird" as I thought it would be. Might use a bit more sauce. The Sausage pizza was a bit of a letdown as there was more sausage on the white pizza and I would have to say the toppings were stingy on this one. The crust on the sausage was also overdone compared to the others which is not Sausage Pizza's fault so we can forgive it this once. Since the Sausage pizza is actually a dollar more than the others I expect more meat next time!Decor: (5/5)Wonderful. Big Windows, Open space, large real wood tables, and decent chairs makes this place a nice combination of eat in and take out. With the current configuration of tables around the outside edges and a large almost sharable table in the centre there is a lot of room for takeout people to come in without disturbing the other guests. My guesstimate is they could fit 30-40 people in here and I wouldn't be surprised if they put a few more tables in down the line. When you enter you get a full glimpse directly at the fired oven on the opposite corner with a nice checkered tile backing in the kitchen. Even though this place has a Hydrostone look on the outside it does not have the slightly cramped feeling inside typical of Hydrostone buildings (in my opinion).  I would like to say that this place has street parking only. We found a decent place to park on the side street beside the natural food store and is possibly the closest place to do so.Value: (4/5)Compared to Salvatore's Pizza, which is the most direct competitor for my premium pizza dollars I would say mothers pizza is closely matched. With this attention to detail I am sure they wanted to offer competitive prices from the get go. The price at Mother's is slightly less with the diversity and toppings being slightly less as well compared to Salvatore's. $16 for a 16" pizza ($17 for the Sausage) is a good price. The French pressed coffees were decent at $3 each and you knew it was fresh so it was worth the extra buck.  We left with about a pizza's worth of leftovers and it tasted good a few hours later too!Overall (4/5)As this is an early review I may change it upon revisiting. Overall I really liked the vibe of this place and the pizza was quite good with the crust being the best of its type.  This place would have gotten a five star rating if it had more toppings on the Sausage, less burned crust on the one pizza, and a bit more selection in the menu.  The service was excellent and the decor was done well and the price was good. I can see this place being a perfect place to have share some pizza and a beer. Or maybe two.

I love that things are clearly marked on the menu for vegans and vegetarians. They have not only a large selection of sushi rolls but also have a few tofu dishes and other Japanese specialty. The food was prompt and the service was good as well. I particularly like the comfortable atmosphere. Feels a lot like a coffee shop but a little more intimate. Decor and seating is great. Definitely a great place for Japanese cuisine.

The girl who was working there, I think her name may have been Mandy, was fabulous. Not only did she take the time to explain the different types of allergies that dogs face, she also recommended different types of foods to try from the raw diet to different brands of kibble. I didn't feel pressured at all to go either way and left with samples of both to try. I have started my dog on the raw diet as well as yogurt and honey all of which she loves:) I will definitely be  going back and highly recommend that any pet owners do the same.

Staff are nice. We got the huge platter of food. Fantastic as usual. 4 of us ate from it and were pretty full. The onion rings were huge and I think beer battered. The meats don't come with a lot of sauce because they put three different types on the table. I like this. It is good for picky eaters and often too much sauce overpowers the food and brings the temperature down. The cornbread is great and the chicken sausage is probably the best! The pulled meats are all amazing. The only downside I think is the lack of soft drink selection (I was happy with a Prop rootbeer) and the ribs don't have a lot of meat on them.But it was very satisfying and our guests LOVED it!

<review# 378,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2013,10/17/2013,10,25,4,5,4>The Chickenburger was my Diner de Jour for Father's day this year. Rather than drop $100 at some D'mouth Crossing big box restaurant, we decided Father's Day is about the company not the atmosphere. My family asked 3 times "you're SURE you wanna go to the Chickenburger for Father's Day"The last time we were there a few weeks ago we were pleasantly surprised to find they had a second outdoor patio, behind the Chick, where the Innis house used to be. Even though it is only picnic tables on a piece of grass the new vantage point was nice and the ton of space between each table gave a sense of privacy even though we were out in the open. On Father's Day, for whatever reason (maybe grass cutting) all the picnic tables were tilted against the trees so I made my was to the more congested outdoor patio while the family went to order the food.For my special day I decided on a Chickenburger (of course) with fried onions, a double cheesburger with fried onions and ketchup, small fries, small onion rings and a strawberry shake. Yum yum YUM yum Y-U-M!The chickenburgers are real chunks of chicken. Not a preformed piece of chicken-type meat. Real chunks. Get the Hearty whole wheat bun if you really want.The burgers are real meat balls, thrown on the grill and pressed flat (once on each side) by real humans. You need to know that the gillmasters have worked their way up through the ranks until the chain of command deem them to be ready to go on the gill.There are quirky things you find out after coming to the Chicken burger for a while. Like: - DON'T ask for lettuce or tomato on your burger. Chicken burger apparently has NEVER put lettuce or tomato on their burgers. Once about 15 years or so ago when CB won Canada's Best Burger contest, a letter to the editor of the Chronical Herald protested because when he was at Chickenburger and kind of insisted on having lettuce and tomatoes he says he was invited to go next door to fast food burger joint where he could get lettuce and tomato on his frozen and then thawed burger-out-of-the-warmer.- If you ask for "the works" on your burger you should know that "the works" does not include ketchup. I am not really sure what "the works" DOES include, but I know it doesn't include ketchup.The shakes are some of the best around, and you will NOT suck a filling out when drinking one through a straw.You will pay a bit more for the meals here like $8 instead of $7, but I think it is good value for money.And after you finish your meal, go next door to Chicken Little for your ice cream treat. A few year's ago as the story goes, the owner's 15 yo son suggested to his dad that they should have an ice cream stand. So his dad said "Ok, do it"TIP: if you get a double scoop, get it in a cup. It doesn't drip and thy put a LOT of ice cream on their double scoop.

I've worked at Shearwater and driven by Johns' lunch for years...just put it off as a local greasy spoon, one to avoid as I am looking out for my midlife middrift, which may appear any year soon. But, my new GF who grew up in the South End, couldn't believe that I had never ate at the infamous John's Lunch.In I went, twisted arm.  I ordered the clam platter. The last time I had eaten sweet clam meat like that was at 5 island national park near Parsboro. People, put your fried food attitude in the strainer, and head out to John's. It's family owned, I talked with the Son and Mom. They claim that their seafood is the freshest, and i can account for that statement. It was such a large meal, that i had to doggy bag.  The interior of the place is extremely small, but hey, how much elbow room do you need to slam back a few clams and fries.I enjoyed it totally !!

<review# 383,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2013,10/12/2013,13,44,,6,1>I've been meaning to write a review for this place for quite some time now. I actually had half a review written, and just never finished it, for the longest time. I've been here 4 or 5 times since they've opened, and every time I've had at least a good experience, and at times, a wonderful experience.I have to say, one of my favourite things about this is that while it's a bar, it also caters to people who don't drink. Which is very nice, as typically, being the designated driver can be a bit of a drag. Not so here, as there are delicious eats galore. The drinks here, also amazing. I would say the drinks are of a higher caliber than the desserts. There is a wide variety, and definitely something for everyone. The servers are also incredibly helpful with picking something out if you're having a hard time. Their mocktails are also delicious, if incredibly sweet. I'd like if they had something a bit less intense, as the desserts tend to take care of the sweetness factor.Speaking of desserts. The desserts are the reason I come here. My first visit they were phenomenal. I'm sad to say, I feel they've gone downhill a little since then. But that being said, they're still really excellent. Same as the drinks, there's a wide variety with a menu that is constantly changing, and I'm sure you won't have trouble finding something. However, I'm not sure they really cater to the gluten-free or vegan crowd, so that might be something to consider. The service here is also good, with friendly staff who are really great at helping you make decisions (which trust me, is really awesome, because it can be hard). This is a spot I'm sure I'll find myself at a lot, if only because I haven't found a place that offers desserts and cocktails as delicious.
<review# 384,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2013,10/11/2013,5,11,,7,2>I went to Hali Deli for the first time on Sunday morning with two friends for brunch. I loved the look of the place right off, it's straight out of the 40s from the posters on the walls to the old school tin ceilings. Super charming. The lady working that day was also wonderful, very helpful and welcoming. She very patiently answered the mountain of questions we all had about menu items we'd heard of, but weren't exactly sure we knew what they were (ie: knishes. They're delicious, that's what they are). The menu items my friends ordered looked fantastic, but I'd ordered the special of the day and I certainly didn't regret it. The special was the Deli Benny, Eggs Benny served with smoked meat on top of potato latkes with a knish served on the side. It was lighter than I'd expected, but not at all in a bad way. I finished everything on my plate and felt satisfied but not weighed down like I'd anticipated.Hali Deli is a wonderful addition to Agricola Street. I live over in Dartmouth and I'll make the trip once more some Sunday morning just to eat here again. As someone who didn't have the luxury of growing up around delicious, authentic deli food I'm rating this as a bit of an amateur, but I'm pretty confident my star rating will hold up. I can't speak to the authenticity, but as far as flavour, presentation, service and atmosphere go, this place is aces in my books.
<review# 385,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2013,10/10/2013,25,117,3,3,3>Best, and biggest, cookies ever.That in and of itself was enough to get me to the waterfront to check this place out. Forget the amazing reviews I've heard on here and on Twitter - cookies got my attention. And I was NOT disappointed! They are HUGE and fabulous! And delicious! I have to confess that I'm just a plain ol' tea drinker so the cookies really were the draw for me but my co-worker grabbed a fancy latte-like drink and downed it in mere minutes. With froth still on his lips he exclaimed "Perfect!" and that was all I needed to confirm that amazingness that is Two if By Sea.
<review# 386,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2013,10/9/2013,29,249,2,6,4>Anyone who knows me, knows my love of all things French, so I am extremely happy to have this patisserie in my city. The place is on the small side, but I think that adds to the charm. Along with coffee and drinks there are croissants and pain au chocolates to choose from (you can even order frozen croissants to bake at home, with advanced notice) along with a display case filled with all kinds of goodies. The macaroons rival the ones I've eaten in Paris and their lemon and chocolate tarts are delicious, but my favorite item so far is the canele. The canele is utterly swoon worth, with a crunchy, caramelized outside, and a creamy custardy inside. I can't go into the store without getting one. I'm so glad to finally have a French pastry shop so close to home!
<review# 387,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2013,10/8/2013,65,111,,5,3>Best grilled cheese of my life. I feel like that's all you really need to know. But I'll go on, because I really want to sing the praises of this place. First of all, I've been hoping a great food truck would show up near my office, so I was pleased to learn Bite Me plans to set up shop at the corner of Windsor & Young a couple days a week. I spread the word to my coworkers, and several of us ventured out today at lunch to give it a try. I am a little in love with my grilled cheese on French bread with sautéed mushrooms and maple syrup, topped with crispy onions. I mean, come on. My fries were tasty and perfectly crispy to boot. And some of my coworkers who didn't order fries were treated to free fries because it started to rain while we waited. How awesome is that? Only thing holding back the 5th star is cash only. Understandable for this type of business, but most people just don't carry cash anymore. I never do. Next time I'll have to try the deep-fried Oreo. Maybe. Either way, I'll be back!

And not just SHOES, but those shoes...you know...the ones that no one else has, the ones that you always seem to be looking for--thats what she has in there! Loads of clothing, great jeans, jewellery, hand bags...oh my oh my!!!!!Prices are fantastic for what you are getting. Unique styles and well known hard to find(around here) brand names!!Crimson Clover gets a HUGE SHOUT OUT from this Halifax shopper!My apologies in advance to my credit card.....eeeekk
<review# 389,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/29/2013,10/6/2013,8,63,,5,2>I hadn't been to the True North in ages, so I was looking forward to trying their food again; especially their delicious hot dogs.While my friends went for the larger dogs, I decided to stick with 'the Mutt' and added the traditional ketchup and mustard to it.  The bill was $11 for the dog, french fries, and a soft drink which I thought was a steal.I enjoyed the 1950's style design and the records that were placed on the walls as well as copies of some old music posters on another side of the establishment.  A large jukebox near the bathrooms plays all the old classics from the 50's, 60's, and even the 70's.One funny moment occurred when I was in the washroom as the True North has two sinks in two separate areas.  Although this seems reasonable; one sink is actually within a few centimetres of one of the toilets.  I did not realize that someone was about to come out of the 'john' and when he opened the door to come out, the door whacked me in the shoulder as I was getting set to dry my hands.  In conclusion, I had a great experience at the True North Diner.  The prices were reasonable and the service was excellent; I liked the fact that the servers are dressed in 1950's garb as it adds to the authenticity of the experience.  I will try to sample one of their desserts next time as they looked appealing just from looking at them in their display cases.
<review# 390,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2013,10/5/2013,39,130,1,3,1>Food quality: amazing, as usual.Prices: just fine. Service: efficient.Staff: friendly.Line up organization: absolute cluster eff.My one and only gripe is that this is a small space, and if you head down between 12-1, you're very likely to encounter a blob-like mass of people waiting to order a sandwich, order a salad, pay for their meals, or some combination of all 3. The interesting part is that there appears to be no defined line-up structure, so you just have to kind of seize the moment when you think it may be your turn to order/pay.(Note: If you're cool with pre-packaged, you will save yourself some of the wait/confusion.)The food is great though, the staff are good at their jobs, and your wallet won't be lightened too much by a trip through Pete's ToGoGo's doors.
<review# 391,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2013,10/4/2013,4,41,1,4,1>A few months ago, I went to le bistro with my mom for lunch. She ordered Salade a LOrange & I ordered Linguine Barcelone. As soon as my mom took a bite from her salad, I knew she loved it. I reluctantly tried some (I was never a fan of salads other then caesars, not to mention this salad has raisins, mandarins & almonds - not exactly my cup of tea). Let me tell you, ever since this salad, I have been way more adventurous with trying new dressings (as juvenile as that sounds). It's just sooooo good. I crave it all the time. The pasta was good too but honestly, I was so thrown off by the salad I just wanted to eat that.Then, to my absolute delight, I noticed that their dessert menu had gingerbread (something quite difficult to find personally). It was delicious!The service was great and friendly... however. I went a second time with one of my friends and it took us a good 20 mins to get service. It wasn't busy at all when we walked in. We were seated and then the waitress seemed to care less wether a couple of teenage-looking girls were there. It was almost as if she served us because all the adults were good. That too me is so frustrating and the reason this place lost a star for me.Food is excellent though and when I'm served by younger-looking people, they seem waaaay more friendly. Just saying.
<review# 392,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2013,10/3/2013,1,3,,1,1>I really love Sally Beauty, their prices are great, their selection is fantastic and its open to the public, so I can actually recommend it to friends, family, or clients looking for beauty supplies. This is where I buy almost everything I need in terms of implements for my makeup kit, including the lash glue I swear by. The girls are very helpful and incredibly knowledgeable about the products they carry, I had some questions about hair color on my last visit in, as I was thinking about switching things up and didn't want to go the box dye route. The girl helped me out with picking a demi-permanent and giving me some helpful tips on how to mix and apply (even though I was going to pester my hair dresser relative to do it for me anyway, I appreciated the service). Overall great selection, great staff, the location isn't the most convenient if you don't need to go to Bayers Lake often, but I usually just stock up on everything all at once every few months and go on a Sally Beauty spending spree.
<review# 393,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2013,10/2/2013,21,55,,2,1>Oh man.. burritos and tacos are a thing of art! Habaneros makes them with the toppings you desire, and as spicy (or not) as you wish. I indulged in the chicken burrito with a lime sauce... and it was awesome.It's not traditional mexican fare, but it certainly is Mexican derived. It's a nice a change from typical burgers. Give it a shot!
<review# 394,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2012,10/1/2013,54,227,5,3,3>I was recently introduced to Tom's via the Yelp Retox - I'd tried to go before, but damn, it's hard to get a table there during happy hour. So basically, cheap wine? Yeah, I'm in. And I liked all the food I tasted - in particular, there were sweet potato crab cakes on the specials board that I'd pretty much marry. I love the atmosphere here and will start to make an effort to come more often than just during happy hour so I can actually stay, rather than awkwardly lingering before bailing for a lesser venue.
<review# 395,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2013,9/30/2013,35,24,,1,1>My first trip to the goggle was 5 years ago when they opened and I have been going ever since. The place has changed over the years and always for the better, more seating, nicer art, and a consistent staff of amazing people. I would tell you about the menu but in 5 years I have ordered the same thing every time, the goggle burger. If I could only eat one burger for the rest of my life it would be this one.
<review# 396,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2013,9/29/2013,9,1,,2,1>This was such a good hot dog experience!

It was a truly wonderful food experience! Try it out!
<review# 397,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/22/2013,9/28/2013,2,7,,2,1>Durty Nelly's is a great pub with a really cool atmosphere. Went in here and had the fish and chips at the bar with a friend as well as a few pints of Keith's. The location is great, right in the heart of the downtown core, and the staff is extremely friendly. The food was great, it was a tad loud at the time (6pm on a Saturday) but I can't really hold that against them considering I don't expect the place to be quiet at that time. Great spot, recommended for sure.
<review# 398,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2013,9/27/2013,27,107,3,5,4>Sometimes excellent service can elevate a good meal to a stellar one.  This is where Finbar's shines. The food is tasty, make no mistake. Their Sticky Pudding is my favourite.  In my two visits I've had the mac and cheese (good but not outstanding), their nachos (my favourite appetizer by far), their cheddar dip (also quite good).Extensive beer selection of both local and imported. So I was happy.The one failing was the oppressive heat of the dining area... No idea if the AC was on the fritz or if in fact there is AC? I went outside on a hot day to take a breather.Go - have a pint, grab a bite. You won't be sorry.
<review# 399,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2013,9/26/2013,9,59,2,4,1>A friend and I went down to the waterfront to watch the late Canada Day fireworks with her daughter. We decided a harbourside snack was in order, and what better snack than something bacon related! I had the Porkabello -  a big white bun with arugula, portabello mushrooms, caramelized onions, goat cheese, an awesome sauce and 2 different kinds of bacon. Omg yum. Not for the faint of heart, this sandwich packed a punch! A little messy to eat, but totally delicious.My friend had the Bacon Butty and loved it too. She knows her bacon, and was very impressed. Despite the fact that it was busy, they were pretty quick with our order, and it was hot and delicious. The prices are definitely reasonable for the boardwalk. I'll be back.
<review# 400,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2013,9/22/2013,1,9,,2,1>I went here on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't too busy. Staff were helpful and showed us how the self serve yogurt concept worked. I found many of the choices too sweet, but settled on a Greek berry flavour with fruit toppings. Next time ill go for chocolate toppings on a chocolate yogurt. Price was slightly high but not unreasonable compared to dessert at a restaurant.
<review# 401,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/13/2013,9/21/2013,20,72,,2,3>So, it's 1830 and dinner is in the oven, when the power goes out. It's either BBQ from frozen or hit the trail. Difficult choice. We'd been meaning to try Edible Matters for dinner ever since we first visited last year, so here was the perfect opportunity.   To cut a long story short, my daughter ordered the night's special, pasta with chicken and sausage; wife went for seared haddock and I chose the free range chicken. All three were nicely prepared, though the sauce with the haddock was assessed as a bit too thin and the fish was a little dry at the edges. The pasta was superb, with a very generous portion of chicken and two varieties of sausage, one of which was quite spicy. As for my chicken ....  On the first bite, I remembered what chicken used to taste like when I was a kid. For the most part, today you get water saturated, chemically injected meat flown/shipped in from God knows where and it tastes of nothing. Not this beastie! Subtly flavoured, perfectly cooked, succulent. The veggies were superb as well.   Two out of three ain't bad and we will definitely be back.
<review# 402,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2012,9/20/2013,5,7,,4,2>BREAKFAST!!We stopped in looking to try something new and breakfast; for $6 was a delicious bargain. 2 eggs, toast, homefries and choice of meat, tea/coffee or juice. I went with the Ham which was nice and meaty and my friend loved her bacon. The serving sizes were perfect, I finished my plate and didnt feel sick, The food tasted home cooked and our waitress was friendly and fun.
<review# 403,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/3/2013,9/19/2013,20,226,2,6,2>As a big fan of the former Il Mercato at this location, I was wary of the new resto.  Fortunately my fears were allayed as soon as we walked in.The interior has definitely changed, and for the better.  Warm and cozy are good words to describe the new look.  Wooden beams have been added to the ceiling, and some walls are brick and some have collages of Italian posters to peruse as you wait for your food.  I recognized some of the old staff but saw many new faces as well.The menu is perfect, with something for everyone. I tried the spaghettini with smoked bacon and Mike had the daily lunch express, which consisted that day of a small pizza, spinach salad and a strawberry tart for dessert.  Everything was really good.  I do miss the olive oil and balsamic vinegar provided with bread in the past (the bread now comes with butter), but I can always head to the Bedford Il Mercato if I'm desperate.  :-)Service was lovely and our food came very quickly. The wine list is EXTENSIVE, as is the beer list.  We were unable to partake on this occasion but on future visits?  Absolutely!
<review# 404,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2013,9/18/2013,39,80,2,3,1>I love me the Nomad Gourmet. My  first experience was at a Local Connections Halifax event linked up with Propeller Beer. Bought a ticket, got beer and NG burgers. It was beer and burger heaven for the evening. My second experience was sampling their sausages on a bun when checking out the Man Show part of the Exhibition Park Christmas Craft Fair. One thing is clear, you don't have to be a man to enjoy the tasty morsels being served up from the NG kitchen. And then this weekend I got to try breakfast Nomad style. I chose to "build my own breakfast' for $4. The way this works is you get an egg and hash browns and add on things at your choosing for extra $. I added some bacon and got the BEST BACON of my life. It was perfectly grilled and made my weekend. The egg was fried egg perfection and there were too many hash browns for me to eat. The hash browns are real local potatoes cooked on the grill and have a charbroiled taste to them. Pro-tip - NG will now be at the Halifax Seaport Market on weekend mornings as long as there isn't a cruise ship in harbour. Extra Pro-tip - I didn't try the breakfast sandwich - but people - it's homemade Belgian waffles with chicken!!One final tip - when your handsome pirate brother has a new baby the way to the new parents hearts is to bring Nomad Gourmet burgers to the hospital for lunch the day after the baby is born. That way both new parents are happily stuffing their faces with burger goodness and you get your brand new niece all to yourself! (at least until the burgers are devoured...)
<review# 405,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2013,9/13/2013,24,132,4,4,1>It's small, it's quaint, it's smack in the middle of Hydrostone, and I like it!Great place to stroll through on your way to your Sister/Bristers place.Lots of benches for sitting, coffee shops nearby, food nearby, all the things you need to make a park kick ass!In the area, grab a joe and or a snack and just relax on a bench and people watch!
<review# 406,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2013,9/12/2013,15,59,4,4,4>As I watched the construction of Funky Monkey my excitement grew. I'd always loved Cascade and made sure to stop by in the summer to grab a slice of pizza and a popsicle. Yes, they have Root Beer and Banana popsicles! Since it's opening Funky Monkey has grown to become my favorite ice cream spot in Dartmouth. I thought I'd do a breakdown of why Funky Monkey is so amazing. Price: The prices are exceedingly fair and low and the portion sizes are generous. Yes, they accept debit and credit! It was about $2.25 for a small, which is two large scoops. The first time I came I ordered the largest size because the prices were so reasonable. I had to split my cone across two people to finish.Seating: There is ample room to stop by and hang out while eating your ice cream. It really seems to serve as a meeting place for the neighbourhood. Kid and dog friendly, the patio is comfortable and convenient! No more walking home with a melting cone.Selection: An ice cream hut does not get my chilly seal of approval without ample selection. Funky Monkey gets the seal! There are a ton of flavours, and they even select new ones for each season. You're able to browse the flavours while waiting so you can choose exactly what you'd like. They always carry my favorite flavour, Moon Mist. Laugh if you will, but Moon Mist is intergalactically accepted as one of the greatest ice cream flavours. I've never grown out of it. They carry both soft and hard ice cream and you can choose from cups, cones, or waffle cones. I haven't tried the other cool treats but they have milkshakes and sundaes. There is even a selection of ice cream for dogs! Peanut butter, crumbled treat bits, vanilla: your dog won't have to share a lick of your cone. I really love the dog friendly atmosphere, they make sure all family members are welcome. Four legs or two. Every year I find myself watching the corner like a hawk in the spring thinking, "is it open yet? Isn't 5C in March warm enough for ice cream?!". Did I mention they always play great music? I've definitely seen a few impromptu dance parties break out on the patio.
<review# 407,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/4/2013,9/11/2013,76,115,,4,1>It's nice to have a place to get a burger and fries that's a bit more "elevated" than McD's in my 'hood. You're paying more for it but you're getting more freshness and flavour in return. Their food is really tasty and the portions are quite generous - I love that they stack so many toppings onto their burgers (I lurve me lotso toppings!). My favourites are the Three Little Pigs (Pulled pork, peameal bacon, Oulton's double smoked bacon, Canadian cheddar and chipotle mayo - aka. heart attack waiting to happen) and the Maui Wowie (Apple wood smoked cheddar, caramelized pineapple, Oulton's double smoked bacon, fried onions, roasted red peppers and sweet chilli sauce). It's nice to see them using local meats, as that's something I wouldn't expect from a 'chain' like this. The one thing I will say is not to expect FAST food here - they tend to take quite a while to make each order - I have waited about 15 mins or so anytime I have gone. I think this is both good AND bad - good that they make your burger to order and it's not sitting under a heat lamp for an hour, but bad in that the waiting can be frustrating. The staff is really nice though. If you are in a hurry, I would say skip this place. Come by when you are not in a rush and are able to appreciate a place that takes it's time preparing your meal.

It's a great find at the end of the season!The staff is always friendly and Michael has to be one of the nicest and friendliest clerks in the city by far!I 'LIKE' their Facebook page so I often get the pictures of the latest additions to their shoe family and I have to use every ounce of my will power to not hop in my car and rush right down.Be sure to check them out on your next visit to downtown or Parklane!
<review# 409,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2013,9/9/2013,13,17,,3,2>Looking to start my Halifax experience right (and impress my parents enough to want to come back and visit,) we chose Chives, mostly in part to good reviews online and a fun looking menu.  Chives is an unpretentious restaurant with food and service that you might find in one of the more uppity places.  We really loved everything we ordered, especially the roasted Cauliflower Hot Pot, the Atlantic Lobster Risotto, and the Double Smoked Bacon Wrapped Pork.  A little less impressive was the pork belly and fried ravioli that came with the Bacon and Scallops entree.  Just a little on the greasy side.  Overall, the ambience, service, and food would definitely bring us back for another delicious meal.  Not a bad first meal in Halifax!
<review# 410,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2013,9/8/2013,48,65,,3,2>My new go-to sushi joint downtown.While the veggie selection isn't as large as some of the bigger sushi places, what they do have is delicious. There are some great appetizer options (deep fried tofu, edamame, etc.) and some delicious vegetable rolls. The ACI roll (avocado, cucumber, inari) is fantastic, and my absolute favorite roll is the Yam Tempura. Freshly fried tempura served in a roll with avocado and rice. Perfection.Definitely check this place out. It's perfect for a fast and affordable lunch, but I think dinner would be great, too.
<review# 411,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2013,9/7/2013,4,4,,3,2>My sushi addiction started many, many years ago, taking me all over the city in the quest for the perfect combination of not only sushi, but starters, salads, soups, and desserts. I've had many favourite sushi restaurants over the years, changing almost  every time someone pointed me in the direction of the new 'hot sushi spot', until I happened across this place one evening. Now, every time I try a new sushi bar, I keep coming back to this one. Even the free sushi at a certain well-known spot on Quinpool road isn't enough to keep me from coming here. My go-to meal of spicy salmon, alaska roll, and agedashi tofu cannot be beaten by any other restaurant in the city, and I can confidently say that I've tried them all!
<review# 412,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/10/2013,9/6/2013,20,178,,4,2>I stopped in on Friday for lunch and this new spot was quite busy. The place seats about 16, does take-out orders and all the tables were full while we were there. I had the Thai salad which was a delightful mix of rice noodles, vegetables, tofu, and house-made peanut sauce. The server (also the owner?) was extremely outgoing and kind. I'm not vegan so I didn't know if I would like the coconut bacon, cashew cheese, and seitan items. However, I enjoyed my Thai salad so much I would give them a try next time. I wonder if there's a way to sample the things that people might not be familiar with.
<review# 413,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2013,9/5/2013,22,150,1,3,3>The Alderney Farmer's Market is my favourite Saturday morning place to be. And a Port City Coffee with a Maple Bacon Doughnut from the Doughnut Stand is my favourite way to start a Saturday morning at the Market.I get a vague sense they do have other doughnuts but I am instantly and always drawn the Maple Bacon. I mean a yeasty doughnut doused in sweet, sticky maple glaze to which crispy, salty nuggets of bacon adhere, I ask you, what else could you ever want?I may try some other flavours but my heart will always belong to the Maple Bacon.
<review# 414,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2013,8/31/2013,40,216,5,6,6>After lots of buzz, a tease opening in Open City and then a soft opening, Craig Flinn's cleverly named 2 Doors Down opened to the masses in mid-May.  A visit one Saturday night proved to have too long a wait for a table, so my girlfriend and I came back in the middle of the week and had much more success snagging a table.The interior can best be most concisely described as friendly. It's modern without being too minimalist or trying too hard, and warm reds and dark wooden tables and chairs make it feel comfortable.We were promptly seated and soon an extremely knowledgeable and professional server was over to take our drink orders. With some interwebs sleuthing beforehand, I knew that this place was a good spot for bourbons, so I jumped on one of their drinks of the day, a Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey cocktail, with a citrus muddle, this was a great summer drink for sure.When it came to food, I had to jump on one of their bar bites, a small appetizer unlisted on their permanent menu, the polenta fries. For my main, I was torn between the fried buttermilk chicken and the smoked pork chop, but the pork chop, with its deep fried mac and cheese soon won me over. And my other half is a chicken fan so I figured I could snag a bite of that anyway, because really that's what dating someone is all about.We got our polenta fries in short order and eagerly dug in. Half inch thick polenta fries popped out of a plain white fries container, stamped with the 2DD name, with a small dish of romesco sauce on the side - think a slightly chunky tomato sauce that packs a noticeable garlic punch. The fries are very crisp on the outside, very very smooth inside while still maintaining the texture of the cornmeal. Fantastic. The romesco makes the fries even better, and could pose a threat to the Heinz empire.There was a little bit of a wait for our mains, but we were kept thoroughly hydrated with water served in everyone's favourite milk bottle from Fox Hill Cheese House. This also reminded that I've been meaning to switch to their milk, which I did later that week. Getting back on track, when we got our mains, they were a sight to behold. A hefty smoked pork chop with apple and cranberry chutney leaned against a block of breaded and deep fried mac and cheese, next to asparagus that lay in a cream and whole grain mustard sauce. Eating with my eyes was great, but the traditional eating with my mouth was even better. The meat was slightly smoky and juicy, and the sweet and tangy chutney paired perfectly with it, altogether making for the best pork chop that I can ever recall having. The asparagus was perfectly cooked with a nice snap to it still and flavourful in its sauce. I was glad to see deep fried mac and cheese finally making its appearance in Halifax, and making the quick and delicious trip to my belly. Crispy on the outside, and cheesy on the inside with a great white cheddar-ish taste. My girlfriend's fried chicken turned out to be strips instead of the expected whole breast, drumstick, etc., but it was was still a winner with a crunchy breading and slightly tangy flavour from the buttermilk. The plate was rounded out in southern-ish fashion with sweet potato, a black bean and corn hash and a tasty hunk of cornbread.  You can be assured that I had more than one bite of this. While their cheesecake in a Mason jar was quite tempting, we ended up settling on the warm gingerbread for dessert. With a Baileys and butterscotch sauce, it was impossible to turn down. Lightly gingery, it went well with the sweet sauce, and a wonderfully light whipped cream and shreds of mint made for a very delicious and well balanced dessert. After being only out of the gate for a couple weeks, 2 Doors Down was hitting all the right notes, which deserves kudos unto itself. I'm looking forward to heading back in the future for more bourbon and well executed comfort food.PS. I realize that a certain restaurant reviewer for a local paper beat me to the punch with nearly the exact same meal, but let it be known that I did not copy off of him/her. However, let it also be known that since said reviewer has stopped having restaurants pay him/her to use his reviews, I will readily fill that space since I do not have silly things like journalistic integrity to worry about. Gotta pay dem bills.

<review# 416,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/16/2013,8/29/2013,29,84,,4,3>Popped into this conveniently located bakery when I was running a bit early this morning. A pleasant, tidy sort of place advertising muffins, scones, pastries & the like on their sandwich board. They have a small number of tables for those looking to linger. You can pick up breads & cookies packaged & ready to go, or single pastries from the case. Coffee is self service. Some eclairs & almond pastries were ready to go for $1.50 but I opted for pain au chocolate fresh from the oven & dusted with powdered sugar for just under $3 including tax. It was delicious with coffee and a very good example of this tasty treat. The service was very pleasant & I hope to come back for their lunch; I was told there are often ham & cheese croissants, just not today.

I am addicted to fatayer and this is the best place to get them if you can't get ahold of your favourite Lebanese baker.These little bundles of delightful dough are stuffed with meat, spinach or feta.. oh man... I am drooling just thinking about them! I have tried some of their sweets and Im not a major fan, but I really just want the dang fatayer anyways!
<review# 418,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/8/2013,8/27/2013,28,259,2,2,2>Downtown Halifax's little brother/sister doesn't disappoint.Plenty of fun to be had with their overflowing shelves of a plethora of candies and other novelty gifts. It's always bustling with folks, so it can be a task to get to the candies.I often find myself in there, spending more money than I should be on candy. Of course you pay more for the novelty of the candy but can you blame yourself? It's a store just beaming with fun and has a way of making you feel like a kid again and again.Take a step back into your childhood and let it be wide-eyed and giddy!
<review# 419,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2013,8/26/2013,66,321,,4,1>One of the best additions to Alderney Landing, the Alderney Farmers' Market and downtown Dartmouth.If you're not from around here, you probably don't know the name. Noggins is a farm in the Annapolis Valley that has wisely expanded their operations to both the Halifax Seaport and Dartmouth farmers' markets. And what makes the Dartmouth location so good? Well, for one thing, it's open all throughout the week. So if you're commuting by ferry, you can swing by and pick up something for dinner. Beyond carrying their own wide assortment of veg, they have a ton of locally-sourced products. Need some Foxhill cheese? They've got that. Want some maple syrup? Yes. How about Propeller ginger beer? That too. And so much more.Sure, it's pretty busy during the farmers' market hours (Saturday morning) but their extended hours mean you can get good stuff throughout the week. Prices are reasonable and the staff are both educated on their stock and approachable.
<review# 420,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2013,8/25/2013,59,150,3,3,2>This could be the most accurate and shortest review in Yelp history:Best milk ever. The end.It may seem fairy pricey at first because do have to pay for the bottles - which are super neat. They are, however, refillable, but not refundable. So, if you plan on indulging in all the greatness that is Foxhill's milk, and you will, you only have to pay for $2.25 fee (per bottle) once! The price is $3.00 for whole white milk or $3.25 for whole chocolate milk, per litre - which I know is a little pricy, but so, so worth it. I have two bottles, which I refill whenever I go to the market, one chocolate and one white. I should purchase more because the chocolate milk doesn't last a day, okay, it doesn't even last half of a day, honestly. They are only 1 litre bottles... and it's just that damn good.Even if you are, for some reason, uneasy about buying strange milk without trying it - not to worry - you can purchase a single glass.

I had gone to a few other places and did not get the FABULOUS service I received when visiting Always and Forever. She was very patient and kind when helping me and I a very picky bride. She made me feel very comfortable and welcome. Since finding my dress I have been back to try it on a few times and never once felt like I was being a pain. Thanks again Michelle for your great customer service and I would Highly recommend any Brides to be to visit Always and Forever for a great experience and welcome ness. I am sure I will be seeing you ladies again very soon to try my dress again before my big day August 2014.

The cats were happy and fed with a clean litter box when we returned home. Jessie sent us updates during the week (she offered to send them daily) with photos. Her price was great and I'd recommend her to anyone.
<review# 423,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2013,8/22/2013,1,5,,4,2>Hamachi Kita is definitely one of the best sushi spot in Halifax. I have been there 4 times now and every time I have been really happy with what I got.I always begin my sushi meal with some miso soup, theirs was good, not too salty but still very flavourful. The sushi is very fresh; there is just enough rice and plenty of fish. They're basic sushi are excellent. The fusion sushis are really original and they are AMAZING. It's always nice to have your basic spicy salmon but I love to add some special roll to my order and I find that Hamachi kita has the best variety. By the way, the hurricane roll is delicious. :)The décor is really nice although I tend to eat on the patio. As for the service, it is good, can be a little bit slow when its full but normally its quite fast. The waiters are nice and very courteous.All in all, Hamachi kita is an excellent sushi spot and I highly recommend you go check it out, you'll love it!
<review# 424,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2013,8/21/2013,26,201,,4,2>I super enjoy this place. I love the atmosphere and the variety of seating options. Especially the upstairs patio.The staff are always super helpful and friendly. I enjoy the foods as well. But I find it a tad pricey- but I feel like that is the way of the cafe these days. Just wish like some other cafes that they had some cheaper options. Gelato never disappoints. And the coffees/lattes....mmmmmmmmmmmmm........ Some of the best!
<review# 425,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/13/2013,8/20/2013,20,71,,3,2>Amazing food. I love the location and the atmosphere. I've been a few times, either for drinks and small plates after work or for a full on dinner. I haven't had a bad thing yet. The butcher's plate is always a sure thing. I fell in love with the fried rock hen but the menu changed and its gone now. Either way, you've gotta try this place.
<review# 426,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/14/2013,8/19/2013,27,128,,5,4>My husband spotted this place when we were both famished. We are vegan so we weren't sure they'd have anything but looked at the menu posted outside. They looked like they had some options so we went in. The waiter was extremely kind and helpful, letting us know what we could eat as a vegan. We ordered something called the Pad Seu Yei which they modified to make it vegan, as well as a spring roll. The food came quickly, presented nicely and ended up being extremely delicious. The atmosphere and decor was also extremely inviting and nice.
<review# 427,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/6/2013,8/18/2013,71,45,,5,1>Cheese Curds was one of the original "gourmet burger joints" during last year's burger wave that crashed into HRM. Since then they've also expanded to a second location in nearby Burnside. We visited a few weeks after opening and multiple times since then and I can honestly say that their service and offerings have been identical every time - which speaks to their commitment to consistency which is a plus in my books. The menu offerings are a bit overwhelming at first - many flavour combinations to decide amongst but once you get your choice narrowed down and you order your burger is crafted with love and devotion. I personally love kitchens open to the public eye where you can see how the operation works and this aspect of the business gives you something to occupy yourself while your burger cooks. If you're looking for fast food, go through the drive thru - here your wait means the end product will be cooked to perfection. The burger toppings are numerous and only work in conjunction with the meat to make one tasty entree. But don't stop at the burgers...you must also check out the poutine offerings. While you can opt for the traditional poutine with cheese curds and gravy atop hand cut fries, I suggest stepping outside the box and trying the butter chicken poutine - same great hand cut fries but with chicken and curry sauce over the cheese curds. I love this menu item so much I sometimes just skip the burger and just order this. Service is as fast as can be expected given they cook your burger from raw. All staff are personable and you can tell that working together as a team is an important element in the business' success. Hop the Woodside Ferry from downtown Halifax and come to the Darkside for a great burger (and poutine!). It really IS worth the wait.

I believe there were approx 40 people there.  The service was really good despite so many people and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  Their calamari is delicious.  I had the Two piece fish & chips and it was awesome but there was so much of it I couldn't finish it.I have never had a negative experience at Salty's. It's pretty much a sure thing.

I've redeveloped a love for CD's, after a few weeks of no music, I found myself craving it, so I started buying again. I first came here a few months ago and I just love this place. I have only been here twice but I'm already a huge fan. Cheap CD's and the girl, who was working both times I've visited, was nice and friendly. Good place for lost and hidden gems, great, cheap, and well conditioned CD's. Recommended all the way!
<review# 430,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2013,8/15/2013,26,94,3,2,4>I realize it is only a few months since I posted a review of Relish, but as I am taking part in Halifax's Burger Week (I want the Green Egg!) and Relish's burger sounded like one of the more unique ones of the participating joints - Burger with a Blueberry thyme chutney with Brie and back bacon.I think it is a really good burger. Blueberry and thyme do go well together and when they come together in the chutney it is pleasing. My minor complaint is that I didn't often get enough of the thyme.The service was excellent - friendly and efficient. And I got my second stamp... one day left so I guess it is a burger for lunch tomorrow. Burger week is one of the reasons I've gone on runs 8 straight days!
<review# 431,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/18/2013,8/14/2013,17,52,,4,1>After a 3 year hiatus due to some necessary travel on my end, I returned to Halifax to attend my beloved Greekfest which happens annually. Now just a bit of background: I love Greek food. I love Greece (and WILL travel there someday). I normally love Greekfest but this year I found it to be a little underwhelming. The weather was beautiful as it usually is on GreekFest weekend (I don't know how they do it!) and there were plenty of people around. However, I felt that things have gotten a lot more expensive than they used to be. I paid $6 for a simple chicken wrap that was no thicker than my wrist (and I have very tiny wrists) and another $14 for a plate which was good but I could have gone to one of the many amazing restaurants around and had the same thing for a lot less. We went during the day and there was some dancing and music but nothing over the top and I just didn't feel like there was anything there for me. Once you've experienced Greekfest one year, you're done - unless your Greek and in that case it's a huge family reunion. If I was Greek it would probably be my favourite weekend of the year but since I'm not, I was a little disappointed this time around.
<review# 432,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2013,8/12/2013,13,104,,4,3>I was at Pipa 3 weeks ago and again last night - and every time I go I say to myself 'I need to come back and try thisor this or this, etc.'There's just so much on their menu that I want to try!Last night was:- Nachos- Mushroom Escondidinho- Espetada - Madeira style  The nachos were okay - I would argue that the portions were small for the price (for also being veggie) and I was hoping there would be a lot more black beans that we got. Next was the mushroom escondidinho - the first one that arrived was pretty terrible to be honest, but after I discussed with the waitress why it was different than 3 weeks ago, she told me that the owners decided to mash up the potatoes instead of pureeing them. She offered to take it back and ask for a re-make and did just so within like 5 mins! What a great waitress! She apologized profusely as well. And here's the piece de resistance! My espetada was soooo friggin' good! I just couldn't believe how tasty and perfectly cooked the meat was. Ah, it's making me drool just thinking about it. Just the perfect amount of spices.Then when our bill came, she didn't even charge us for the mushroom app. Great all around!

It is poutine with hand cut fries, great gravy and curds and topped by 4 or 5 haddock bits ($6.99). Yum. My partner had fish sticks, 4 slender pieces of fish with a breading instead of the regular beer type batter. The breading was nicely spiced and herbed before being deep fried. A very yummy supper for $6.99
<review# 435,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2013,8/9/2013,21,105,,3,2>When my in-laws messaged two Sundays ago that they were on their way into Halifax and wanted brunch, we thought we'd head to a spot they have frequented often. That first stop was over packed with people waiting. Trying to think of a good alternative, Tess came to mind as we've driven by so many times never taking the time to stop in.Collectively we enjoyed a Burrito Crepe, the Belgian Waffle, and two Quiche dishes. All were excellent! The side green salads were a nice and fresh with a light dressing. My mother in law and I were both feeling pretty under the weather, but still could not resist and ate anyway. Our server was kind enough to bring us each a tea to help us feel better, which it did. The set up of this spot is unique for Halifax. I love the patio out front and how easy it is to find a street parking spot along the block. The interior kind of makes you feel like you're in a much warmer region of the world. I had a colleague bring up Tess the other day after also just discovering them and loving their crepes. They are almost like one of Halifax's best kept secrets, but as the good word spreads, I'm sure they too will soon have a line up for brunch... They are however, more worth the wait then many of the alternatives that already have lengthy lines. (Note that we personally never wait more than 10 minutes to be seated before seeking alternatives). This will be one of our destination of choice when up early enough for brunch on a Sunday or when making recommendations to guests of our city.
<review# 436,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2013,8/8/2013,13,44,,4,2>I was brought here by a friend of mine, and from the moment we uttered the secret phrase to exiting the bar, I was utterly enchanted by this secret spot under The Middle Spoon. The ambience is absolutely amazing, and the decor is just perfect. I can definitely say entering an establishment has never made me as giddy as this. It's just... it's a lot of fun! I can't wait to bring people here so they can experience it.The drinks are also amazing; it's not a place the survives on a gimmick. It's actually really phenomenal. The menu is quite extensive and offers something for every taste. Whether you're looking for something savoury to go with their delicious eats, or a sweet drink to wash down a dessert from upstairs, you're covered. The staff is also very helpful if you're overwhelmed, having an extensive knowledge of the menu. That being said, the drinks are expensive. This is a one or two drink kind of place! Probably one, for most people. Definitely one for me. Really, just go here. Get the password from the mailing list, and go! Look for the cactus light, let it be your beacon, and you won't regret it.

Invite Tarek's in, of course!!Tarek's opened in May, in my 'hood, and we've already been to the new location 4 or 5 times. As always, the food is simply fantastic. The menu is huge with wraps (OMG GOOD!), soups, salads, plates of delicious delicacies,  and hummus. Oh their hummus is so tasty...!!! And there's more - felafels, apps, and rumours of pizza coming soon. There's just so much food! And it's always hot, fresh, flavorful and delicious. The service is wonderful and friendly. And they'll remember who you are!This location is a pretty good size and they have some booths and tables around so you can eat-in or take-out. The new Tarek's is a fabulous addition to Spryfield and unlike the other location - this is NOT cash only! They take cash or debit, meaning that even if you forget to visit the bank machine you can still stuff your face with delicious garlicly, hummusy goodness!
<review# 438,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2013,8/6/2013,6,21,,5,3>Probably my favourite pub in Halifax. Beer is brewed in house. Beer is great here, no wait, EXCELLENT, especially the seasonal brews. Their Russian imperial stout is to die for. Food is straight forward pub food, not elaborate, but decently priced and tasty. The kitchen is not on the same floor, but in the basement and has to arrive via a little elevator, so when orders pile up, it can get a little slow. Decor and atmosphere is straight forward. You come here to enjoy the beer. The staff run this place. No manager to dictate the way staff act and what music is played. So, each staff member takes and delivers orders according to their own style. Sometimes with a big smile, a mohawk, or a polite grunt. Music varies from the occasional live band to staff chosen music like Pink Floyd, Radiohead or even jazz. No. Bieber. Here. Ever (Thank God). Trivia nights here are very popular. There are televisions, but they are smaller and you have to sit at the bar to see them easily.If you want to do a dual pub crawl, you can connect into Tom's Cuban Havana through a shared hallway, especially nice during the winter. Summers are great, when they open their windows. Alternatively, sit on their patio. Year round, early evenings tend to be busier, and it can be hard to get a seat. Sometimes the seating area upstairs is open, but I guess it depends on the staff.

The line can seem a little long and intimidating but in my experience long lines = good food. The staff here are awesome, super sweet, very efficient and I've noticed they have many of the regular's orders down pat. The dish comes with a small cabbage salad, potatoes, the option of steamed or fried rice (they let you do 1/2 & 1/2 if you wish) the delicious Seoul Chicken and the choice of either a potato patty or dumplings. It's super filling and comes to $7, taxes in. A pretty great deal, in my opinion. While I have yet to try their other dishes, the options are lemon chicken, spicy chicken, spicy pork, some sort of beef dish, red shrimp and bi bim bap.

We walked down Argyle Street not really knowing where we would (over)indulge in delicious breakfast food. We see the sign " Ceasars - $3.75.SOLD! To the Argyle we go.. My friend must eat gluten free which they have a menu for; *thumbs up*..All I'm looking for is hollandaise sauce, because let's face it.. it's delicious!She had some egg sandwich thingy .. a real mess it seemed as yolk was all over her face and hands. She said it was delicious and the gluten free bun was fluffier than what she was used to with gluten free options, awesome. I had the Fritatta breakfast pizza, my very first breakfast pizza... A little skeptical of course I was... Hey, but it was pretty good, and it came with that favorite sauce of mine for dipping! So, Breakfast was  A-1.Oh and the Ceasar's ? Delicious!
<review# 442,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2013,8/1/2013,8,31,,4,2>I finally visited this restaurant with a couple of friends when our first choice of restaurant was too packed to get a table. They were crowded, too, but found us one anyway. I can't say much about the ambiance -- early evening on a quiet night with a reservation would probably be romantic, but I found it a bit too crowded to be what I expected.The food more than made up for it. I ordered their vegetarian asparagus pasta (either linguini or fettuccine, I forget which) and adored it. Anything asparagus makes me happy, but this was so delicious. One of my friends ordered the halibut without mushrooms and they accidentally brought it with mushrooms. They immediately came back to retrieve it, apologized, made another, and apologized some more. Apparently, the fish was so good it was worth the wait.Then, the triple-layer butterscotch/caramel pie. Wow. I kid you not, my friend thought it was spiked because her taste buds were so happy afterwards, and I suppose mine were, too... it was hard to hear over the chorus of Hallelujahs coming from my stomach. (Yeah, their food is delicious.)The food and great service bumps this from four stars to five.

From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with smiles and friendly service, with very little pretension.My mom and I didn't actually get further than the gelato counter at first. The friendly girl behind the counter let us try every single one of their amazing selections, before we finally settled on a wee scoop each. I swear, she gave us a whole serving just in samples! She was clearly very proud of the gelato and of working at Humani-T. And you know what? That's the difference from a good place and an amazing place. It makes it somewhere I want to give my dollars to. I'm definitely going to come back to try a selection from their amazing bakery cake, or a sandwich or soup. If they served booze, they'd blow The Middle Spoon out of the water as a dessert nightspot.
<review# 444,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/23/2013,7/30/2013,42,100,,2,3>I've been meaning to update my thoughts of this place for a while now here on Yelp and have now finally decided to do it. I tried Cantina several times when they first opened and while I thought it was okay, I did feel it was underwhelming. As I said in my original review, I wanted to like it more and improvements could be made.They were!I get the burrito when I come here and unlike before, they do put the finished burrito on a grill for a minute or so so that it is hot throughout. And while my preference is for the beef burrito, I got the chicken one last time I was there and it was great! I haven't tried any of their other mains yet because I honestly really like the burrito. There's a small selection of toppings in addition to the (by default) beans and rice. There's also several salsas to choose from as well ranging from mild to their version of "x-hot". Surprisingly, the x-hot does live up to its name though I suspect some restaurants might label it "hot" and label their "hots" as mediums, since I don't consider them too spicy.If asked if I thought this place had the best mexican fare in town, I'm not sure how I'd answer. I do very much like the burrito but other things to consider when ranking or rating a place includes things like service, location and setting. One of the most appealing things to me about Cantina Mexican is that it's located just off of Spring Garden Road and since I spend a lot of my time downtown, it's convenient for me. It also has enough seating, which was something Burrito Jax lacked (up until several months ago) so that also helps the appeal of this place.Cantina Mexicana has become my go-to Saturday afternoon eat-out spot these past few weeks and it's always a pleasant choice!

It is a great workout and what really sets this place apart from just a spin class is all the extra stuff like tonights class for example was also yoga so we did some spinning and some yoga as well. I can't wait to go back and try more. Also you get a cold towel after each spin class. I love this place.

Just one of those places you continually drive by.Went in with some family from out of town as they had heard True North had some of the best Fish around town. I thought... Really??? When looking for fish in particular the general rule of  thumb for me has always been to go to a place that specializes in Seafoood.So they ordered the 2 pc Fish & chips. Portion size was perfect. In fact my Dad had a hard time putting it all away.....and that is not usually the case!I went with the special of the day: Haddock Tips.I really enjoyed these. They were only very lightly coated & that was all they needed. They were superb ;)My portion was OK. I was able to eat it all- so no waste, but prob could have done with 2 or 3 more pieces of haddock. Id have eaten the fish over the french fries!I look forward to making sure to stop in again..... This time not waiting so many years!!!
<review# 448,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2013,7/26/2013,12,118,,2,3>So I walk by here every single weekday on my way to work in the morning, and back to the ferry in the evening (although they are usually closed by then).I had a pretty bad week so I decided that today I was going to treat myself to something from TIBS. Well I walked away with a provolone/proscuitto croissant and a chocolate chip cookie. It didn't even concern me that the croissant was $5 because I knew it would be good.The croissant was amazing, I ate it cold but had an after thought that I should have heated it a little bit. I've never had a croissant so yummy and flavorful! The cookie, as always, is delicious (only ate a tiny piece so far, saving it for later!)I definitly recommend this place, and it's a plus to see them baking things fresh everyday. It's going to be hard to resist buying their goodies all of the time!
<review# 449,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2013,7/25/2013,27,107,3,6,3>I like beer.  I like their beer.  I visit this shop ever couple of weeks for a refill of the growlers.  Always have plenty on tap and the do beer mixes which I quite enjoy!If there is any lacklustre comment to be made, it's that service is uneven. Sometimes I go in there and the staff is helpful, giving advice. Other times, it is perfunctory. Get me in, get me out.  But maybe that's the way for most shops.If you like delicious beer, here's a spot for you.
<review# 450,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2013,7/24/2013,54,227,,7,2>This is one of the best downtown takeout lunch spots. Great service, awesome prices, and loads of options.I knew I loved this place a lot when they allowed me to order a "salad trio" comprised of couscous, rice, and grape leaf rolls. So delicious, not too heavy for lunchtime, and amazing value.
<review# 451,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2013,7/21/2013,7,40,2,4,3>BACON! I feel like that is all I really need to say, but to be serious Canadian Bacon Cookhouse makes a great sandwich. I had the Simply "Dill"icious sandwich which totally rocked, it had really good quality bacon, pickles and dill pickle chips. My friends had the club and I was basically drooling over it but  avocado and bacon are basically my 2 favourite things. We checked it out opening weekend and you could tell that the owner enjoyed what he was doing and he spent a few minutes talking to us, letting us know about what they had to offer and joking around (bacon/pork puns included).  As a treat I got a piece of chocolate covered bacon (served on a stick) to share and was not disappointed. I think it was a fun way of selling it and it will be funny to see tourists walking around the waterfront this summer eating bacon on a stick.
<review# 452,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2013,7/19/2013,7,53,3,6,2>I don't know why I haven't written about this all time favourite diner before.  I found an old picture I took last time I was there which made me think of it.  I unashamedly love John's Lunch.  Yes I love the fried yummy, yummy, goodness of it all.  My favourite (OK it's the only thing I order) is the Clams & Chips.  Sometimes I order just a plate of clams so I can have more clams. ;)  When I was going to the old NSCC in the late 80's it was just down the road and we would treat ourselves to a once a month visit and no one was ever ever disappointed.  My will power keeps me from going more than once a year....yes sad eh?  And if not for that we at least take my son when he is in town visiting.  He and my husband get the fish and chips or haddock tips and chips.  The batter is great (they let me have a sneak bite or two) and everyone likes the fries too (frozen ones - who cares sometimes).Now the weird thing is - I now work close by and I've only been once in 2 years.....all the ladies at my work keep telling me how bad it is for me - like I don't know!  I think I'm due for a visit just talking of it.Thanks to the great folks that keep this place alive and kicking.  Thanks for the always great food and service.  And lastly thanks for being just what you are and not pretending to be anymore - a great diner!
<review# 453,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2013,7/18/2013,34,12,3,7,2>I've eaten here a couple of times and I've been really pleased! I'm a huge pulled pork fan, so I've ordered that twice. I had mine with cornbread and mac n' cheese, and I was pleased both times! I have no complaints about Boneheads - a great go-to for a stick-to-your ribs, finger-lickin' meal that tastes so homemade you'd swear your Dad had just bbq'd up a storm in the back yard! That being said, I've been known to make a preeettttty delish pulled pork at home in the ol' slow cooker (which I've been doing as of late rather than buying it at a restaurant.) BUT, if I'm looking for a great pulled pork sandy on the run, this is a great go-to. It's located right down at the end of Barrington, so it's close enough to everything, but generally easier to locate parking than some other downtown restaurants!Good price, nice staff, cute restaurant! What's not to love? I've tried other BBQ spots in the city, and this one is by far the best I've had! Props to Boneheads for doin' BBQ right!
<review# 454,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2013,7/17/2013,39,80,7,6,4>So here's the deal. I LOVE Panang Curry Beef. As in love it so much that it is in fact the only dish I've ever ordered when dining in at Cha Baa Thai. I especially love it at lunch time. It's become a monthly treat for me and some of my coworkers to head over to Queen Street at lunch and order their $10 *(yes, that's right, I did say $10!!!!) lunch combos. And typically, all three of us will order #6 - the Panang Curry. And when it promptly arrives at our table we will fall into silence while we worship the goodness of the sweet spicy heat. Perfect little lunch spring roll, perfect steamed rice, perfect spicy tender beef and veggie curry. Get in my face! Everytime I go back I think I should branch out and try something new. But then I remember the quiet silence of three of us enjoying our lunch so damn much and I can't do it. Combo #6 every time. Lunch bliss every time.
<review# 455,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2013,7/16/2013,20,226,,4,4>Holy amazing experience Batman.  This was the best dining experience I've ever had.The in-laws reserved a private room at the Prince George for a family celebration.  The room itself (the Hanover Room) was beautiful and the perfect size for our party.  The menu is small but varied with something for everyone, from the play-it-safes (chicken, salmon) to the more adventurous (swordfish, elk).We had a host of hors d'oeuvres and the wine flowed freely.  Our group tried just about everything on the menu and it was all amazing.  I had the swordfish and I can honestly say it was probably the best seafood dish I've eaten in my life.  The ghocchi was ridiculous and the chocolate junkie for dessert was to die for.  I can't rave enough about the high quality, creativity and care taken with the food.The service?  Was impeccable. We had one "main" server and another two who helped clear the table. Our glasses were never empty, the stream of food from the kitchen was steady, and she was ever-present while inconspicuous.  The most professional server I've ever had.Do yourself a favour, save your pennies and go to Gio.  Our visit was an all-around exceptional experience.
<review# 456,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/25/2013,7/15/2013,18,38,2,4,3>So... I have the side of my head shaved. Pretty cool, I know!But what I didn't realize is that hair grows quickly (I've never had my hair that short before, so it's all new to me!)... I also didn't feel like spending a whole lot of money to get it shaved by my hair stylist. So my little brother recommended that I just walk up the street and go see Phat, and I thought, why not?He's awesome. He knows every single customer by name (like he knew who my brother was and my brother does not go there regularly, he likes his shaggy look).Anyway, he did an awesome job with my hair.. and guess what? It only cost $8.00 for my side to be shaved. Sweet!
<review# 457,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2013,7/14/2013,61,77,3,5,3>So saddened to hear Jane's left the common but HEYYYYY YA super pumped that I can fill my gut with her goodness close to my work. The coffee Gods placed a coffee card on my desk one day and I've been smitten ever since. It is literally the cutest place you ever did see. Super tiny but packed with personality and goodness. I spent a copious amount of time rummaging through the to-go fridge. It's such a great idea for someone who just wants to grab something and bring it back to their desk to eat. Not to mention, taking dinner home after work. It appeared that I rummaged up an appetite as what was supposed to be a latte trip turned into a square-soup-biscuit trip. Hilariously enough my soup could've came from space for all I know. After ordering, the girl called my soup in over the phone and out popped a man from the back door. It was the neatest thing. The latte was bomb. The soup was hearty and delicious. The biscuits were buttery and decadent. But the squares, ohhhh those squares. I've never seen such perfectly cut squares in all my life. They tasted perfect too. Needless to say I've been back, multiple times. M'swell put my office right in there.
<review# 458,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2013,7/13/2013,5,27,3,3,1>I used to live further away from Layers.  Far enough that it was kind of a pain to get there, find parking, etc.  Those were safer times.Now I can walk there.  I find myself thinking about it ALL THE TIME.  If I ran there, would I burn enough calories to be able to have a cupcake every day?  My trainer tells me no.  I don't live far enough away.I'm not a big chocolate lover, but this place could convert me.  So far my favourite is the vanilla salted caramel cupcake.  I also love white chocolate macadamia, lemon raspberry, vanilla strawberry, and red velvet.The cake is always so, so moist, and I don't know what she does with her icing.... it is heavenly.If you're thinking of heading to Layers on a weekend, go early in the day.  They sometimes sell out before closing time, especially if it's a holiday weekend of any kind.
<review# 459,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2013,7/12/2013,24,132,4,7,3>This place makes me wish I worked downtown!I would eat lunch here every day!Down right phenomenal!The burger is juicy, delicious, fresh, cover it with cheese and bacon and I am in my happiest of happy places!The price is the best price for this kind of burger anywhere!Man I will be back, as often as I can!
<review# 460,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/14/2013,7/11/2013,38,94,,9,2>Decided to drop by here during lunch hour after hearing all the fuss about the food and smoked meat.I love the style & vibe this place is trying to recreate, if I was within walking distance, I'd drop by more often.On this day, I tried their special which was the mac & cheese & half smoked meat sandwich for ~12$While other reviews get picky about the meat and authenticity of its source (hey I lived in Montreal too), bottom line is that the sandwich is a lot better than many other joints in town.The mac & cheese, or should I say mac & cheese with bits of smoked meat is naughty. It's a tad different than what I was expecting. I liked how it thickened as it cooled off.The only downside is that with a pop, I paid ~17$ which to me is a few dollars more than my threshold for a lunch meal.
<review# 461,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2013,7/10/2013,70,95,4,7,4>Oh yes!!!I've been on the hunt for authentic Chinese. The plethora of places I've been too since moving to Halifax have failed me in my search...Until I walked into 9 + Nine.If you are going somewhere else for your fix of Chinese goodness I highly suggest you give this little hole in the all in Clayton Park a try and do it quickly before word gets out on how amazing this place is. Here are some tips;*Bring an appetite* Bring a few friends to share as many dishes as possible.*Get the Ginger Beef and Hot Spicy Chicken*Add a side of Singapore noodlesWord on the street is the owner trained with Martin Yan (Yan Can Cook). If you are unfamiliar with that name do yourself a favor and give him a little google so you know what you're getting yourself in for...The food is amazing.The service is pretty rocking (super super nice people)You can special order pretty much anything (that means you can veer off the standard menu)One of the servers took a few minutes to explain their specialty rice pot: You should come with at least 4 people and make reservations. It's a big freaking pot full of rice and everything you can think of....I saw a large group having a hey day with one and I was completely jealous. hmmmm, I'm thinking special yelp event trip to Nine+!Seriously people, take the trip over to Clayton park and finally eat some authentic Chinese!!!
<review# 462,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2013,7/9/2013,16,94,2,3,2>So far, this is the best sports bar!! (that I've been to)The servers are super friendly but sometimes slow. The beer is cold, and always flowing! They have some decent deals on pitchers (if you like Canadian and Coors!)Now lets talk wings. Being from Alberta I am used to having cheap wings. Not Nova Scotia cheap (I'm sorry .50-.70 cents a wing is NOT cheap!). But for the price you get a really good wing! You have your choices of breaded, no breading, big breaded, spicy, garlic and boneless. And if that isn't hard enough for you there is also 58-ish sauces!! Seriously. I counted once, but I was also drinking so don't take my word for it...So head there and get your fingers dripping with sauce...wait that sounds bad
<review# 463,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2013,7/8/2013,38,43,2,9,2>There's a reason Halifax Stanfield International Airport has won so many awards. It is a very easy, efficient airport. Clean adequate washrooms, easy lay-out and pleasant staff keeps everything moving along. Sure it doesn't have the most restaurants or stores. But what it does have is quite good. Free wi-fi is located through out the airport. The seats are also quite comfortable so don't worry too much if you have a long wait. It's not a bad spot. The parking area has been increased and is comparable to most airport parking fees. You'll be surprised by how helpful and friendly everyone is. I always am. Note for US Pre-Clearance passengers: Once you go through security and pre-clearance you only have a convenience store and a very mediocre bar. The bar does serve breakfast but it isn't good. We're talking eggs from a carton here. So stock up on munchies before you go through.
<review# 464,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/2/2013,7/7/2013,15,59,,5,2>I love sushi, I really do. I've made it a bit of a mini quest to try every sushi place in Halifax. There are quite a few. Dharma-Sushi is one of my favorite go to sushi restaurants I've found on said quest. I especially love a trip to Dharma for lunch. They offer the usual Japanese fare but also have a delicious selection of bento boxed lunches and daily specials. The prices are reasonable for a quick and filling sit down lunch. Tuesday and Thursday are my preferred days to visit for lunch. They offer a $9.95 bento of tempura, California roll, salad, chicken teriyaki and rice. They also carry my favorite Japanese soft drink, Calpico. A strange mixture of cherry and milk flavor only Japan could offer. I've found the service to be quick and friendly during every lunch hour I've visited. The sushi is fresh and delicious. Which is all I really desire. That, and BBQ eel. They have both. Yum.
<review# 465,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2013,7/6/2013,18,151,,5,2>As a lifelong hater of all things seafood, I can't believe that I now experience cravings for sushi - but thank god for AYCE sushi restaurants! This was my first time at such an establishment, but my boyfriend had frequented them back in Ontario and had lots of good things to say.We arrived shortly after 11 and were the first customers. I was surprised by the large size of the restaurant - it doesn't look like much from the outside. The tables were well-spaced and the decor was simple yet attractive. We were promptly seated by a pleasant lady who explained the ordering sheet and accompanying menu booklet. Our food came very quickly (naturally), but continued to do so even as the restaurant filled up with the lunchtime crowd. I can certainly see how things could become a bit slow - this is one popular place!We took full advantage of the AYCE - we ordered a few servings of shrimp and veggie tempura (extremely light and crispy - some of the best I've had!), pork chops, beef teriyaki, and 8-9 different sushi rolls. The futomaki rolls and crispy yam rolls were particularly good, as was the Red Dragon Roll...first time I've eaten raw salmon, but certainly not the last! Everything was of good quality. We ate more than we could handle, but somehow managed to clean our plates. Considering the vast quantity of food we consumed, the price was right!Great atmosphere, cheerful and efficient servers, fantastic food - we will definitely be coming back!
<review# 466,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/29/2013,7/5/2013,24,41,3,4,2>I... do... not... like... Greek... Food! Keep that in mind and truly appreciate it in this review. I don't. I don't love it at all, but that's just a personal preference. Anyway, away we go! I checked into Athens this weekend for a part of the Yelp UYE Breakfast Club, and had just a great time! Mind you, it was Breakfast, and I love Breakfast.Food: 5/5I ordered the Hercules breakfast plate, and this is what I got. A chock-a-bloque full plate of pancakes, ham, bacon, greek sausage, eggs, hashbrowns, toast, and a single perogie to top it all off. I love a full plate of food, and I always boast how a restaurant's "full" plate does not meet my standard of over-the-top full. This one, however, came as close as any possible could. The last two or three bites were sheer determination, as I didn't want to send the plate back with a single piece of food on there. But the taste? Equaled the size easily! It was all delicious. Came out nice and hot, and flavourful. Who can ask for more?Price: 4/5I love a bargain, and though I've seen better prices in some places, this was still great. My huge plate (that could easily have been split between two people) was only a very reasonable $13.99. There was also a much smaller (but good size plate just the same) breakfast special on for $6.95. These are greasy spoon diner prices for top notch sit down restaurant food and experience.Location/Atmosphere: 5/5Nice, central Quinpool location with its own parking lot (NOT a common thing in the Quinpool area). Inside was nice too. Comfy seats, large tables, not too noisy, and just a good spot.Service: 5/5Great friendly service. Have you often considered asking your server to sit down and join your for food because they seemed like they'd be great company in a group that is having random conversations about local joints, movies, and tv shows? Because we did. We even asked, and though she obviously couldn't because she was working hard, she still joined in the conversations with us when she could. She was quick with the food, friendly, and very accommodating when we had a question or wanted a substitution or anything. Can't ask for more there!All in all, it was a great first visit for me to Athens. I don't know how I'd feel about a Green dinner, as, like I'd said, I just don't enjoy traditional Greek fare... BUT... after this visit, I would seriously consider it. I'd go back, and recommend the place to anyone looking for a wicked breakfast. Maybe when I get a chance to try a later dinner, I'll be able to say the same about lunch or supper!
<review# 467,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2013,7/4/2013,48,65,1,5,2>I absolutely love the food here! Such a different combination of flavors than standard lunch fare in the city. I always get the "V6" (Veggie Spring Roll & Fried Tofu with Vermicelli), but I've heard great things about their pho and other dishes.The service is always pleasant and fairly quick, and it's great spot for takeout, too.My only gripe is that it's very diner style, in that the seating isn't super comfortable and the atmosphere... well, there isn't one.
<review# 468,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2013,7/3/2013,11,40,,4,1>This is honestly my favourite place on the Halifax harbourfront.  It is absolutely delicious. My favourite thing to get is their panko crusted haddock tips.  They are like little morsels of deliciousness in my mouth and you get quite a bit for a decent price!  The fish tastes fresh and even though it's deep fried, it doesn't feel oily.Definitely a must try if you're in Halifax!
<review# 469,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2013,7/2/2013,4,4,2,2,3>Deciding my university major was easier than choosing between the amazing selection of decadent desserts on display at this place! Yet at the same time, you really can't go wrong, no matter what you choose, as all of the cheesecakes are amazing. The desserts are divine, the ambience is lovely, and the experience exquisite, to the last detail. Perfect for any occasion, although the cheesecakes are an occasion in and of themselves.
<review# 470,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/3/2013,7/1/2013,22,150,,5,3>Went here yesterday to meet up with a few Yelpers for a dim sum brunch.  The last time I had dim sum was years ago in Toronto, back then the restaurant we went to had carts circling the restaurant and you picked your dishes from them.  I kind of miss that but ordering off  a menu isn't so bad and you get a better sense of what you are getting.I loved every dish we tried, well, I took a pass on the steamed chicken feet, if they'd been fried I might have had a go but with steamed it's a texture thing. Dumplings steamed and fried, pork and shrimp; tofu, squid, stuffed egg plant, noodles, turnip cake, sticky rice, steamed pork buns and spring rolls.  I think that about covers it, that's the beauty of having a larger group, you get to try a variety. And a few pots of green tea to wash it down.  All for a reasonable price.Service was attentive and very helpful when asked what each contained.  It would have been better if the menu had been more forthcoming as to what each dish contained, especially since we had a vegetarian and one allergic to seafood. For example, surprised the stuffed eggplant and turnip cake both contained shrimp.All in all an enjoyable time with good food and good company.  Worth a return visit.
<review# 471,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2013,6/30/2013,3,8,,3,1>This is the best laundromat in the city! Since I moved to the north end, I've been going to another one which is dirty, has no staff on duty, and a majority of broken machines. As soon as I found Murphy's (major bus route) and walked in, the super nice lady told me where the nearest bank machine was and gave me my change UP FRONT for my wash so I could 'save time'. It's next door to a fab local cafe, two minute walk from grocery and convenience stores, and has dry cleaning and alterations on site. Very impressed but especially with the pleasant, helpful staff. Thumbs up!
<review# 472,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/24/2013,6/29/2013,20,178,,3,1>The location is very convenient for anyone that lives in the Regency Park Drive neighborhood of Clayton Park. The salon has about four chairs for hair services and a private room for the esthetician. We booked three appointments for nail services which were reasonably priced, although the online price list is out of date. As demonstrated by numerous certifications hung on the wall Alayne, the esthetician, has many years of experience in the business. Alayne was very kind and accommodated the three of us in her room so we could chat and served us coffee/tea. The space is simple but spotless and provides all standard OPI nail products and relaxing spa music.

He came bouncing through the door with more energy than he likely knows what to do with!The portions they give you are HUGE.  None of us could finish our meals. My fried ginger beef was amazing.  It definitely packs a good punch of heat.  Its got good ginger flavor and heat without the stingy/burny feeling ginger often gives.  The spring rolls were quite delish as well.  I also noted how crispy their egg rolls were.  Usually you get them and they're mushy and gross.  Not these ones.  And their filling was quite good too - not that weird mushy reminds-me-of-cat-food pasty filling you usually get.  I can see how they've been voted best chinese.  They've figured out what works and have stuck with it.  One of the guys at work commented that he usually orders the same thing from them and every time its the same.  So they've figured it out and kept it consistent, and clearly it works!  Two big thumbs up!
<review# 474,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2013,6/27/2013,11,51,,4,2>I'm not sure whether to kick myself for not going sooner, or going more often; but Java Blend is one brew that's well worth the visit.There's a reason you could go by just about any day of the week and see the place positively buzzing with activity.  They know their stuff, they do it well, and man oh man is it ever good.The cafe itself was kind of small, but it had the feel of a good old-fashioned coffeehouse.  As I mentioned before, it's pretty much constantly buzzing, so if you want to sit and enjoy your coffee, you might be waiting a bit; but that in no way diminishes from the experience.The service too is some of the fastest I've experienced anywhere, be it a big chain or other small local joints.  The staff make it both fast and friendly, which works very well to their credit.If you love coffee like I do, you'll love Java Blend.  A bit off the beaten downtown path, but well worth the visit.
<review# 475,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2013,6/25/2013,65,55,,4,2>I can honestly admit that I've walk by the Hideaway on numerous occasions and never really paid attention to the space. Luckily my friends are more observant and suggested it for a Saturday night dinner. The space is actually much bigger than it appears. It has a cozy dinning area at the front of the restaurant with street views but then it actually expands all the way to the back of the building where they have a large table - perfect for group functions!The menu is impressive - not overwhelmingly huge but enough goodies to put some thought into it. We started with the bruschetta which was delicious!! What made this bruschetta different from others I've tried is that they placed the toppings (including balsamic drizzle - my fav) on top of a warm, deliciously moist baguette. It was a great change-up to the traditional!After my love affair with fish tacos in LA last June, I decided saw them on the menu and had to try them. They were served in hard taco shells instead of soft which made them a little harder to manage but they were still delicious. The mango salsa was very fresh and flavourful against the haddock.My dinner pals had steak and chicken salad and both had nothing but rave reviews. All in all, I think the Hideaway is a great addition to the neighbourhood and I can't wait to go back and try a few more menu items.
<review# 476,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2013,6/24/2013,0,10,,8,3>Fastest, easiest, best experience I've had getting a tattoo. The shop itself is really clean and open, and they have a lovely receptionist who greets you when you come in.I literally walked in off the street with no appointment, and about half an hour later I had my tattoo. I had already drawn it exactly how I wanted so they just scanned it and made a stencil, which took all of 10 seconds.The artist (Matt) was really nice and he did a great job replicating my own handwriting. The tattoo is now healed, it's in really good shape and I love it.If I decide to get another one, I will definitely be going back to Utility. I have two tattoos from several years ago and I can honestly say this is the first one that really means something to me and I'm glad I came here to do it.
<review# 477,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/27/2012,6/23/2013,40,216,2,4,3>We're all familiar with the ubiquity of Mediterranean restaurants in Halifax. There's even a smattering of Persian restos around too. Acadian restaurants? Not so much. Mediterranean, Persian AND Acadian? Welcome to Nova Scotia and welcome to the puntastic Garden of Eat'n.From what I've read, I understand that GoE is simply the previous restaurant at this address, 308 South, with a new owner, name and a Persianified menu. Having never been to 308 South, I can't attest to any changes in decor or service, but Garden of Eat'n seems to have a good thing going. In an effort to whittle down the list of new restaurants on Quinpool I hadn't tried yet, my girlfriend and I arrived on a Tuesday evening to find it surprisingly bustling, with a few tables put together for a group and most of the rest occupied by other couples. We were seated at one of the few remaining tables and perused the large menu while we waited for our drinks. It's some significant reading with several pages and several dozen offerings of varying international foods. Due to its uniqueness to the city though, I had to go with some of the Acadian fare.I've had rappie pie before, but only the pre-made frozen sort that you can buy at the grocery store, so I wanted something a bit more authentic. And what could be more authentic than rappie pie at a Mediterranean/Persian restaurant, amiright?! Thankfully it came with a side salad of your choice, as who needs a side of fries or other starchy fare when your entree itself is re-hydrated potatoes and animal fat? So I went with the Caesar and also got an order of beef kibbi as an appetizer.Considering the hustle and bustle of the place, the food didn't take long to arrive. Initially I was disappointed in the kibbi, as there was only three lonely  pieces,  with some shredded lettuce, red onion, and a few pita wedges to fill up the plate. What kibbi there was though was good, with a crunchy exterior and a meaty and herby filling.When the rappie pie arrived, it was more or less what I expected. It's hard to do any sort of impressive presentation for rappie pie, it's a slab of re-hydrated potatoes, fat and chicken cooked in a pan to form a crustless 'pie'. But like myself, you don't have to look good to be good. It was pleasingly salty without being overwhelming, and managed to have a noticeable chicken flavour, with a good amount of meat strewn throughout it, and it had a nice crust on top for a bit of textural contrast without being difficult to cut through. While I was familiar with rappie pie, my girlfriend hadn't tried it before so I gave her a bite, but she wasn't a fan of it's admittedly mushy texture.Service was friendly and attentive over the course of the evening and deserves bonus marks since there was only one server for the whole place.Being the fan of diversity that I am, I hope Garden of Eat'n survives the turnover that has accorded at this address in the past few years and continues to serve up its unique mix of foods to the QPR area.
<review# 478,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2013,6/22/2013,29,84,,4,3>I had a great experience here a few days ago. With a late morning meeting downtown I was looking for a filling early lunch before heading back to my office. Wandering through the Scotia Square mall I was looking for something reasonably healthy but also with enough substance to get me through the day. I tried out the Dill Pickle and the staff were super friendly and efficient. When I asked for the chicken feta wrap and then requested spinach, it turned out I would have been charged extra for spinach, but the server suggested switching to the chicken florentine, which included spinach and my choice of cheese, plus lots of other fresh veggies. I chose feta and voila! Got the sandwich I wanted without being charged extra. My wrap was just over $6 with tax included.The wrap was full of fresh veggies, just the right amount of dressing, and lots of chicken. It totally kept me going all day, and made me wish this place was located a lot closer to my office so I could go there again soon.
<review# 479,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2013,6/21/2013,19,100,,5,2>What a gorgeous renovation of that room! The place was just lovely and the staff were friendly and efficient. It was busy on a Friday lunchtime so there was a short wait, but everyone was extremely courteous!The place is a little loud, but not so that you need to shout to chat with your dining companion. I had the pork belly slider. The sandwich was divine, loved it. The slaw was a tiny bit lackluster perhaps. Good kick from the kimchi, but not enough acid, would have liked another hit of vinegar. My mum had the mussels and was very pleased. We didn't try desserts, but I will be sure to, next time i go in. For there will definitely be a next time!
<review# 480,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/29/2012,6/20/2013,76,115,,4,3>Visited this place for the first time last night at the recommendation of friends. We had five people and so were lucky enough to grab the one booth at the front, right of the resto, which meant we had an interesting street view and privacy from other diners (it's not a big place and all the tables minus the booth seat 4 only, so you may want to make a reservation if you plan on taking a larger group). This place is nothing fancy - it's pretty small and dark and the decor is nothing to write home about. However, the twinkle lights on the walls and candles give it a nice evening ambiance and ultimately the 'look' doesn't matter if the quality of the food and service is not good (imho). And we definitely weren't disappointed on food OR service! We had two different waitresses serving us, which got a bit confusing, but it was lovely that they were so attentive. The menu is not huge but many of the options sounded great. I ended up getting the Shrimp Linguine and it was delish. Lots of herbs, slices of pepper, bits of bacon and feta cheese. Lots of flavour. Definitely a good portion and you can tell the ingredients are fresh. My one complaint is that the shrimp had tails, which made it tough to eat in a pasta, but this is just a personal preference and not a comment on the quality of the dish. The dishes from the "middle" section of the menu all come with your choice of soup or salad and garlic bread so you definitely won't starve here! No complaints at all about the caesar and bread - both were yummy. I also had a glass of white wine that was good and well-priced ($6.50), however there aren't many drink choices so this is definitely a place you come to for eating, not cocktailing. Everything is well-priced - me and my boyfriend's dinner (including pasta and sides for both and my wine) came to a little over $40. Parking is a bit of a pain here since it's on a busy street right around a curve (no parking in front - have to try and find space in one of the side streets, which can be difficult on a busy night due to all the apartments). But the good news is, once you DO find a spot and head into this little joint, you will have a great meal and service coming to you!
<review# 481,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2013,6/19/2013,26,201,2,4,3>I actually LOVE this place.  The atmosphere is also fantastic- with a buzz in the air. It's not dirty like many other pubs, their bathrooms even have dyson hand dryers and tvs. I like it.So with all the wood being from different parts of Ireland, I like the authentic feel and not the cheesie "everything in here says Guinness and shamrock" feel that other pubs (e.g. Pogue) give you.Servers are always great- and do an amazing job juggling that many people- scattered all around the place. Literally, people are everywhere. They also have a decently sized patio which I enjoy in the summer.Now the food and drink- fantastic. I love their unique cocktails and they have a great beer selections. Wine is pretty cheap too! The food never disappoints. The flatbreads are scrumptious, and they have an awesome variety for apps. Blarney chips being a drinking favorite.  Their fish is always fresh, and the entrees seem a cut above pub food. Easily some of the best pub dining in this city.One of my new pre-hockey game spots!
<review# 482,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/24/2010,6/18/2013,79,899,1,7,1>Phil's seems to be a favourite of Halifax, the night we went there, it was lined up. We were fortunate, the wait was not too long. It was a Sunday evening, and as we stood there the waitress was telling people they were going to run out of fish. I could not believe it. We were served by a waitress who was run off her feet, it was crazy busy. The fish arrived, fresh, done to perfection, fries were crisp and the onion rings were tasty as well. Phil's batter is much lighter than most fish and chips. The atmosphere at Phil's is pretty standard, plenty of talking, it got pretty loud at one point. Phil's is a great family restaurant. Oh, by the way, the did run out of fish! That is a lot of people served.
<review# 483,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2010,6/17/2013,14,258,7,7,5>Dear Chicken Burger, Did you know you're my favorite place to eat in Halifax? Well, you are!Love,AdamI think, if I had the wheels, the money and the time I would eat here everyday. This is a place that always delivers for me. In all the years I've been visiting the Chicken Burger, I've never had a bad experience. I love taking old friends, new friends, family and well wishers out here, especially if they've never been. They usually walk away with a new love.Maybe I'm biased, I don't know why, but no other joint in the city gets me as stoked as the Chicken Burger. I love the 50's diner motif, I always flip through the juke box when I go there and pick out a few songs to play (Yes, I'm that annoying guy), for some reason it just makes me happy.Now I'm not going to say the Chicken Burger is a flawless establishment, but I will admit that I even find its flaws a little charming. The fact that they never turn the heat on means this place can be a little chilly in the winter, the war you have to wage to get additional cups for condiments (you will never get more than three tiny cups, ever.) is tedious and the fact that a lot of the staff are very young and can seem overwhelmed by too many customers can be annoying. But I don't care, the food is tasty, the Chicken Burgers are out of this world and the fish and chips are among the best in the city.I guess when it comes down to it, I have a lot of really great memories with a lot of really great people attached to this place. Without this turning into a Wonder Years moment, I hope you're able to make similar memories at the world famous Chicken Burger.
<review# 484,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2010,6/16/2013,29,269,,3,1>My husband has been meaning to go to Burrito Jax for a while. It's around the corner from his office. Fortunately for me, he waited until this weekend. Be warned... this is not a sit down restaurant. There are a couple of stools and a bench, and I did see a few people actually eating there. But mostly, the line - and there is usually a line, is for take out. The choices are awesome - 5 or six main ingredients from chicken (mild and spicy), beef, steak, pulled pork and vegetarian. And then comes the even harder part - choosing from 6 salsas, rice, refried beans, black beans, mashed sweet potatoes and lots of different sauces and filling s to choose from. I'm not sure how they actually get everything onto the soft tortilla in order to fold it all neatly and grill it. It was worth the wait! And I might mention, the price is pretty awesome too. Less than $6 for a small (maybe in Texas), it was beyond big enough for me. A great option for an inexpensive and healthful meal.
<review# 485,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/3/2012,6/15/2013,1,9,,4,3>Koo E Nami Royale is spacious, warm and quite beautiful. It has a seating capacity of over 100 people. All lunch entrées at Koo-E Nami Royale are only $7.99.I loved the long and luxurious stainless steel spoon and chopsticks, which I found easier to use than the plastic ones. In fact I would love to have some of my own!Last time we visited a Korean restaurant I ordered the Bento Box which is similar to the Bulgogi Platter but this time I wanted seafood so I got the Seafood Stir-Fry Platter that came with octopus! That would be a first for me.We all received lovely Korean salads to start, always so fresh and delicious. I must discover a recipe for that dressing! We also received sprouts and kimchi and wow, this kimchi really kicked! Very good though but it lived up to its overpowering reputation. Kapow! Nice...At first I could not see a lot of seafood under all the fresh vegetables but it was there. I ordered mine to have the sweet soy sauce version which was delicious. I did add some of the table's hot chili sauce too which made it perfect. And the octopus? Fantastic!From the photos on the wall it is clear this restaurant has a result crowd of people who love hanging out and enjoying the food.This is a wonderful restaurant and if you need a space for a party and want to do something a little different, I highly recommend Koo-E Nami Royale.My only complaint is the washroom was too clean! Yes, you read right. If I had been in there a couple of more minutes I would have had a migraine from the industrial cleaners. For those scent-sensitive like me, you might want to send a scout before using the facilities.I loved having lunch at Koo-E Nami Royale with my friends. We did not feel cramped or rushed and the food was so varied and wonderful. The price for lunch is a fantastic deal and the dish I had was so tasty I want to come back for dinner.
<review# 486,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2013,6/14/2013,5,93,3,2,1>First time at this, "now chain". This is the 2nd location in Dartmouth and was the 2nd day open when myself and a party of 5 came in for lunch. They seem to have the efficiency thing down to a science. Food was very tasty and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had the Triple bacon Poutine and my heart stopped. Leave your diet at home and live a little...;-) Recommended for sure.
<review# 487,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2013,6/13/2013,49,23,5,7,2>After the closing of Janes I contemplated the meaning if life. I mean lets face it brunch is the Savour, I'm not even religious. Luckily, acting on a tip from the daughter of Jane's owner right before they closed I finally made it to EM. It's a bit far off the beaten downtown route but well worth the trip. Parking is sparse at this location and its off a small highway so I suggest carpooling if you are in a big group. The place exudes essences of Jane's. It all seemed familiar somehow. Same thought my brunch companions that day. Which is a good thing. Well great actually. In the front waiting lounge are fridges and shelves full of homemade jams, soups, pies, ready made meals. All looked done well and there were GF options. it was busy on the Saturday we went so there was a bit of a wait. The dinning area has a nice atmosphere and reminded me of a ski lodge for some reason. Probably the attic like roof and the fireplace. The kitchen area was glasses in so u can see all the food being prepared. Kinda neat I thought.  You can also spy in your food and know when it's coming!But what about the food? Usually when I am at a new restaurant I like to try their infamous plates or whatever seems slightly outrageous but good.  For me this was the waffles and deep fried chicken served in a sausage gravy. What can be crazier than that for brunch? really?  I also ordered a mimosa to start. it was made I noticed from freshly squeezed OJ bc the foam was a pure fluorescent  orange and thick. It was delicious and thicker than usual mimosas. Finally my meal came. It did not disappoint. The gravy with the sausage bits was brilliant. I love sausage as it is and then u put it on my chicken ? The chicken although being deep fried did not taste gross or grassy like say KFC would. mind u there is always a place in my hangover heart for KFC. respect.  I also ordered the home baked potatoes and bacon as sides. Gotta have variety and bacon I always say... The waffles were golden brown and made from a great batter. Almost the perfect texture. The maple sirup was real and none of that fake artificial drip most places use. Overall the meal was amazing for a first experience. I'm going back this week. My curiosity had been spiked. What better achievement can a place have really? Job well done.
<review# 488,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2013,6/12/2013,3,11,3,5,4>I've been going here for lunch almost daily since starting a new job in the building. When I was looking for reviews of places to go for lunch, I came across this place. The reviews where a bit on the "meh" side. Needless to say when I showed up, I was very surprised. The first day on the job, I stopped down for a club and fries. It was really good, probably one of the better ones that I've had. I spoke with owner later in the week and he told me that he taken over the business only 3 weeks prior. Many of my colleagues commented on the huge improvement in food quality. The main fare in this place is sandwiches, burgers and the like. They tend to have a daily special, but I usually stick to the sandwiches, burgers, or an occasional poutine.My only real criticism of this place is that some of prices are a bit high. Cookies and other baked goods go for double what they would normally. Overall, I like Belmont Cafe. It's a good place to go for a quick snack or lunch. Recommended.
<review# 489,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2012,6/11/2013,6,5,2,22,5>Well I have eaten here several times now both with my Co-Workers and my Wife for Lunch and Dinner meals and I have to say that the Food and the Service was excellent. It has an atmosphere unlike any other place in our little town of Sackville you can easily entertain clients knowing they will be impressed or take the Misses out for a great Romantic Meal and score the points us Men need. Thanks to the Chef and Staff and Welcome to Sackville.
<review# 490,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2013,6/10/2013,4,11,1,3,2>I was on my way home and just happened to drive by the battered fish, usually the parking lot is full and I don't have time to wait.    Not this time, and I thought it would be a perfect time to try it out, not to mention I was hungry.First impression, love the atmosphere everything is shiny and new, big screen televisions display the menu, I was greeted right away, the staff was super friendly and efficient.  I really wish I had taken the time to look at the menu, out of habit I just stepped up to the cash and ordered 1 pc fish and chips.  As I was waiting for my meal I read over the menu.. practically drooled on the floor with all the yummy options.   The selection is incredible and surprisingly it  is not all fish, there are some chicken choices there too.  I made sure to get a side of Cole slaw, and some extra tarter sauce and headed home.  It was hard to maintain my composure and wait till I got home to dive in.   It was so worth the wait, the fish was really fresh and delicious.  The homemade tarter sauce is some of the best I have ever had, make sure you ask for extra.  I consider myself a bit of  french fry connoisseur and let me tell you the battered fish did not disappoint.   I will definitely be back, I now have a battered fish bucket list of menu items I need to try.
<review# 491,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2012,6/9/2013,18,60,2,2,2>After calling about 10 places in Dartmouth on a Saturday morning to make a reservation for that evening at 7:30 (I know, I know, bad planning) we were finally able to confirm with this location. I was not sure what to expect as this place was on Windmill Road, and being from the  other side of the bridge, I thought this area was sketchy (still not sure exactly where we were). I was pleasantly surprise! The location was quite big, very clean and nicely decorate. When the first half of our group showed up there was a table and chair missing from our reservation, and two of our members had to wait for that to be sorted (the place was packed and there seemed to be a lack of tables)/. I was worried at this point that things were not going to go well, as no one immediately attended to them and they were left standing. But within 5 minutes they were seated, and a little while later an extra table was found. I tried the spinach dip, it was okay. I had a mushrrom/swiss burger with kettle chips. The burger was tasty (nothing to write home about, but good) and I am happy I chose the kettle chips. I would really like to highlight that the service was amazing. Our waitress, Sarah, was very friendly and attentive. She was actually so smiley that when I first looked at her, I was scared, but it ended up turning into a fun night of banter with the waitress. She didn't mess up any orders, the bills came, and she did not try to rush us out the doors (we ended up staying for 2.5 hours). And when asked if she had a candle for a birthday cake, she was very happy to help us out. Great work! I definitely left with fond memories!
<review# 492,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2013,6/8/2013,17,52,1,6,3>New Restaurant?! I love new restaurants!! Saturday of their first week in business, boyfriend and I make the trek up the hill to visit the new EDNA and I have to say, we rather enjoyed it. It was a bit pricey but I'd say it was worth it. We skipped the appetizer for wine (their wine and beer list is nice and local - I like that) and for mains I had the hen and he had a seafood soup of some kind and he LOVED it. Even I, who does not eat seafood, tried a bit of a scallop and didn't want to spit it back up.... well done Edna, well done. The hen dish looked small but surprisingly filling - it could have been the lovely bed of lentils it comes with, the lentils were my favourite part. Honestly though, I think a similar dish at another restaurant that we frequently visit has won my heart over and I was a little "meh" overall about my dish. I understand the concept of the big communal table but since boyfriend and I had just spent the day running in the Bluenose Marathon, neither of us were in a share a table with strangers mood so we sat at one of their 2 person tables in the front. This was really nice until another pair came in and was seated next to us... normally you have space but here you don't. We could hear everything the people next to us were saying as they were about a meter away and I didn't feel comfortable talking about a whole lot simply because I knew that everything I was saying was being said to the people next to us well. Once again, I understand their concept but we chose not to sit at the communal table for a reason.Anyways, overall Edna is a great spot for a nice meal and some good locally based drinks. They have tonnes of gluten-free options which is great for my boyfriend's mother who will be visiting us next month. However, like every new restaurant there is room for expansion (both in regards to the distance between tables and their menu which I'm sure will be switched up every so often). If you do happen to go and enjoy seafood, try the seafood soup (stew?).
<review# 493,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2013,6/7/2013,59,150,,4,2>I've been a huge fan of Bramoso's breakfast pizza for quite a while now. It's a regular Saturday afternoon farmer's market treat. The veggie gluten free is my favourite!This was the first time I've been to their Quinpool location. It's a really nice but fairly small restaurant, tastefully decorated and staffed with friendly people! It was pretty chill environment.Their menu consists of a page of appetizers and average restaurant entrees (salads, sandwiches etc) and two or three pages of pizza! Quite overwhelming - especially since they all sounded so delicious!I probably would have gone another route if I were dining solo - but my friend wanted the Hawaiian pizza, and I'm pretty easy to please. It was so good! A medium pizza is perfect for two people to share (getting three slices each); if you are really hungry you could start with an app, or even get a large pizza, but the medium worked great for us!I love the "home-made" style of their pizza; their crust and sauce are absolutely perfect and the toppings were plentiful.I already can't wait to go back and try more of their pizza options!Ps: They serve local beer!
<review# 494,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/18/2013,6/6/2013,13,104,,5,4>Was never really a fan of Pizzatown until recently. Plus, I think this location does things (or offers) different stuff than the average PT. Probably because it's right next to (and has a connecting door!) to Goodlife!At this location, there's a salad & wrap bar where they make it to your liking with the topping you want. I don't think this is standard for a) a pizza place and b) your everyday PT. It's like having a bit of Pete's in a pizza place right next to all the delicious greasy goodness. :DI had a spinach salad on one occasion and a donair on the other - one end to the other. Haha.The spinach salad as I mentioned was made just like I wanted it - with all the veggies and you can add some protein (eggs, chicken, etc.) if you'd like. They skimp a bit on the chicken if you ask me for the price you pay - but oh well, it was still a pretty tasty salad.I was actually quite surprised by the donair as well. I usually find that franchises just don't do donairs as well as the mom n' pop shops. But I was pretty wrong. The donair was pretty delicious.The meat was spicy, right off the cone and I didn't feel like taking 2 packs of tums afterwards. It's been 4 hours since I had it, and I feel great.Definitely check it out if you work/live/etc. near Burnside.
<review# 495,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/24/2013,6/5/2013,4,5,,6,2>When I saw Nancy, I was in desperate need of a trim. Two of my work colleagues had their hair cut by her and were pleased with the results.She fit me in about four days after I called. As my mentioned, my hair needed serious TLC... my split ends had split ends and so forth. When Nancy had a look, she didn't lecture me about how I should take better care of it (that's a pet peeve of mine).After washing my hair with phthalate-free, vegan, not-overly-scented fragranced shampoo, she started working on my mop. I have long-ish, thick hair and asked for layers. She recommended shortening the layers around my face and it ended up looking good. She suggested how to style it and gave it a quick once over with a blow dryer. Now, a week after, I'm very pleased with the trim. It ended up costing around $55 including the tip.Nancy was very pleasant and by the end, I felt like a long-time client. She was almost too friendly and eager to please. If you go to the salon for a half-hour of silence, don't go here. I am so happy to be see an environmentally responsible salon opening in the community. I hope Nancy can expand her services so she I can start getting pani-medis there.
<review# 496,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2013,6/4/2013,4,2,,2,3>I have been going to Darrell's since 2001 and absolutely love it. On top of that I can't ever remember a time when I was disappointed with the staff or food. Back when there was a laundry mat in the basement, I would spend a lot of time there, eating and studying. Now, the restaurant is more popular and they have added seating instead downstairs. Still, every time we go in we still feel the homey feel and never feel rushed by staff to get out and let the next table in. I have tried many things on the menu, but have to say the Original Pita Club is the only thing I usually order. Friends typically go with another wrap or the Peanut Butter Burger. Now, I'm gluten-free because of health reasons, but I still go here to 'cheat' my diet because I love it so much, and compared to Pizza or other take out it is not as hard on my stomach. Plus they still do all the great things like milkshakes and floats to make it really unique! Good Job Darrells!
<review# 497,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2013,6/3/2013,13,44,,2,2>I visited Chez Tess for a Saturday brunch with my boyfriend and my family. We seem to have arrived with perfect timing; the place as nearly empty when we got there, so taking a table took but a moment. Right after we had sat down, though, every other table filled up! It's a very cute little place. There's not a lot of room, but it's used well. They have a chalkboard on the wall listing the days specials (an omelette, a quiche, a sandwich, if I recall correctly?) all of which sounded delicious. To be honest, all of their food sounded delicious! It was difficult to choose. In the end I went with their french toast. The fact that it was being made with brioche instead of their typical apricot bread that day just further cemented my decision. And what a good decision it was! Some of the fluffiest most delicious french toast I've had the pleasure of consuming. My family all had different crepes, which came with large green salads and a potato cake of some sort. The potato cake was delicious (I tried a nibble), and the crepes all looked great! Now even though it was breakfast time, that didn't mean I said no to dessert. I opted for the crepes suzette, which is something I've wanted to try for quite some time now. Delicious, warm crepes with oranges and a buttery orange sauce. Ah, it was so good! I could eat that forever.The service here was also very nice. Our waitress was nearby whenever we needed her, and they had a lot of staff on which made for quick service! I will definitely come back again. Maybe for lunch or dinner, this time!
<review# 498,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2013,6/2/2013,46,10,,3,2>I love this place! Friendly staff, and great deals. The food is fresh and very tasty.  It has all the usual suspects from Pork buns to tarts and some I had never tried before (coconut something or other).  I have been to a few Chinese bakeries in San Francisco and Toronto, and while Kee Heong isn't quite at that level it definitely has the potential and they are headed in the right direction.  Cost: A couple of bucks per piece, and they have deals for certain times of day like by 2 buns get one free, etc. Location: Super convenient for those who park in the Metro Park, why not grab a few sweets on the way home!
<review# 499,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/27/2012,6/1/2013,25,117,4,9,5>We discovered Affordable Fuels when my husband (who was my boyfriend at the time) and I moved in together. I was a student and he was working full-time and we needed oil...but no one would deliver less than $400 worth. That just wouldn't work for us. We didn't have that kind of cash. So I started frantically calling around before winter hit but I kept getting bare minimum of $400 to deliver or needed to go somewhere (in the middle of no where!) to pay for smaller amounts in cash. It was horrible. I was at my wits end and then I found Affordable Fuels. The woman on the other end of the phone was so sweet when I called her, practically in tears, telling her that I just needed to keep our apartment warm and could she help me? Well she could. Not only was their delivery minimum only $200 but they took debit or credit! She was kind and knowledgeable and so very understanding. Since that first experience with Affordable Fuels we have NEVER bought from anyone else. Why would we?! That was over 4 years ago. Affordable Fuels has only gotten better. They consistently have some of the lowest oil prices in HRM, they deliver on a dime (no word of a lie, I can call today and get it tomorrow), their minimum is still only $200, they take credit or debit and Steve (the owner) is amazing - he can help with ALL your furnace problems! They also know their customers and they care about the service.  We will continue to use Affordable Fuels and it all started with that very first phone call and the kind response I got from the woman on the other end. Great customer service has turned us into lifetime customers!

The cranberry salsa is a nice option, adding just a smidgen of sweetness to my heap of veggies, rice and guac. Everything tastes really fresh, it's quick, and you can call your order in ahead of time for pickup. Super excited about this new option for good eats in our hood!
<review# 501,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2013,5/30/2013,27,83,,5,2>Never been to a Pete's Togogo before. But thankfully they decided to open one in SUB. I think that is a right move. We students need better alternative than the usual suspects in the building. For once, we not only have better food choice but also have better service. Its still new and they are playing around with their combos and products. I like their morning sandwich combos with Javablend roasted coffee. The bread they use is really good. Will definitely be a "rePete" customer to this one.
<review# 502,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2013,5/29/2013,19,131,,6,3>We eat a lot of sushi. So we are always interested in trying new places. So to hear of another place to have sushi in the CP area excites us tremendously. So, exactly one week after trying the new Hamachi Mura, we headed  here to Tako Sushi and Ramen. Before even sitting down our server asked us if we wanted miso soup. That's a fantastic idea - have some soup before you order.. We have a strategy to ordering sushi: 1. check for  specials -  Find those "dinner for 2's or combos - that way you can find the best deals for a little less cash. They have a 'deluxe maki combo' which consists of a variety of rolls; salmon, tuna, sweet potato and California. These combo's usually come with miso soup and house salad and this one did as well. 2. Order some apps - We opted for tempura and gyoza . The bf LOVES tempura and I ADORE gyoza (pork this time).Everything happened quickly. Our server was back very soon after seating us, but we were ready and made our order. Everything was tasty and fresh and presented well. Especially the tempura, the veggies were thinly sliced but piled high and plentiful. The rolls were placed on a wooden, raised slab which was something different to see, but it was classy.Our server was extremely pleasant and really seemed to enjoy her job. Prices were excellent as for the amount of food we ordered our bill was $45. Welcome to the area Tako! I think you will do well here!
<review# 503,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2013,5/28/2013,29,249,1,3,2>I've fallen in love with the Bahn Mi sandwiches from Indochine. If I'm catching a movie or running some errands on Spring Garden, I will stop in and grab a bite for dinner. It's nice to be able to grab something inexpensive that's fast, fresh, delicious and relatively healthy. My favorite sandwich is the Spicy BBQ chicken, though it's not super spicy so you may want to add some extra sweet chili or rooster sauce if you are a heat lover. I really enjoy Indochine's commitment to real and fresh food. It's real chicken that's cut up every day, not some processed deli meat, the produce is always fresh and crispy and I love that they serve the sandwiches on delicious, organic local bread. I can't wait until the weather gets nice and I can eat my bahn mi in the public gardens.
<review# 504,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2013,5/27/2013,8,31,1,2,2>I've been here twice now, so I think this place deserves a review. This is a gem tucked away among all the other pubs and eateries in the Argyle district. Two friends and I came to seek refuge in a rainstorm and decided on this place because a) I didn't want to keep walking in the rain, and b) the menu looked promising.A menu with icons to show staff favourites is common and gluten-free icons are slowly becoming more common, but vegan icons? A hat tip to you, menu designer!We tucked ourselves into the cozy corner booth and ordered hot chocolates all around to start. The whipped cream tasted good, not at all like that horrible fake whipped cream you still eat because your taste buds decide to be bratty. Then, the waitress brought water for us.I ordered the spinach and artichoke mac and cheese -- half of it filled me up, but I took the other half home because... well... let's face it, digging into delicious cheesy goodness and discovering a mildly flavoured, just-crisp-enough artichoke heart hiding out makes this vegetarian go "yippee!". My friends had the Goggle Burger (pronounced good) and lobster mac and cheese (that person's first experience with lobster, which left her saying she wouldn't mind trying it again).There was no waiting around for the bill nonsense and the food came faster than I expected. The waitress was friendly and attentive, but not overly chatty, and the vibe there was the exact easygoing vibe we wanted at that time. Love the feel of this pub, and the plentiful vegetarian and vegan options mean I'm coming back again for sure.
<review# 505,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/14/2013,5/26/2013,8,168,,6,3>I had a great experience when I popped in here on a Sunday afternoon about 10 minutes before closing.  As soon as we asked if they were closing soon, the owner quickly said not to worry about it and that she would stay open for us as long as we liked.  I was interested in buying an Ergo carrier and the two ladies working there were so helpful in telling me all about them, the pros and cons and comparing them with other brands.  I left with one in hand (that I got for a great sale price!) and will happily go back.  The store is small, but has a really good selection of cloth diapers and other baby items.  They also have a play area for little ones.  It's worth going in for a look and if you need some assistance with a specialty item.
<review# 506,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2013,5/25/2013,6,54,1,3,5>Just an addendum to the awesomeness of Sushi Nami. We recently descended on them with a group of 14 for a birthday party. When I realized I had miscounted and had only reserved for 12, they quickly scooped up another table and added it to ours, even though it was a Friday night and the place was busy. The service was amazing. I mean, it was pretty much the same pace as when I'm there with two people. Everyone's food came out within minutes of each other. Everyone had drink orders promptly refilled. Everyone had big smiles on their faces as they nommed sushi - especially the birthday boy! Add to that, they said 'no problem!' when we wanted the birthday boy's cheque split between 13 of us. They also brought him out a free dessert (which we passed around the entire table, since we had dessert waiting for us at our next destination.) I heartily recommend the tempura banana with sesame ice cream. Great job, Sushi Nami! And thanks for a night to remember!
<review# 507,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2013,5/24/2013,66,321,2,6,3>Seriously, what's not to love about Lake Banook? Set just outside of downtown Dartmouth, this lake has something for almost everyone. In the summer, there are beaches for swimming and play (both official and unofficial). There are several rowing activities - whether it's sculling, dragon boat racing or paired rowing that take place in the designated lanes. It's also a popular spot for fireworks and special events. Don't forget that Prince Albert Road is often closed off beside the lake for special events as well. All year round, there's a great mixed use trail around most of the lake that's used by strollers, dog walkers, runners, skateboarders and bicyclists.  In the winter, the ice usually gets thick enough for skating.Basically, it's a great lake to meet all your lake needs.
<review# 508,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/25/2013,5/23/2013,39,130,2,9,3>Yes to Thai Ivory Cuisine. In fact, 5 yesses.1. CRAZY menu. I'm talking like 10+ pages of options. 2. Great service. Our waitress was very friendly and polite.3. Delicious food. Every single one of us were convinced that we had the best dish. 4. Solid portions. No skimping going on here. You will be full when you leave.5. Reasonable prices. The prices might be $1 or $2 above some other places, but a portion of rice is included with most of the meals, and for the amount and quality of the food, I think it's well worth it.
<review# 509,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2013,5/20/2013,54,227,3,9,6>This review is just for the sushi pizza at Wasabi House, as that's pretty much all I ever order when going out for sushi. I had a great takeout experience at this place over the holidays. I ordered on a busy weeknight, and I appreciated that they let me know over the phone that it was pretty busy and gave an accurate estimate of how long the order would take to be ready. When I went in to pick it up, there were a few people ahead of me in line. I didn't mind waiting a few minutes - I enjoyed seeing a locally owned spot in my neighborhood so packed!The lady who rang in my order couldn't have been nicer, and they had even thrown a few extra pieces of sushi into the box because of the wait. Totally unnecessary, but delicious.The pizza itself was tasty, but massive. I rarely eat a whole one alone anyway, but in fact this pizza lasted me two meals and then some. The crispy rice bottom is covered in fish, with more rice on top and other toppings like avacado and roe. It was way too much food for me, but at about $14 I felt like I'd gotten an amazing deal. I highly recommend trying it out, or getting on for the table to split.
<review# 510,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/3/2013,5/19/2013,12,118,1,6,4>Now my boyfriend cannot eat red meat and pork products due to an intolerance, so I mainly eat chicken and fish with him. So when I ventured into this little place and saw the awesome prices on meat, I bought some for myself. I bought a rack of ribs and a steak. Both tasted pretty good and were pretty cheap ($5.00 for 2 full racks of seasoned ribs, and $2 something for the steak). However, the chicken is not much of a deal, at least that I could tell during this particular trip - I was shopping with someone who knew exactly what they needed and so I did not have much time to really browse, so I will have to come back again soon to take my time! I've also been told to avoid the frozen products because most of it is expired or soon to be expired.
<review# 511,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/28/2012,5/18/2013,9,76,3,4,3>I had walked past this store a hundred times I'm sure, and never ventured in up until this past May.I decided to register for one of their clinics and was pleasantly surprised at how much of a "family" atmosphere this place is! Aside from the many clinics they offer, there is also group runs open to the general public---even if you are not even from around here..on Wed & Sundays.  What a great way to get out and great active or what?!The associates in the store are all very knowledgeable about running shoes, and all the gear they offer.  They've even got a frequent buyer reward program.Bruce the store owner is very friendly and actually quite witty!  The Running room is a great place for anyone, walkers, runners & racers!
<review# 512,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2013,5/17/2013,28,259,3,3,3>From the Casino down to Pier 21.. the Halifax waterfront is easily the best free attraction Halifax can boast.Raise your hand if you haven't just gone down for a stroll?That is the sound of no hands raising (does that even make a sound?)You have a whole laundry list of festivals and events that call the waterfront home. The buskers, the JazzFest, I Heart Local Halifax, Tall Ships, Natal Day, Canada Day and the list just goes on and on. There's museums, memorials, street performers, hobo's/street people, and plenty of humans. We have a famous Tugboat who lives down there, I have seen seals/otters in the early hours, a wave surrounded by soft squishy stuff, playgrounds galore, volleyball nets and there's even seagulls as big as your head!Are you sold yet? Get on down and experience the best of what Halifax is, and leave your wallet at home.. sometimes it's just nice to walk and sit.
<review# 513,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/25/2012,5/16/2013,13,213,3,4,3>This was my second visit to this location. First time to buy a bike helmet and this time to find a ski helmet that fits my head now that it is the law to wear one while skiing. Soon I am sure I will return to this store to get yet another couple helmet's when required by law to wear one while driving and walking. The best advice I can offer anyone is do not call them just go over. I called twice yesterday and all I got was hang-ups? A CLICK and then the pause and dial tone again. I called another location of the same store and got them to check to see what was on sale and in stock etc... The guy told me at the other location that they never answer the phone when I told him about the hang ups. Showing up at the store as it was last time I visited was a good experience. Lots of helmets to choose from for average size heads. I always have trouble with the fit for mine as I need something large very large. I ended up buying one. Wearing it around the house etc... To see how it fits.  This store has or at least yesterday an army of sales people walking the floor. The store called this weekend black Friday sales. It was save the tax across the whole store with a few better sales for certain items. I would return here as the prices are reasonable and the sales staff are helpful. If you find the service was good don't forget to get the sales person's name because they will ask you at the cash who helped you and that person will get commission. Just don't call the store before going over unless you like hang-ups or whatever that is? I don't know of an answering service that hangs up in the callers ear?
<review# 514,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/30/2012,5/15/2013,39,80,4,9,6>Ummm, how have I not been here before? Seriously, with my love for chocolate this place has my name written all over it. I visited Choco Cafe for the very first time today. It happened to be their first anniversary. And now I'm seriously hoping that they see lots more anniversaries because I would like to go back every other day forever. It's an extraordinary combination of chocolate goodness that the Cafe has going on! It's a lovely open space with comfy tables and a full espresso bar. I tasted my brother's Belgium White Hot Choclate this morning made with Choco Cafe's very own handmade chocolate and it was sweet delicious heaven in a mouthful. My americano (hello Java Blend my local favorite choice!) was caffeine perfection as well. They offer free samples of their milk and dark chocolates, (and this weekend some special treats in honor of their anniversary). If you're looking for gifts for any occasion the Cafe has a huge range of choices for just about anything: baby showers, weddings, Christmas and more. They also have  some unique options for wedding or event favors. Beautifully hand wrapped chocolates of a quality I've never seen before here in Halifax. Honestly given the options and variety I found the prices to be really quite reasonable. The service was friendly, fast and fun. Couldn't ask for more and I can't wait to go back!
<review# 515,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2012,5/14/2013,38,87,3,4,4>It took me awhile to get to Ace and my only regret is that it took me so long to get here. Like my mother, I enjoy a good burger. Which means means I've slowly been trying out the burger places in town. And while I've found some tasty burgers in town, they don't hold a candle to Ace. I ordered the classic with whatever it comes with, the works I guess, with a side of fries. And it was downright the best burger I've ever had. In fact, as I write this the memory of that burger haunts me and makes me wish Ace were open right this second. In addition to devouring my burger, I left no french fry untouched. (my eating companions were big fans of the veggie burger and were telling me that there is a gluten free bun option. I wanted the beef and the gluten). I seriously love that the food is locally sourced. The staff was great and I find it delightful that this burger company has found a home in Gus' Pub. This pub is most definitely not fancy (possibly the opposite of fancy), but it holds a soft spot in my heart (I've seen some great shows there and drank with a friend on her wedding day). I go simple for a drink and get a beer in the bottle. I'm looking forward to my next visit. Anyone want to go for a burger on Saturday?
<review# 516,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/2/2013,5/13/2013,28,42,4,4,4>I'm no stranger to hair removal.  It's a fact.  I wish I were a stranger to it but one can't live with regrets.  We all do what we gotta' do and and for anyone else who feels this way, this is your best bet.Great little shop in Bedford.  I've actually been a client for years and wouldn't have it any other way.  Chandrae is simply great..  Tons of experience and great to chat with during sessions.The price is certainly right as her rates are the best in the city.  Some will want to pay extra peace of mind thinking they're getting a much more professional and experienced person but they're simply throwing money away.  I've never been disappointed with results and always very happy with the amount of work that gets done in the time spent.This is good and bad.  Good for me because it's fast and affordable.   Bad for me because it means I'm that much closer to not needing to go any more.Yeah... getting teary here.... I need a moment.
<review# 517,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/2/2012,5/12/2013,21,7,2,3,4>Morris East is easily one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The food is amazing and the service is always incredible. If they weren't already high enough up in my books they recently introduced a dairy free CREME BRULE. It is to die for. If you and dairy are not friends - fear not Morris East is there for you!
<review# 518,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/9/2013,5/11/2013,21,105,,9,4>This new location just opened, it's close to home, it was easy enough to find close by parking, so we figured we might stop in. We're glad we did. My husband and I stepped up to the counter and ordered a shared meal of the smoked sausage, pulled chicken, brisket chilli with corn bread and dirty rice. It was plenty for the two of us. This place is a carnivore's haven...At the Barrington location, I loved the Mac & Cheese. I will always try the Mac & Cheese at every place and they make a good one! The picnic tables and window bar make for plenty of seating. The Bonehead's sauces (two BBQ and mustard) at every table are very good. You may need a lot of napkins, so there is a roll of paper towels standing by for you. The place is open and clean with a warm inviting appearance. I could see the massive smoker in the kitchen and the place was filled with the smell of the wood. LOVED it! The service was friendly and I cant wait for the next trip! If you haven't already, you should really check them out soon!  (Debit machines are on route, so cash only at the moment).
<review# 519,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2013,5/8/2013,7,53,2,4,3>I have to say I was beginning to think all HRM hotels were mediocre at best but am happy to say the Prince George has made me rethink this.  I decided to treat my girlfriend to a different birthday than just dinner.  I booked their Perfect Escape package which includes their Deluxe Double room (you can get king bed & crown room options too), free wireless, parking included, and a $25 credit to Gio (our choice), or their other eateries.  Another nice thing about their package deals is I didn't see any blackouts for weekends as some places do. This booking was for a Friday night for example, not some lame 'must book on Tuesday crap'; very nice. I did mention it was her birthday on booking & they said they'd try for something special.  I really didn't expect anything to be honest.  We arrived about 4pm. The check-in staff were very friendly and really seemed happy!  What a nice surprise.  They gave us vouchers for 2 free drinks at Gio that night as a gift - thank you!  We were on the 2nd floor overlooking their Terrace Rest. The room was very nice with all the amenities.  My friend and I really liked the bathroom, nice shower, mirror, sinks, very clean, & Aveeva products.  The beds were SO comfortable ahhhh.  We were told on check-in that something was coming to the room soon and just a few minutes in and the door knock brought a friendly server with 2 very large pieces of cheesecake and sparkling wine - happy birthday and thank you I say!!  Very classy. We dined at Gio and I will yelp that separately but for this inclusion here just say it did not disappoint from when I was there last which was soon after their opening.  My girlfriend really liked her meal and the service was spot on.After dinner I had a family 'thing" so we just went back to the rooms to be close.  We checked out the sauna, pool, & hot tub. All very nice and clean. Bonus for us was they were on our floor not far at all. really relaxing and back to the room for some drinks and chit-chat. Check-out was an appreciative 1pm so we got to sleep in. Again the beds so rocked and we had a great sleep and well rested.  I highly recommend this hotel and all the staff.  So much so that I'm booked in for post Val Day as treat to my husband and this time we are doing their recommended brunch. Can't wait!
<review# 520,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2013,5/7/2013,65,111,1,11,3>I was so excited to hear an all day breakfast place was opening in Dartmouth - this is so my jam. I've been to Nena's a couple times now and have been delighted both times. A friend and I popped in for brunch last weekend. I crave eggs benny for supper all the time, so this was going to be my eggs benny test run. I was not disappointed. The eggs were perfectly poached, the hollandaise was tasty and the home fries were just right. My friend and I wanted to also try the pancakes, so we split a side of one chocolate chip pancake for $1.70. They forgot to put chocolate chips in the batter and put them on top instead. A happy accident as the chocolate chips melted into the butter we spread on top. So good.I dropped in after work one day this week to try pancakes and bacon for supper. Another hit! I went with plain pancakes this time and they were so good, as was the bacon. Breakfast is my favourite meal, and having it readily available at all times is both amazing and oh so dangerous.It's a small spot, but the space is maximized. Clean and modern, it's going to be a great addition to the neighborhood. Service was friendly, and they even threw in a free dessert to go as I was paying for my pancakes and bacon.Two issues are holding back the 5th star. It's cash only, which is a huge problem for me. There is an ATM next door which helps a bit. But I hear it won't be cash only forever. Also, on my first visit, the server was cleaning the other tables with a very strong-smelling cleaning product. The smell was very distracting and took away from the flavour of the food. It might be time to switch to unscented products.I'll be back. Often.
<review# 521,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2012,5/6/2013,61,77,3,7,4>I've been to Wooden Monkey a couple a times and have yet to manage to jot anything down. It's such a fabulous spot with a cheeky location. Regardless of your table you almost always have a view of Citadel or Argyle (ignore pre-convention centre mess). Not to mention you get to walk through beads to get to the bathroom. Wooden Monkey is the perfect spot if you are vegan, health conscious, or enjoy quality local food. The first time I was here I ordered the Monkey Pita with free range chicken from Pasture Hill. It was ahhhhhhhhmazing. Although it is listed in the 'light fare' section I struggled to finish it all. So it's a great size. I found the flavor of the mushrooms in the pita to be outstandingly delicious.The second time I was here I sampled the vegan nachos. Though the thought was initially odd, I didn't seem to have a hard time shovelling them into me. As a non-vegan I thoroughly enjoyed them. So if you are a vegan and struggle to find good vegan nachos, I suggest you get your hiney to Wooden Monkey. Their substitute for cheese had a better melting point than most and was semi-stringy; mimicking the effects/taste of real cheese. If you order the nachos, be sure to get the guac!!! It was delish and creamy.

My hair is curly, but not your big loose girls, it's tight curls. I am the kind of person who will spend good money to get her hair done as long as it's done with creativity and excellence.So when I have to get it cut, I'm always weary about who I go to because most hairstylist are "oh, it's soooo curly, I don't know what to do with it." (ugh, lack of imagination if you ask me). And it has left me frustrated  a lot in the past 10 years or so.Now, enter Ryan. As soon as he saw my hair, he was so excited and he had all these plans of what he can do with it. I immediately felt like I can trust him with my crazy mess that is my hair. I swear, if he ever moves, I'm moving with him to wherever he's going.
<review# 523,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2013,5/4/2013,23,14,3,8,6>My boyfriend and I have been saving up our pennies to try all the Korean restaurants in town. We didn't have to save many pennies to go here for lunch! I wanted to come to two main reasons: the lunch special was highly recommended by a co-worker, and it's close to where we live! Since we moved here from Regina we've been craving our fave restaurant (Korea House) and hoping some places here could live up to our cravings. We both got the lunch specials - I had Bulgogi with california roll and Mike had the spicy pork with dumplings. They were both delish! (especially for just under 10 bucks!) The dumplings were crispy, pork was spicy and beef very tender.  I was so stuffed at the end of the meal - definitely not what I expected. They come with miso soup, salad, kimchi and rice. All the flavours were strong and delish. We were the first in the restaurant and served very quickly!The only thing to note was that we waited a little longer than we could have for our bill. Once the bill came we paid right away so I don't consider it a problem really. Can't wait to go again and try other things on the menu, although we are bulgogi freaks so we probably won't stray too far. ;)
<review# 524,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/5/2012,5/3/2013,38,43,2,3,3>Oh I am such a big fan of this place.Liquid Gold is exactly what Halifax needed.An entire wall is covered with vats of olive oil and the other wall is loaded with vats of balsamic vinegars. The best part? You may taste each one so you make the perfect purchase.My very favourite (besides truffle oil) is the Wild Mushroom and Sage oil. Take a beautiful chicken and slather it that oil plus s&p and you have a great dinner. It is extremely flavourful.The store is lovely and inviting. You could easily spend 30 minutes plus in here tasting oil. The staff are fabulous and know exactly what they're doing. This is something you should expect in a specialty store but is often not the case. Clearly they're worth their weight in gold too!

I was hesitant at first but that is one heck of a sandwich. The large is a waffle folded in half, while the small would be the quarter. The chicken, lightly breaded and juicy with a little bit of the apple slaw inside both pieces of waffle.  I'd probably add some kind of sauce to it the next time.I'm glad that the truck is trying new locations, it's not everyday I don't make it downtown very often and this is exactly what I needed to break away from the meh sandwiches from nearby superstore & sobey's.
<review# 526,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/15/2013,5/1/2013,20,226,2,4,3>I don't often shop downtown, but Park Lane is one of my favourite stops when I do.I think the best thing about this mall is that it is never crowded.  Because it doesn't have many stores that would appeal to a younger crowd, there aren't hordes of teenagers wandering aimlessly. (They're all outside on the sidewalk. :-D)  The Empire Theatres in this mall is my favourite for the same reason.While many of the stores appeal to me (Body Shop, Samuel & Co, John David Shoes, etc), it's unfortunate they don't have a "real" food court. There are perhaps three different places to choose from for lunch, and none of them is particularly tempting for me.  On the other hand, you're downtown; it's not like there's a dearth of choices!Another thing that would give this mall five stars: the return of Frog Hollow, or another independent bookstore.  A mall without a bookstore is like a cat without a tail.  Sure, he can live just fine without it, but ... he would be so much better with it.

I love Dee Dee's.I've had my fair share of the ice cream during the summer months (and thank goodness the commons is close by for running off said ice cream), and it's hard to find a better scoop of dairy goodness. I love the openness of the little cafe. You get to engage in conversation with the girls behind the counter as they talk about whatever comes to mind. I love that some days when I'm sitting there my eyes sting a little from the onions being prepared for the days food orders. It's like I'm sitting in someone's kitchen and damn if that doesn't make me feel all warm and cozy...As for those burritos, they have to be out of this world because when I'm there, there is a never ending line of people coming in and ordering those little rolled up morsels of goodness...
<review# 528,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2012,4/29/2013,51,65,,3,3>Today was my first trip to Shubie and I absolutely loved it. It's definitely looking like I'll be coming here weekly this summer, if not more often. Mike B. and I decided to take advantage of the beautiful not-quite-Canada Day (seriously, look it up!) weather and get our butts outside and in the sun. On the recommendation of James G., we decided to rent kayaks at Shubie and paddle down the canal. When we first arrived, there were no kayaks available. Apparently it's a good idea to call ahead and make reservations. (They only have five kayaks in total.) We arrived at 2:30 and decided to place a reservation for two kayaks at 3:30. In the meantime, we took a stroll through the many trails Shubie has to offer. The trails were great - very scenic and practically no mosquitos. (I was wearing bug spray, but I find it's never effective enough to keep them completely away.) It was great fun to run into some off-leash dogs who seemed to be having an absolute ball. Once we headed back to the wharf, we suited up in our life jackets, hopped in our kayaks and headed down the canal. It was beautiful. The water was very calm and the canal was incredibly serene. I did find that the paddles dropped quite a bit of water on me, which wasn't something I experienced as much when kayaking before. It didn't detract from my enjoyment, though.After an hour, we headed back and drove home - but we assured the staff that we'd be returning. Especially with price being pretty great - $12/hour for a kayak. We're thinking perhaps a CMYE event might be in order!

<review# 530,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/14/2012,4/27/2013,15,59,2,5,2>I have been extremely excited to try Habaneros but every time I ventured down their way I ended up at Cheese Curds instead. At least both places are owned by the same Chef. Resisting the Cheese Curds Thai Chicken Burger was difficult, but finally managed to try out Habaneros. Unlike Cheese Curds there is little waiting, and my order was prepared quickly. I ordered the burrito which was reasonably priced considering how much choice and content can be packed inside. There were several kinds of rice, salsas, beans, cheeses, meats, and a ton of veggies. I opted for the cilantro lime rice and the cilantro sour cream. Cilantro has to be my absolute favorite addition to any dish. So fresh and crisp. My friend who joined me chose the vegetarian burrito and I have to say that I regret not doing the same. I went for the braised beef in my burrito which was flavorful and delicious but much too overpowering. It would make a nice meat only burrito but the taste of the beef completely drowned out the lime, cilantro, and veggie flavors. I finished about half my burrito before I scooped out the meat and tried it without. It was definitely an improvement. The burrito without meat was delicious enough on its own. Without the meat there was more of a balance. Other than braised beef they also offered fajita spiced beef, chicken, and a pulled pork option. These options may offer a more well-rounded burrito. I loved the plethora of choice available for tacos and burritos. It would be great for a large group where everyone has varying preferences and tastes. Especially since the service is fast.. I left full and quite happy and will definitely return as I want to sample some of the other options. The Chimichangas look especially appealing. I'm also very happy that Dartmouth finally has a place to cure one's Mexican food cravings.
<review# 531,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2013,4/26/2013,18,151,3,4,3>I love books. I would read all day if I could! As such, I am rather fond of libraries. The Alderney Gate library is probably my favorite of the many within the HRM. Here's why:- Two floors of literary goodness, which means a massive selection of everything.- Plenty of computers.- All the children's stock is upstairs, which means that adults can browse in relative peace and quiet downstairs (huge plus for me).- Loads of toys, games, and play areas upstairs for the kids.- Lots and lots of windows.- Knowledgeable staff.There is but one negative attribute to this library: it is really, really difficult to get into unless you are walking or busing it. The parking lot is almost always filled to the brim (the ferry terminal is in the same building), and getting to the library from the rear entrance is a huge hassle.Aside from the parking, the Alderney Gate library is one of HRM's truly fantastic features.
<review# 532,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/6/2013,4/25/2013,22,150,,6,4>Having only discovered the Alderney Farmer's Market this summer, this was my first visit  during winter.  And this is when I can really appreciate the presence of Noggins. Here is where I can find carrots that taste like they just came out of my own garden and plenty enough fresh and organic veg to get your good nutrients all winter long. Also a bonus that they are open every day, not just market Saturdays. They carry, not just fruit & veg but Foxhill cheese, milk & gelato, Old Dutchman cheese, Made With Local granola bars and Terra Beata cranberries, just to name a few..Sure, you'll pay more then in the grocery store but it is so worth the fresh taste of naturally ripened, not dyed, organic goodness. And you're supporting local to boot, win win.
<review# 533,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2013,4/24/2013,24,41,4,4,4>A constant favorite! Need a drink? Need some food? Need some great live irish music? You've found your home!Food & Drink: 5/5Cold beers, and great choices on the tap! Tasty food, ranging from traditional irish stews to a good ol' Canadian Hamburger with fries. They've got it all, and it's delicious.Service: 4/5Way friendly, super quick drink serving, and reasonable food service. Two separate bars for your convenience, and the servers coming by routinely to fill up your mug.Location: 4.5/5A little close to the water, and a little further downtown then most other pubs, but very refreshing at the right time of year. Not hard to find, and very close to both the ferry and bus routes.Atmosphere: 5/5It doesn't get more irish-pub-y in Halifax than The Old Triangle. Run (I believe it still is...) by the musical duo, Evans and Doherty, it's just got it all. Irish county flags everywhere, irish lore-inspired stained glass decoration, wooden floors with the proper rustic look it should have... It's just the tops. Three floors of varying environments, each one getting a bit more private for your own private party, and even a few rooms at the top floor you can close off for your small party of 3 to 6. My favorite spot? Second floor, large fancy chairs between the stairs and the 2nd floor bar.Do you want to find a good Irish pub? Do you want to celebrate the Green, White, and Orange any day of the year, and 4 times as hard on St Patrick's day? Then the Old Triangle is your best bet! Sláinte
<review# 534,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2013,4/18/2013,65,55,,5,2>Cheese Curds was the first burger joint I tried in Halifax's new gourmet burger craze and I am a big fan!My first thought of the actual location was that it was nothing to write home about. The atmosphere didn't really do too much for me but it was the amazing staff that made my experience one to remember. The guy who rang in our order was amazing - not only was he super helpful walking me through the process but he had so much personality and obviously enjoyed his job. The whole team seemed to enjoy themselves at work, creating a really fun atmosphere.The food itself was delicious! I decided to make my own burger. Starting with the regular Angus patty I added jalapeno cheese and bacon (obviously) and then added curry mayo, more jalapeno's and lots of fresh veggies. I guess I like it spicy! I also decided to go with regular fries, which were pretty tastey. My dinner companion went with the onion rings drizzled in honey. I wasn't a fan of the rings or the honey topping. The rings didn't hold their batter very well and were very bland without the honey, which I personally didn't think was a good combo.All in all, I will definitely be back to try another creation. A big congrats to the team for taking a top spot in the Top 10 new restaurants in Canada!
<review# 535,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2012,4/17/2013,56,312,2,4,5>I've made several visits to this location. Every time it looks different, but to be fair, there's an eight month gap.I think this is my favourite Indian restaurant in Halifax. Good food, nice presentation, and friendly prompt service works for me and balances out the totally off-the-beaten track location. In fact, of any time I've been there the biggest complaint I've ever come up with is the horrible parking lot which is just a little too small and makes me worried I'm going to hit someone or get hit.Lunch specials around $11-13 which are massive work for me - you're looking almost at dinner sized meal portions. You've got a choice on combination plates, or with a group you can just order a la carte, which is probably a great approach, and the more common way to do things at good Indian joints.We missed out on samosas today because they had none ready during the lunch rush, which was a little absurd, but pakora worked as a good substitute.
<review# 536,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2012,4/16/2013,12,153,,6,5>I've run a food drive at work for the past 2 holiday season, this one being my third.  The folks at FEED NOVA SCOTIA have always been great with helping organize and answer questions. If you haven't already you should seriously consider helping them out!  Every little bit counts.  FEED NOVA SCOTIA collects all food donations and distributes them so people in our communities will have food on the table. There is no such thing as too small donation.  They will make sure all donations get stretched as far as possible.  If monetary is more your speed they can do that too.  While everyone is in the spirit of giving this time of year, please consider helping them out throughout the rest of the year as well. This really is a worthwhile cause.  Please give.
<review# 537,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/7/2013,4/15/2013,40,216,2,4,3>Although I was never a devout attendee of the old farmer's market at the brewery, as I have never been a fan of shoulder-to-shoulder crowds and not knowing where the hell I am, I was still quite familiar with Cheelin's presence there. They would be set up near one of the main entrances with heating trays filled with the less adventurous sort of Chinese food that sells well to the masses. Not that this is a fault at all, because like most noodle dishes, I was a fan of their famous noodles. Enticed by a Teambuy coupon, I made the adventure down to find the actual restaurant itself one evening. Like anything located in the brewery, it can be a bit daunting to find so I'm not ashamed to admit that I first looked at a building map  inside the entrance, lest I end up lost in the twists and turns of the market. It turns out that it is at the northerly end of the building, not far away from daMaurizio, with a small sign and unassuming curtains setting it apart from the random small businesses in the building. The dining room is nothing fancy, with your basic vinyl-cushioned chairs and tables filling up a fairly sizable space. Generic Chinese restaurant decor adorned the walls with watercolour paintings, hung decorations and what can only be described as a huge ass fan dominating one of the walls. I'm assuming it was for decoration only as you would have to have some serious forearm strength to be able to hold and operate the fan. The restaurant was pretty quiet, although there were a few other tables with people at them, so it wasn't awkwardly quiet with a much too large staff-customer ratio.After perusing their menu, my girlfriend and I settled on what we thought to be a good mix of dishes - the twice-cooked pork, mixed veggies and of course the Saturday noodles. I'd like to state for the record that that is what they are actually called on the menu. No messin' around here. After chatting for a bit and quietly praying that the large fan didn't fall and crush someone, our hefty platters of ethnic deliciousness arrived. The twice-cooked pork was a mix of somewhat thinly sliced triangles of pork, zucchini, onion, carrot and dried chiles. The pork had an odd sort of texture, a bit stringy without being dried out or tough, but a good flavour, and the overall dish was well rounded. All the veggies in the pork and mixed veggies still had a nice crunch to them, as no one likes a soggy stir fry, except the worst kinds of social deviants. The Saturday noodles were everything I love, simple noodles mixed with bean sprout and green pepper, with enough grease to make them tasty but without inducing too much guilt or immediate cardiac arrest. We had the plentiful leftovers packed up to go. My belly was pleasantly full, but my mind wasn't blown, but there's definitely something comforting about a Chinese restaurant that can provide a solid meal at a respectable price. Now only if it weren't located in a sandstone maze on Lower Water St...
<review# 538,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2013,4/14/2013,29,84,1,7,2>A great neighbourhood gym. When I first started coming here I didn't think they had enough cardio equipment - because that's my fall back - but once I became a regular I realized that's just not why people go to Fitness Fx. Whatever machine I'm interested in is usually available immediately or within 20 minutes. It's a very friendly place, and things are generally tidy and ready to use. I do find that depending on the time of day there are some folks who forget the "please don't drop your weights and scare the jittery among us" rule, and clang their weights pretty hard on the ground. That said, the management have responded well to this kind of problem and promised to remind repeat-offenders to control their dumbells lest they bounce on someone's toes and cause a more serious injury than a simple pulled hamstring. The rates are really reasonable, and they've been good lately at updating their class schedule too.ETA: Within hours of writing my review I went to get some exercise and found new cardio machines all set up! Well done, guys :)
<review# 539,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/14/2013,4/13/2013,28,24,4,4,3>Need a great place for fish &  chips and a cold Guinness ? Well search no more I've found the place.Celtic Corner is a Celtic gem found in downtown Dartmouth ..but don't let this stop you from checking it out. Inside you will find tons of comfy booths as well as your typical pub style wooden tables and chairs.  The walls are covered with Irish type things.  In the evenings you can pop in and check out some great maritime / Celtic style musicians, they always have a full line up. The menu a Celtic Corner is not giant by any means,  however what it lacks in size and selection it makes up for in taste.  I recommend you try the grilled curry chicken burger, the Black and Tan onion  rings and of course their fish and chips, but don't forget to chase it all with a tall pint of Guinness. The prices are pretty reasonable , you could order ALL my recommendations and it won't  break the bank . My only beef with the place was the washrooms  looked as if a hurricane blew thru them the past couple of times I've visited, which as a female is a bit of a deal breaker. All in all Celtic corner is totally worth taking the ferry for !
<review# 540,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/23/2013,4/12/2013,76,115,,7,4>I was excited to hear a new pub would be moving into my neighbourhood. No offense to Winston's (I never actually visited it) but from what I know it wasn't exactly fancy, judging by the common occurrence of fights, stabbings, etc, in the area after dark. Not exactly somewhere I would run to visit! Given the much-needed injection of something clean and new into this little strip mall, and because I am a fan of the original LD, I had high expectations when I stepped in here the week of the opening.I can't compare the interior to the old incarnations since this was the first time I set foot in the space, but I liked it. Typical pub with wood-paneling everywhere and the wood benches and booths that you will find at the original. Honestly, I'm not big on the super high ceilings and open concept - it's ok but I feel the space lacks a lot of the warmth and coziness of the original location, and it disappointed me a little. It felt more "industrial" to me. I LIKE the space and I'm all for 'new space, new vibe' but I personally was looking for that LD "feel" and I personally did get it. And I mean it literally about the warmth - I felt a draft in our booth during the whole meal and kept my coat on. However, the good thing is the service and food were what we expected and we enjoyed both. I had the Lower Decker burger which was delish - the patty was huge and juicy, well-cooked, and a highlight for the toppings were the house-made pickles (appreciate that they make their own rather than just open a jar). Great meal! They have lots of choices on their menu and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. In addition to the regular menu, waitresses were coming around with trays of complimentary apps for people to try, which was great (opening week, and all). We tried a quesadilla and a crostata-thingy that were both really tasty. It was a nice added treat. It's also nice that they have the same musical entertainment here that is the hallmark of the original location - keeps the boisterous atmosphere there. I honestly can't remember the name of the guy playing guitar while we were there but he was awesome! All in all, I liked our experience and will be back. I just hope they can keep the class level UP in this notoriously dangerous Clayton Park corner.
<review# 541,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2012,4/11/2013,26,201,2,6,3>I have no idea how I forgot to review this place. After many, upon many, trips there...I have never been disappointed!! 1. The owners/staff are the best I have come in contact with in the food service industry. Warm, inviting, helpful, accommodating. They go out of their way. And they learn who their regulars are and treat them well!2. The atmosphere just blew me away when I first entered. I assumed, based on the building, it wouldn't be anything great. But man, this place makes me want to stay forever. I enjoy the large table at the back for groups- that is semi private. And they are more than accommodating in putting tables together in other areas3. The cheesecake selection is unreal!!!!!! And if there is something you really want but is not in the cabinet....just ask, they may have a freshly made one out back. I have yet to have a cheesecake I didn't like. And Colin is always trying new flavors and changing with the seasons. I never used to like cheesecake but I think that they do it soo well, so smooth and so flavorful that it's hard not to like. 4. They support local! Selling Laughing Whale coffee, and Trinity Gold Lemonade, and cupcakes from a local baker. 5. They have vegan and gluten free cheesecake every night. How considerate is that!6. They have over 60 flavors, and just ask, Colin will try to make your fav.7. Their whole cheesecakes for take out are quickly replacing regular baday cakes in my family. They are soooo reasonably priced.8. And free live music on Thursday nights!As you can see, I love it!
<review# 542,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/9/2012,4/2/2013,8,63,3,3,3>I usually go to PG's Cafe for lunch once a month; however, after passing by New Asia  several times, I decided to give this place a shot and see what it was like.I was immediately taken aback by the size of the establishment as from the outside I thought it would be a medium to small dining area.  There were only a handful of people in there, so I was a little worried about the quality of the food, but I was to be proven wrong on this day.The waitress was friendly and came straight away; I decided to order the combination plate 1 which was an egg roll, rice, and chicken balls with a can of Pepsi.  This all came to a total of around $10.00 which surprised me as I received quite a healthy portion of food.My order was quite tasty as the egg roll was meat instead of cabbage, the rice and chicken rolls were a tiny bit greasy; even so, a little grease doesn't hurt once in a while.  I almost didn't finish the food, but just as I was about to stop, Chariots of Fire started playing in the background and I managed to pack the rest of the food in me before I headed back to work...LOL!!Overall, it was a nice experience and I will come back to try some other dishes such as the lemon chicken and curry beef.
<review# 543,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2013,4/1/2013,18,60,3,14,7>I had decided to come here as I had heard from a friend that they offer "Wildcard Wednesdays." This means that for 20$ you get a cut and 50$ a cut and colour. The catch: you have no control of the outcome. You just have to trust your stylists abilities to make you look wonderful. My appointment with Ayla began with her playing with my hair. I liked that she did this as I felt as though I was going to receive a cut that would suit my hair texture. Furthermore, she actually asked me if I styled my hair. Given that my abilities allow me to only handle a blow dryer and straightener - this was another great question! These tasks seem simple, but really - not every hair stylist does them. I'll leave looking great, but complete unable to replicate the style at home. Ayla was friendly and talkative - she chose a great colour (a dark brown), and cut (a short bob - lost 10 inches!), and I am in love with my hair. I would definitely go back again .... once I get more hair! .Oh - and they had lots of tea and reading material to let the time pass!
<review# 544,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/10/2012,3/31/2013,59,150,5,12,6>Le Bistro by Liz is so, so nice! The atmosphere made me wish I was on a romantic date (instead of an office party!). I'm usually not a fan of eating in a dark setting - but the entire mood that the décor Le Bistro offers is undeniably enjoyable. It's funky - cozy - classy.Our server was fantastic. He had great energy and was super personable and attentive. He made us laugh quite a few times - I love when servers do that! The food isn't the only reason we enjoy eating out so much.The menu was small but had a lot of different options and was very appropriately priced; ranging from $7 to $22. We ordered quite a bit. There are two types of mussels, spicy marinara and classic Chablis sauce, we had the Chablis. It was very flavourful. But, not as flavourful as the escargot; with wild mushrooms, caramelized onions and roasted red peppers, and goat cheese - I couldn't stop cleaning up the excess sauce with my bread!  It was so good, I would go back just for that. We also had an order of potato skins; they were good, but nothing special.For my main dish I had the "Scallops a La Bordelaise". There was about 5 large Digby scallops with whole wheat fettuccini and chardonnay sauce. It was good - but a little boring; needed a kick to it. Some people in my party ordered the "Club Paris" - a chicken club sandwich served on pretzel bread - it looked really good!  Everyone enjoyed their meal - there were absolutely no complaints! I'm not sure how I had room for dessert, but I did. My friend and I spilt their "famous yummy lemon parfait pie". It was not what I expected; but it was delicious.I would return here over and over again. It has such a great space. The only negative is their bathroom only has one stall. They were hosting a few holiday parties that night and long washroom waits are not fun!Bonus: I called to check if they take reservations, they did! And, it was for a Friday night! I was super impressed by this as usually restaraunts won't on weekends.
<review# 545,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2013,3/30/2013,34,12,,7,4>I've had Cha Baa Thai in downtown Halifax and I've never been disappointed! This was my first time at the Burnside location, and nothing's changed. As far as places to eat in Burnside (I work out here) - you've basically got your choice of the run of the mill usual suspects (Wendy's, Tim's, Subway, BP, Montana's, etc.) But if you're looking for more of an actual sit-down meal, you've got less choices on that end. I've heard Cha Baa has some good lunch specials so I went today to have a bite to eat with a friend! YUM. That's all I have to say I chose to start with a hot and sour soup because it's a serious weakness of mine. At 7$ I have to say, the bowl was substantial, though I'm not quite sure it was worth that price (I had just veggies in mine, which in my mind should have been less than the options with beef, chicken, tofu, or shrimp). Nonetheless, it was hot, delicious, and chock-full of a ton of veg (snap peas, carrot, bok choy, tomato, onion, cabbage etc.) and I'm talking BIG chunks. I didn't finish it all because I wanted to save room for other goodies! I ordered the Panang Beef lunch special which is $10, and includes 1 small spring roll+dipping sauce, rice, and the beef dish. Flavour explosion. I have never had this dish here before, I've had the pad Thai, red curry, green curry (all delish) and I chose this based on a recommendation from my boyfriend's sister who eats here frequently! It was just the right amount of spice after my hot and sour soup, and the beef was cooked perfectly. Often times when you order a dish like this, I find the beef can be rubbery and overcooked. Not the case with this dish! The beef strips were sliced thinly, and were cooked with lime leaves, green beans, red chili, cabbage, coconut milk, pha-naeng curry paste and peanuts. The sauce was creamy, flavourful, with just the right amount of coconut and peanut flavours. I would have this again in a heart beat! I think I have a new go-to comfort lunch! The bill was about $23 including tip (came to around $19 before tip.) The food came out quickly, despite a lunch rush, and the server was friendly, helpful, and knew her stuff! I'd recommend Cha Baa Thai to anyone looking to have a nice meal - be it lunch or dinner!
<review# 546,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/4/2012,3/29/2013,13,104,4,4,3>Not sure why I've waited this long to review my fave Italian restaurant in town - although people will be quick to tell me that Amano, Bicycle Thief, etc. are better. My quick rebuttal is that I haven't been there - but soon.Either way, I've been to Il Mercato about half a dozen times (this one and the downtown one). Not a single time - not even once - have they disappointed me. Ever.Single.Time it was an awesome experience.And I'm not one to get the same thing over and over - I've had a couple of their pasta dishes (the garlic spaghettini is to die for if you love garlic, it actually might kill you for the amount it has in it), tried their pizza, their sandwiches, their soups, etc.They nailed all of them. All of them!In my last visit, I had the Lobster Fettuccine. You should see the size of these lobster chunks! I took a pic that I'll upload. Big lobster pieces with lots of taste! BAM! One thing that I'm always cautious about with Italian food is sauces - sometimes I'll get this very tomato-ey (you know what I mean) sauce, that just doesn't taste good. It's so overpowering that you don't taste anything else.Not this sauce baby. It was like half tomato half creamy sauce - it was divine.Either way, awesome lunch and one of my fave places to eat....until I try Bicycle Thief & Amano. :D
<review# 547,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/7/2012,3/28/2013,13,25,3,4,3>I've been here twice and I have to say that I really like this place. The first time I ordered a burrito and it was good. But I know in the end I am much more an enchilada girl. Today I had the Chicken Mole Enchilada and it was fantastic. Three enchiladas, rice, black beans, pico de gallo and guacamole. Holy Mole. It sure was a lot of food. Get a take out container, you're probably going to need it. This was my first try of mole sauce. Not quite as dark as I thought it would be but I could definitely taste the hint of chocolate. Overall, it was very nicely balanced. My favourite on the plate was of course the star, the enchilada. I liked the softness of the tortilla and the chicken was moist and delish. Paired with the mole sauce it presented some nicely layered flavours. I have to say, this place is more Authentic Mexican than it's fusion counter part in Dartmouth. But I like them both. This place is set up like a fast food. Pick your dish, pick your toppings away you go. There is limited seating. But it wasn't a problem on this Wednesday noon hour. One thing that did impress what the staff. The guy who made our special came around to see how everyone was enjoying the food. He was also happy to give me a little sample when I told him i wasn't sure if I would like mole sauce. Overall it was a great experience. I definitely will be back. One thing I would note for improvement would be the nachos. My daughter ordered some nachos with just cheese the first time we went. What can I say, she is a pain in the enchilada. Heaven forbid she order something with a vegetable on it. When we got them, there wasn't much cheese at all and the nachos were a little on the stale side. She really likes them at Habaneros. Anyway, otherwise I really like this place. They are also doing a great job on Facebook. Check in there to see the mouthwatering daily specials and you won't be able to stop yourself from going. facebook.com/CantinaMexiJust realized that 3 out of my 8 reviews are Mexican fare - OLE!

In the grand scheme of things, there's just not a lot of reason for me to visit the industrial park. So when everyone told me that they had amazing Lebanese food over there, I started praying that this treasure would make its way across the harbour - and now we're in luck. Kababji is amazing. Their lunch menu is a great bang for your buck. I had the Spinach Fattayer and an order of Fattoush and I was not disappointed. Actually, I took the salad home with the intentions of eating my leftovers with my dinner, but thanks to my non-existent will power I've pretty much polished it off this afternoon - after which I loudly proclaimed 'I LOVE YOU LEBANON' Please go to this restaurant right now, we don't want it to suffer the same fate of all the other establishments on the corner of Salter who have set up shop, and soon disappeared.If you're constantly looking for your fix of Lebanese food during the other 51 weeks of the year that don't include Lebanese fest, then this is the place for you.'This is the best Lebanese food I've had in Halifax, aside from Lebanese Fest' - Sarah Carver, Lebanese food enthusiast
<review# 550,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/20/2013,3/25/2013,14,61,3,3,3>We went to Bistro Le Coq by accident. We'd been planning to eat somewhere else on Argyle Street and ended up getting a parking space right outside. As a testament to human laziness, we opted to eat at the closest restaurant instead. Bistro Le Coq strikes the perfect casual/fancy balance. It's comfortable and it feels like it could actually be a French bistro. There are lots of nice little touches, like a bottle of still water left on the table and nice warm slices of baguette to start. We were there on a Tuesday evening and it wasn't very busy - just enough to feel comfortable. Our server was efficient and helpful and spoke French, which added to the authenticity of the place.I ordered the roast chicken with frites. The chicken was juicy and seasoned to perfection and the frites were crispy and delicious. Our meals were reasonably priced - $19 for my chicken. They were also offering a special three-course fixed-price menu for the month of February for $45, which looked outstanding. Quite a happy little parking accident after all! I look forward to going back for gnocchi soon. Date night success!
<review# 551,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/26/2013,3/24/2013,27,83,,9,3>Finally we have bakery here in Halifax that promotes Chinese (Cantonese) type of pastries. This really makes the Chinese diaspora in the area feel a little closer to home. Although I would say it not 100% perfect, but it does have a fair variety. For the locals who are unfamiliar with this kind of fare, may I recommend that the first choice is to go for the "egg tarts". Chinese eggs tarts are a MUST. And that's exactly what my wife and I went for. Based on our first try, Kee Heong, does it just right - right kind of flakiness to the pastry and texture for the filling. You won't be disappointed. Secondly, go for the "Bo lo" bun. Ok, to be fair, coming from Singapore and Malaysia, we can say the bolo bun's there are way better than the one's here in Kee heong, but its still not that bad. The bread texture is just the way it ought to be. But I would have love to have the filling to be little more and the top layer of crusted icing to be a little "crustier" (if there's a word for that). Overall, a nice quiet place to hang out and to savour and sample different types of pastries apart from the usual fare and also ones from other immigrant communities such as greek, middle eastern (like baklava, etc.) - now you have oriental instead. Halifax is becoming more cosmopolitan by the day.

<review# 554,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2013,3/21/2013,25,117,2,5,4>Mmmm, Greek food....!When my husband suggested we head to Ela for my birthday dinner I was thrilled. I love me some delicious Greek food and I knew the place wouldn't be too busy on a Thursday. So, after we bundled in many, many layers to brave the -22 weather, we headed out. I was right, Ela was not busy and we were seated at a little table for two near the entrance but off to the side enough that we had some privacy. (FYI: The tables are low, my tall husband kept hitting his legs on it and could have just lifted it right off the ground if he wanted. Erp!)The service at Ela is always good. They are quick, courteous and always helpful with the menu. Hubs ordered a ravioli (at a Greek place?!) and I got the stuffed chicken. His pasta was AWESOME! Lots of cheese and spinach and a great roasted red pepper and tomato sauce. My stuffed chicken was just as awesome - lots of spinach in the chicken and a perfect amount of sauce on top. My salad, I opted for that instead of seasonal veggies, was perfect and absolutely delicious. My one complaint with the meal was my lemon potatoes - they were cold and mushy and just generally not great. We finished off with a new chocolate cake they have. Be warned it's RICH, very rich. But delicious. The bill came to about $60 for both of us, not bad considering we both got a large meal and dessert! Great birthday dinner to start off a great new year!

Well lemme break it down for ya:Beer. Good selection (including my love, Propeller Porter) beer cocktails when you wanna switch it up, and totally decent prices. Food. Foggy spuds. Goggle Burger. Peanut bowl. All delish. I'll never say no to eating at the Gogg. Bonus for comfort food without a deep fryer! Service: The gals are totally awesome. I've gotten hands down, some of the best service in the city here. They're friendly and cheerful, wry and funny. We've gotten into more than one nostalgia session about 90s music and TV while I settled up my bill.Atmosphere: Not too loud, but not dead, either. Juuust right.Keep foggin' up them goggles, for the good of Halifax!
<review# 556,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2013,3/19/2013,39,130,,3,2>I don't know why it took me so long to go to Chives. I've always heard rave reviews of the place, so when I finally got my butt in one of their seats I was expecting quite a bit, and I must say - they did not disappoint. Chives exists in a curious place where "cozy and homey" meets "fine-dining" but it totally works. The food is delicious and artfully prepared and the service is stellar. (Also, I will never say "no" to a freshly baked biscuit with butter.)Of note - this is one of the only places I have purposely ordered a vegetarian meal (I'm not even slightly vegetarian... but I just wanted to mix it up a bit) and REALLY enjoyed what I was served. If you're in the mood to treat yourself, you should certainly give Chives a try.
<review# 557,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/13/2012,3/18/2013,27,107,,4,2>I have been going there since it opened and it offers hot dishes, cold sandwiches, beverages, desserts, fruit.  Kinda everything.It's a pretty good spot if you want a miss mash of stuff.  Sometimes fruit, cheese, and a domino square.  Sometimes a wrap, milk and some hummus.  They have a lot of choice.
<review# 558,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/26/2012,3/17/2013,13,71,,6,2>Oh yes I'm a fan.I've been to Edible Matters twice and both times was blown away by the quality of the food they serve.First though, a bit about the place.  When you first walk in and see the loaves of fresh bread and local produce on the table, you know you're in a nice place.  The vast, bright dining room is very inviting.  The only wonky thing currently about EM is the fact that you order and pay at the counter and they then deliver your meal to your table.  It seems a bit awkward for a place of this quality but I've heard this might soon change.On my first visit, I had a BBQ duck sandwich, served with homemade chips and sweet pickles.  It was excellent.  The meat was flavourful and moist, and the bread was amazing.  I also had the soup of the day, which was a cream of celery.  Yum.For my second visit, I chose to go with their lunch special, which was gnocchi with beef cheek.  The texture of the gnocchi was spot on; I have rarely had better.  The sauce was so rich and had clearly had a generous splash of red wine before being reduced to thick goodness.  The beef cheek was so tender, you could tell it had been braised for a while.  I am looking forward to visiting EM for supper soon!
<review# 559,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/9/2013,3/16/2013,20,178,,4,3>I visited on the third day open and it's cool. The lunch line wasn't long at 11:45 am but it got longer as I waited. They serve soup, salad, sandwiches, snacks, bakery, hot and cold beverages. I think the prices are the same as downtown at $7 for a small salad and sandwiches $7-8. There are two checkouts and the wait was no longer than anywhere else on campus at noon.The salad station could have moved faster and the salad didn't bust outta the container like they do downtown, that could use some improvement. Of course you have to wrestle to find an empty table in the SUB, so try your luck.
<review# 560,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/3/2013,3/15/2013,25,107,4,8,3>I think we can all agree that car repairs SUCK. What's even worse is when you don't know much about cars, so you constantly feel like you're maybe being  (pardon the pun) taken for a ride when you go to any mechanic. Recently what- in my lack of mechanical knowledge mind- should have been a quick fix job turned out to be a hefty (read expensive) endeavor. A week before Christmas. The place I had been taking my car seemed legit enough, but when you're faced with a bill that big, you're going to panic a bit and get a second opinion.  I did some asking around and these guys were recommended to me by a co-worker. With nothing to lose, I figured I'd give them a shot.The shop is nothing to look at, it is all business. The owner is not one for small talk, but he does know his stuff. Their second opinion revealed more stuff that needed to be fixed, but a much lower price tag. After considering paying a random and sketchy dude on Kijiji to fix my car and risk possible death, I decided to do the adult thing and suck it up.Duffus Auto was quick and efficient and made this totally painful experience a little less traumatic.I got my car back and it smelled vaguely like cigarettes and motor oil, but if ever anything goes wrong again, I will waste no time in heading back to these guys!
<review# 561,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/17/2013,3/14/2013,29,249,2,3,2>Modern Orchid is a Pan-Asian restaurant located in Dartmouth Crossing, serving mostly Chinese and Thai inspired dishes. Their traditional sweet and sour stuff is about the same as elsewhere in the city, nothing too special and I have to give a pass to their Modern Orchid noodles which are basically a bland Pad Thai, but I did find enjoy their Singapore noodles, which I ordered accidentally, I meant to get the Shanghi Noodles, which many of my coworkers adore. I can't speak too much to the service, because I've only ever gotten take-out. as they offer a 10% discount, but the staff seem nice. Their main menu prices aren't bad, and they seem to have decently priced dine-in lunch specials.
<review# 562,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/15/2012,3/13/2013,12,118,,5,3>So the Dill Pickle is conveniently located to my workplace for a lunch time meal. I've seen the prepared food in passing for catering purposes but have not purchased a meal there until this evening (staying late at work, boo). I opted for the chicken pita and salad. I got lettuce, tomato, cucumber, cheese and red pepper mayo on the wrap. It was pretty good, although one half had like 10% sauce and the other half had like 90% sauce. I got the creamy pasta salad, which is okay but I sit here starring at it as it is just way to creamy and is leaving an odd taste in my mouth. Next time I will get the soup or garden salad instead. Everything is quite fresh here so that is a plus! - and it is reasonably priced, $5.75 for the wrap and salad, a bit extra for the cheese though.
<review# 563,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/30/2012,3/12/2013,37,121,2,6,3>OH MY LORD!!! HEAVEN on a plate! Ever since I heard of this place last week I've been dying to try it out... and today was the lucky day. Let me tell ya, it was definitely worth the walk from the south end in "feels like -17C" weather.I was meeting up with a few friends for a Friday lunch. When I arrived the place was just bussling! Packed to the bones with people waiting. Luckily, my friends (who chose to drive) where already sitting at the counter with a seat waiting for me :)I went in thinking I would get the smoked meat sandwich, but after sitting down for a few minutes and seeing all the orders coming out of the kitchen I was at a loss... and then I saw the special "Smoke Meat Mac N Cheese"... even harder to decide. One of my friend had the Reuben (which he loved). Since I couldn't make up my mind, I settled on the Deluxe Grilled cheese sandwich (with tomato and smoke meat on the inside) and split a Smoke Meat Mac N Cheese with my other friend (we couldn't get it as a side)...All I can say... FOOD COMA! Despite the $3 pop (since it was in a classic glass bottle I didn't seem to mind) overall this place was amazing and I will definitely be back.Be aware, it is cash only but they do have a bank machine on site!Go and enjoy! I know I sure did :)
<review# 564,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/19/2013,3/11/2013,54,227,2,5,4>I recently ordered takeout from B-well, and when I went to pick it up I was instantly tempted to eat in instead. I love the casual, comfy vibe they have here. As always with sushi places, I was most interested in the sushi pizza. It was tasty! One of the better ones I've had in the city, and I'd definitely return for it.We made a mistake in ordering the salmon tempura roll - the salmon was cooked, and if we'd read thoroughly we wouldn't have ordered it. Our fault, not the restaurant's. But, guys? Order the samurai balls.Balls of batter, cheese and covered in bonito flakes and seaweed, with a tasty sauce for dipping. I have no idea if they're a traditional dish, but they're amazing.

For at least three reasons: 1) It's close to my home. 2) My grandmother was German. 3) I have a sweet tooth.Having gotten that out of the way.... SOOOO GOOOOD. I'm mostly referring to their pastries here. They have loads of products but it pretty much breaks down to a 50/50 mix of pastries and breads. Bread is good. Bread is nice. Bread can be delicious. But bread ain't no cherry-filled turnover! Yes - pastries are where it's at in my books. While they are good straight from the vendor, I actually recommend taking them home, tossing 'em in the toaster oven for a few minutes. That way it'll be everything you want - warm, moist, and somehow soft and crispy at the same time.
<review# 566,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/2/2012,3/9/2013,21,7,2,9,4>This review is long overdue! We used Highland Drive catering for our wedding in July. Upon our first meeting with Jessi we knew she would be the perfect fit for a wedding with many guests that were coming from out of town. I have a dairy allergy, and we knew that there were guests that were coming that were vegan or had gluten allergies.Jessi put together an amazing menu that covered all of our needs and would leave our out of town guests with a true taste of Nova Scotia. We got to taste everything before hand and the BBQ chicken she came up with left me drooling for months. I did not think that was possible with chicken! Jessi was a great liaison between us and our rental company to ensure we had everything we needed for the big day.On top of a delicious meal, the Highland Drive catering team was not dressed in stuffy penguin costumes, instead cute dresses, red lipstick and pearls. It was the perfect touch for our venue.Working with Jessi every step of the way was a pleasure and from a pricing perspective extremely competitive with other catering companies in the city. Thanks to Jessi we were able to serve our wedding guests a unique menu that was perfect for us.
<review# 567,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/26/2012,3/8/2013,21,105,2,4,5>The newest addition to the Middle Spoon is the Speak Easy lounge, Noble. Very discrete, hidden away and with limited access, and very well made unique drinksVery enjoyable, nice atmosphere and they play it up as exclusive. The concrete bar with wooden top, raw wood shelving, plywood drink menus, soft lighting, old piano in the corner, barn style door, wall of books, and prohibition era music all add to the feeling of a very uniquely interesting place that is hidden away.It is the same bar tender that was the founding bar tender of The Drawing room, and creates the Middle Spoon's amazing concoctions. They are very prohibition era style and the place has nice character.They send out the password each week - Expected on Wednesday. They are open Thursday, Friday and Saturdays from 7:30-1am.The Absenth drink, (Death something?) was very well made and  the Puck R Up was one that I wanted to savour. It was our favourite of the evening.My husband was okay with the Roasted Maple something(?) and more enjoyed the Faceless Angel over a rock of ice. -If my phone hadn't died, I would have jotted in the proper names.There are several food items on the menu that sounded great, though we hadn't ordered  any on this night.I really am looking forward to our next venture there, though at a $78 total bill (including tip) for 4 drinks, it may not be a weekly occurrence.  The drinks are worth it as a nice treat.

And more than once they've saved me when I'm in need of plain to fancy hosiery for an event (because ladies, just avoid the drugstore hose, especially Shopper's Drug Mart). They're not terribly cheap, but it's always been worth the cost. And they know their stuff and are super friendly and helpful.

<review# 570,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/15/2013,3/5/2013,49,23,,6,4>Tess revisited. Non Crepe brunch items. You must explore them! Tess was always my other favorite Brunch destination with Jane's. Now that Jane's is closed, RIP :(  I come here more often.But today I am writing about the non crepe menu. A lot of people have misconceptions or maybe bad experiences with Crepes. Tess always has a specials board on the weekends. So if crepes arent your thing I recommend their soups, which in my mind are amongst the best ever in this city. They are usually purees in nature and are not shy about spices and garlic. I have never been disappointed by a soup at TESS. Also try their Quiche. I have tried several now off their specials board and they are all amazing. Like eating a cloud of delicate morsels.For me by far is their CROQUES. The Croque madame in the sandhich form or the waffle form. Both are amazing and unmatched in this city. The bread is from Julian's bakery, with glazed baked ham, Swiss & Gruyere cheeses topped with an over easy egg and drizzled with their signature Dijon sauce. The same goes for the waffle version except the ham is imbedded inside it. Utterly devastating and none of the friends I have steered towards this menu item have ever regretted it...Sometimes they have their croissant/cheddar/bacon breakfast sandwich up on the board. its not to be missed either. Always ask the staff for help or substitutions/additions. They excel at what they do. So if crepes aren't your thing there are other amazing items for brunch at Tess. enjoy.

Throw out the idea of every Chinese place in North America. Gone is the grease. Gone is the small portions. Up with the authenticity. fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection. Sauces that could make your mouth water, and food to fill your belly for days.The only knock for this spot would have to be it's location. Basically a storefront.. but you cannot blame that on them. You can just thank me for the review (hah). The restaurant area is a little cramped, and a little randomly decorated... but it oddly gives even a more authentic feel.The staff is very friendly, and almost precious. Great people, and willing to accommodate a lot of requests and are very fun to converse with.The prices are well well worth the food. Unbelievable stuff.Have you left yet?
<review# 572,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/30/2012,3/3/2013,39,80,2,9,5>I heart Ace Burger. Big time. My favorite combo is the Classic. It's just pure fresh delicious burger goodness. Of all of the new burger craze joints that have opened up around HRM (FlipBurger, Relish, etc.) Ace Burger's food is my hands down favorite. I've also tried the Deluxe burger which was good, but now know I don't wanna mess with a Classically good thing and will stick with my favorite. I've got to give the lamb, the veggie and the pork a try because they sound incredible. The locale in Gus' Pub I will admit had me a little intimidated upon my first visit. I'd never been in Gus' before Ace Burger opened. But the food makes it worth returning again and again. It's also handy to be able to order a beer from Gus' to go with your burger. Plus it's kind of the perfect dive-bar spot for burger eating. It's casual, it's quick and the Ace Burger staff are friendly and amazing. And who doesn't love a piece of Double Bubble to finish off an incredible burger meal?Some noteworthy things: 1) the goodness at Ace is CASH ONLY. So come prepared. 2) They are open late Monday to Friday. Usually 11:30am until 9 early in the week and until the shows are over at Gus' on Thursday, Friday, Saturday. 3) They are NOT open on Sundays. (unless that changes, which with their popularity it just might!) If you're hungry, if you have a burger craving, if you love fresh local food - get thee to Ace Burger pronto and enjoy!
<review# 573,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/3/2013,3/2/2013,39,42,3,12,5>My friends and I walked into Nena's and were immediately greeted by the owner and the waitress. This l'il joint opened a week ago, and their menus and menu boards haven't arrived yet, so our options were written on the white boards at the front. There are a bunch of different meaty combos, some pancakes (with ice cream or seasonal fruit if you like), a couple breakfast sandwiches, and lots of eggs. So far, there're no vegan options, but apparently the waitress' mom's gonna provide some gluten-free baked goods, and soon they'll be serving green and herbal tea. Our food was served in a Goldilocksian amount of time- not suspiciously quick, and not too slow. Everyone's eggs were cooked to their specification, and most pleasing of all, the homefries were delicious. My brother's request for cheese on his eggs benny amused the chef to no end, but he came through deliciously, with a delightful touch of dill on his order.  Our only complaint was that the beans were a little too mapley-sweet. The staff of this new 40-seater was super nice, taking the time to ask where we'd heard of the restaurant, where we were from, how we liked the food. I'm sure I'll enjoy it even more as they add some healthier options, and we'll definitely be back to check up on 'em. It's pretty dope to have a breakfast place in this part of Dartmouth, and they seem to be genuinely eager to meet the neighbourhood, and to meet the needs of their customers.

I had an errand to run on Quinpool--so decided to take a run into The Heartwood for a solo lunch. I had been wanting to try this place for so long!I went for the special: Beet Puree and a side salad.I was skeptical I must say. I mean I like beets--but had never had Beet soup.  Once again going for trying something I wouldn't normally was well worth the risk! I really enjoyed this. It was served just warm, it was a puree however there were still chunks of beets and...?? in it. The flavours were so nice and fresh.Now--the side salad--the real surprise. It was basically just a mixed green side salad. I think there may have been fennel shred in it. What also caught my eye was sweet potato? In a salad? Cooked. Ive never had sweet potato in a salad--but you know what? It worked! Chunks of roasted sweet potato. The salad was drizzled with a very light poppyseed vinegarette or some sort. Again the salad was so refreshing.I left there feeling satisfied--yet not heavy at all. Cost--I think I paid...$13.00 for my meal. I had only a glass of water--which the waiter was very good at keeping topped up!I can hardly wait to re-visit the Heartwood, perhaps I wont wait until another last minute broken lunch date next time!!

After working downtown Halifax and trying several times at that want-to-be-shoe-repair-place, I'm happy to say I can get my shoes/boots etc fixed now when needed.  These guys/gals rock!!!!I changed jobs a couple years ago taking me to Woodside and I then started doing my banking downtown Dartmouth just 5mins away, and lo and behold I caught this place out of the corner of my eye one day as I drove by.  I thought why not give them a try?  I mean just because you had the very worst experiences before doesn't mean they are all alike right?  Bang on is right.First I took it slow and dropped off a couple pair of shoes.  One pair was an old favourite that I got in London and was not likely to get again but having paid 5pounds for them I wasn't sure I wanted to spend a lot on the repair.  I opted for my truly favourites, and expensive by my standards, pair of Rockports.  I had worn them so much there was much wrong with them.  They assured me they could fix them and the cost was not bad at all (~20ish).  When I went to pick them up I was shocked - they looked brand new!  I've since taken back 2 more pair of shoes and a pair of suede boots.  All the work was to the very highest standards and they will ensure that both shoes/boots look the same in their repair - they even suede protected my boots!!!  The service is fantastic.  The two guys and one gal always seem happy,  They are courteous and very knowledgeable.  I HIGHLY recommend this place and I wish only one thing - that I had found them before I had one very expensive pair of hiking shoes fixed 4 times to have them break as I was leaving the plane into Cancun.  I was so pissed to not have a pair with me but why did I trust that it would be fixed for "real" this time anyway?  :)  Don't throw out those favourites - give these folks a try.

I've sat close to the stage and in the balcony and both have been very good. Sight lines are good and no problems hearing.I think the only shows I've been to (aside from Barometer Rising in 1986 in Junior High) have been the Holiday shows. This year was Elf and it was good but not my favorite. I've enjoyed Oliver and White Christmas from past years better.I really have had very little interaction with staff and have no complaints at all.

If you didn't already know it was there you probably wouldnt find it.When you walk inside the salon it is completely separated into specific sections. Although it makes it seem small I prefer it this way. When you're getting a manicure you don't have to smell hair dye. It suits the space very well.I went to the salon yesterday for a mini manicure. They had every colour of OPI you could ask for. But they also carried a vegan line of beautiful colours- so inclusive!My aesthetician was warm and friendly. She explained everything she was doing with professionalism. She did a lovely job on my very short nails which I know is hard to do. I just had regular nail polish applied.They also carry the OPI gel nail colour line. Where you can have your perfect polish stay on for 2-3 weeks straight. A great option if you'll be traveling or getting married. The price was fair and the service was great. I was truly impressed.
<review# 578,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2013,2/24/2013,61,77,2,5,2>Having lived so close to this historical spot its a wonder why I've just gone this month. From what I understand Tom's has been a everlasting joint of fine Italian fare- minus a wee bit of a closure.We popped by here when my too-tired-to-cook self thought we best eat out. Upon entering you'll likely be drawn into how tiny it is. Then you'll become delighted at how much character is jam packed in there!The walls reek of history. Our orders came quick and were loaded with simple, yet fresh ingredients.  A regular size pizza was surprisingly larger than I thought it would be. Since the man ordered a large, we had some goodies to take home with us. Service was great--as was the bill.
<review# 579,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/29/2012,2/23/2013,6,83,3,4,2>We didn't make reservations so we had to wait a few before they could sit three of us.  The servers were cool too, very pleasant and when two 'hot girls' busted in front of us thinking they could get a seat before us because they were wearing short skirts and long jackets, the server told them to basically get back in line.We had tempura vegetables and prawn, spicy Tuna roll, Philly roll, an assortment of Nigiri, deep fried Butter fish roll, and spicy Salmon roll.I'm totally not into the 'over the top sushi' with pineapple, lettuce or gold dust...just give me the basic and simple, because that's usually the really good stuff.
<review# 580,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2013,2/22/2013,38,94,6,3,3>On a cold Saturday afternoon, I needed something that will stick to my ribs and essentially pass out on the sofa for a few hours. The missus was heading towards Fairview and I asked.....I want bonehead BBQ take out!Picked up the phone and placed the pulled pork plate with mac & cheese & dirty rice. Also a piece of pie for the missus for being a good egg and getting it for me.My last  taste of Bonehead downtown didn't go as planned, but I figure that I would give it another shot and order the same thing.Let me tell you the take-out serving seems to be a lot more than the eat-in, which is very good thing IMO. Each item was in its own container and once I got everything on the table, I was wondering how I would finish it all.....Actually I didn't wonder that much, I ATE IT ALL! I'm sure I lost a few weeks of my lifespan eating this food.With a little bit of sweat on my forehead, I put the containers in the trash LIKE A BOSS! and proceeded to fall asleep on the sofa while watching video podcasts.I'm glad that the new location is much easier access for me and I'll be making this a take-out habit.The order with dessert came up to ~24$ and considering that I didn't eat again for 12 hours is good value.
<review# 581,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2012,2/21/2013,18,38,4,8,6>OH MY GOODNESSS!!!!!!!Yes! I am that excited about this! I am officially never moving out of the Quinpool area! I have everything I need on this little delightful road. And now with some Thai! So I dragged my friends for dinner (I even convinced one of them to join Yelp! Yay for Marie C.!) and we decided to try out the new thai place down the street. They atmosphere was a bit dark, but completely different from what I'm used to (for those of you who remember Athens and The Greek Village, it's not what you're thinking!) and it suits the place, the nice shades of yellow and the lovely chandelier closer to the cash. Not to mention the awesome statues everywhere. Okay, you need to notice the amazing table clothes.. they are so pretty that we were tempted to ask them if we can take them with us.The menu.... well, it's a bit overwhelming. Liz L. noticed that there's close to 700 items on the menu... so yes just a bit overwhelming. The service was quick and awesome as well. The most perfect veggie spring rolls, just simply cooked to perfection. I ordered the Green Curry Rice with chicken and oh my, the portions were huge! I did manage to eat 90% of the my meal, which was an amazing feat (and I was pretty hunger when I walked in). Now, I'm excited to have my Chicken Pad Thai tomorrow for lunch.I will defintely be back here very very soon!
<review# 582,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2012,2/20/2013,15,59,,4,3>I love the Salt Marsh Trail. It's a convenient family friend trail almost in the heart of Halifax, well Cole Harbour to be exact. It's a great option for a day outdoors, especially if you follow it to Lawrencetown. I wish the trail had been around when I was a kid, it would have been a great place for a bike outing. The trail is dog, hiker, walker, maybe horse, and bike friendly. You can get some fantastic views of the ocean and surrounding countryside.The only caveat I have is to make sure when you park your car is devoid of valuables and locked. I've heard a few times from the HRP and RCMP that the Salt Marsh Trail parking lots are often targeted for break-ins because of the remote location. Great for spring, summer, and fall hikes but winter may be a little tricky. The icy conditions, extra ocean cold, and lack of maintenance could be dangerous and generally not fun.
<review# 583,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2012,2/19/2013,9,18,1,7,6>So as many of you know Adam and I have two bearded dragons, Apollo who is 2 and (Tiger)Lilly who is 6 months old. Sadly we did previously have another dragon, Phoenix, but she passed away. In Halifax there are 2 (1/2) vet clinics that handle exotics. Fairview Animal Hospital, and the Sackville Animal Hospital. Poor Nixie tried to lay eggs one day and well things did not go well. We needed to take her to a vet and right away! Naturally this happened on a Friday night around 11pm, and I had been previously told that the emergency vet clinic did not handle reptiles (this was misinformation), so we waited until the morning and frantically called first thing. We were able to get in to see Dr. Benjamin the exotic specialist within an Hour. Although things didn't work out for Nixie all of the staff were extremely warm and welcoming. We walked in with our tupperware container and the second they saw us they said "Oh that must be Phoenix", and you could tell they all genuinely cared about us, our lizard, and wanted to do everything in their power to help. Some of the interns who were working there stayed with her the entire time she was there, trying to make sure she ate, that her distention was properly cared for and that she was warm and as comfortable as possible. Unfortunately Dr. Benjamin was not going to be in on Sunday and Nixie needed continued care so they did all the necessary paperwork, faxed it and called ahead to the emergency Vet Clinic, so that we could transfer Nixie there (which also saved us some money as they did not have to do a full exam and assess her injury or develop a treatment plan). About a week later we received a card in the mail signed by all the staff thanking us for choosing the Sackville Animal Hospital, and then about a week after we had called them to tell them that Nixie had passed away, we received a sympathy card from them with personalized notes from all the staff. Not just signatures but real notes. I have taken many pets to many vets and have NEVER felt like the vet clinic cared so much about the animals and owners. I would very highly recommend the Sackville Animal Hospital, and will continue to make the 45 minute drive to have my dragons cared for, rather than go to the closer exotic vet because the staff are so fantastic!
<review# 584,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2012,2/18/2013,9,53,2,5,3>One of the best things about living in Downtown Dartmouth is the Alderney Market.  We can complain that we don't have a permanent grocer, but there are now permanent stores in the market that offer fresh produce, meats and fish on a daily basis.  Don't forget that wineries often set up a table, so you can pick up a bottle of Nova Scotia's finest, or pop right into the NSLC to complement your market-bought meal.On Saturday?  Get yourself up, stumble down to the market with your cloth bags, and recover with a coffee and a selection of sweet or savory breakfast pastries, or even a cooked breakfast - Canadian style or International - curry, hummous, samosas....   Sit down and enjoy your food while taking in live music, or stroll around with your bounty so you don't miss anything else at the vendor tables; jewellery, preserves, cakes, organics, dips, artisan breads, free-range eggs, gluten-free goodies...there is always something new, especially seasonally.  However, you can do your weekly good shopping here easily.  Fresh produce that doesn't wilt in your fridge by the next day.  The market has announced it's expansion and now that Holidays are upon us, it's always more exciting with Christmas craft and gift ideas.This is truly 100-mile shopping, and enjoying the process, as opposed to slogging up and down a giant store aisle.  Love it!

I always find new and interesting titles here.  For such a small store (by big-box standards), they sure have a great and varied selection.  Staff are friendly and knowledgeable.  Their personalized service is like finding an old favourite pair of shoes in the back of your closet: "Oooh, I'd forgotten what good customer serivce is like!"I will join my fellow Yelpers in reminding everyone that there is more to life than Chapters and the discounted book tables at Costco.
<review# 586,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2012,2/16/2013,65,111,,3,3>I can't believe I haven't reviewed Biscuit yet! This is my happy place in Halifax. Many of my favourite things have come from this store: my super cute ice cream bowls, my Hunter rain boots, my favourite mustard yellow shoes, my sort of Mad Men-esque tie blouse, my Steve Madden knee high black leather boots, and some gorgeous jewelry/accessory pieces. It's such a fun and colourful store, even before you walk in the door. And once you do, your senses will be taken on a wonderful little trip around this retro, character-filled store. Most of the items you find here, from gift items to the salt and pepper shaker collection to children's books to shoes to bags to clothes to jewelry to greeting cards, won't be found elsewhere in the city.I've always received excellent service here. I'm greeted with a friendly smile in every section, and offered help every time. In August, I had put a pair of Hunter boots on hold for a few days because I knew my friends were getting me a Biscuit gift card for my birthday. I walked in the other day (3 months later), wearing the boots, and the sales clerk who'd put the boots on hold for me immediately called out, "Hey - you're wearing your birthday boots!" That's a very personal level of service and speaks volumes to the quality of service provided by Wendy and the Biscuits.
<review# 587,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2012,2/15/2013,24,41,3,5,4>Having been to FB three times now, I think I've finally amasses enough experiences to properly review it. I went once with a group, once with a friend, and one with my girlfriend, and received a similar experience each time. Overall, 4 stars out of 5, though some aspects dipped below 4.Customer Service: 4/5Unlike some other popular burger places in HRM, the line to order your food is relatively short. Each time I waited for 0-4 minutes to order, which is pretty good. The staff were friendly, helpful and patient. They weren't yelling at me to move in closer, they let me take my time to check out their full menu, and answered any extra questions I had. The wait to actually get the food was a bit longer (10 to 15 minutes), but really wasn't all that bad when compared with other dining businesses and their wait times.Atmosphere: 2/5Not overly friendly atmosphere. The decor was more or less bland when compared to other establishments. Seating was large-ish (maybe 40 to 50 seats?), though the seats were not overly comfortable either. Not very loud, so easy enough to have a conversation with a dining partner. Menu was easy to read, which was a nice change of pace. Price: 3/5Not crazy, but not great. For one person, you can expect to pay about $15 easily if you get a meal. Even if you only get a burger and nothing else, you could still expect roughly $10 by the end of it. Compared to other burger places, the price was pretty average, but compared to fast food prices, it was a bit high. Food: 5/5I mentioned above it was more expensive than fast food. Well, that also describes the food quality. Way better than fast food. I had the Peanut Butter topped burger and the spicy jalepeno/guac topped burger, and both were delicious. Topped high with delicious and fresh toppings and added goodies, the only problem was how to fit it in my mouth, and that's not really a bad thing. I've tried their fries, and their poutine, and both were great again (though the poutine could have had more cheese curds added). Their battered onion rings were crumbly and salty, but treated my taste buds just right. They also serve a wide array of milkshakes, that were also tasty, though not thirst quenching. All in all, a tasty adventure. I don't think my wallet or diet could handle regular repeat visits, but a good spot for a once in a while meet, date, or hunger-battling-stop-in.

Try this placeYou want some of the best fish and chips? Try this placeYou won't be disappointed, trust me!
<review# 589,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/14/2012,2/13/2013,22,150,2,6,4>We tried to eat here back on a busy Saturday evening in the summer, by the time it was our turn to order they were out of brisket and the pulled pork was going to take awhile so we left disappointed.  This time we arrived at 11:30 on a cold, drizzly Saturday morning and had the place to ourselves.With the attention of all the friendly staff, we had our food very quickly.  The two of us shared a Two Meat platter.  We got the beef brisket and the pulled pork for meat selections, mac & cheese and fries for sides and it came with a small serving each of coleslaw and cornbread, we added a second cornbread so we'd each have a piece.  Wow, I am so glad we didn't write this place off. The meat was tasty, tender and moist (something so sensual about that word fits the food here).  We didn't bother adding any of the sauces provided at the table, it was perfect naked.  The fries were done to a crispy outside, hot and soft inside, just the way we like 'em.  The mac & cheese was hot and creamy and while not as good as my home made of course, was still a delicious, hearty portion. I didn't try the coleslaw but B said he wasn't a big fan.  The cornbread was perfect.  I can't imagine how hungry I would have to be to finish off this platter on my own, even the two of us couldn't finish it off completely. I had tweeted about it being the perfect birthday meal and as we were finishing up our meal, one of the staff arrived with a perfect piece of chocolate peanut butter birthday pie with a candle!  I don't know if they make this pie in house but regardless, you have to leave room for this at least once in your life. I'm not up on real Southern BBQ but I know what I like and I like Boneheads BBQ.   For the sake of my health, I couldn't come here as often as I would like but I can't wait to get back and get me some more  smokey, meaty goodness.  Mmmm mmmm
<review# 590,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,9/16/2012,2/12/2013,20,72,,3,2>Elements specialises in using local produce, which has to be a good thing. It is situated in the ground floor of the Westin Hotel, which is one of the nicer Halifax establishments. Parking is available in the hotel car park, with tickets validated by your waiter. A big plus. Decor is unfussy and contemporary. On the night we visited in mid-September, there were only about a dozen covers, so what could have been quite a vibrant place was somewhat subdued. Background music was provided by a chap called Paul, with a straw hat and a guitar. And a good voice. Level and genre (standards and classics) were pitched just right. On to dinner. Service was friendly, informed and unobtrusive. I kicked off with the gazpacho with local mussels. Very tasty. The seafood stew was a bit too reliant on two largish chunks of fish, but flavourful and filling, nonetheless. My wife's lobster and scallops came with a replacement curry sauce, on which she wasn't too keen, but otherwise no complaints. The wine list is mostly Nova Scotian and would benefit from having the grapes listed, as not everyone is familiar with the local hooch. Very reasonably priced, by Halifax standards, which is a major plus. Nice to see the chef getting out and about in the restaurant.
<review# 591,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2013,2/11/2013,18,151,2,5,4>I had purchased a WagJag coupon for Seoul Restaurant and was eager to try it out. I'd become a fan of Korean cuisine thanks to several very pleasant visits to Koo-E Nami Grill, so my friends and I were excited to give this place a shot.As many others have noted, it's easy to walk right by Seoul Restaurant. It's certainly not a dive - bright interior (a little plain, but that's okay), an appropriate number of tables, and an interesting graffiti wall along the foyer. We ordered California rolls, shrimp tempura, and some other kind of sushi that had salmon in it. I don't care for sushi but sampled the California rolls anyway - they really were pretty good, and my friends were so taken with them that they ordered a second round. The shrimp tempura was melt-in-your-mouth delicious.I honestly cannot recall the names of most of our entrees, but mine, a large clay bowl of moderately spiced chicken stew, was quite good. The rice that accompanied my meal was perfectly cooked. My friend enjoyed her bulgogi and its side dishes, and our male dining companions inhaled whatever it was that they had. The meat in all of our dishes was extremely tender - always a bonus!Our waitress was friendly and had a good sense of humor. Wait times were appropriate. The place was about half full by the time we left, but given the well-spaced tables, the atmosphere remained fairly quiet throughout our meal. Extra stars for that.We we be returning to Seoul!

Functioning in the previous grill location it offers the typical Chickenburger staples of chickenburgers, hamburgers, fries, onion rings and even milkshakes. Seating is in the surrounding food court area of the Student Union Building but you can also get take out. Service was quick despite this only being a location that's functioned for a week. The location is staffed by Sodexo no doubt due to the long standing DSU agreement. Just popping in for a quick lunch break bite I tried the large fries and a medium vanilla milkshake which came to $5.50 with tax. Not liking ketchup the Manager, Adam, happily fulfilled my request for a cup of mayo. Colour me happy I can now satisfy that milkshake craving during the academic year.
<review# 595,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/2/2012,2/7/2013,40,216,3,5,3>What do you do when you have the day off work and find $25 on the ground? You go out to lunch to a place that's on your very literal list of restaurants to try! Being that this would be my first meal of the day, I didn't want anything too heavy so I opted for Star Anise, a Barrington Street and pho staple that I have walked by hundreds of times, but never patronized. The restaurant is about half full when I walk in, just enough people so that there's a bit of a background noise, but not so many that the place is packed and the capacity is going to slow down the kitchen. There's even a good smattering of Asian customers and presumably Vietnamese script on the menu, generally a good sign for these sorts of restaurants. The decor is warm and welcoming with a red and yellow palate and a exposed brick wall on one side of the restaurant, although the generic euro-esque painting prints on the walls seemed very out of place. Service was quick and attentive, perfect for a business lunch if I was having such a meal today. However, it turns out the food I ordered would not be optimal if you were looking to be in out and quickly. Looking at their lunch specials, a pho dish is oddly absent, so I ordered a Vietnamese pork spring roll ($2.25) and jasmine tea ($2.00) to start, along with a bowl of beef ball and beef flank pho ($10.99). The jasmine tea was a little disappointing as it was just a tea bag and not the loose leaf variety, although it still had a nice jasmine flavour in the green tea. The spring roll made for a great appetizer, filed with minced pork, carrot, sprouts, taro, glass noodles. The wrap is crispy and flaky, and the filling has a nice pork flavour with its added seasonings and each bite breaks away easily, rather than having much of the long pieces of sprouts and julienned vegetables pull out, which can be an issue with spring rolls.The  bowl of pho arrives and it's impressive, probably the largest bowl of soup of any kind or ethnic origin that I've ever had. This is going to take some time and appetite, both of which I was fortunate to have. Being the proud omnivore that I am, I start off tasting the meat; the slices of flank are nice and tender, although the significant chunks of fat in them are a bit chewy. The beef balls are meatballs that are cut in half and their rubberiness, consistency and flavour have me suspecting that they are simply from-frozen Swedish meatballs and they leave me disappointed. The broth is rich and not too salty and is brightened up by cilantro and green onion, and is given further depth with a few squirts of hoisin and sriracha. The plentiful noodles are the perfect size and I'd equate them to thin rice linguine. I'm extremely thankful that I was wearing a dark-ish shirt at the time as there was a significant splatter zone around my bowl. I don't know if it's possible to eat pho neatly with chopsticks, but if it is, I certainly can't do it.I'd have to give my Star Anise experience a 3.5 star rating were such sorcery possible, as it was more than OK, but not something I would rave about. With excellent service that they have, if there was a little bit more attention to detail in the kitchen and other smaller issues with the business, Star Anise would definitely be a place to go back to fill all your over-sized soup needs.PS. I wasn't hungry for a solid 10 hours after this meal. No lie.
<review# 596,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2013,2/6/2013,28,24,3,4,4>The old triangle is my go to spot....and not just for a great stout. Found in downtown Halifax the Old triangle is a traditional Irish bar. The bar itself has a great layout, with two levels with two large bars as well as multiple private rooms , this helps disperse patrons . I'm absolutely in love with the decor of this pub, it's warm and inviting yet still holding true to the traditional Irish feel. Covering the light yellow and green walls are paintings of Celtic folklore, which go we'll with their stunning stained glass windows. Now the menu .. I could honestly spend a days gushing over this menu ... But I won't.  The old triangle's menu is AMAZING, is a great balance between typical pub grub ( which is superb ) and traditional irish dishes which I recommend you all try because they are to die for ! If pub grub and meat are not your jam don't worry they have you covered with tons of veggie options.The veggie oat burger will knock your socks off and is mushroom free. Plus they have a large beer, whiskey  and other spirits selection that would put ,my fridge to shame.If you want a super fun ,relaxed ,traditional east coast night where enjoy great food, beer and  you hear all the classics like The Night Pat Murphy Died then this is you're kind of  place !
<review# 597,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2012,2/5/2013,56,312,5,3,3>THEY HAVE FRIED PICKLES.I think it's only a "holiday thing", not that I know why those are seasonal, but still, that's awesome. They're one of my favourite bar snacks, going way back to when I was in university. Back when you could smoke in bars, drink $10 pitchers of draft, and play darts all night while eating things like fried pickles.We went for more of an adult dinner, which was satisfying to all involved, by the looks of it. I had fish and chips which were tasty, though the batter looked so dark I was expecting them to be burned/overdone. Despite the initial disappointment over the appearance, what actually mattered was how they tasted, and we were good there.My wife had the black and blue burger, and the impression I get was that it was good. The couple we dined with, well, I don't remember what they had but I do know that we all left reasonably happy, and that the bill was reasonable for what we had.I can't give five stars for a few little things, like packaged tartar sauce. Is making it fresh (or at least duping me into believing you did) so hard?!
<review# 598,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2013,2/4/2013,8,31,2,5,5>No reviews on this little healthy fast food place? Time to change that! I've always overlooked it in the food court for the big brand appeal of (to paint myself in a flattering light) Teriyaki Express or (to be honest) New York Fries... but a few days ago, I found myself in a crowded food court, looking around for the shortest lineup. Healthyway Café presented itself and I suddenly realized I could go for a wrap.I ordered a spinach wrap with vegetables. I was pleased because there were lots of the usual veggies to choose from, plus all kinds of other options. They don't have the bazillion cheeses and sauces of Subway, but I felt a little healthier eating this excellent wrap. I even ate the broccoli I asked for! When the cashier rang it up, she accidentally entered a meat wrap (veggie wraps are a dollar cheaper, woo hoo!), but I pointed it out and she was quick to correct it. Service was quick and friendly, the food was tasty, and I didn't have to wait in a lineup forever. If you want your wrap cut in half, ask before you're done putting veggies on, as they're quick to wrap it up in the wrapper for you.The spinach tortilla it was all bundled up in was pretty decent, but I saw an intriguing option that looked like sun-dried tomato and I'm definitely going to try that next time. There were several different healthy food options there. I'm not overwhelmed with love for this place, but it certainly earns more than three stars, so until I take a few more food court trips, this place will sit solid with 4 stars in my book. Give it a shot!

The staff are so friendly, and made me feel comfortable. Dr. Stephen Creaser has a true passion/love for his job. He explains all of the steps he is taking and insured that I was completely comfortable (yay no pain!!). He also takes photos of your teeth! So at the end of your appointment you get to see (from his view) what he did, why and how! Its pretty (gross) cool! Dr. Creaser's prices are really reasonable too! Their staff are really helpful when it comes to insurance as well! I actually am looking forward to my next appointment, not really, but I definitely am more comfortable with the thought of going!!
<review# 600,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2013,2/2/2013,11,51,3,5,4>Visited with some friends at the Dresden location a couple of months ago.  It was a fairly quiet day when we arrived, giving a nice relaxing sit-down (for the most part).I ordered the Tako Karaage to start, along with the house roll.  For being a nicer sit-down restaurant it naturally took some time for the meal to arrive; but when it did, was it ever good!Prepared just right, flavorful and well presented, the menu surpassed my expectations by a longshot.Be warned, it's not the kind of place I'd take kids, if only because of the slightly more formal (not casual, not full formal) atmosphere.
<review# 601,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/7/2012,2/1/2013,27,148,4,5,3>Came here for the first time last night with a friend to celebrate my birthday.  What a nice evening!  The ambiance is perfect, dim lighting, views of the harbor, etc.  our server was great.  Friendly and attentive but never in the way.  Had one of the cocktails of the day as well as the chef's special pasta. The cocktail was so good (cranberry juice, allspice syrup, fresh ginger, and some other stuff) was so good that I had 5!  (I promise, I'm not an alcoholic, haha).  The pasta was lovely and the Cesar salad we split as an app was so good.  Lots of garlic!  They also bring you soft bread with roasted red pepper hummus while you're perusing the menu.  Food came out quickly, which surprised me given there wasn't an empty seat in the place. I will be going back to the Bicycle Thief as soon as I have an excuse!
<review# 602,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/21/2012,1/31/2013,33,173,5,4,3>Two words for you: Avocado Fudge.  If you see these golf-ball sized hearts of chocolatey goodness, don't hesitate, and buy one.  In fact, buy two; one to eat now, and another to gobble down in secret later, away from hungry eyes.  While you're at it, stock up on their cleverly-named Ravenous bars for that pick-me-up you'll need when the midday slump hits.  You'll feel like you're spoiling yourself, and smirk while you eat it, knowing that the delicious snack you're shoving into your maw is actually good for you.  I think if Poe had these snacks nearby, his crow would have quoted "I want more!" instead.
<review# 603,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/12/2012,1/30/2013,12,153,3,5,3>Last night I was finally able to take in the Q experience.  The decor of the place certainly suits them.  Rustic and western-ish without feeling like you're in the wild west of yesteryear.  The service was great.  There was one fellow in particular (unfortunately do not recall his name) that was exceptional at making sure everyone was well taken care of.  On the service front they've got it down.My friend and I each ordered the quarter chicken with ribs: her with beef ribs myself with the half rack pork ribs, both with memphis sauce.  I got fries and the mac  and cheese for my sides, she chose fries and potato salad. n  Oh, and a basket of onion rings to share. The food came out extremely quickly.  We both anticipated a bit of a wait, however within minutes our food was on our table.  It looked delicious.  My ribs looked a little burnt, however.  Flavor wise, it was delightful.  The memphis sauce had just enough punch for my liking.  the chicken, while tasty, was a bit dry.  And my ribs were also quite dry and tough, and not nearly saucy enough for my liking.   She found the same with her chicken, and was just not really a fan of the beef ribs.  She also noted they weren't saucy enough for her either.  My mac and cheese was tasty, and was surprised to find there wasn't a huge puddle of oil in the bottom of the bowl as usually happens with M&C.  Both meals also came with a small piece of corn bread and a cup of coleslaw.    She enjoyed the slaw I was less of a fan.  We both wished the piece of corn bread had been larger.  At the end we both agreed we won't make it a point to go back based on the food quality.  That isn't to say we won't go back at some point, but we won't make it a planned thing.  Service wise, great.  Food wise, mediocre.
<review# 604,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2012,1/29/2013,65,55,,3,3>Do yourself a favor and check out a show at Shakespeare By the Sea - you wouldn't regret it. Always on the hunt for new activities in Halifax, I was definitely on-board when a friend suggested we check out Alice In Wonderland - What. A. Show!I'll start with the actors - very talented, high energy, engaging and clearly passionate about what they do. I wanted to crawl in bed myself after looking at the schedule and realizing that these guys put on about eight shows in one week. The amount of energy they bring to the show is extraordinary! There wasn't a dull moment in Alice in Wonderland.The outdoor venue is the coolest part about the experience. Situated within Point Pleasant Park, you couldn't ask for a cooler stage!! The actors are great at projecting their voice and using the whole space. As someone who frequents the Park often, it's great to see the space getting used for more than just dog walking. Apparently there were over 350 people at the show the other evening... you definitely couldn't tell! I guess that's the great thing about an outdoor venue, you don't feel crammed in with your neighbor.My suggestion, grab a friend, grab an ice cream, and take a walk to catch a show. A few tips... 1 - arrive early. We got there 30 minutes before and got great seats - definitely worth a bit of a wait. 2 - don't park in the waterfront parking lot and walk up the stage. Apparently they close the gates at night and you're left waiting in the parking lot until someone comes to let you out. Not that that happened to us...
<review# 605,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2012,1/28/2013,29,84,2,2,4>I recently popped in to the new Humani-T location armed with a $30 Teambuy credit and wondering how I would use it up in just one visit. I had offered to take a friend to lunch but it wasn't the right day, and I needed lunch darnit!One thing I tend to look for when eating out on my lunchbreak is a place where I know I will have some leftovers for the next day or later on when a snack is needed. When I walked in to the cafe I was impressed by how bright and colourful and patterend it was - great decor, and the staff were all super friendly and helpful from the first step in to my last step out. Sandwiches are currently located all the way at the back of the place, which isn't obvious at first but is fine if you know where you're going. Basically there are three areas where you can order different things, and it wasn't too busy when I went in midday on a weekday but I bet it gets super busy at times and the lineups might be confusing. I spotted a chicken pesto sandwich and asked for a side of the bean salad. Then to use the credit I had, I ordered two pints of gelato. Of course I meant to take them home but it has been too warm to walk home with them and so they've stayed at work which has been two weeks of good afternoon treats at the office! The sandwich was great, they grilled it panini-style for me to take away and the pesto was delicious. It was plenty for lunch so I saved the bean salad for the next day, a great way to economize. The staff are great for recommendations and liberal with samples of gelato, which is awesome. You can mix 2-3 flavours in one pint container, so I got one with half chocolate, half bacio (hazelnut/chocolate) and one with raspberry and lemon-lime, which is super refreshing. I also recently learned that every night from 11 pm - midnight they do a gelato happy hour, buy one get one half off - what a great date night sweet ending!
<review# 606,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/6/2012,1/26/2013,3,31,2,5,5>We've driven by here plenty of times but just recently stopped in on a Sunday evening for a bite to eat with the kids.If you like delicious bread and high quality ingredients, this is the place for you.  The menu is small but what they do at Pavia they do very, very well.I ordered the Pavia pannini, a delightful combination of feta cheese, manzanilla olives, and pepper garlic jelly from The Tangled Garden.  The pannini had a salty sweetness from the combination of ingredients and was fantastic.  My husband ordered the Alla' Amentea which combined fresh mozzarella, prosciutto, green olives, and a drizzle of olive oil.  It too was quite delicious.  My husband said there was a bit too much cheese for his taste, but he admitted that he really isn't much of a cheese person.  Lastly, our five-year-old son ordered the Nuova Scotia, an aged cheddar, ham, and basil wine jelly concoction.  He sat there saying "mmmm.  MMMMM!" The whole time, and I managed to snag a bite and it was also fantastic.Dinner for the three of us was $37 with tax and tip and I was happy to pay every cent.  We will be going back soon to sample the coffee and sweets!
<review# 607,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2012,1/25/2013,59,150,3,9,2>Best Choice was one of the first Chinese food places I ordered from when moving to Halifax. I was, and still am, blown away by the portion sizes. They're huge!! You could seriously eat your combo plate for an entire week.When me and my soon-to-be-roommate order from there we go splitsies. We will get a combo plate - rice, chicken balls etc and an order of Cantonese Chow Mein. We'll go back for seconds and there will still be left-overs! The plates are just that big! The Cantonese Chow Mein is really good - but I wish it had more of a kick to it; it's really needing some spice! But - it has chicken, beef, pork and shrimp all in one dish! The only thing I don't like is their egg rolls.Very fast service, prices are decent; but they do charge a $5.00 delivery fee.
<review# 608,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2013,1/24/2013,17,52,,3,3>Free billiards table... need I say more? Well of course I do but all in all, the Freeman's location on Grafton St isn't half bad. We were really there for a pint and some pool but the server was very friendly and the place was clean. I have yet to try it out on a busy night (it is JUST across from Cheers afterall) nor have I eatten there so I can only go by what I see. I have eatten at the Quinpool location and enjoy their food so I can only imagine it's on the same level. It's a great place to visit with a group of friends or a casual date - not for a family meal or a special evening with your man or lady.
<review# 609,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2012,1/23/2013,76,115,2,5,3>This store makes me happy. First of all, it's just so darn pretty to look at. The way they have the store laid out and decorated is really chic, but with a fun, hip twist. Second of all, they carry super cute and well-made pieces that you won't see everywhere else, and many of them by local artisans. Last time I visited I picked up a gold necklace with a pen point charm and I absolutely love it (I have pretty much worn it every day since). Thirdly, the girls that work here are super nice and always have the best outfits on. You just get the sense from this place that the owners are really passionate about what they do, that they handpick each item lovingly, and that they have their finger on the pulse of what is happening in Halifax and what fashionable Halifax ladies are looking for. I have to admit that most of their prices are out of my range, however, these items scream quality in the construction and fabrics, plus they are unique, so I totally understand the prices (it just means I can't purchase things here as often as I would like *sadface*). So glad to see a chic boutique doing so well downtown - I really hope it sticks around!
<review# 610,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/7/2012,1/22/2013,8,63,1,5,2>I've visited Jenny's numerous times over the last decade and have been impressed with the quality of the food about 95 percent of the time.The inside of the restaurant is nothing special; however, they spent some money fixing up the bathrooms.  I would warn people that plan on sitting in a booth that the windows are really thin, so you may have to keep your sweater on in the wintertime as you could get a cold chill.On this night, I went to Jenny's with my mother and cousin and decided on the pan fried haddock over the chicken fingers and fries.  I still ended up getting fries with the haddock and salad, although you could receive rice if you wanted to.The food was nice and the service on this day was good as well.  In general, the pub is only half-full during supper hour; however, they do get a good crowd on the weekends as various bands or karaoke takes place.Overall, a good experience and I recommend you pop down on a Wednesday or Thursday night as the haddock is terrific and they have a good deal on the chicken wings.
<review# 611,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/12/2012,1/21/2013,18,60,2,3,3>I really love this burger place, and since visiting it I feel that no other has held up. First, they have unique burger combos, which I love. I choose the Legendary CC Porker. The thing that really made the customer service top notch (in my books), was that I knew I would not be able to eat this double burger, and asked if I could have it with just one patty. Not only did they tell me it was not a problem, they did not charge me for the full thing. I would say it is difficult to find a business nowadays that would do that. It took a little while to get the burger, but I will not complain as it was made fresh, and there were a few people in front of me. My favourite part was their Subway-eque toppings bar. You can choose your own toppings without additional cost! Imagine that! From hummus, to bruschetta or the classic dill pickle - there were many choices, and I can't wait to go back and try other combinations of toppings. The burger itself was cooked wonderfully, and the staff were very friendly. Wish they had one in Halifax, so I did not have to trek over the bridge for this excellent food and service.
<review# 612,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2012,1/19/2013,13,213,2,5,2>The shop is run by students of the NSCC Akerley campus. Store hours this year are Wed, Thr and Fri open at 11:00 am but that could change to 11:30 am as I thought it was open 11:30 in past years. Runs to about 1:00pm but the shelves are empty most days shortly after 12:15 pm so come early. Breads mostly with some cakes and sweet things. Price wise it is very cheap. Bread only between 1.50 to 2.00 and rolls today were only 1.50 for 13. Same even better then any artisan bake shop at a fraction of the price. Mostly staff and students shop here but no ID required or rules posted so I cannot see why the general public can't stop by if you are in this area on one of the said days and time?
<review# 613,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2012,1/18/2013,26,201,,7,4>Ahhhhhhhh.....some of the most tasty food I have ever had. The food is so fresh and filled with flavour. Even the hummus is better than most I have had. The chicken, and lamb are delicious. But The lentil wrap is soooo yummy. The red sauce they give you on the side is such a good addition to the meal. And don't get me started on that amazing rice, and deliciously soft pita!Super nice staff with a beautiful atmosphere. And Free belly dancing shows on Saturdays!
<review# 614,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/30/2012,1/17/2013,13,104,3,5,3>By far the best poutine in town hands down. I'm all about simplicity and Willie's does it right. I personally just like the 3 basic rules for a great poutine:- Crispy fries, not too crispy and not soggy- Tasty gravy, not too salty but not bland- Cheese curds, not mozzarella or any other substitute - it has to be cheese curdsI find with other places they do 2 things wrong:1) They get one or more of the 3 basics wrong2) They try too hard and put too much stuff in itAnd the best part about Willie's is consistency - every time I go there, I get the same poutine and it's the same experience. My expectations are always met!
<review# 615,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/9/2012,1/16/2013,13,25,,6,4>I have been to Cheachie's three times. Everyone is right. It's very tucked away in Bayer's Lake near the NSLC headquarters and well it makes you feel just a little special that you know it's there. I'm fond of this spot for a few reasons. It's a small local joint, not a chain restaurant. The food is fresh and good quality. They take a lot of pride in the food. The service is friendly. The ambiance in Cheachie's is okay. They are going for a Mexican theme. Soft latin music that sounded like it may have been Marc Anthony playing in the background. Lots of Day of the Dead kind of artwork. Table cloths and polyester napkins (I hate them and believe me you'll need them when the food gets messy). And a lounge area that reminds me of a comfy hangout in someone's reck room or basement. The chairs aren't that comfortable. But it's clean and welcoming. It's a lot more spacious inside then it would appear on the outside. I've always found the service good. The waitress was a little boisterous but still friendly. The cook often makes an appearance at the bar and they seem to genuinely want to make sure you've enjoyed your food. The prices are okay. Maybe a little pricey, about 12 to 14 bucks for a burger and fries. But the food is good. The fries are fresh cut. There are a few mexican inspired dishes, such as Chili, soft tacos, fajitas. Some gourmet burgers and a really good chicken burger called the Mother Clucker. I've opted for the spicy Mother Clucker on 2 visits.  A fresh chicken breast, seasoned and breaded, mayo and a spicy sauce. It was a little salty on my last visit and the fries a little soggy but overall I enjoyed it. It was super filling. I love a fresh cut fry and I like that this is real white meat chicken. I've also had the chili on a separate occasion. It was good, but not as good as mine ;) However, it was a great lunch deal at 6.95 for a bowl along with some garlic bread. My friend opted for the quesidilla with refried beans and rice. She enjoyed hers too. It looked pretty good to me. My other friend opted for a spicy mother clucker, cluckerized. It came with cheese and bacon. he liked it but it wasn't enough kick for him. So he added a variety of hot sauces that were all on the table.It wasn't that busy for a Friday afternoon, but it was a long weekend. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and vowed to return again with more of our colleagues.
<review# 616,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/26/2012,1/15/2013,9,33,4,8,5>My fiancé was out at a work party so I decided to treat myself to dinner out. It was a cold, rainy, windy night in December so what better to warm me up than Thai food?I placed my order by phone prior to leaving work in Downtown Dartmouth. By the time I made it through rush hour traffic to Burnside my food was sitting waiting for me. I took it home (about another 12 minute drive) and it was still piping hot when I opened all the containers. For myself I ordered the fresh spring rolls, ginger beef, massaman chicken curry and jasmine rice. I was not disappointed. Everything was hot, fresh, spiced perfectly, and delicious.So much so that when I was heating up my leftovers the next night I called and placed another order for my fiancé to pick up on his way home :) everything was just as good that night too!It's nice that Dartmouth has finally started to get some quality restauatants.
<review# 617,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/12/2012,1/14/2013,14,61,,4,2>This is becoming our go-to for sushi takeout. When you call in an order, they have your previous order on file and read it back to you in case you want to order the same thing again and don't have a menu handy, which is helpful! The Bananacado roll may sound like a weird combination but it rocks my world. Other favourites include the sweet potato maki, spicy Alaska roll, and "Da Deal." I've never eaten at the restaurant, only placed orders for pickup, but look forward to enjoying a meal there soon.
<review# 618,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/13/2012,1/13/2013,48,65,2,8,4>I was absolutely blown away. It's a little insane, really. The place is gorgeous inside, the staff are all fantastic, and the food is... Well, life-changing.The best falafel I've had in Halifax, easily. It's made with real chickpeas (not that powdered stuff), and it shows. Their hummus is spectacular, too.The food is that oh-so-oily deliciousness that you crave. The perfect lunch or supper spot downtown. Get there!Oh, and so much of the menu is really cheap! So that's a massive plus.
<review# 619,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/27/2012,1/12/2013,42,100,2,5,3>I can't believe I haven't written a review for here yet.I'm a relatively new regular for Strange Adventures because I'm pretty new to the world of comic books. Well, somewhat. Like most people, I read Archie comics when I was younger and the occasional Ninja Turtles comic if I saw one in stores. However, because I grew up away from lively civilization, I didn't have regular access to comics so therefore it was pointless to get into something if I wasn't able to see it through in the continuum it was meant for. It was also before the internet so it's not like I could read them online either.Fast forward fifteen years and I see my favourite cartoon growing up has been undergoing a renewal phase recently. The Ninja Turtles have launched a new comic series in addition to being bought by Nickelodeon who have also launched a new cartoon series (I have yet to see this...someday!). There have been a LOT of TMNT-related things out in the last year or so that have made their way to Strange Adventures. So every few weeks, I wander in to see what's new.Last week, I went in to spy for the new issue of the comic book. I got the date wrong. It won't be in until next week. What I *DID* find, however, was a new issue of a TMNT classic series that I have also been collecting concurrently and ALSO a new larger side-series TMNT graphic novel that very much excited me!I'm not only a one-comic guy though. I'm a big Tin-Tin fan. There's a large stuffed Snowy in the window that's been there all year that whines at me every time I walk by. Someday, Snowy. I will adopt you.The staff here are helpful and know their stuff about everything and everything. And in addition to the comics, they have fun figures, toys, t-shirts and other things as well so if you're not a comic book fan, it's still worth coming in to scope the place out.PS: If there's ever any Toad-related things in here (from Super Mario), do tell me because I collect ALL of the Toads!
<review# 620,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2012,1/11/2013,27,83,,3,6>After a long day walking around the waterfront and visiting George's Island during the Tall Ship event, we decided to go to Choco Cafe for a bit or two. We ordered Americano coffee for drink and had the croissant and olive and chilli wrap for a bite. It was good and beyond our expectation. Besides that, the cafe felt cosy and the staff were friendly indeed. We liked the idea that students enjoy 15% discount too - which would definitely go well with us. This is definitely a place we'll come back to visit from time to time, whenever we are near Bishop's Landing.
<review# 621,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2012,1/10/2013,23,14,3,5,3>I'll be honest, we still feel like Halifax tourists. We moved here from Saskatchewan 4 months ago and are still figuring out how to cross the street! Not to mention going to every restaurant ever recommended to us. This one was high on the list - and the name was easy to remember! We stopped by on Canada Day right at noon expecting it to be packed - hallelujah it wasn't! And a spot on the patio to boot! The staff was super friendly - we got our very own Canada flag from them :) Happiness.Michael had a delicious pulled pork sandwich (sans coleslaw, he's super picky haha) with roasted potatoes: which were delicious and perfect. I had the seafood bowl, which was full of mussels, huge fresh chunks of haddock and super tasty scallops in a very light and refreshing white wine cream sauce. Delicious on a hot day! I couldn't think of a better spot to spend our afternoon on a crazy hot day.I should note that my mother-in-law can't stop raving about the lobster mac & cheese and the lobster bruschetta from their visit here a few weeks ago, so it goes without saying that there is something (non-fried) on the menu for everyone, and if you're a tourist (or feel like one!) treat yourself to a Foggy Goggle visit!
<review# 622,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/31/2012,1/9/2013,55,223,,7,3>This place is a hidden gem in Halifax, located off Dresden Row, you have to go inside a side door and up the stairs, well worth the exploring.We went with a large group of friends, about 12 of us at one big table.  Our server (maybe the owner?) offered us the "family style" dining option.  We said sure, since this is the traditional way of eating in India, and was pleasantly surprised with the dishes.  It was a food train, plate after plate of delicious food.  They even checked with our spice preference and veggie diets.  Split between the 12 of us our bill came to $20 each.  Great deal considering all the dishes we got to try.The only thing not getting the 5 star was the service.  We had to practically drag a server over to get our drink orders, and they never checked back to see if we wanted more.  With our table, they could have made a lot more $ on drinks for sure, we where there to celebrate!Also, the spiced tea... don't bother.  It's not authentic Indian chai by any stretch of the imagination (they use a red rose tea bag).  A shame since India produces some of the best black teas and chai in the world.
<review# 623,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/17/2012,1/8/2013,30,26,6,8,3>RCHMND is the menswear store I wanted to bring to Halifax. Kristi, Peter and Craig just beat me to it. Full of modern, expertly constructed clothing, accessories and other items of use, their product selection is perfectly reflected in their store environment. A selection of brands like Gitman Bros. Vintage, SNS Herning, Filson and Yoshida & Co's Porter all carry their own heritage that rivals the old NSCAD block the store is found in. Contemporaries such as Our Legacy, United Dry Goods, Isaora, APC, Baldwin Denim, Saturdays NYC and Norse Projects match these storied brands with their own conscious use of fabrics and attention to detail. This thoughtfulness is what sets RCHMND apart from other menswear stores in Halifax. Everything is where and what it should be. Personally, owning some pieces from Our Legacy, Gitman Bros. Vintage and SNS Herning, I can attest to their construction and worth in investment. The products RCHMND carries are built to last. Thus, the price reflects this. You are buying brand name, but you're also buying the antithesis of H&M and fast-fashion. Those companies do have a place in your wardrobe (they do in mine) but when you buy a piece from RCHMND you are buying those details that are more often made by someone paid well for their efforts (check the tags and you'll see made in USA, Japan, or Italy present on a number of pieces). That isn't to say the products won't inspire you. Star prints, camo jeans, bright coloured toques all carry a sense of whimsy that make RCHMND so much more than a high quality GAP. Each piece tells a story, some more timeless than others.That story, presented in an unstuffy, unpretentious tone, is why RCHMND is a must visit for you or the guy in your life. Your/their closet will thank you, even if your wallet might be a little upset.
<review# 624,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2012,1/7/2013,37,121,,4,3>What a great little spot this is for Fish and chips. We stopped here on our way to the Silva to grab a pre-cruise snack and I was amazed at how delicious the fish and chips was...As a local, one is sometime skeptical of water front places but this one really blew me away. The fish had a nice light and crispy batter, the fries were done to perfection and they offered a great choice of sides as opposed to just the traditional tartare sauce. I had a try of the wasabi mayo and it really lit up my fish and chips!I'll definitely be stopping by again the next time I'm on the waterfront!
<review# 625,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2012,1/6/2013,25,117,4,9,6>I pass by The Garden of Eat'n almost every day when I drive my husband to work. I've noticed it change from a vet's office to Bermudan place to a cafe-like place and now to The Garden of Eat'n. I jumped on their Yelp profile first, but found no reviews. So I headed to their website, followed them on Twitter and then decided it might be something worth checking out.The idea of Persian, Acadian and Canadian food in one spot intrigued me. I've never had Persian food and I wanted to see what it was like. So I grabbed Liane K. and we headed out for our first Yelp Review meal. I have to tell you - I was NOT disappointed! Let's start with the restaurant itself: Small, but not tiny. They've probably got 20 tables inside and 8-10 booths outside (in the ally. Which is SO neat). We opted for inside and sat ourselves at a quiet table in the middle of the place. There were 2 or 3 other tables when we arrived. It's a little dark inside but there's some really interesting decor. And the place smells FANTASTIC. The smell of Persian and Acadian food was wafting through the place...I can't believe people weren't running in off the streets!!Our server was quick, helpful and friendly. She gave us some great suggestions and even helped us pronounce menu items properly. Liane and I shared  the dip quartet (which has hummus, roasted red pepper, olive tepenade, tzatziki and a something that was kind of like relish...?) and it was delicious! Just the right amount to get us started and good taste test. For our mains: I ordered the Baghali Polo and Liane had some other Polo which came with chicken in a pomegranate sauce (more on that in a minute). The chef actually brought our food to the table and made sure to check with us several times throughout the meal. Which was a great touch!Now, on to the actual food: The Baghali Polo which is Persian white rice with lima beans and a lamb shank, was FABULOUS. The rice was delicious, especially when I added the perfectly cooked lamb. Liane's polo, which from here on will be referred to as the pomegranate polo, was even better! It was a delicious plate of rice and pitas with a huge plate of chicken, covered in an almost-gravy like pomegranate sauce. I ended up stealing at least half of Liane's sauce to add to my meal - FAN-EFFING-TASTIC!At the end of our meal we chatted with our sever, and again with the chef. They were so kind, and really very interested in what their customers thought about the meal and their restaurant. It was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to go back with more friends to try more of that delicious Persian food. Well done, Garden of Eat'n!!!
<review# 626,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/20/2012,1/5/2013,29,166,,12,3>Well I am reluctant to jump into a review of a restaurant on one of the busiest lunches of the year - a couple of days pre-Christmas. But, being a dedicated Yelper, it is an experience that I need to report on.Having visited the previous establishment several times, it was remarkably familiar. Same clunky elevator ride, same beautiful vista welcoming one onto the floor and the same eating habitat with various views, chairs, rooms and feels. There is new paint and a bare tree in the big room, but it still has a nice feel to anyone who has enjoyed it before. Maybe it is a bit more relaxed than that old establishment.For anyone who has not been in the space - it is fantastic. A view of the harbour sighed through the bridge of the ferries. There is the big central room, the somewhat distant group room and the long and skinny room surrounding the bar. Lots of variety for any size group. All have access to the view!The staff were most helpful in the just-before-noon rush for tables. They allowed us to move tables in search of a somewhat quiet table. They turned down the CCR music. They  double teamed well to get all and everything we needed to our table.The orders were taken quickly and the food arrived in a timely fashion - almost too timely. The baked haddock was lovely to look at with the light batter. It flaked nicely to the touch of the fork, but it didn't eject that telltale cloud of steam when it broke open. Similarly the roasties looked great - but never threatened any heat sensors when eaten. Both fish and roasties would have carried more flavour if they were hotter. Oh and the cold slaw was reduced to a couple of pieces of leaves and the tartar sauce had what I think was the round remnants of a radish hidden in the middle- so the veggies were definitely challenged. The tartar sauce was tasty and enough for dipping the fish.So, having enjoyed the Wooden Monkey on the other side, loving the view here, appreciating the challenging timing, I will most most definitely be back. The staff are great, the food very local with some variety from the average restaurant.But on this day, at this season they let me down by pre-preparing the food in anticipation of the crowd, leaving me somewhat cold.
<review# 627,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/23/2012,1/4/2013,13,71,,7,4>Ahhh.... one of those review where you wish you could give a half star.  This was really a 3.5 for me.  Moving right along...Being originally from Montreal, I grew up with this kind of food... Montreal having such a large Jewish population.  I was very excited at a traditional deli finally opening up in Halifax.Popped in with a fellow ex-pat Montrealer and we figured we would give this place a workout!  First, the atmosphere and decor is all deli.  This would fit right in on the Main in Montreal.  Good start.The service throughout the meal was attentive and prompt.  The menu is a pretty concise choice of deli favorites.  I ordered the matzoh ball soup and the smoked meat sandwich while my friend had the Reuben.  The soup was absolutely fantastic.  The single large matzoh ball was nice and airy as it should be and the broth was beautifully flavourful, with a few thinly sliced carrots.The smoked meat was somewhat disappointing for a native Montrealer, but still the best I've had in Halifax.  They use Lester's smoked meat, which is known back home as a bit of a "mass produced" product but at least Hali Deli brings in the full brisket, steam in and then hand slice it.  They will soon be sourcing their rye bread from Montreal as well, enhancing the authenticity.  The french fries were fantastic, but the coleslaw was virtually inedible, with barely any dressing, and the cabbage tasting like it had just been shredded moments before.  One complaint I have is that the restaurant only accepts cash.  Sure, they have an ATM in the back but seriously in 2012?Minor complaint though.... I will be back for a nice taste of home.
<review# 628,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2012,1/3/2013,8,168,1,6,5>Birch Cove is just a short walk from my house and is really one of the best spots in the city for lake swimming. Due to the world canoe chamionships taking place here a few summers ago, the entire grounds, parking, etc. have been renovated and are top notch.  There is a life guarded area, but I usually opt to plant myself on the grassy area a little farther down where it is a bit quieter. Great swimming that's clean and refreshing on lake Banook.  It doesn't get much better than this.
<review# 629,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2012,1/2/2013,21,55,2,5,4>No reservations and Halifax loves it. Do the math.It's like a bit of New York in Halifax! It feels hectic as there are so many people coming in and out, tables constantly being flipped, food being promptly served.It's exquisite. The staff is very knowledgeable and so quick witted, it's a very fun and refined atmosphere. We went for birthday celebrations and were not disappointed. For a Tuesday it felt like a Saturday-- everyone was so relaxed and engaged eating and sipping wine. We all had starters- I had the Risotto Croquettes. I'm telling you, if God was reborn as a food this is it. The lovely fiancee had the Calamari which had a zing to it and a tomato sauce over top-- but just lightly sprinkled. Probably the best in the city thus far, and the Mama in Law had a salad. I'm unsure which one-- but it came bearing Goat cheese! You can't go wrong with Goat Cheese..Our mains were all amazing, and the kitchen was more than accomodating at switching the types of pasta we wanted and substituting others. We couldn't leave without dessert and we all got a flavour of the Creme Brulee. Vanilla, chocolate and a limited time pumpkin. The pumpkin was SO good and very warm for this time of year. The chocolate was the fav of the wife and in-law though.This place knows what it is doing. The service is so great, the kitchen staff have your food in front of you before you know it, and the overall atmosphere makes you feel like you're on vacation-- even if it's just a 3 course getaway.
<review# 630,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2012,1/1/2013,25,107,,4,3>Being marooned in Bedford often means a pretty disappointing lunch selection. I've driven by Izzy's a couple of time but never really gave it a second look until a co-worker happened in for a bagel and a coffee and had rave reviews.A few of us decided to check it out for lunch and I have to say- it was DELICIOUS!Hand-made bagels and cream cheese, delicious baked goods and friendly staff.It's straight up dangerous that this place is but a short walk from my office...
<review# 631,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2012,12/31/2012,20,178,,6,4>Something new just opened yesterday in the neighborhood, the space is freshly renovated with a take-away shop in the front and a kitchen in the back. Right now the fridges are full of sandwiches, salads, entrées and desserts. The clerk was friendly, explaining the choices and told me they will soon be serving ten flavors of cupcakes each day! I picked-up a couple of chocolate cookies for $1.99 each and they're buttery good.
<review# 632,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/12/2012,12/30/2012,39,130,3,7,4>The original "Le Bistro" was home to one of my first memorable non-McDonalds dining experiences as a child. I have always had a soft spot for the place and was a bit worried when I read some not-so-hot reviews when it was recently rebooted. Well, I finally made my way there a few nights ago, and my worries were put to rest because my meal was delicious and the service was great.They started us with a freshly baked bread loaf (can't go wrong with bread and butter). We then had the seafood minestrone (which came with big chunks of fish and scallops and shrimp) and the beef bourgignon which was a serious stick-to-your-ribs perfect meal for a cold night. My one gripe is that the toasted cheese/garlic bread that came with my soup was a bit burnt,  but it got eaten, so it couldn't have been that bad.
<review# 633,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/10/2012,12/29/2012,29,249,,9,2>I stopped into Layers for the first time today. The shop, while small is bright and airy. The first thing you notice are the cupcakes, all beautifully decorated. The had a few different flavors available and I selected the chocolate with vanilla bean frosting. The cupcake was packaged in a cute little Tiffany blue style box that kept my cupcake stable until I got home. The cupcake itself was delicious, super moist and chocolaty.I really loved the frosting, it was creamy, not too sweet and the vanilla flavour really came through. I also liked the frosting to cupcake ratio The cupcake is pretty affordable at 3.25 a pop. The store also has a chilled and frozen foods section. They have a nice selection of entrees for two people and party sized apps as well. I picked up a bottle of champagne vinaigrette, I can't wait to try it, and enjoy that it only has natural ingredients in it. My parents throw an annual Christmas party and this year I plan them some risotto croquettes from Kitchen Door Catering to serve, they looked delicious!
<review# 634,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2012,12/28/2012,51,65,2,5,3>You know, when I was a bit younger, I didn't quite understand why the Halifax airport won so many accolades. But having traveled more and seen more airports, I totally get it now. This airport doesn't have the giant selection of shops and restaurants that larger mall-esque airports boast, but you know what it has that most travellers actually value more than extensive shopping? Free WiFi. It's a godsend and it spoils me. I'm constantly surprised by how much it costs to access the internet is larger airports. (I'm looking at you, Boston's Logan Airport.)As mentioned, the restaurant selection is small, but solid. You've got some typical fast food (Burger King, Tim Horton's, Starbucks), a Halifax staple (The Chickenburger) and some decent post-security options. Checking in to flights is pretty painless. The automatic check-in booths definitely help the process and the staff at each airline counter have always been helpful and efficient. The security process is pretty similar. Both are, of course, subject to increased wait times during popular vacation periods, but they do the best job possible of keeping things moving. All in all, I think it's a great way to start a trip, a great way to come home and a great way to introduce newbies to the city.
<review# 635,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2012,12/27/2012,54,227,2,6,4>I've made two visits to Tempo now, and can happily say that I'll absolutely be back.Last week, three friends and I hit up one of Tempo's launch parties to have a few drinks and check out the scene. And I've got to say, I was really impressed. The drinks: Amazing. They're classic and not sugary, without being too strong. The food: Their tapas were fantastic, especially the tempura veggies and the artichokes. The location and decor: I love this spot. It's close to my office and giant windows give you a great opportunity for people-watching. The decor is trendy and relaxed. The service: We stuck around after the party to order some food, and the service was slow. Very slow. But you know what? It was also stellar, because a staff member (not our waiter, perhaps a supervisor?) checked on us multiple times, apologized for the delays, and in the end comped part of the bill to make up for the long wait. I was ready to cut them some slack, seeing as the party had probably slammed the kitchen earlier in the night and they were likely still working some kinks out. So the compensation wasn't expected, but very much appreciated.I returned for lunch with a coworker, and had another great experience. My club sandwich was different and very tasty (though it's a lot of bread, so next time I'll have it with salad rather than fries) and the chef whipped up a delicious-looking meal for my vegan colleague. The service was fast and friendly, and our table by the window in the sun made for a lovely lunch outside the office. The dinner menu sounds great and I'm hearing good things about brunch, so I will be back in no time.
<review# 636,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/2/2012,12/26/2012,10,15,,5,3>I spent a long time since my last trip to Montreal looking for a way to get my hands on a pair or two of Naked and Famous denim - I reached out the N&F and they directed me to Tony at HIM in Halifax. I reached out to Tony on twitter (@HimBoutique) to confirm stock of color, style and fabric, he got back to me right away, let me know he had what I was after. My wife and I went in a few days later, scouted the stock and found the denim i was after. Walked out with the jeans i wanted and a sweet new wallet. Not only did i get what i wanted, but Tony made a few suggestions and remembered our conversation from twitter. it was great personal service and i love pointing people in the direction of HIM. there are not that many places in Halifax to grab menswear that isn't a chain store or overpriced (in comparison to MTL)
<review# 637,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/15/2012,12/25/2012,12,118,3,3,3>I finally ventured into this legend of a restaurant in Dartmouth. Now I might have been here once when I was younger but not in atleast 10 years. I chose this spot to have my birthday dinner, and boy was it delicious.When we arrived (4 of us), it was about 6pm on a Saturday so it was mid-rush. We waited maybe ten minutes and grabbed a table in a corner. Our server was very fast and our drinks arrived quickly. I was so torn on what to get that I decided to go all out and get the $32 surf and turf deal (don't worry, I did not eat everything by myself). We also ordered the munchie basket to share. When the appetizer came, we were shocked at the portions, an app like that would cost much more than $20 anywhere else! It was great! I also was served fish chowder from my meal and it was delicious, however I  gave that to my boyfriend as it was too rich for me. When my plate arrived, I was slightly embarrased by its size but also excited to dig in. On the plate was: 1 lb lobster, 6 oz medium rare steak, 5 scallops, a skewer of shrimp, clams, mashed potatoes, rice, and a side of ceaser. Steak was cooked to perfection and delicious, as was the lobster (and it comes cracked! bonus!), the scallops, shrimp, and clams were also quite good. The salad was nothing really special but the bite I had was fine. Only complaint is the mashed potatoes seemed quite bland/fake like (although I am sure they were not). Of course I took a lot home for leftovers, and NO I had no room for dessert. The other diners at my table also enjoyed their meals. I cannot wait to come back here and try something else! I belive that they would benefit greatly from having a hostess or two, but I understand that because of the many entry ways, this would be difficult; it would prevent the clutter of people in the entrances and the awkwardness of standing in front of and almost touching the other diners that are at their tables. It does have the old pub feel and could use some updating here and there but the old chairs remind me of my grandmothers kitchen chairs (which is a nice touch), and the atmosphere is what brings a lot of people back.Overall, GO!! Go now!! and make sure you are hungry when you come here!!
<review# 638,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2012,12/24/2012,66,321,11,8,7>Full disclosure: I like candy. I like candy a lot. So, knowing that bias, you can appreciate how insanely excited I was when I found out a candy boutique opened just a few blocks from my home.I managed to contain myself long enough to make it through the doors and then I really was "a kid in a candy store." There are lots of options now with more coming soon! The store's only been open for a few weeks so they don't have all their inventory. When they do? I dunno, I might go into some sort of feeding frenzy.I may have had a lot of sugar before/during writing this review.So! In I went and met the owner (Stacey) and congratulated on opening her own business. She was super-friendly and so genuinely happy to see customers. She gave me the "grand tour" but, as stated, I may've been a bit distracted by candy-candy-candy. If candy's not your thing (and if that's the case, we can never be friends) there are other things to draw your eye: there's a selection of cool cards that I don't think I've seen anywhere else in the city. There are some party supplies and, given the time of year, some Halloween stuff as well. And back to candy... there's the classic "bag your own candy" station with some sugar-free (if you're into that sort of thing). The selection for packaged candy is broad and delicious. Lots of UK treats we don't often see in Canada; some products I didn't recognize but found intriguing. There is still room for improvement of course: the addition of Rockets, for one thing! Considering she's just opened, Stacey has grand designs I can't wait to see unfold. So, if you're caving candy, shimmy on over to Sugar Shok.
<review# 639,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/28/2012,12/23/2012,28,42,3,2,2>My oh my oh my...Ok... I'll be honest.  I'm not one to go for all the fancy spa treatments and whatnot.  I'm really more of a low maintenance kinda' gal.  However, we do have to treat ourselves every so often and I finally decided it was about time I did the same.Up until today, I'd been going to see Saskia strictly for my eyebrows.  I've had my eyebrows done by several different people/places over the years and I was so happy to have Saskia do them right.  It was during my last eyebrow session that she asked if I'd be interested in a facial.  I'm sure the look on my face told her, "Uh...really?  Why would I want to do that?"  So, after hearing all the benefits of such a treatment, plus the added bonus of actually learning a thing or two for my own personal knowledge, I agreed to come back in a week to venture into uncharted territory.So after going over a few of the ground rules (remove sweater, glasses, necklace, earrings - thankfully we stopped there), I laid down in the soft lit room with the light classical music massaging my eardrums.  With my eyes closed the majority of the time, my face was treated to a wonderful variety of creams of varying scents and textures.  I must admit, this was a very foreign sensation that I will just have to get accustomed to.   You see, I'm actually quite ticklish. Although it may have seemed like I was very tense, I was quite the contrary.  It's just difficult to just let yourself go when you really want to burst out laughing!The end result was in a word - stunning!  I was quite shocked to see myself in the mirror looking so fabulous without any makeup on.  Yeah, this from the girl who doesn't take the garbage out without putting her face on first. (Ok... maybe I'm not THAT low maintenance)Saskia definitely knows her stuff too.  She took the time to give me the scoop on what I was doing wrong and what I needed to do to make it right.  I left feeling invigorated and ready to take on the world...tomorrow...  Until then, I'm just going to stare and smile at myself in the mirror.
<review# 640,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/6/2012,12/22/2012,38,87,3,4,2>This is the best thing to happen to my work place. My entire office is a fan of the $10 buffet. While not technically "all you can eat", it turns out all I can fit on a plate is all I can eat (pro-tip: you can fit more in the take out container). You never know what's going to be on the buffet menu from one day to the other, but I've yet to be disappointed. Didn't love the buffet kibbi, but I can deal - I like their kibbi well enough if I order it on it's own. Like other Tarek's locations, this one is cash only. An ATM is on site, but I prefer to plan ahead and avoid service fees. Staff are great and will answer all your "so, what's that? and that? and how about that?" questions as you pile up your food.
<review# 641,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2012,12/21/2012,21,105,,6,3>We've been taking our dog, Adobe to obedience classes at Jollytails and we've been quite happy thus far. Our 1yr old Doberman/Lab, Adobe has been catching on pretty quickly, and we have been learning how to properly work with him for best behaviour. The facility has an indoor and outdoor area as they also run a daycare. I work across the street and can rarely hear dogs barking. The staff are all very nice and you can tell they are honestly caring about animals and  against cruelty or use of punishment to train. They seem to understand dog behaviour and how to encourage the best atmosphere for all the dogs. We plan to take Adobe to their daycare services over the winter months.
<review# 642,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/29/2012,12/20/2012,28,259,,6,3>A season ticket holder for the Halifax Mooseheads, and a volunteer for numerous week long events at the Metro Centre over the years including Briers, World Hockey Championships, Curling Championships... I have seen it all, good and bad at the main arena in Halifax.The experience starts with the atrocious parking available to arena-goers. Your main option being a Scotia Square parking lot that can be easily filled during the day and have some less than desirable folk within in at night. If you are one of the lucky few that finds parking within reasonable walking distance.. count yourself lucky!But onto the show.. the arena by today's standards is pretty low quality overall. The staff is pretty helpful/accommodating in most situations, and at least attempt to do their job in a happy manner.The food is arena food. The traditional staples.. popcorn, pizza, hot dogs, fries and cupcakes... ( ok, one of those things is not like the others... I admit... ) you must overpay for, but as is the case in any and all arenas do in any city big and small across this great country of ours.The building facilities are dated, bathrooms with low overhang ceilings, seats scrunched together for optimal ticket sales, sky boxes (added for the 2000 Memorial Cup the building hosted) that obstruct views of most, if not all of the upper bowl attendees.. the list goes on. But in a city where junior hockey and 'semi-semi-pro' basketball is the only two consistent tenants of your arena... you learn to live with what you have.All in all, when you go to the Metro Centre, you don't go because you are interested in an exhilarating building of spectacular architecture, or what have you. You are there for the event, and the building does an average job of housing those.

The staff are always friendly and helpful and the baked goods (fresh made daily!) look delicious. (Although I've never tried them). Today's temptations included a seedy oatcake, flour less peanut butter cookies and fudgy brownies among other treats. When I make back to Steve O Reno's I'll give them a try and let you know. But in the meantime my recommendation is this: If SOR is on your path to caffeine by all means make it your regular joe. You won't regret it.

The veggie burger blew me away, it was not bland at all like allot of  veggie burgers, and really if you put beats on anything I am already sold. I am not a big fry person but decided to give them a try and they stayed crispy till I got home to Clayton Park and were nicely seasoned and did not need ketchup.  I am excited to go back after they have been open for a couple of weeks to try a couple of other options, the pork burger sounds awesome. It would also be nice to be able to take my time and eat in and not have to run home with it.
<review# 645,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/6/2012,12/17/2012,6,54,3,4,3>My visit here was part of a surprise birthday extravaganza for my friend. She had no idea what was going on, and when we pulled up, she exclaimed, "OH MY GOD GLOW IN THE DARK MINI GOLF!" 29th birthday is the black light birthday, don'tcha know? There were ten of us, so we split into three groups. The black light artwork on the wall is extremely trippy, and gets moreso as you play through (I won't spoil it, but make sure you look around at all the trippy art.)I don't know how long it'll be before I feel like going back, but it was definitely a great way to kick off a birthday party evening.

Located in the Dartmouth surplus parking lot in Burnside this lovely trailer is loaded up with fabulous homemade soups, chowders made for your sandwiches and salads!  She has the absolute best tea biscuits too! I usually find those drawing me back in, as they come with a soup when  you order it.She's always got lots of selection on the stove, and always a delight to visit for some lunch. Prices are very reasonable, and occasionally she does draws for "free lunch fridays!".If your in the park, and you haven't visited this spot yet--you truly are missing out.
<review# 647,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2012,12/15/2012,5,26,4,5,4>I'm still smiling after eating here. I'll admit too not being an expert of any stripe on Mexican cuisine. So I was curious to try out this new choice of meal. When I initially finished my meal and I started this review I gave it a 4 out of 5 based on a general policy of mine too give 5's unless a track record has born this decision out. But as I was driving back home from Habanero's I was smiling and planning for when I could get there again. I had 3 Taco's for my meal a Pulled Pork on hard corn Tortilla, a Fajita Chicken on soft flour tortilla and my favorite of this tasting a Beef Barbacoa on flour tortilla. All were tasty meats that excited my tastebuds. I had all three topped with the Tomatillo Salsa and Chipole Sour Cream, this was not overly spicy to my palate but perfectly complemented my choice.  As a plus over it's sister store Cheese Curds I wasn't weighed down and left in a meat coma. I was fully sated but comfortable.  As my opening line states my meal here just made me smile, I want to bring people here to share the wonderful Taco's as well as sample their other wares   inclued Burrito's, Burrito Bowls, Flatbread Pizza, Quesadilla's and Chmichanga's. I'm  sure this I will become a regular and hope to attain a Dukedom here quickly.
<review# 648,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/20/2012,12/14/2012,38,43,,3,2>Neptune has inspired me since I was a child. I've been lucky to have parents who believed in the arts, ensuring I went to a lot of shows growing up.  I took part in many classes and groups at Neptune over the years.But seeing shows at Neptune is just lovely. Great plush seats and perfect viewing through out the theatre makes this a great place to be. I've always felt the stage was a bit small- but it goes up and up giving you incredibly depth. The box office is efficient and the prices are fairly reasonable for what you get. I wish they had more drink and snack options for pre-show and intermission. In London they have tiny Ben and Jerry ice creams for the intermission which is way better than a cart filled with Pepsi and chocolate bars. But we come here for theatre- and wonderful theatre is what you get.
<review# 649,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/22/2012,12/13/2012,7,53,2,3,2>This was my first time to this location having been a few times to the Dartmouth Crossing one.  I found the decor similar and my only issue is that the space is limited and as such the tables seem just a bit too close.  There was a couple in particular that seemed to hang on our every word....no matter how low we tried to talk.The food here was as good as their other location.  I found the sushi very good but not the best (hence the rating).  None of my rolls fell apart (always good) and the temperature of the rolls was good (the rice was not cold).  I stuck to basics and my friend was adventurous.  The unagi was very good.  The spicy scallop maki was good but seemed something was not quite right and I'd hate to suggest that it wasn't 100% fresh but that could've been it as my taste buds for raw fresh scallops is pretty good.   The Green Dragon (Fusion) and Firecrackers Dream my friend really liked and I took some pictures which I will post.The service was very good.  The waitress forgot my water near the beginning but once reminded she apologized and as another Reviewer stated she was sincere and even explained she had poured out the ice cubes and put the glass down and then forgotten - all perfectly fine.The bathrooms are another matter.  I do not  know how long the hot water problem has been an issue in the ladies room but for goodness sake get it fixed.  Both hot and cold taps have way too hot water coming out with a sign that I finally noticed on how to get cold water out.  Lastly the TP holder in each stall is so full of dust and dirt that it turned me off from what was a clean bathroom.    Another simple thing to fix and that means a lot to patrons.

This is your regular mom and pops pizza business with a little bit of extra added  care to cutomer service!

<review# 652,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2012,12/9/2012,61,77,4,5,3>I've really only popped my body into the ever so dartmouth loved Celtic Corner like 3 times in my life.Each time, I soak up the overwhelming robust atmosphere. She's definitely a pub! And you definitely can't knock it. I love me a good pub. Each time it's been ridiculously packed and the service never suffers because of it. It has such neat little private rooms tucked away into corners. Some are large enough for 10ish people! Or small enough for a romantic make-out sesh to stumble upon.I've split calamari and nachos with my friend Aimee and they were delish. Mixed drinks or beers, they got a good handle on both. I've got my eye set on the patio this year. Even though I have to shuttle my ass over the water to get there, it's definitely worth the effort.It has a good solid mix of the older and younger crowd. Pretty near Dartmouth's pride and joy.
<review# 653,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2012,12/8/2012,34,91,,3,5>On a whim we dropped by to try this place out. This place is quite literally off the beaten path on a dead-end in Bayers Lake Park. Neither of us knew anything about Indian food so this was an adventure for us gastro-speaking. We told the waitress we were noobs and in need of help. She desribed some the of the combo-plates and disappeared briefly to re-emerge with samples of their 3 favorite dishes for us to try. After that my decision was set on the beef vindaloo, very spicy and delicious. I will be back. I also found out they have a lunch buffet on Saturday and a Sunday brunch
<review# 654,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2012,12/7/2012,38,94,3,3,3>This is based totally on the back door experience. I have no idea what the front looks like.My first visit to the backdoor was during opencity, where the 6$ banh mi was being served. We were the first ones in line and was just blown away by this spicy sandwich. Since then the 10$ pad thai has been made available for the last 2 months and  judging from twitterverse there seems to be a regular stream of people getting it daily.So I finally made it again to the back door on a rainy day. You never know what to do....Do you knock the door? should you help move the recycle bins? If the door is open, do you stick your head in? Do you really need to wash the dishes while waiting?What you do get is a chance to stick your head in the kitchen and see the meals being prepared and hard working staff creating these fine meals.The pad thai in hand (it was steaming hot) I brought it back to the office and opened it up. Oh man, really good stuff. This might be the best priced/quality/quantity/fresh pad thai in the city.Maybe I'll have a sit down meal, but for now...the back door 5 min wait to get the meal ready - no fuss - pad thai is my thing. Even waiting in the rain :)
<review# 655,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2012,12/6/2012,18,38,3,5,3>I hate that when someone says the word "Sushi" and I immediately start to drool.And that's what happened on Sunday while I was at work, it was a little embarrasing. So I dragged my friend down to Wasabi House for dinner. Man, it was packed! That's great! It took a few minutes for them to seat us, but we waited patiently.I ordered the Ruby Sushi combo that came with Miso Soup and Salad. Normally, I avoid all sorts of fish and stick with veggies, but I wanted to try something new this time. Also, they have Tamago (Or egg sushi which is my absolute favourite), so I ordered the 3pcs nigiri of it. But it turns out that they ran out of Tamago, which is not the end of the world for me, so I actually got to try the Red Snapper Nigiri for the first time. Yum!I pretty much think that I over-indulge with Sushi and I never learn my lesson! I always eat too much and always regret eating lots of it... and I do it ever single time. My friend had a great time and loved the food. So we will be back!
<review# 656,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2012,12/5/2012,15,59,,8,5>Now I know I've written a review of Darrell's before and it is well known that this eatery is my absolute favorite in Halifax. I just wanted to give some thoughts on the other half of Darrell's that is review-less. I'm talking about their equally delicious catering. I spent quite a bit of time calling and researching caterers for our wedding. We were torn between quality and price. Everywhere that offered more than wonder bread sandwiches was a good $8-12 per person. An outrageous price for sandwiches! Thankfully we remembered Darrell's, which has an excellent catering menu. Darrell's price was less than half price of every other option, and I called over twenty other caterers. The catering consists of all your favorite wraps, desserts, salads, sides, drinks, and even cutlery if you so desire. We ordered a couple of every kind of wrap. The price was the best in the city especially considering the high quality and freshness of the food. We had a number of older guests at our wedding, vegans, and lactose intolerants. No other catering offered wraps or sandwiches that allowed us to happily feed everyone. Even the skeptical became converts. Four guests even visited Darrell's for a late supper after our party. The wraps arrived on time, fresh, and extremely delicious. At the end of the evening even though we ordered almost double for the number of people there were only a few left, which we quickly devoured while opening presents. At another catered event I also tried the cookies and squares Darrell's offers and they are delicious as well. Although definitely not a traditional wedding option, I am so pleased we decided to have Darrell's cater.
<review# 657,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2012,12/4/2012,7,14,8,9,7>I'm going to be honest here, fellow Yelpers: the barista at Le French Fix is my best friend. So aside from the fact that she's utterly fab and totally awesome, I'll try to make this as unbiased a review as possible.Oh my goodness gracious. Let's start with the coffee. It's custom-roasted for this little cafe and is super flavourful. I mean, suuuper. You can actually taste hints of fruit or nuts or chocolate or whatever it is you're supposed to taste in really good coffee. The espresso is velvet-smooth and packs a punch. (The barista's smokin' hot too, and really knows a lot about coffee - that's not just my opinion, she actually does - and she pours a delicious latte.) ...Ok, not so unbiased. Sorry.The macarons are nom-tastic. The almond one is my absolute favourite, but I'm pretty sure Geoffroy (le chef) could make sandpaper taste like buttery, French heaven. If you try nothing else when at Le French Fix, please, for your own sanity and well-being, try a mille-feuille. You can le thank me later.
<review# 658,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2012,12/2/2012,9,18,4,5,4>I have become a massive fan of Untitled Eats over the past year, which is incredibly dangerous as I work at the Art Gallery.I had been a huge fan of the Armview for many years and when I heard the owners of the Armview were going to be opening the new restaurant I was extremely excited, and certainly not disappointed. Their menu is seasonal, and features a different (always delicious) Farmers Market soup daily, which is where most of my money goes. They also always have a selection of ready made sandwiches for those of us on the move. They also have a cocktail night on Wednesday evenings, Thursday nights there are $5 tapas plates, $5 Wine and $5 martinis (and they certainly give the Fireside a run for their money), and they have started an after work drinks and DJ night on Fridays, all of which are fantastic for a night out with your friends, or the beginnings of a night out. I have tried many of the tapas plates on Thursdays, and have often ordered seconds they are that good. It is great get a couple friends together to order one of everything and share so you get to try it all. The tapas plates change every week so you constantly get to try new dishes.One of my favorite meals though is the Eggs Benny they serve for brunch on Saturdays. There is just something about their hollandaise sauce that I cant put my finger on, but it really makes it pop. It's true, my friends will all tell you I am an eggs benny addict, but Untitled has some of my favorite, and I am very fortunate they don't serve them during the work week or I would be completely broke.On top of all this they cater and mmmm it's delish!All in all I LOVE Untitled Eats and they are definitely worth the visit, especially for wine and tapas on Thursday nights!

<review# 660,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/1/2012,11/30/2012,24,132,2,5,3>As far as golfing goes in HRM, this is the best bang for the buck.It is a 18 hole par 60, so It's a short course, with only a handful of holes where you can dig out the big dog.But at less then $40 a round during the high season, that is unbeatable for a course this nice.Pin high offers the same price for 9 holes and I wouldn't waste my time there.The staff are very friendly, know us regulars by name.  A rough round will still only take around 3 -3.5 hours to play.I love the views, the woods, the pleasurable walk.Whether you are new to golf, an old pro, of someone like me who loves to play a game of whack-f*#k , this course is topnotch.I will be back to play here, regularly.
<review# 661,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2012,11/29/2012,9,53,4,5,4>Have just recovered from a night at the Lower Deck.  Whenever we have visitors and want them to experience Halifax hospitality, this is where we go.  Beginning with a ride on the Dartmouth ferry, we arrived to find the Lower Deck Patio Party in full swing - what a surprise!  If you see this advertised, don't miss  it!  Bands outside AND inside, and a DJ upstairs,you can troll back and forth and follow the music.  We ate upstairs and are never disappointed in the pan-fried haddock (a simple dish but ruined by many restaurants.)  My chowder was chock full of seafood (haven't we all ordered chowder and struggle to find a piece of seafood in it?)We ate, danced and sang all night.  The Lower Deck really knows how to create a great atmosphere.
<review# 662,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/14/2012,11/28/2012,24,41,2,5,3>Every November I look forward to admining a 2 day professional exam at the DAL SUB building. I don't look forward to it because I get to see hard work paying off in a 4 part intensive exam. I don't look forward to it because I get to return to a University for a short time again. I definitely don't look forward to it because of the parking fiasco all around Dalhousie. I look forward to it, because it means I'll be visiting the DawgFather. There are a few hot dog vendors all around Halifax that are used to a regular clientele, but none are quite like the DawgFather, and I mean that as a compliment to him.Food: 5/5It's a hotdog cart, so you know what you're getting. Delicious phat boy hot dogs, huge bunned sausages, and some flat but tasty burgers. He grills them right there and buys them fresh (or seemingly fresh anyway). He also puts out a full table of condiments so you can pick and choose to your heart's desire. Try out something new with a spicy flavour, or stick to the original green/yellow/red stuff. It's all delicious.Atmosphere: 3/5No places to sit, often a long line to wait through, and depending on the time of yar or weather that day, you can end up freezing or getting soaked. BUT, what should you expect? It's an outdoor hot dog cart, so you should know that's a possibility. Customer Service: 5/5Friendly, talkative, and caring. If you're hard up for a bite, and he knows you're a regular, he'll let you hit him back tomorrow. He trusts the students (who are probably 95% of his customer base) and knows they will be there every day for him. Nice guy, always smiling, always laughing. Hard to beat that!Price: 5/5Great prices all around for what you're getting. $4 for a sausage, $3 something for a hotdog, and $2 something for a burger. $1 for a pop, and the same for some chips or a choc bar. All in all, if you need a quick fix of meat cooked on the street (though not street-meat) then the DawgFather has what you need!
<review# 663,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2012,11/27/2012,22,150,3,5,6>So yesterday I'm thinking I'm feeling like some fish & chips.  Usually I make them myself but really didn't feel like dirtying all those dishes. Having recently seen some Yelping about this place and as I drive by it pretty well every day, I decided to give it a try.Mother of Nemo, why have I been passing this place by?!  There were so many tempting options on the menu but I stuck with my original craving and ordered up the 3 piece fish & chips (that would include enough leftovers for lunch today).  I added a side of the creamy coleslaw.  Total was $15.99.While waiting for my order I checked the place out.  Loving the retro theme, lots to take in while waiting for food. The place could use a little polishing up, some areas are looking a little worn but clean. The menu reads that everything is made in house, including the colesalw, gravy and tar tar sauce, they only use haddock and the fries are hand cut.So my order is ready, and I head home.  As soon as I get in the car I'm regretting my decision to take out.  The beautiful smells wafting from the greasy brown paper bag have me salivating before I'm out of the parking lot.  During the 6.5 minute drive home I have to keep my speed in check as I am anxious to dig in.Now I'm not a big fan of take-out because I find things, especially fried things,  do get a bit soggy and cooled off.  Generally I'll crisp food back up in the oven but I couldn't even wait the few minutes to do that. As soon as I was in the door I was plating my dinner and diving in.Three nice sized, flakey pieces of what looked like haddock loin in a light crispy batter.  The fries still had some crisp left in them and were very tasty.  Loved the creamy coleslaw and the tartar was alright too.I was tempted to chow down the whole thing but today at lunch I was glad I hadn't, got to experiences that goodness all over again.  Yeah, I'm a fan.
<review# 664,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2012,11/26/2012,11,41,2,5,3>I seem to be giving out a lot of 5 star ratings lately but honestly, Yelp makes it so easy to pick the most fabulous places to frequent!My girls and I visited here this afternoon for some yummy indulgence, after reading the reviews I knew we were in for a treat. The chef greeted us promptly and began a run down on all the yummy desserts he had to offer - cheesecakes and cupcakes too. He had 9 different cheesecakes in the case (or was it 12?) but either way, picking one was tough! Two of the girls got the strawberry cheesecake with a drizzle of strawberry coulis, and I had the tropical green tea cheesecake. Omg you guys. I know cheesecake and so does this place, they do it WELL! It was mouth watering and we all had a hard time not eating it in one bite! We have already made plans to go back..But let me talk about the service. Seriously, it was awesome, the chef himself told us about the cheesecakes and   Once we picked our choice of food and delish beverage (I had a hot tea, the girls had homemade lemonade) they brought it all to the table and we paid once we were finished eating. They checked in on us and we all took some more home in the most adorable and carefully packed containers!Yeah, I took home two pieces. What of it?This place is a MUST to visit!
<review# 665,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2012,11/25/2012,20,226,3,2,4>I can't swim (I actually hate getting wet but yes I AM CLEAN SWEAR), but I love to be by the ocean.  Crystal Crescent has a lengthy, scenic trail route that meanders along the shoreline and out of sight - someday we will bring a well-stocked back pack and see how far we can go.  The views are amazing, the water a perfect blue-green on a sunny day and (provided it's not too crowded) we enjoyed the peace of being away from traffic and screaming kids.  After running my hands through warm sand at the beginning of the trail, I was happy to admire the beach from a small distance.  We will definitely be returning to hike where no Brooks has hiked before.
<review# 666,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/4/2012,11/23/2012,10,29,2,2,2>I visited this place purely because I wanted something new, Asian and priced reasonably. I got all those things and a great experience. Service was a smidge slow, but the food was delicious - a nice blend of Chinese, Vietnamese and what I believe was Thai options. I tried some veggie options and nearly killed myself with a delicious spicy green curry - but it would have been a good final meal. Average was $20-25 per person with one appetizer, a main, and a drink.
<review# 667,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2012,11/22/2012,70,95,7,6,6>This place is getting the BIG 5 STARS from me.Not because the food is good (it's not the best but it doesn't suck either).Not because the service is outstanding (I've had better).But because I freaking love dive bars and FLNY is about as dive-y as it gets in my book. Seriously. No I'm serious on this one. The second I walked into this place I knew it was going to become one of my favorite places to hang out. You can tell me the food sucks, the beer is warm and the place is a crap hole. I'll come back with a "I love Freeman's" response. There is something close to my heart sitting in a bar with people that look like they've never seen the light of day or are a little "off centered" in their day to day lives. To boot, the musical gigs they've been offering us patrons is pretty much off the hook in my book. I've happened in on a few Sunday afternoons (cause when you run a marathon you're on the look out for a good pizza to scarf down) and each time I've really loved the musical accompaniment to my food.P.S. Love the pizza!
<review# 668,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2012,11/21/2012,71,45,4,7,6>Living in Eastern Passage I *might* be a little biased. Okay, I am - but it is for good reason - it is known for its large portions, great tasting food and the location doesn't get any more "maritime". The two menu items I cannot recommend enough are the fish & chips and the clams & chips. With a 10 ounce piece of haddock (who are we kidding, it is an entire fish in my books!) you will NOT walk away hungry if you can consume this huge piece of fish...and fries. Deep fried in a panko-like coating that resembles crushed Corn Flakes it is delicious and easily shared between two people for a meal. The clams are whole bodied clams cooked to perfection and easily double the order size you receive elsewhere. My husband usually orders the calamari and fries and is always pleased with that dish as well. I am sure they have desert options but I've never been able to entertain them after eating the mammoth seafood servings. The decor is an eclectic mix of modern and sea shanty chic. Tables have black table cloths and the chairs are (p)leather but the walls are wooden shingles with fishing nets, bouys and random ocean themed knick knacks. Service is hit or miss. On busy nights there is a wait for a table and on more than one occasion I've stood waiting for a table and not even been acknowledged by numerous staff passing by. On the worst occasion in the middle of winter we waited 20 minutes before someone said hello. :-(The menu is extensive - almost to a fault. There are simply too many options and can be a bit overwhelming. That being said, I always go with the intention of trying one of the other delicious sounding offerings but stick with the fish or the clams - because they are so darn good!We typically dine with our two young children here and they are always welcomed. Crayons and colouring books are offered to keep them busy and there is also a fish tank at the entrance to keep them amused while we wait for a table. One of the highlights for the children is the clown fish that everyone affectionately refers to as "Nemo".
<review# 669,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2012,11/20/2012,40,5,4,10,3>All About Eyewear should write a book on customer service, and then tour the world. Even after spilling a grande pike place (it was full) all over their beautiful carpet on my first visit there, they were still ridiculously kind to me.You can tell that this is a family owned, independent business - the difference being that they treat their customers with a great deal of care and they pay a lot of attention to detail. You are greeted by name each time you enter the doors, and Fred has an incredible memory bank which allows him to pull all of the eye frame styles you mentioned you were interested in MONTHS ago. I've been very satisfied with both the eye care check-ups and the retail service. When my glasses broke (due to my own carelessness), Fred quickly provided me with a pair that I could use while he fixed my regular frames. A wonderful service to have in HRM, I highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality eye care service and a fantastic, and unique, assortment of eye frames to choose from.
<review# 670,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/7/2012,11/19/2012,40,216,3,6,3>If you haven't figured out my dining MO by now, let me fill in the blanks for you: I'm a fan of comfort food done well and the places that serve it. I appreciate finer dining, but let's face it, a solid mom and pop diner is more accessible and more wallet friendly, and you don't have to worry about putting on any fronts when going there. The Ardmore is through and through one of these places, with their well worn vinyl cushion booths, wonky ceiling fans and light shades that look like they are from someone's grandparent's house, and may very well be. To complete the feel, there are old timey photos on the walls and a condiment caddy with the usual diner-style tall container of sugar and red squeeze bottle of ketchup. Not so typical was the bottle of Roland brand sriracha, which I had never heard of due to the dominance of the green-capped Huy Fong rooster sauce, and suspected it was a cheaper version.Like any popular diner, there's a mix of all sorts of people here, from representatives of Halifax's omnipresent student population, to professorial (yeah, that's a word) looking types and regular Joes and Janes, all enjoying good, inexpensive eats. I like to think that a good diner is like a tiny United Nations, except more gets done. It's a Thursday morning so the restaurant, while mostly full, isn't crazy busy as a weekend day, likely having to do with fewer hungover students. My girlfriend and I are quickly seen to and I head straight for the breakfast menu. It's a full page of breakfast deliciousness that is all served all day, and the prices are quite reasonable. I'm hungry, but not hungry enough for my usual big breakfast type of order so I go for the eggs Benedict with ham, because nothing says 'light breakfast' like an egg yolk and butter sauce. It doesn't take long for our food to arrive, and when I see my plate, I'm relieved that my girlfriend's breakfast comes with toast, as there's no way that the pile of hashbrowns that I got would suffice in delivering that pool of rich, yellow awesome (something I wish people called me) to my mouth. The Hollandaise is a little bit thin, but it's fantastic - rich and smooth from the egg yolks and butter it is mainly comprised of, there's also a slight lemon tang that helps keep it from being completely overwhelming. I even ordered my eggs cooked soft so that there was even more yolk goodness to go around. While it might seem lost in all of the Hollandaise and egg, the ham manages to make itself known, thanks to the sheer volume of it, as there is a few soft folds of it, not just one lonesome slice below the egg, as with eggs Benny as many lesser restaurants. The hashbrowns are A-OK, but I paid little heed to them as I was just using them to sop up the Hollandaise. The Ardmore is a Halifax dining icon and for good reason, with simple but delicious diner food at really good prices (breakfast for two was just over $20 with tax). One caveat though is that they are cash only and there is no ATM inside. Seems a little odd in this day and age, but hey, it obviously isn't stopping the hordes of Ardmore fans.
<review# 671,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2012,11/18/2012,56,312,3,2,4>A lot of "Irish pubs" have that feel of being totally contrived, totally fake, and not at all welcoming. Not so here. The Old Triangle has a comfortable, unpretentious feel with great staff, good food, and pretty decent value. My last visit was with my cousin and her less than a year old son who loves the live music on Monday night. This kid is a true Cape Bretoner, already tapping his feet to fiddle music. Our server had almost a sense of panic about everything, which seemed totally unnecessary but she did a great job of looking after us, including a meal for my little cousin.The meal's got lots of options but doesn't overwhelm. I tend to be wary of anywhere with a massive menu because doing a lot of things implies not doing anything particularly well. Everyone seemed pretty happy with their meals, which is always a plus.As another bonus, we were there the night I came home from a long military deployment, and so they treated me to dessert, an amazing cheesecake I shared with everyone. Totally unexpected and unsolicited, it just came from our server overhearing a bit of our conversation. Definitely appreciated though.
<review# 672,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/22/2012,11/17/2012,27,148,3,7,2>Went here tonight for the first time and was impressed.  It was almost empty (8 p.m. on a Weds night) and the service was great and the food quick. They shouldn't even give you a choice as to the bread and olive oil when you first sit down; it is so good EVERYONE MUST EAT IT.  NOW.  Seriously, fresh bread and a homemade olive oil/sea salt/fresh ground black pepper/lemon/fennel combo?  I could have eaten just that. Had a spanakopita for an appetizer and it was delicious.  I don't like spinach.  I actually kind of loathe it. And I loved this spanakopita so you know they are doing something right!Had the chicken souvlaki with rice, potatoes, greek salad and tzatziki for my entree. It was really yummy and after all the bread/apps I couldn't finish it and brought it home for lunch tomorrow :)Also had the best mojito ever!Side note:  one of the owners has a gluten allergy, so they are aware of those restrictions and have quite a substantial GF menu for those who require it!
<review# 673,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2012,11/16/2012,12,153,3,3,2>Ah The Moustache.  This is one of those places I don't frequent often but when I do I'm never disappointed.  Yes, they're a bar.  However, while I'm sure there are some exceptions, you don't run in to hoards of young'uns there to pound back the brewskies and dance on the table tops.  The Moustache just doesn't function quite that way.  They cater to a larger demographic than just the booze hounds. The service is always great: personable, efficient, friendly...all the things you expect from a server.  And even during their busy times the food always arrives piping hot and without much of a wait.  Clearly they've got a system worked out, and it is certainly working for them.  This place is usually hopping, so to not have to wait an hour to eat is a big bonus.  The nachoes.  I think I'm in love.  A heaping mound of them with the perfect amount of toppings and dippers.   Against my better judgement I ordered the Moustache Burger:  their buger patty, topped with pulled pork, 2 onion rings, banana peppers, pickle and spicy BBQ sauce.  Oh, and a side of sweet potato fries.  SO.

<review# 674,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2012,11/15/2012,33,173,4,10,4>I will preface this review with my explanation about how much I hate dentists.  Ever since I started getting my teeth poked and prodded, I've been That Kid.  You know, the one that often winds up throwing up in the dentist's office from a combination of anxiety and the awful, disgusting fluoride gel.  In my teens, I was also That Patient.  The one with the horrible case of nerves that had to eat several dinosaur-shaped chewable fluoride pills reserved for young children because the fluoride gel plate still makes me gag.  I don't like dentists. But I like Dr. Daniel.His office is very sleek and comforting, with plush seats and a little snack bar with water and healthy snacks to munch on while you wait for your cleaning.  The bathroom is stunning, with a beautiful sink and all the tools you need to freshen up your mouth before your appointment, and a little vanity section with Aveda products to freshen up after the appointment.  The office is a reflection of the professional and detail-oriented staff and service offered by Daniel Daniel Dentistry.I had shared my anxieties to the staff before my first appointment, and they made it their mission to ensure that I was relaxed and at ease with what was going on; it included being personable, explaining what was happening before they did anything so I would know what to expect, and constantly checking in to make sure I was alright.  Dr. Daniel was also great; he explained what he intended to do, how certain things were affecting my dental health, and made sure I was in control of the pace.  He laid out my options for me, and assured me that there was no pressure on what treatment plan I should follow; he gave me the choice to choose what option fit my schedule and budget, and said that he would support me as best he could with every option.He is a high end dentist, and his work is impeccable.  You can also choose to get notifications of your next appointment by text; talk about modern! Because of my anxiety, I was given the option to take anti-anxiety medication for my appointments, which is a nice perk for anyone needing help getting through their own fears and anxieties. I opted not to take it, because I did have to go back to work, but I trusted Dr. Daniel and his work, and it paid off in the end.Because he's a high end dentist, and he prefers to work with longer-lasting (which means costlier) material, you may need to expand your budget. Also, because he is in demand, you will need to pay for your sessions up front, but the staff will process the claims for you to expedite your insurance returns.Also to note is that Dr. Daniel has a severe cat allergy, so you'll be instructed to de-lint prior to your appointment.  Don't worry, though, the glossy bathroom has plenty of sticky lint rolls!
<review# 675,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2012,11/14/2012,65,55,2,5,3>I'm surprised it took me as long as it did to visit Sugah! - I'm a huge ice cream fan and love stores that sell fun candy items. First off, I love the atmosphere in the store. It's open, clean feeling and filled with color and tasty items - a great place to find the perfect gift.I patiently waited in line for 45 minutes during Open City to test out their ice cream for 1/2 price (don't worry visitors, you wouldn't have a wait like that on regular day) and it was definitely worth the wait. After weighing my options, I went for a coffee ice cream base with a cookie dough addition. What I really like about their additions are that you have more to choose from then just candy additions - they have cranberries, nuts, fudge and other ingredients that extend beyond the traditional peanut butter cups and chocolate chips (not that there is anything wrong with either). The service was one of the highlights for me. Even after having served the large line (that didn't stop behind me), they were still super friendly and patient. I got the vibe that they really liked their job and that they were happy to be there.Next time, I'm going for coffee ice cream with chocolate peanut butter fudge...

Our next experience with Crystal was for donairs.  I love a donair, and Crystal's donair meat is something else.  Really tasty, nicely spiced, and they are generous with it.Our latest experience was for pizza.  They got the sauce-to-topping-to-cheese ratio just right.  It was really good.On a final note, the place is CLEAN.  Like, you could probably eat off the floor clean.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but if you are jonesing for a pizza or a donair, give them a try.
<review# 677,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/5/2012,11/11/2012,59,150,5,6,5>I was never a ground beef person, so obviously I have stayed away from burritos... little did I know a burrito didn't have to be ground beef. Anyway...Let me set the tone of this story for you; it's Saturday night, 3:16am, Pizza Corner. My friends and I went our separate ways to feed into our alcohol induced cravings. Sarah had a burrito; like I said, I wasn't one for burritos, but this particular burrito was just screaming 'eat me', so I did - I took a big bite of her delicious burrito! Instantly I wanted to trade in my poutine. I knew I was going to have a new restaurant added to my Pizza Corner rotation.Speed forward a few weekends... it was my turn for a full Burrito Jax experience!The staff are awesome; they know their stuff and they're good at it. You don't even have to know what you're doing - they'll just start asking you question and you'll be building your burrito as you go. The burritos are humungous and can be stuffed with pork, beef, chicken, pepper steak or just veggies. They have lots of sauces (hot sauces, sour cream, "jax" sauce etc) and 4-5 different salsas (including cranberry salsa!), all kinds of veggies, rice and beans! With so many different options you can never get sick of Burrito Jax.
<review# 678,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/25/2012,11/10/2012,18,60,,6,2>I really enjoyed my burrito here. It was tasty, extremely filling, and filled with what I wanted. I also really enjoyed the decor. It's bright and fun. There was (what I think) Mexican music playing, and despite not knowing what was being sung I ended up bobbing my head while eating my burrito. The staff were also very friendly. Only complaint is having to pay 1.50 extra for guacamole. To me, this should be standard in a Mexican place and not an extra.
<review# 679,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/12/2012,11/9/2012,76,115,2,4,2>I walk by the Coburg every day between my bus stop and my office and one day I wondered 'why the heck am I getting my coffee at Tim's when I could pop into this cute little locally-owned business and probably get a much better quality drink?' Well, I thought to myself 'self, that is a great point', stepped in, and was not disappointed. The inside of the Coburg is surprisingly large, with lots of places to sit. There are stacks of newspapers and magazines to read, and even a book exchange that encourages patrons to borrow something pre-loved to read. It's very sunny and has some paintings (for sale) on the walls that give the interior a bright, artistic feel. I pretty much always get a dark roast, which is very enjoyable, but have it in my mind to try one of their daily specials one of these days ($3.20) as they always sound very tasty and creative. Their bagels are also tasty - nice and soft and doughy - and I love their 'build-it-yourself' breakfast sandwich that you can put together with pretty much any bun/bread and toppings you want (they have a list of all the options on a chalkboard by the cash). They are a bit pricey but they are huge and will likely fill you up for hours. Unfortunately I can't speak for their lunch food, such as the paninis et al, but I have heard good things about them. If I had to complain about anything it's that the service can sometimes be slow - I am usually there around 8am, which can be a bit of a rush time of day, and some mornings I wonder if they have more than one staff-person to cover the counter (um, attention coffee shops: you are busy in the mornings. Schedule staff accordingly). Also, I feel the service is a tad inconsistent, dependent entirely on who's working - there are some cashiers/baristas who are super-friendly and know what they are doing (actually most) but a couple that are not necessarily bad servers, but just seem a little stunned (I have been overcharged for my medium dark roast a couple of times by one particular person). However, generally I find the staff is pretty good, and the speed/attitude does depend on the day (again, inconsistent). I can't say I feel the Coburg is anything 'special'. But for the most part I like it! And I plan on continuing to frequent it to try more of their offerings. Besides, working on a University campus with a drought of locally-owned, non-chain places to eat/drink, it's nice to know I can get something fresh and different close to my office.
<review# 680,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2012,11/8/2012,13,213,1,5,3>I had been searching for a bike rack for my spare tire. For anyone who has been in the market for a bike rack will know it involves several phone calls and Google searches to try to find something that works for your vehicle with the wide variety of styles and choices. Rock-ol-o-gy is just what it sounds like. These guys sell racks and that is it. Whatever kind of rack you are looking for they have it. They are owned by the same people who own the trail shop. I called ahead to see what they had and they had exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price.  I asked if they could hold it as they only had one in stock. To my surprise the guy said yes and when I arrived at the store they even installed the rack to my tire and gave me a lesson on how to use it. The store has as you would expect had many racks on display. I did not spend much time looking around as I only needed one rack that can hold a couple bikes and it was put aside for me. Like I said the prices are fair. I had been calling around. However on the phone the rack was 205 and at the cash it was 210? I was not going to call them on 5 bucks but it would not be a full yelp review without looking at the so so points as well. Overall great experience. I would shop here again but let's face it. How often do you need to shop for racks? Chances are I got all the racks I need for some time.
<review# 681,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2012,11/7/2012,17,52,3,12,7>While I was living in Asia all I wanted was Americanized Chinese food (won tons, chicken fried rice, egg rolls - the whole grease filled nine yards) but now that I'm back in North America, I am on a constant search for Authentic Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean and Japanese foods and I have to say I may have found it here. The bf and I went there after hearing from his Mandarin tutor that this was a really great place for Chinese food! Our order consisted of: a spring roll each (YUM!), "Homemade Sichuan styled pickles" (bloody hot - and I can handle my spice, but wow) and Mu Shu Chicken....... only one word can describe the food.... AMAZING!The waitress was the only one on staff (besides the cooks who come out and gave us our food while the waitress was tied up with other tables) but she neglected to give us napkins when which is kinda hard to not have when eating mu shu chicken. Besides that, it was great. The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 is simply because there needs to be one more server on during busy times and also some more promotion - it was only through word of mouth we had heard about it.
<review# 682,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2012,11/6/2012,26,201,,5,3>Tucked in a house, the resto in and among the giftware (some beautiful tea sets)...Formosa's is sure to deliver. Owner is sooooo friendly and very helpful with recommendations. Serving lots of vegan dishes, and huge portions. The dumplings are amazing! And great prices too. Love the way you are served tea with your meal, although I found it was hard to pick the great teas out of the not so great ones from the wall. At the end of your meal you are given clementines and special candy. It is awesome! I could just eat those dumplings alllll day. Definitely worth the trip to D-town.
<review# 683,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2012,11/5/2012,16,102,2,12,7>This is it! This is the place to go and take your time, eat and drink and spend your money! Went for dinner a few weekends ago to celebrate my best gal pal's birthday. We were a group of 12 so we were seated at a banquette and I was super impressed with the atmosphere, and I even enjoyed the 'cozy' feel and the buzz of many voices in a small area. The complimentary bread and red pepper hummus would have been a great meal with a bottle of wine! I love bread, love love love it and the hummus was the freshest tasting dip/spread I have had in ages! I tried a lot of food that evening -  the ribs were some of the best I have ever had. So tender and flavourful, and the server even brought me a finger bowl afterwards and draped the towel over his arm for me to dry my fingertips on. I tried my neighbours calamari and it was pretty damn good too. I had the double bacon wrapped pork tenderloin for my main and the first few bites were great, but I found it was too rich to finish. I sent it down the line and one of my dining companions finished it off. Back to the bread I went.. and wine, don't forget the wine. Skor bar gelator for dessert and I was in heaven. I think I could have stayed there all night but all good things must come to an end. I would honestly give the food 4 stars (scallops were itsy bitsy, potatoes served with main were lukewarm) but the service deserves 6! I wish I could remember my server's name, but it has slipped my mind. He was super attentive, friendly, engaged and he made our experience stellar. I feel like he was hiding behind a curtain just waiting for one of us to look up in need of a refill. Love it! I will definitely go back for a special night out.
<review# 684,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/11/2012,11/4/2012,13,104,3,6,7>Every time I've been here it's been great. This isn't your average 'Chinese' food eatery - unlike the run of the mill restaurants, this place seems pretty authentic. The menus, signs & even the TV channels are all Chinese. They even serve Chinese beer. How great is that?I got the mixed vegetables, chicken fried rice & ginger beef.All were delicious, fresh and cooked just right. The vegetables had grill marks on them and slap you across the face with the garlic-y goodness. The ginger beef is flaky and delicious, the only bad thing about them was that they started to get a bit too sweet near the end.Service was excellent and prompt. Great experience overall!
<review# 685,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/18/2012,11/3/2012,48,65,,2,3>Bearly's never disappoints. It's exactly what you expect: unpretentious and fun. It's not for everyone, and it's not my go-to, but if I want a cold domestic beer, some bluegrass music (who doesn't, from time to time?), and a good time with friends, this is where I go.
<review# 686,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2012,11/2/2012,42,100,4,4,3>If Halifax is capable of maintaining a place like the new Humani-T Café location, I feel like our fair city is finally moving into the big leagues! This place is absolutely beautiful on the inside. During my first visit yesterday, I couldn't help but notice how much attention went into the little things with the decor. Wall paintings, couch cushions, even the layout of the tables and the types of bar stools that line the counter which extends from the front entrance to the back one. They are a few outdoor tables on the South Park side but in the back, they have their own patio with additional outdoor seating.It's simply amazing! If I could come in here and just hang out without looking awkward, I totally would. But of course, I have to buy something so let's get to the menu.They have breakfast and lunch food items. The sandwiches are the same as the ones in the North End Humani-T, which I do very much enjoy. They also have soups as well. For drinks, there is a wide variety of coffee and espresso-based beverages to be made, hot or cold, with or without gilato or sorbet. There are a lot of flavours to choose from as well and of course, you can incorporate them into a bunch of different desserts.While it looks like the type of place where I'd want to go, grab a drink and a snack and stay and read for a while, Humani-T South Park feels more like a dessert bar than a café though, which I wonder could work against it. Unless it's just me. Either way, if I'm there for twenty minutes or two hours, the atmosphere is just amazing! The staff are wonderful! The music is fun! Hopefully wi-fi becomes available.I can totally see Humani-T being my new favourite go-to hang-out spot in the downtown. It's hip, swanky but not too classy for a regular guy like me.
<review# 687,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/15/2012,11/1/2012,23,14,3,9,4>My boyfriend and I were pretty excited for Flipburger to open - not knowing a lot about it, but just from the "burgers & shakes" in the description! We've been to Five Guys (in Regina) plenty of times, and it has that same vibe - except that this place is SUPER clean and trendy. The way to order is pretty much the same - pile your burger with a ton of awesome stuff! Some really unique items too (like peanut butter/sauce) were offered which was awesome.I got a cheeseburger with a bunch of stuff - paid 2 bucks extra for Onion Rings to be on the burger, but I didn't realize until halfway through that they forgot the Rings. Oh well! Next time. The fries were really good - we got the parmesan & truffle oil which I seriously recommend because WOW - tasty! However, for the serving size, it felt a bit overpriced. We each got milkshakes, and although they were tasty, the size also seemed kind of small and  they didn't taste super amazing, just like icecream basically. All in all - we will probably visit again because it is an awesome experience to customize your burger (and the fries are super tasty), although if there was a Five Guys in HRM, we would probably go there instead.
<review# 688,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2012,10/31/2012,17,11,3,10,7>I view my dining experiences like I view movies.  Whilst I am always holding out for a 'Shawshank Redemption' or a 'Godfather Part 2' sometimes, even with that level of quality on offer, I just want to settle in for some 'gets-the-job-done' fare and slide 'Speed' into the DVD player (yes, I still have one of those...).Happy Sushi is 'Speed' in this analogy.  Even though it's not winning any critics choice awards, you simply can't deny it does what it does very well and therefore it's easy to get swept along.The price is right.  Ridiculously so.  $17 (tip is included) for an all-you-can-eat lunch that includes rice, noodles, meat, tempura, rolls, sushi pizza, edamame, miso... pretty much the basic spectrum of sushi offerings?  That's pretty damn good.  And the fact that the sushi is actually not bad at all... well, sign me up for repeat viewings ad-nauseum.  The dinner menu is a little more, but it throws in sashimi for good measure.Yup, I said 'not bad at all'.  It's not amazing (nothing I have ordered has ever blown me away) but similarly I haven't wrinkled up my nose at anything either.  When I first moved to Halifax from Vancouver 2 years ago, one of my biggest disappointments was the sushi scene here.  Sure, there's AMAZING sushi to be had in Hali (Shige's sushi pizza rivals anything I ever had on the West coast) but Holy Haamachi, is it ever expensive!  Coming from a city where $10 would buy you world-class raw fishy goodness, I was pretty bummed that to replicate the experience in Halifax cost me over $40.  And whilst I will always have a hankering for the good stuuf, and therefore always frequent the Shige's and Doraku's of this fine Maritime land, you really cannot beat hunkering down at Happy Sushi and having free-run of the extensive menu and still coming away with change from a twenty.It can be a little slow if it's busy (which it is, often) but come on, if you're opting for 'all-you-can-eat' I doubt you're in any kind of rush.  Sit back, relax and let the sushi apocalypse wash over you.
<review# 689,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/22/2012,10/30/2012,30,26,,7,3>In Bedford area? Looking for a good meal for lunch and/or dinner? Go eat here. Seriously. This place rocks. Edible Matters is a short drive from Hammonds Plains/Bedford Highway intersection, and is worth the trip. Offering up a multitude of trendy adjectives, ie. fresh, locally sourced, house-made, gluten-free, etc. EM comes across unpretentious, and hits this funny spot of being rural/urban at the same time. A delicious lunch menu of sandwiches, salads, and casual fare are complimented with great coffee and beverages. Go here and order the Janh-Mi, a BBQ duck take on the classic Vietnamese sandwich. Most of their lunch dishes come with sides of refrigerator pickles and freshly made potato chips. You can order a pop, but I'd recommend their daily water (free) which is usually flavoured with cucumber and citrus. I tried a special one lunch of marinated melon salad, that while flavourful didn't fill me as much as their sandwiches do, but overall this place is great. Oh and they sell Macaron's. Not macaroon's, but those tiny french pastries that come in all the colours of the rainbow. They aren't everyone's cup of tea, but I do enjoy their gluten-freeness and they aren't easy to find in this city.A co-worker recently picked up a loaf of their gluten-free bread and at $6 the price was far lower than other options. The flavour and texture was fantastic, with a hint of sweet and didn't crumble at your touch. They also offer a selection of pickles, jams and other jellies to pick up on your way out.This is one to watch, I'm especially excited to try a family style supper this fall.
<review# 690,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2012,10/29/2012,37,121,6,7,5>Oh... I can't believe its taken me this long to write a review for Indochine....Taking in consideration that I have now become a regular (1-2 weekly visits) this is well over due. In one word... ADDICTIVE!This is a gem of a place. My favourite, the Korean Tacos! 1 for $4 or 2 for $7.50, you absolutely can not go wrong! My favourites are the fish taco and chicken, but really, they're all delish! Fresh sprouts, carrots, cucumber, toasted tortilla (and they have a gluten free option) all dressed with a sauce that is the perfect balance of hotness and tastiness... OH MY! I might have to run up and get one now :)Their Banh Mi's are equally as good. Served on a fresh, toasted baguette with a choice of white or multi grain, the bread offers an exquisite balance of crispiness on the outside and that soft fresh bread texture we'll all learned to love! The pork meatball Banh Mi is absolutely to die for.If you're in the mood to try a little bit of everything, you can go for their Taco/Pho or 1/2 Banh Mi/Pho combo (under $9 folks!!! perfect lunch or light diner). They also have a great selection of vermicelli bowls/plates and their new organic mint lemonade is perfect for a hot day!The restaurant is quite small, only seating 12-15 people inside BUT, they have quite a few outdoor tables set up. And, lets get real folks! What better way to spend your lunch hour on a sunny day then to grab a couple tacos and walk across to the public gardens! BUT please... don't feed the ducks.... if they get wind of this amazing place right over the fence, I'm sure they'll take over.You've probably figured out I'm a fan by now. So what are you waiting for, get out there and get hooked yourself.
<review# 691,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2012,10/28/2012,27,83,,4,2>Pipa serves a real good fair. A step into their restaurant gives a good vibe of the typical fine dining establishment. Take your pick of either a rustic cottage setting or a more modern type and you are on your way to order. Both my wife enjoyed our meal and time there. Perhaps that's because we were the first customers on a weekday morning. She ordered pie and I myself Chicken piri-piri. Overall, we loved the plating and the salad sides which were fresh but of the 2 mains, the pie was excellent. Love their crust which was delicately made and very buttery. As to dessert, we went for the traditional Portuguese custard tart. Being from Asia and having been to Macao and Hong Kong which are famous for their Egg tarts, we'd say theirs are up there. It was nicely done except what is surprising is that they used filo pastry instead of the standard type of pastry for the sides. But that's fine with us. This definitely a place to come again. Besides the services was also above our expectations.

I do) shout down to a little boy "hey kid, you want to come up here"?  The kids eyes lit up, we was already excited to be on the ferry, but to ride with the CAPTAIN?  Wow!  Quickly got the OK from his mom and scooted up the stairs to the control room.  After we stopped the kid came down and I walked behind them 1/2 listening to him talk non stop about how the ferry works, still brimming with excitement.GOOD ON YOU metro transit!  I'll remember this next time my bus is late and I'm waiting in the rain/snow.

It gets the 4 because the service was excellent, both friendly and helpful, not to mention informative.I settle on a hot chocolate after considering a tea of some sort and the the barista suggested adding a mint green tea bag to the mix. It was a decent hot chocolate and the mint green tea was interesting - it was spearmint and I would've liked peppermint much better.I was hungry and opted for a samosa,  which was quite good. They aren't made in-store but are made locally - she told me where but I forgot almost as soon as she told me. I'll go back again...
<review# 694,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2012,10/25/2012,8,168,5,9,2>Don't hate, but I'm a teacher and many of my summer days are spent lazing on the beach soaking up the glorious rays.  Now several teacher friends love to accompany me on my beach excursions, but I tend to love beachin it a little more than the average person, so I sometimes make the trip alone with just a book and a towel.  A perfect way to spend a couple hours. Now Rainbow Haven is about 20 minutes from my house, so it's really the closest option for me. Here's some advice: If it's looking like it's going to be really hot be prepared for a few things..1. Parking gets nuts, and can be really crazy by 1 o'clock.  I like to get there by 11 to solidify a spot for my car and for my butt. 2. Make sure your car is MVI'd, plates and good, license isn't expired and you're buckled up. The cops love to set up routine road stops along Bissett Road.3. I prefer to park at the end of the beach where you first come in, opting not to park down by the canteen. There are fewer people here and less craziness with kids, etc. Sometimes it isn't lifeguarded, but on the really hot days when there are more people it usually is.4. RH can be a bit of a gong show.  Socialites showing off their tatts or buffed up dudes trying to impress the ladies, it can all be a bit much.All this being said, I love to spend a morning here with my book or an afternoon with a friend.  The beach is clean and well taken care of and most shenanigans are dealt with quickly.
<review# 695,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2012,10/24/2012,21,55,2,12,3>3 meals later and I'm finally finished my combo plate. Yea, the portions are gigantic. Alright, the quality of my food (based on 2 visits) has been outstanding. It's still steaming hot when it got to my door, vegetables were very fresh and still crisp, and their chicken balls are the size of softballs and not all batter. The spring roll was huge as well, and filled with some sort of amazingness. I am going to go against the trend here and say I really disliked their egg roll. It had a strong curry taste which turned me off immediately, however my fiance loved it. Even went on to say it was one of the best she's tried. Be your own judge, I'm guessing. If you're ordering a combo plate be sure to try their ginger chicken, it's SO good. After my experiences, you'll be hard pressed to actually convince me to order from anywhere else in the city!

These fantastic $5 martinis are what originally drew me and a gaggle of other young PR students to the Fireside one Monday night late in 2008. What kept us was not just the cheapy martinis but also the amazing food, great service and comfortable, relaxed atmosphere. I haven't been to the Fireside in almost a year due to the  fact that most of my former classmates have moved away but last evening I had a chance to head back for a much needed reunion with both my PR peeps and those FABULOUS martinis. And I was not disappointed (with either!):The atmosphere is just as I remember: warm, friendly, inviting and casual. The food was still affordable and delicious. For a meal try the lamb burger or a Greek wrap.  If you're looking for something to share, or just a munchie  definitely try the spinach and artichoke dip, you will NOT be disappointed!  And the martinis...well the martinis, as always, rocked my world. A few favourites, you ask?? The sour apple, Tommy's Uncle and Beachcomber are all great mixes. So, if you're looking for a great drink and chat with friends the Fireside is a great spot. Maybe I'll catch you there...next Monday!
<review# 697,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/29/2012,10/22/2012,13,71,,3,4>This was our first visit to Moda and certainly won't be our last. We came in from the pouring rain outside and the hostess offered to hang up our coats and umbrella, which is always a good start in a top notch restaurant.Our server, Emily, was very helpful in telling us about what she thought were the best items on the menu. The menu is short, which is something I enjoy; it is usually a sign that the kitchen limits itself to few items that it does very well. Moda certainly proved that theory. We had looked at the menu online before going and two items had been removed from the menu. We both thought that the menu could benefit from either having those two items added back (pheasant and osso bucco) or something else added; the current menu seemed a bit "safe".The wine list is also short but features some very nice choices, including quite a few selections available by the glass. We ordered a glass of prosecco and a glass of valpolicella. Both were excellent. We placed our food order at the same time as the drinks, finally settling on the mussels and the risotto spheres for appetizers, and the seafood pasta and braised lamb shank (not on the online menu) for mains.We were brought a few slices of excellent fresh baguettes at the same time as our drinks. The only criticism I might have is that our appetizers then arrived much too quickly. My partner's mussels came in a creamy broth that had a beautiful aroma of smoked bacon. The mussels were cooked absolutely perfectly and the smoked bacon was a great pairing. The risotto spheres were delicate and airy, and the accompanying rosemary scented tomato sauce was rich and also a great match.Our mains didn't disappoint either. The seafood pasta came with a very generous amount of seafood. The mussels and shrimp were perfectly cooked, but the haddock was ever so slightly overdone. The lamb shank was out of this world. You cannot possibly cook a piece of lamb any better, it was quite evident that they took their time with this. The sauce was flavorful and coated the lamb beautifully. The accompanying vegetables were just al dente. Perfect!Emily came back to tell us about the desserts. We settled on the bread pudding with a caramel sauce. The portion is more than enough for 2 people. This was the best bread pudding we had ever had. The caramel sauce was amazing!Overall, this restaurant should be rated with the best in the city. We will definitely be back.
<review# 698,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/6/2012,10/21/2012,25,107,2,8,3>Moving is not pretty. That's why I would prefer to pay somebody else to lug my stuff around. These guys had been recommended to me by a few friends and after making a few phone calls around, they were also the cheapest movers I had contacted.They are actually a national company (something I was not aware of) so I ended up talking to a call centre in Vancouver before I actually found the number for the Halifax office. Once on the phone the staff were very friendly and helpful. One thing I will say about these guys though- depending on when you plan to move, expect to have to pay a big deposit. The amount gets deducted off your final cost, but I wasn't expecting to have to shell out over half the final cost upon booking. The day of the move they showed up on time and my two-men team was super efficient and got straight down to business. They were nice guys- very polite and respectful of my stuff (they weren't just chucking stuff in the back of the truck etc). They were pretty quick, to move out of the old place, wait for the new landlord to show up with the keys and unload in the new place all took just over 3 hours. The best part? Not a single thing broke in the move (ok, one wine glass, but that was my poor packing skills, not the movers' fault).
<review# 699,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2012,10/20/2012,39,130,,4,2>If you're hungry after scrambling over the rocks at Peggy's Cove, I recommend skipping the diner there and driving down the road a few minutes to the Finer Diner. I had my first visit there this weekend and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the service and the food. They have a solid menu with a lot of seafood offerings so I opted for the crunchy salmon sandwich and it was delicious. The generous portion of fish was coated in a spicy, crispy breading and came with fries (which were fine, but nothing special). It was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a while. We were too stuffed to order desert, but I did see some delicious looking pies on their way to other tables. Next time I'll know to save room!
<review# 700,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2012,10/19/2012,20,178,2,4,2>Another happy side effect of my travels on Open City and the shop keeper met us with a dish of complimentary chocolate. Winner! I had the small hot chocolate made with dark chocolate and it was delish, rich and not too sweet. The interior is larger and lusher than you'd think certainly enough room to curl up with a hot drink or lunch. The selection of chocolate for purchase seemed complicated but the clerk was glad to chat and provide samples to customers.
<review# 701,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2012,10/18/2012,29,249,1,6,3>So I have a confession to make, I can't carry a tune to save my life, but even still I'm a closet karaoke fan. I had never been until Jill M. and a group of friends introduced me on the final night of Yelp Retox 2012. I've since become a big fan.I've never had the food, but their drink staff is fast and friendly. It's a large place, and after a few drinks I still manage to end up outside instead of in the washroom from time to time. The karaoke is where it's at. Laurie is great, there is a big song book with too many options. Its got a supportive crowd that depending on the night and the song, will get up and dance. There are lots of props to choose from if you are putting on a performance, and there are always a couple of fun regulars around.  Lion's Head Tavern is a great dance club alternative for a night out in Halifax.
<review# 702,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2012,10/17/2012,51,65,5,3,3>Honestly, I've only ever actually frequented Willy's while not entirely sober and I've only ever ordered poutine. So this review will be pretty short and sweet. The poutine itself is solid. Hot, greasy, starchy - everything I'm looking for when I'm seeking a good night-ending meal. Probably not the best in the city, but certainly good enough to satisfy a craving. This said, I have no idea how much a poutine costs, as my memories of paying are... blurry. Can't really say much about the staff as they, too, are not exactly enshrined in my memory. But they've managed to successfully navigate several business transactions with a drunken me, so kudos to them.
<review# 703,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2012,10/16/2012,54,227,,8,4>The North End is quickly becoming my favorite neighborhood in Halifax, and this store is one of the little known gems in that part of town. Seriously, it's tiny but I could wander through the aisles for a good hour looking at all the different food! I've been in once in a while over the years, but my most recent purchase was some frozen paneer (cheese) and some korma paste to try and replicate a delicious dish I had at an Indian friend's engagement ceremony. I'm a hesitant cook but love Indian food, so I'm sure I'll be stopping into this place again!
<review# 704,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2012,10/15/2012,10,15,,5,2>Started with Nachos, they had a Clay burger and chowder. The burger had a fried egg and a weave piece of bacon. Amazing. My wife had the onion burger. It looked awesome, but I was way to stuffed from my food. That clay burger was excellent, it was a simple but well executed burger. Easily one of the best burgers I've had in Halifax. Will be back here for sure.
<review# 705,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/28/2012,10/14/2012,12,118,3,3,3>I have never actually been here, but my mother went there for breakfast today and brought me back a chocolate chip cookie. OMG it was the size of my head! and it weighed like 5lbs!! So yummy and I still have over half of it left! My mother also thoroughly enjoyed her breakfast (croissants). I will definitely stop by here sometime soon to check it out myself.
<review# 706,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2012,10/13/2012,66,321,4,4,4>I don't like coffee.I don't like the taste of it.I don't like the smell of it.I don't like the look of it.I don't like coffee.My friends do. So, every now and again, I will swing by the Goat to get them a gift bag.Now, since I don't like coffee (Have I mentioned that I don't like coffee?) I don't know much about it. I don't really understand this "roast" scale. I wouldn't know why one bag is a blend and the other is not. I definitely don't get ... well, really, anything beyond the instant coffee that I used to make for my parents as a kid. Thankfully, the staff here know way more about coffee than I do. Or they can do a very convincing job of faking it but I'm going to assume they actually do know. They don't seem to mind that I'm an idiot in this respect and take the time to answer any of my questions. They also have wisely decided to put descriptions of the bags of coffee (that I can actually understand) out. The text actually describes the flavour, not just the experience so I can make a decision based on my existing knowledge of my friends' likes and dislikes.So whenever I need to pick up a bag of good coffee, this is the place I've been going.
<review# 707,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2012,10/12/2012,28,42,3,8,4>This mom-and-pop shoe repair place does not disappoint.  Having only worn my new boots for a few months, the really small pad on the heel needed replacing a little sooner than I expected.  So I took my darling footwear to this quaint little shop by the Oxford Theatre on Quinpool Rd.  I honestly didn't even know it was there but after going here once, I won't ever forget it.   After leaving my babies in the experienced hands of the proprietor, I left feeling a little sad.  Did I mention that I LOVE my boots?  I've talked about them in another review so I won't bore you.  However, if you so choose to be bored, you can read a little about them here:yelp.ca/review_share/2RZAnyway, upon returning, I was quite surprised to find they had done more than I had asked for by waterproofing them as well... at no extra charge.But wait!  That's not all!Being a cash business, I was sadly a little short on cash.  I asked if he minded while I run across the road to a bank machine to get some cash.  He simply asked me to give me what I had and that would be fine.What a great little shop!  Watch and learn people.  This is how you keep customers coming back.  It's also how you get Yelper's to give a 5 star rating.
<review# 708,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2012,10/11/2012,21,105,2,5,3>I took my husband to Phat's for the first time this evening, for a haircut. He has tight curly locks that need a bit of extra effort to get just right! We arrived at Phat's at 7:27pm, and the place closes at 7pm. Phat noticed us pull up and about to pull away. He hustled to the door, opened it and waved us in. This earned the first 2 stars. Phat took his time, made us laugh, only needed to ask a few questions to complete a good short cut and we were impressed with out having to point out any spots that were not to our (my) satisfaction! This earned him another 2 stars! Phat has some funny signs up on his mirrors, remembers names and who people are, makes just enough great conversation and truly makes you feel important while you are there. Another 2 stars. Oh wait, I can only give 5... From a female perspective, the back wall could use some cleaning and organizing, but as my husband pointed out, this is a men's barber shop and he didn't even notice. We were both extremely satisfied with our experience, this will now be his regular barber shop and we gladly recommend Phat's!Tip well. He earns it!
<review# 709,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/15/2012,10/10/2012,20,8,,4,2>A quiet neighbourhood, an unassuming storefront and uncluttered sales floor. Perfect conditions for tasting olive oils and balsamic vinegars.I think Liquid Gold Tasting Bay & All Things Olive is one of Halifax's best kept secrets! Come here and fill up a spoon to taste flavoured and specialty olive oils, or make your own bread dipping concoction with balsamic vinegars (and test it with bread cubes from Juliens!)Staff here are very, very knowledgeable about the product and pairings. Stop here for yourself or pick up a cool gift!
<review# 710,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/20/2012,10/9/2012,9,59,,7,3>I've been to Ace twice now, and I've got to say I'm pretty impressed. The first time I went and ate in. I had the Deluxe Burger and fries. Well, the Deluxe is Delicious! It has bacon and cheese, and a great bun. The service was awesome - they were friendly and prompt. I was impressed with the fries, as I'm not normally a huge fry fan (exception: sweet potato fries. But that's another story for another day). Their fries were crispy and fresh. The second time I ordered a veggie burger and fries to go. The fries were the same and delicious, and the veggie burger was good too. It came as a square patty with goat cheese, arugula and pickled beets, with a rosemary bun. I will say that it isn't my favourite veggie burger, but it was good, and falls into my category of good veggie burgers that don't try to taste like beef burgers. The service was excellent the second time as well. The staff there are so friendly.
<review# 711,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2012,10/8/2012,13,25,2,9,2>I just came from this restaurant and I had to review it while everything was still fresh in my mind.  I had been meaning to try this place for awhile but I was a little reluctant due to the initial reviews. But as you can see from the rating, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I will preface my review by saying I am not a sushi connoisseur. I love sushi, but I tend towards what I like to call the non-fishy options. As we approached the restaurant we could see that there were quite a few Japanese people inside. I took this as a good sign. While I might not know what qualifies as the best sushi, I am pretty sure they know what's good. We were seated right away by a kind waiter who took his time to explain how this ALL YOU CAN EAT Sushi menu worked. The price was around $23 per person. Many of the rolls came in 1 piece per order. But there were lots of maki rolls that came in 6 pcs per order. There were 3 of us and we planned to do a lot of sharing. We got 3 menus per table with one check list. Beside each item you checked, you were to put the quantity of items. As they should, the restaurant frowns on wasted food and encourages you to order just a few items at a time. You can order as many times as you want. I had read a few reviews on here that said there were big lags between food. We didn't experience that at all. We probably started with a few too many items. You'll want to plan to have time to relax and enjoy yourself. We were on a time limit, another reason we ordered more in the beginning. We tried the shrimp tempura, light, flaky yumm. The grilled veggie roll, a little mushy but still yum. Miso soup, standard fare. I had asked for some spicy sauce that never came, but that's no big deal. Spicy salmon roll, really tasty but quite a bit of tempura bits. I didn't mind that but the sushi lovers might be disappointed in the amount of salmon. The spicy jumbo shrimp, another deep fried item I know...but sooooo good. This grilled salmon asparagus dish that everyone loved. Mango salad, not as good as Thai mango salad but we were not in a Thai place, still very good. A Golden dragon roll, featuring more shrimp but topped with mango. I loved the veggie tempura. There was a good spicy crab roll we liked too. We all said to each other that there was nothing that we did not like. There was a garlic beef dish that came later that we didn't love. The beef was a bit chewy but we didn't hate it. We finished with some deep fried banana and green tea ice cream. Sounds like we ate a lot. But it was just a bit and a piece here and there. Okay...we were stuffed. We ate too much, LOL. The service was great. Kind waiters. The food was hot when it should be. It came quickly after we ordered. We are all looking forward to going back when we have more time and can bring along a few more of our girlfriends. The restaurant is not crowded. This might by a location thing. It's downtown Dartmouth after all. If it was anywhere else I think it would be really hopping. I have no idea about the Sashimi because that is not my kind of thing. If you are really picky about your sushi, this might not be the best sushi you've ever had. But if you like to try a little bit of everything, check this place out. You might be just like me, pleasantly surprised.
<review# 712,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/23/2012,10/7/2012,5,5,4,7,6>I just  can't say enough good things about Thumpers! After moving from the States, I was desperate to find a local salon that I could count on for a quality cut. Since moving, I've been to Thumpers twice (two cuts + once for some highlights). Unlike my salon in the States, I've had zero problems booking appointments with very short notice. In both instances I've been able to book an appointment for the next day. This is a plus for a someone who has taken matters into her own hands when not able to book an appointment within days. This has ended tragically in the past. Whether or not this was sheer luck or not, I don't know, but I'm not complaining!In addition to quick booking, I've been really impressed with the front desk staff. Like many high-end salons, Thumpers offers all clients a beverage upon arrival (with more than one tea option)! Even though Thumpers staff members could have an attitude frequently associated with higher-end salons, I've never felt more welcome at a salon. In fact, my boyfriend even noted how nice everyone was while waiting five minutes for me at the end of my appointment.I can't speak for other stylists, but I love my stylist - Kelly Welling. If you are looking for a stylist truly interested in what you're looking for, she is your woman. Oh and the fact that she is hilarious and will have you laughing for hours in her chair doesn't hurt either. On my second visit I decided to finally get some additional highlights. We talked through a few different options before getting started as I wanted some really subtle ombre highlights, giving the impression of some ligher blonde pieces, but wanted to avoid the need for maintenance associated with full highlights.After washing the bleach out and starting the drying process, Kelly did something I've never experienced at a salon before. She flat out told me that the color wasn't noticeable enough and that she needed to re-do it. Upon inspection, she was right. The color was so subtle that it was hardly noticeable that it was any different than the color I arrived with. Some others may have been irritated by this, but for someone who is extremely picky about highlights and subtle color, I was not irritated in the least. In fact, I was very impressed that Kelly pointed it out and then offered multiple options for correction, after many apologies.I've left salons unhappy in the past with color, but haven't been vocal enough about it. In this case, Kelly took care of it for me! Unfortunately I didn't have time that night to stay longer as I had plans with some friends, but we made an appointment for the next day to lighten the color a bit more. I popped back in the next day and after a quick 45 minutes, the color was lightened to perfection and I was on my way. The only downside of Thumpers is the price, as mentioned by other reviewers. Truthfully I only get my hair cut about 2-3 times a year so I'm willing to dish out a bit more than someone who gets their hair done on a more regular basis. The fact that I had to come back a second time did not upset me in the least and will not deter me from coming back again!
<review# 713,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2012,10/5/2012,14,61,3,3,3>Hubby, baby and I had lunch on the Q patio on a sunny weekend recently. We opted for the patio in case baby boy had a meltdown so we could make a speedy getaway. The people-watching kept the three of us entertained throughout the meal. We both ordered chicken - I had the breast and hubs had the half-plump, which was significantly more meat. He picked the Alabama white sauce and a side of fries, and I had the Memphis, which I'm told is their most popular, with corn on the cob. Our meals came with cornbread and coleslaw. It was a great lunch. Messy, but delicious. This would probably not be a great place for a first date unless you're both OK with finding mysterious BBQ sauce smears up to your elbows later. I wasn't expecting to love Q but it absolutely exceeded my expectations!
<review# 714,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2012,10/4/2012,6,54,3,3,3>Need a place for a special occasion drink? Check. Perfect for after-theatre, after-nice-dinner, hell, even after-a-night-on-the-bottom-floor-when-you-want-­to-class-it-up. I love the cocktails here. They're real and strong and they don't taste like fruit juice. At first, the drink prices might make you balk a little. Then you realize it's not really a bad deal when you're drinking something twice as strong as you'd get elsewhere, and expertly made. Going to the Drawing Room is like stepping into another world. It's just so unique, classy and atmospheric. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that you climb the reportedly haunted staircase in order to get to it. OoooOooo.Much like the other floors, service can be slow. At least in the Drawing Room, they have an excuse. Hand-crafting a fine cocktail takes longer than drawing a pint. And for the most part, it's worth the wait.
<review# 715,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/20/2012,10/3/2012,7,40,2,3,4>Well last night I finally made it to Morris East and I feel like I have been missing out. It was busy but we did not have to wait at all and our waitress was lovely, attentive but not in our faces the whole night. I went with a group of friends and we tried 2 different pizzas and 2 different salads which was a great way to do a first visit because we got to try a good selection of the menu. Salad wise we had the Caesar and the Roasted Wood-Fired Vegetables, the Caesar  was good, above average even but the roasted vegetable blew it out of the water. Who knew brussel sprouts could be so dam good  but they were. For our Pizza options we had the Peach and the Capricciosa both which were yummy and featured well balanced flavours. The Peach though was simply amazing the combo of the sweet peach with the salty prosciutto was basically perfection.
<review# 716,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2012,10/2/2012,39,80,2,7,5>The more I Yelp the more I learn that 5 stars really are reserved for extra amazing experiences. Frankly, I think Pavia deserves it. I'm actually writing this review from a window side table on my laptop on a Friday afternoon after enjoying a lunch which included the All Amantea Panini (made with Italian prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, green olives and drizzled with olive oil) and a cup of their soup. Today's soup was sweet potato with ginger, lime and coconut. And trust me when I tell you...it was GOOD. Full of flavor, just a hint of heat GOOD. Now that I conquered my lunch I'm enjoying an Americano, made with Pavia's special espresso " MokFlor". It is better than my lunch and that's saying a lot. But what Pavia does best of all is their service. You can come be like me and come to get a little work done, (hello free wifi) be like others I see around me gathering with friends, or  meeting with colleagues. The wait staff and owner are my favorite kind of friendly. They give you your space but attentive to what you need. I witnessed the following while at Pavia that melted my heart. A little girl who had a sore ankle on crutches hit her sore foot on the way in with her mom and was all teared up. The owner asked Mom if she could have a chocolate chip cookie cure and with Mom's permission took her over one all done up with a little fresh melted chocolate on top to make her feel special and forget how much her foot hurt. His thoughtfulness worked like a charm. I love it here, and would recommend it to anyone. Go, enjoy - and don't forget to try a ricciarelli (its one seriously  incredible almond cookie).
<review# 717,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2012,10/1/2012,65,111,4,4,3>I decided to treat myself to an overnight stay at the Prince George over Open City weekend so I could stumble to my downtown hotel after a day and evening of merriment, rather than deal with getting back to Dartmouth. It was a fun splurge - I had a deluxe guestroom with king -size bed and a partial view of the Citadel.It was a nicely-furnished basic room - bed, flat-screen TV, desk, chair, mini-fridge, etc. A Keurig machine with a couple complimentary K-cups was available for morning coffee. I honestly didn't spend a whole lot of awake time in the room, but it did the trick for my needs. However, if I had been planning to spend a little more "me" time in the room, I probably would have been slightly disappointed. For one, there was no bathtub. The shower was gorgeous and spacious, but a decadent bubble bath is one of the things I most look forward to when I stay at a nice hotel.  Also, I had been looking forward to room service brunch, but I chose extra sleep instead. Good thing, because the room service options were not plenty on Sunday, but only because it was Mother's Day and the hotel restaurant does a big spread.The two best things about my stay? The bed and the late checkout time. Seriously folks - sinking into this bed was like floating on big, puffy clouds. Amazing. It was incredibly difficult to get going the next day - I wanted to stay in that bed forever. Luckily, the Prince George has a 1pm checkout time. A hotel after my own heart. With the curtains drawn, the room remained luxuriously dark on a bright and sunny spring morning. I took advantage of both the bed and the checkout time - I think I slept past 11am. Writing this review, I wish I was sleeping in that bed right this second. I need a nap!
<review# 718,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/16/2012,9/30/2012,38,87,2,3,3>Biscuit is an absolute gem of a store and has been a favourite of mine since I first moved to Halifax ten years ago and would go there for fun and quirky postcards. I love their commitment to bringing fun and unique clothing and giftware to the city and for making that work so well. It's got a great mix of everything from cute dresses to outerwear to kitchen items to shoes and many things in between. A mix like that could be a hot mess, but like I said, Biscuit makes it work. The staff are super. I finally gave in and bought my first pair of TOMS and like on all my other visits, the Biscuit who was helping me out was delightful and helpful. She knew her stuff and put my shoes on hold while I went outside to call a friend to talk through my feelings about buying TOMS. As others have said, prices can be a little steep (although, not that bad), but I recognize the smaller Canadian designers they carry and I can appreciate that it's not all mass-produced and so cheap that everyone and their dog owns it. Biscuit is the place I go to buy a piece that's a bit different. Not everything in the store is my style or meant for my shape, but c'est cool. I can usually find one thing I love and fits me. And really, all you need is that one great thing to treat yo' self with. (and it's so worth it when you still get compliments on that one thing a few years after you purchased it).Pro-tip: when you know the 50% off sale is coming up, scout out the store in advance and know what you're getting. It'll save you from wandering around in the crowds trying to find stuff. If you find something you want, don't put it down unless you're prepared to lose it. Just buy it. And wearing leggings and a tank top helps with trying something on when the change room lineup gets long.
<review# 719,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2012,9/29/2012,32,111,,6,6>I have become very fond of Ratinaud's duck sausages. These sausages, flavoured with orange and ginger, are hand made and one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten.The first time I stopped by, the owner, Frederic, said he didn't have any made, but if I could wait 5 minutes, he could easily make my order. And that night I fell in love with the duck sausage. Yesterday for a dinner party, I called ahead to see whether he had some and when I arrived 4 hours later my order was waiting for me. I also tried the herb and the Toulouse sausages which were equally delicious and less pricey than the duck sausages. The country pate was my first foray into charcuterie and that was good as well but not as delicious as those duck sausages. I am not very knowledgable about charcuterie and meats in general, but Frederic is very helpful in explaining the ingredients and giving recommendations. Any intimidation I felt was immediately dissipated by his friendliness and passion for meat.Not only does the shop have awesome charcuterie products (that foie grasse is on my must try list), but you get a taste of what it must be like to visit a European butcher. A little bonus yesterday was getting to practice my very rusty French with Frederic's mom. We had a nice little chat about the Tour de France which perfectly complimented the delicious food.

Come on- spicy food, guacamole- what's not to love?And then I heard about Habaneros. I waited, and I waited impatiently for this place to open. I drove by looking for more signs of life. And then it happened. It finally opened after much buzz.It was so easy. We walked in to a mediocre line up and ordered quite quickly. I had three tacos: two hard shell and one soft. I tried the fajita chicken (amazing), taco beef (the usual) and braised beef (delicious, sweet but heavy).It is the wonderful toppings that makes this place a hit. So many amazingly fresh condiments and flavoured mayo. Cilantro everywhere!C said that the pulled pork is the best meat choice for tacos. I may try it next time.I am not a vegetarian- but it would be nice to have a grilled veggie option for the tacos. Instead of a meat choice why not marinated and grilled portobello?The restaurant is trendy looking and easy. Bar stools lined up around the perimeter leaving lots of space for waiting. I like that you have a choice of bottled or fountain drinks.Delicious!
<review# 721,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2012,9/27/2012,29,166,,2,3>With gift certificate in hand, we popped in for an evening meal. It turned out to be a fantastic couple of hours. We settled at a table for two on one side of the restaurant. It had a high level of noise as mentioned by other Yelpers.  As with most 5 star ratings, this one is primarily based on the service. Our waitress provided a fantastically engaging education on their red's and white's. She gave us a little taste of two - just to clarify our decision - based on her recommendation. She was at our table a half a dozen times just to get our wine order!The food was great. They have two different dishes with Gorgonzola! This is the first place that I have ever seen that!Again our waitress helped us to chose a desert to share - a caramelly cheesecake - excellent!It was a most relaxed, informal evening for two.As for the previous Yelp review that mentioned the mouse, well we didn't see any. Although being frequenters of the Halifax waterfront we have no doubt that they are there and, no doubt that this will make Ristorante a Mano a non-starter for many. But, being fans of the ocean and its varied wildlife, we think that sometimes one has to just get over it and, as a result, in this case, we profited from a great experience on the waterfront.
<review# 722,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2012,9/25/2012,61,77,5,5,4>I've been banging my head against the wall for weeks because I have yet to make it to the new TIBS location! Even worse? I couldn't bloody well find the place.Not to worry I did a bit of an embarrassing wiggly dance when I set sight on it. Nuzzled in by subway on the waterfront, if your sense of direction fails you just follow your nose.THE CROISSANTS. Sweet baby jesus. MASSIVE. Like big craters that came to earth from planet Melt-in-Your-Mouth. If you know anything about TIBS you know the they do it large. Large cookies, croissants, personality,... everything. I got a chocolate croissant for Juddy and an almond croissant for myself. Thinking I would totally be jealous of the chocolate, I wanted more bang for my buck and opted to test two different kinds. Pleasantly surprised, I enjoyed the almond croissant more. Probably because all of the Bulk Barn's almond supply was found inside the layers of flaky buttery goodness. Amaze-balls people, hurry up and get your bum there if you haven't already.Service wise, mine was excellent. They were very eager, taking your order as soon as they saw you coming. It was a little bit confusing as some croissants was given to people at the end of the line before the person at the cash had finished her order. This left the customer at the cash with no chocolate croissant. And she sure as heck wasn't getting mine. My fingers were already all over it before I paid.I've yet to have a caffeinated beverage there yet. So I'll continue to bang my head :)SO GOOD. I swear to god their croissants are so gimongous they have a heart beat.
<review# 723,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/10/2012,9/24/2012,33,47,2,5,3>What can be said about Gio that hasn't already been said? I came in today after a horrible day at work for some much needed decompression with a friend, accompanied by some great cocktails and even better food. We started with a Lemon drop that I ordered, and my friend ordered a cucumber gimlet. They were fantastic. I have to say with my lemon drop, it was the best I've ever had. I find so many bartenders try to get all the lemon flavor from Lemoncello, which normally makes the drink a little sweet for my taste. Here they use mostly fresh lemons, and a hit of black pepper (??!!). It was actually divine with the rock sugar on the rim. perfect for a hot day. My friends gimlet was equally satisfying ( we had to try each others drinks), with elderflower liquor it was perfect for a hot day!On to the food... we split three appetizers and left so satisfied that I forgot I even had a bad day. They started us off with this tiny dish of scallop Ceviche that honestly if they just have given me a bowl of that and some crackers I would have been happy. We tried the gnocchi, that had king and cremini mushrooms and a lovely glaze of truffle oil, with ricotta cheese on top, which was to die for. They actually sear the gnocchi after its been cooked and it was perfect. It was fluffy, and not doughy at all. The Crab cake which was to die for, and Im not entirely sure what the sauce was under it, but it had hints of lemon that just made the dish, along with a fun little shot glass of passionfruit and cucumber soda to sip between bites. So whimsy and it went perfect.After the wonderful apps we decided on the Charcuterie for 2 and a bottle of wine. This would rival anyone's in the city. House smoked duck, duck and pistachio terrine, rabbit mousse, fig jam. What can I say? It was a foodgasm... All of this coupled with fantastic decor and friendly attentive service, without being made to feel that you need to be "seen" or "important" there. I feel like Gio is one of those places that people look at and feel that it isn't accessible, which is quite the opposite. Its by far one of my favorite fine dining spots in the city, even if only for a few drinks and appetizers.
<review# 724,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2012,9/23/2012,34,91,2,5,3>We went here after the Yelp event around the corner on a recommendation.  The food was delicious. The bread to start was delicious, I am a bread fiend though. We had the lasagna and Spaghettini alla Carbonara. Both were good but I preferred the carbonara. Then dessert time came, oh my. The desserts were unbelieveable. We ordered the Pumpkin Caramel praline cheesecake and Kahlua spiked layered sponge cake, mocha butter cream iced, cappuccino gelato. Both were great choices but I love cheesecake more than bread.A draw back to all the great food is you are packed in to the restaurant tight, no intimate dining here
<review# 725,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/8/2012,9/22/2012,16,94,3,4,2>I love sushi. I especially love sushi when it takes like my friends g-mas (as close to authentic as you can get I guess). I always have a hard time picking from the menu, so many options, and not a big enough stomach!! So I started with the California roll. Its usually my go to when I cant decide. One thing I didn't like about it, it had roe inside the roll. Not a fan of roe. I then was super delighted when I had the spicy crab roll. ERMAHGERD. So freaking good. It had the little tempura bits in it, adding a perfect crunch! Yum Yum! The salad with the ginger dressing. AWESOME. Seriously. Could eat it all day, and its not a super complicated salad. Literally has just iceburg lettuce, shredded carrot and I think a little cucumber? But so good. My only and ONLY complaint was it was so freaking hot in there. It stopped me from ordering my favorite miso! Service was quick and staff are really friendly! Can't wait to go again!
<review# 726,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2012,9/21/2012,15,59,,5,3>I decided to wait until I'd been to Cheese Curds a few times before I did a review. Being fair and all, you know. I've been about five times now and my opinion has not changed. I love it. I may be considered a regular now. I want to say first that yes, you may wait longer than normal for your food, but it's worth it. There is a caveat on the wall that asks for patience and promises the reward of fresh delicious burgers. They have always followed through on the promise for me. So far I've had a taste of the  CC Porker, the Thai Chicken Burger, Poutine, and the regular burger. The Thai Chicken Burger has become my favorite. I love the Thai sauce and the cilantro. The house version comes with picked red onions, carrots, and thin cucumber slices. Although I enjoyed this combo of condiments, I've had fun mixing it up and changing what goes on the burger every time I've visited. There is a huge list of toppings and condiments to choose from. If you don't like what they offer you can pretty much create your own burger that better suits your tastes. The combo is also more than enough for two people. Every time we've gone to Cheese Curds we share the fries and drink of the combo but each get our own burgers. Cheese Curds is in a small space so if you go during lunch on the weekend you may not be able to get a table. On weeknights and evenings we've never had a problem with seating. If you want to avoid the line the staff told us the best time to come was after the dinner rush and between 2pm and 3pm after lunch. I must also say that I am so glad Cheese Curds exists. Finally fresh and delicious fast food in Dartmouth that is not from a chain!
<review# 727,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2012,9/20/2012,18,38,4,8,5>For some reason, my massively funny review was erased! Oh well, time rewrite it all over again.SO my buddy Paige H and I decided to have a little Yelp date last week and we've both been eyeing this one for a while. She drives by it everyday and I live on Quinpool. I've had Perisan food once before and I loved it. I found it so rich and flavourful, and I have been meaning to have a 2nd go at it. So really the cards were in place to try it. The setting was a little dark for my choice, maybe it's because I was outside all day. They do have a patio, but we chose to stay indoor because somehow we misread the sign and thought that the patio does not open until 8pm. (It turns out that it's for the shisha! Which btw, I am soooooo excited about! And I'm a non-smoker, but something about that flavoured tobacco just makes it sooo much better!) I loved the paintings and the small little icons that were up on the walls and the colours were simple but nice, it made the room look bigger on the inside (Kind of like the TARDIS, for all my Doctor Who lovers!)Moving on, our server was wonderful. She was very knowledgable about the food and was super friendly. She was very attentive, especially when Paige was giving her some PR tips for promotion and stuff!We started with the Quartet of dips, and that was good. The roasted red peppers dip was my favourite! Paige ordered the Lamb while I went a little crazy and ordered the Khoreshte Fesenjaan or the Persian Pomegranate and Walnut Stew with Chicken. You know the lamb was well cooked when Paige just touched it and it simply fell apart on to the plate. But seriously, my dish was simply divine! If heaven tasted like anything I want, I'd have two flavours, Nutella and that dish. It's been over a week and I can still taste it!Needless to say, this place is here to stay. So head on down there and try it out. I promise you that you will LOVE it!
<review# 728,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2012,9/19/2012,38,94,2,8,3>Stopped by a few times; once to check it the wares and the second time to actually buy stuff.Both times, was greeted by friendly staff. I asked a few questions and they answered and vigor.Having hauled freshly skinned sides of beef, pork to the cold room in my youth (how else do you explain my chiselled physique?) , I do know what good cuts of meat look like. And that is something you notice right away; the cuts do look great, no dyes or other tricks, the meat is the color it should be after being cut and aged accordingly.I picked up some drumsticks & thighs (2 lbs), lamb burgers (2 patties)  and sausages (2) on my second visit.The sausages had some Garrison Raspberry wheat beer infused, and it's made old school style. It was lean, tasty and easy to cook, just like it's supposed to be. Put that on a bun with some Tancook krout and you'll thank me.The chicken was simply amazing (drumstick & thighs) lots of meat, thighs were enormous. And the lamb burger was stuffed with a variety of fancy veggies like fennel and other stuff. For those who avoid lamb...don't; the sourced lamb here is amazing and I have no problem putting up my BBQ lamb burger with a Sobey's bun and cheese against one of the fancy burger joints in town, BRING IT!The one downside is that the above cost me almost 30$. Some would balk at that price, but the quality trumps anything you find at the major grocery chains.Stop by and pick up a few things for your next BBQ.
<review# 729,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2012,9/17/2012,9,18,,2,2>I've been going to Pete's togogo for two years now and I'm a big fan. It is a little on the pricy side, but all of the ingredients are fresh, and delicious. I love that you can build your own sandwich or salad, so you always get exactly what you want, but that they also have pre-made options incase you're in a hurry. The seating area can feel a little crowded, but I prefer to go eat on the boardwalk anyway (in the summer that is).  The staff are always friendly, and even though it is a small spot, they manage to fly through the busy lunchtime lineups.All in all, it is definitely worth the trip. I don't know that I could afford to eat there every day, but it is definitely a weekly stop!
<review# 730,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2012,9/16/2012,22,150,3,4,2>Where do I even begin. Having heard a bit about this newish restaurant and knowing they aim to source locally, we decided to give this restaurant a try. Great decision.We were greeted and seated by Amanda and from the moment we entered we were treated like we were the only diners, even though the place was quite busy. I though I might try to go with a lighter meal by having two starters, hoping that for once, I might actually be able to indulge in a dessert.  I ordered the French Onion Soup and the Porter Braised Atlantic Beef Short Rib, which came with Yukon gold pommes frites, jalapeno havarti cheese, micro greens, citrus vinegrette. Hubby settled on the 10 oz Strip Loin with herb roasted fingerling potatoes, spring vegetables and pan jus.Our server Shannon brought out a bread basket full of a variety of breads along with whipped butter, one blueberry and one plain. I tried a piece of the cranberry bread, but held back on any more, still hoping on making it to dessert.My plan began quickly falling apart when Chef Dave himself arrived at our table with his amuse bouche of braised mushrooms on a crostini with a dollop of creamy cambozola cheese, ma bouche was tres amused.  They say you should never trust a skinny cook, but Chef Dave is one skinny chef who knows how to pack every bite with flavour!My soup arrived and was a savoury bowl of onion, bread and cheesy flavours.  I'd forgotten how filling a bowl of onion soup could be and my visions of dessert were quickly fading.Then arrived the mains.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting but what arrived was a bit of a surprise, a big bowl of what looked like poutine but tasted like poutine on steroids. Tiny julienned potato fries smothered in melted jalapeno havarti cheese, bits of beef and the braising liquid reduced to the most intensly beefy jus I've ever had. Hubby's strip loin was done to his specifications and very flavourful. We saw an ad for the restaurant in the hotel elevator that admonished not to lick the plate, but we were oh so tempted!And there died my dream of ever having dessert that evening.  The short rib dish is on the starter menu but I'm not sure who could ever eat a full main after getting through that hearty bowl of goodness, I couldn't finish it. And so, I will take Shannon's advice and start my next dinner at Harbour City with dessert. There is a vegetarian lasagna on the menu but other then salads and seafood, I'm not sure if there's much non-meaty options. A nice wine list with a good variety of Nova Scotia wines and I found out after our visit that they don't charge corkage on BYO Nova Scotia wines any evening.I'm just loving the current trend of local sourcing, it seems to be bringing out some wonderfully creative and tasty dishes around the city!
<review# 731,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2012,9/15/2012,12,78,3,5,3>Dave's Fruit and Vegetable Market is a great place for your need of veggies and fruits, as well as a few other groceries like frozen pies, milk, and sandwich meat.I often come here only for my vegetables because they are a lot cheaper than at Sobeys and such, and they are always fresh. It's a fairly small place so during busy times it can get crowded, and the parking lot is a bit cramped but it's worth it for the prices. Near the cash register is a good selection of baked goods from oatcakes, cookies, and muffins to turnovers, huge cinnamon rolls, and danishes.All in all if you love your F's and V's, and are in around the Dartmouth area you should definitely check Dave's out if you haven't and get some.
<review# 732,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2012,9/14/2012,11,41,3,6,3>Wow I can't believe I haven't gone here until last night, this place is fabulous!I have avoided Jamieson's because I figured it was your typical bar food which I don't really enjoy, and I haven't been able to tolerate greasy food well lately so I wrote the place off. Until a friend suggested it and I glanced at the menu - wow! Great selection. Six of us planned to go on a Friday night and we had a great time.The decor is lovely, so rustic and unique, definitely not what you expect for a strip mall restaurant, even the bathrooms stay in character. Our server set up our table but encouraged us to hang out on the couches - aka "Nan's living room", as I would call it - as long as we wished, but we were eager to try the food and have a bevvie on this warm day. Appetizers were great, two of us ordered the potato skins with apple curry dip (SO GOOD) and another had a salad. Our meals were great as well and ranged from steak to fish cakes to pasta, and everyone loved it! The fries were very tasty and my pasta dish (chicken and mushroom) was literally so good, a little heavy but still super tasty. A few of us had dessert as well and I couldn't finish my main OR dessert but our waitress packed both up for me which I really appreciated, most places don't offer to pack up dessert. We will definitely go back, our bill came to around $100 but with a few pints and a dessert scotch, that was understandable. Husband couldn't resist their great drink selection ;)
<review# 733,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2012,9/13/2012,4,11,2,3,2>This was a girls night out adventure! Emily our guide was great, well versed and really knowledgeable about Halifax and the food hot spots.  There was something for everyone, we started with the best fish in chips I have had, and ended with Belgium chocolate to die for! But along the way we discovered hidden gems in  Halifax.  Haliburton house "Stories" can't wait to go back, and I was so impressed with Elements, this is not your standard hotel restaurant people! They not only support local businesses buy using local food within a 50 mile radius but it tastes great too! How can I forget to mention the beer! The sweet beer! Garrisons brewery, wow! This was a first for me, but definitely not a last.  I sampled the raspberry wheat beer...yummy.  I can't' wait to go back and work my way through the rest of the selections.  $40, well worth it, I promise you will not be disappointed. .  This is a fresh idea if your looking for something new to try, highly recommend this tour.
<review# 734,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2012,9/12/2012,71,45,2,5,3>After hearing musings about the seafood at What's the Scoop I admit, curiosity got the better of me. After all, how could an "ice cream place" possibly also know their stuff about entrees as well?Well on my recent visit I was converted. I am actually going to go out on a limb and say that I think I might prefer the fish here to the fish at Wharf Wraps across the street and that's saying something!We decided to go back and sample "anything but ice cream" this time and boy were we pleasantly surprised. I had heard nothing but rave reviews of the lobster roll so that's what I ordered. Hubby ordered the 2 piece fish and chips and we got the chicken nugget combo for the boys. I also ordered fries to go with my lobster roll. The lobster roll was awesome. Served in a soft and hot dog bun (the ones that come in a package of 12, not a package of 8 - you know the ones I mean...) it was overflowing with lobster. The flavour was mouthwatering and the only negative I can think of was that I like the addition of celery to my lobster sandwich. But, the huge positive is that it was a mere $7.00 (taxes included!). SEVEN dollars for a lobster sandwich. Amazing. The fries were homecut (I'm one of those rare people who prefer frozen) but they served the purpose and were adequate ketchup conveyors for our little boys. Their nuggets were sadly of the mystery-meat variety but you win some, you lose some. The big surprise was the fish and chips which I've already alluded to as being the surprise hit of the visit. Two generous pieces (the two together make up the same size as the one piece at Wharf Wraps) were cooked to perfection with light batter and the inside boasted white flaky succulent haddock. And the kicker? Only $10.00 (taxes included) which is four dollars cheaper than the competition. While you give up the ambiance and table service of Wharf Wraps if you're looking for a quick take out option that is still delicious with a quick turn around What's the Scoop is the way to go. We'll definitely be back.A side note: all prices include tax but they are CASH ONLY so be sure to stop at a banking machine before getting in line :-)
<review# 735,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2012,9/11/2012,7,14,3,2,2>I am a huge fan of I Heart Bikes - not only is it adorable and trendy (VERY important, obviously), but it's eco-friendly, wallet-friendly and just plain friendly-friendly. If you're bored one afternoon and find yourself on the boardwalk in downtown Halifax, just give it a try. I dare you to come back and tell me it super-sucks. I'm definitely not what ANYONE would consider "a bike person" - my knowledge of bikes doesn't extend past the handlebars - but I can definitely appreciate those who ride them daily. You can do guided tours, which look and sound pretty neat, but I just rented a bike for two hours and drove around at my leisure. I felt super cool.Rates at I Heart Bikes are totally reasonable: $9/hour, $15/two hours etc. (One piece of very serious advice: avoid the tandem bike. They look adorable and easy to ride, but you've been warned: they are Satan.) They have child "chariots" and pet baskets, the staff are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly, and you can get in some exercise to boot! I'm fairly certain they stay open throughout the Fall as well - check them out!They also sell super trendy bicycle helmets which completely jives with my hipster sensibilities. I think I may need to become a bike person.
<review# 736,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2012,9/10/2012,70,95,4,7,6>Myth: Only Old men go to the barbershop.Fact: I am not an old man. I'm not even a man. You and I don't really know each other (or maybe we do so this next part won't really mean much to you because you'll probably already know what I'm about to write) but here's a little confession: I'm extremely vain about my hair. Shocking I know.Long story short I lost a lot of weight and when you go from being as big as I was to being as small as I am some things become very (very) important to you. For me it is my hair. Cut short. Real short. I like looking like a boy. Nuff said. I've been here in Halifax since November after leaving my home town of Tacoma (WA) and I left behind my most beloved hair stylist. Since then I've been on the search for a place to get the locks looked after. Tried one place. It was okay for a while but they kept wanting to grow my hair out (what part of I like looking like a boy didn't they understand?).Tried another and while I loved the cut I received it was a hardship on my wallet (and by my wallet I mean my wife's). Then I hear about Saint Lou's. A little more than nervous (because how many women go to the barber?), I walked into this little one-chair barbershop located in the Historical properties and met Rob.Rob is the owner / operator / kick ass barber that is Saint Lou's. I could go on and on and on (and on) about the awesome experience I had hanging out with him as he buzzed and snipped my hair into perfection (and when I say perfection I mean "holy crap I look goooooood" perfection) but let me just bullet point my way through this review:* He'll offer you a beer while you're sitting in his chair. If you don't drink beer or came with coffee from TIBS in hand he'll give ya a card for a free coffee at another time.* He'll be the nicest guy you'll have talked too in a long time. I felt like I wanted to invite him over for dinner after I got out of the chair. * He knows his stuff when it comes to making you look sharp. Seriously sharp.* He won't break your wallet. At $27 you're gonna wish your hair would grow back quicker so you can go back and see him again (and again). You should come prepared to pay cash however (and leave a nice tip cause he's well worth it) or run to the ATM before hand (and from the word on the street the one in the building doesn't work most of the time)* There aren't appointments to be had here at Saint Lou's. You go, you wait a little bit if there is someone in front of you and then when it's you're turn you get in the chair! Lunch break on a Wednesday afternoon? Why not pop in and see if Rob can tidy you up around the ears.Rob did a good thing by opening up Saint Lou's.Get over there and get cleaned up will ya!
<review# 737,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2012,9/9/2012,20,226,4,4,3>I know this place has received many five-star reviews, but it wasn't until I read Laura H.'s rave that I finally caved and agreed to vist Mic Mac.  Mike has always said this place was great but I was wary. What can I say?  I let outward appearances sway me.The exterior ain't nothing to look at. Inside is a bit dim with dark wooden tables and chairs.  It's a pretty big place with not a lot of room between the tables.  It was more crowded than I expected for 1:30 on a beautiful Saturday afternoon but we found a good spot.  Service was prompt and friendly. We both opted for the 7 oz. bacon-wrapped tenderloin; I had baked potato and Mike had fries.  I also opted for the sauteed mushrooms.  Not a long wait, and our steaks were done to a T.  The spice rub they use was very tasty but not overpowering; you could taste the quality of the meat.  Everything was great.What I really want to rave about is dessert.  We both had the homemade Oreo cookie ice cream cake.  OH EMM GEE. It was fabulous. I wanted to marry that cake.  I couldn't stop going "mmm mmm MMM" as I ate.  Creamy, crunchy, delicious with a graham cracker crust.  It was heaven.  Prices are very reasonable and I left an extra-big tip 'cause our entire experience was great.  I can't wait to try everything on the menu!
<review# 738,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2012,9/8/2012,40,216,3,4,3>Being a long time resident of the south end, my review of Boneheads has been a long in coming. Well, if the couple years that Boneheads has been open counts as a long time, which for the purposes of my review, it does.I've come here several times over the years, often for lunch with my dad while he's in town, and after sampling many dishes here and at their main competitor in the city, I feel like I've got a pretty good feel for Halifax BBQ. On this particular visit I was introducing my girlfriend to Boneheads as she is a big fan of pulled pork sammies and I had to have her try out Boneheads' delicious one. I went for the Two Meat BBQ Plate so that I could sample a good chunk of the menu in the most economical manner. And I was hungry as %$&!. I chose the southside links and brisket as my meats, with the sweet potato chips, and mac and cheese as my sides, as well as a wee little loaf of cornbread. Out of the proteins, the sausage was by far the better. With a nice pork flavour, hint of smoke from the noticeable pink smoke ring and a bit of sweet and tangy sauce on the outside, it was a tube steak of win. The brisket unfortunately fell a little flat in its execution. While it had a nice flavour and smoke ring, it was sliced too thinly and mostly fell apart into tiny little meat granules, which was a little awkward to eat, and I'm not sure if it was the slicing or overcooking, but it was a little drier than how I like my brisket.The sweet potato chips were a side I hadn't yet tried at Boneheads and am I ever glad I did, as they are probably the best option out of all the choices - crispy yet retaining that great sweet potato flavour, along with a dip that tasted like a homemade French onion dip, these chips are something you have to try. And since they're made from sweet potatoes they're better for you or something, right? The mac and cheese didn't seem to be having a good day, and I've found that it can be pretty inconsistent at any of the BBQ places in the city. While very cheesy and creamier than their downtown rivals', the sauce had a grainy mouthfeel that was somewhat off-putting. And lastly for my plate, the cornbread; this seems to be  Boneheads' yellow downfall. With individual mini loaves, you get a good amount of it, but as it has more surface area exposed to the pan than a slice off a larger loaf, I always find that the cornbread here is a bit dry and the crust of the bread being almost tough. My lovely companion was a big fan of her large pulled pork sandwich, which had an appropriately more smoky flavour than other versions that she's had elsewhere. With a big pile of crispy fries, it was a delicious, albeit heavy, supper.This all being said, I do thoroughly enjoy Boneheads. It's a cozy place, on a corner with some other great restos (Vinnie's, Laura's). Like many a restaurant it has its strong points and its weaker ones, you just have to know what to get so that you can maximize the pleasure for your taste buds.
<review# 739,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/21/2012,9/7/2012,12,153,2,5,2>Until just a few days ago I had no idea this place existed.  I wonder how many more Hamachi restaurants one city needs?They've only been open for about 3 months.  I suspect them being new, a bit off the beaten path (or on a newly beaten path?) and no one knowing their there is contributing to their lack of being busy.  The night we were there certainly was not buys.  There were a few other tables but the dining room was far from full. Now, i will start by saying I personally find the Hamachi name to be overrated.  I don't find their sushi to be of better quality than other places, however I find their price tags to be larger; which makes me think we're paying a bit extra to say we ate Hamachi sushi. Now, I digress...Myself and my dining partners decided on the order a ton of stuff and all share it approach.   We ended up with a huge plate of different rolls to share.  They were all delicious and well presented.  The Hottie was one I particularly enjoyed.  Holy Dynamite was also tasty.  Heck, they all were.  Consensus was the lobster roll was just OK.  The lobster tasted like it was from a can; it certainly didn't taste fresh.  We also ordered a plate of the Thai Pineapple Fried Rice which was delish!After making our way through the mass of sushi and the rice we decided we weren't quite finished.  The decision was made to order a few more items:  we went with the spring rolls and mussels.  Both were tasty.  Be warned the mussels pack a bit of a heat punch!The service was good.  You can tell they're new and are trying to work out the kinks as she kept coming back to check on us to make sure everything was OK.  She was friendly, upbeat and pleasant.  Overall, not a bad first experience.  The food is good, albeit a tad pricey (we split the bill 3 ways, minus drinks, and my share came to just over $50, which in my books is a tad spendy for dinner for one person. I'm not entirely certain I ate my money's worth), and the service is friendly.  If you're in the neighbourhood they're worth a visit.

<review# 741,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2012,9/5/2012,65,55,4,5,3>I was surprised to find a 20 minute line-up at the Wasabi House on a Thursday evening but was also a tiny bit happy. You see, I don't treat myself to sushi too too often so I was a bit hesitant to stray away from my go-to sushi spots in the city. The Wasabi House has happily been added to said list!To start off, the atmosphere was super fun and inviting. It's a small space so the crowd provided a great energy to the dinning room without feeling over crowded. Our server was fantastic - throughout the whole meal he was cracking jokes and making great recommendations while also being very attentive.Although I'm usually not a fan, my dinner guest and I ended up splitting a combo. It provided us with our choice of a soup or salad, 3 maki rolls and 1 specialty roll. I'm not usually a combo fan because I find them limiting in variety but the menu had a few varieties to choose from. Another plus to combos are the prices - for about $20 (including tax and tip), I basically rolled out of the restaurant chocked full of sushi. That's my kind of way to end a day!!
<review# 742,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2012,9/4/2012,28,24,,6,6>If you are searching for a killer Mac n' Cheese, search no more ! The foggy Goggel is a fryer free restaurant( this makes me incredibly happy). Their specialty is comfort food, and they are superb at it. The lobster Mac n' Cheese is amazing! Tons of cheese , generouse portions of lobster and super creamy..yum! I strongly recommend if you order this to pace yourself. This dish is super rich and filling.  The atmosphere is coszy and inviting, with lots of big comfy chairs. Plus they have on hand a stock piel of classic board games for customers use. I adore this resturant and would recomend it to anyone !
<review# 743,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2012,9/3/2012,33,173,3,6,3>Nothing smells better than a smokehouse.  As long as I've lived here, there's been a smoke house on that lot, and the smell of it always makes me think that I'm close to home.I stopped in here to get a pork loin for some pulled pork sandwiches.  It was the best batch of pulled pork sandwiches I've ever made, and I attribute it to the quality of the meat.  Service was excellent.  They didn't have what I needed in the fridge, so they had the butcher carve me what I needed.  I didn't mind the 5-minute wait, because I got to breathe in the smoky smell for that much longer.They have wonderful pepperoni, delicious beef jerky, all kinds of meats, and some basic food accessories, like condiments, packaged sides, breads and a select variety of dairy products.  It's great if you're stopping in to get your fresh meat for dinner and need a couple of items to make your meal pop.They also have a big cart of dried bones and pig ears, perfect for your doggy to snack on, so really, the whole family can profit from a visit to The 2 Boys.
<review# 744,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/13/2012,9/1/2012,3,31,2,2,2>We stopped in for a Sunday lunch after a long wander down the boardwalk.  Based on our lunch experience, my husband an I are planning a trip sans kidlet in the near future.With no kids' menu, I ordered the bigger burger with a side Cesar to share with my son and my husband ordered the H&T sausage sandwich with fries.First, the burger.  Can I just say that whoever decided to put a sausage on top of a burger is a genius.  And Havarti, not cheddar.  This burger was fantastic.  It was juicy and cooked to perfection.  The side Cesar was also very good.  My son is a big fan of Cesar salad and he said it was "really, really yummy" which is high praise from a four year old.  They make their own dressing which is more sweet than garlicky but very tasty.  The sausage my husband ordered had a wonderful smoky flavour.  There was no honey mustard present as advertised, but he declared that the sausage didn't need it.  The sausage was so big and the bun so loaded with sauerkraut that he opted to eat it with a knife and fork.  The fries were crispy, well salted, and hot.  Based solely on this one experience we were very happy and plan to go again soon.
<review# 745,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/19/2012,8/31/2012,18,60,2,3,3>I have to agree with a post below, Resolute's reminds me of Moe's Tavern (Simpsons). We went here for St. Patrick's day as 1) I knew someone who was playing in the band for the early afternoon, and 2) it's across the street from my apartment. I'd never been before and when I walked in I was a little surprised. It's a little dark (adding to the Simpson-esque appeal), but it's much bigger. We showed up at 3:15pm and grabbed the last table (so it was pretty busy). There was a mix in age groups. From over 60 to mid-twenties. It really made for a diverse, and hilarious evening. Beers were 3.75 and doubles (liquor) 9.00$, so the prices were quite reasonable. My friend had a hamburger, fries and a beer for under 10$. Food was decent (nothing fancy, but edible!). Had a great time, and would definitely go back for another St. Patrick's day. Not quite sure what it'd be like on the average Friday/Saturday. I assume sporting events are quite busy as well.
<review# 746,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/13/2012,8/30/2012,59,150,2,4,3>I did not know the Red Stag had a rooftop patio! Actually... I didn't even know where the Red Stag was until I went there with a friend. I knew it by name only; so, for those of you who aren't sure where it is located, and are too lazy to read the address above - it is in the historical farmers market... or Alexander Keith's brewery!It seems like it is a big place, but it really isn't. We first made our way to the rooftop, which had lots of tables and a bar! But, it was far too windy, and we're girls... with long hair... ya, it just didn't work out in our favor. So, we went back downstairs and all of the tables were taken. We sat at the bar; the bartender was awesome though, so it wasn't that bad. And, the guys sitting next to us bought us all a shot - so that was also awesome!Two of us ordered the fish and chips; it came with a chipotle tartar sauce. YUM! I have no complaints, it was tasty all around. My other friend ordered the seafood chowder, which looked and smelled so, so good and was a pretty decent size. I will definitely return! All of the staff that we encountered were all so nice, the restaurant has great character and the food was delicious! The menu is fairly large and the prices are all pretty decent! I can't wait for a not windy day to enjoy the rooftop!
<review# 747,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2012,8/29/2012,17,52,2,4,4>Wow, I am not a sweets fan, but I have been converted all thanks to Sweet Hereafter.My first experience was a few weeks ago when after work, a coworker and I went to use up a Groupon that she had purchased being it the last day that she could use it. We both got a slice of the most amazing, mouthwatering cheesecake I have ever had in my life and a cup of coffee. The server was friendly and dependable and checked in on us during our visit, the coffee was unexpectedly good, and did I mention it was the best cheesecake I have ever had in my life?My second chance to indulge in this treat was at the Yelp's First Burstday where there was a table with tasting portions laid out for us to try. When I walked in to see the food tables, I gravitated straight to the cheesecake and didn't want to leave.... my boyfriend actually had to pull me away. I'm still having dreams of it and now that I've been yelping about it, I'm going to have to make a plan to revisit this spot again very, VERY soon.
<review# 748,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2012,8/28/2012,76,115,3,3,2>I have found my late night alternative to Pizza Corner (I'm not knocking PC, ok, but hey it's just a corner with a pizza place on each block - not really anything special people). The boy and I popped in here recently after a gig at the Seahorse Tavern. I'm a huge fan of Mexican food and was craving something a tad fattening and greasy (I mean, come on, it's still late night downtown), but I also wanted lots of flavour and freshness. The employees here are FAST! They toss the fillings in those pockets like pros. And I mean FILLINGS - they have tons of options, including several different kinds of salsa and sauces, lots of different veggies, etc. And they FILL them alright. I had a small and that was plenty of food for me - I don't think there is any way I could finish a large, honestly. I really enjoyed the cranberry salsa and guac (God, I love guac). I like that they have non-spicy and mildly spicy sauce and topping options for those of us that can't handle a ton of heat. The burritos do take a few mins to grill once everything is thrown in there but if you can be patient, it's totally worth the wait bc it comes out all warm and gooey with a slightly crispy tortilla. The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was that they have literally no seating inside so you are forced to either eat standing up or trudge back to your car. Not a huge deal, though - just don't go here if you want somewhere to SIT and have a meal. This is grab-and-go all day long, baby. Plus, if you go for a late night snack jones, you may have entertainingly drunk people make conversation with you and that's (usually) fun :) Next time I go for a night on the town, screw you, pizza - I'm grabbing a Burrito (Jax).
<review# 749,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2012,8/27/2012,40,5,12,4,2>It's funny, I never thought I would leave my husband for a sandwich, but there you have it. Surprising, but I'm finding life with my delicious steak sandwich from The Bicycle Thief satisfying and passionate. We have nice cuddles and watch American Idol together. The affair started innocently enough over lunch with friends. Typically, when ordering food I either go for pasta or sushi. This is not a funny joke. I either eat pasta at any restaurant or sushi at a sushi restaurant. Interesting, I am not. Someone suggested the steak sandwich and since I'd had a glass (ok, two) of prosecco, I decided to be a Wild One (just like in Flo Rida's new song! Check it!). People of Halifax and visitors from afar: THE STEAK MELTS IN YOUR EVER-LOVING-MOUTH. I'm not kidding. I didn't bite it just to see! It was the most scrumptious, delightful sandwich I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my face. The fries (or frites?) were also lovely, but the sandwich totally trumped the plate. It was like bringing Leo DiCaprio and Channing Tatum to lunch. You appreciate Channing, but you can't get past Leo. Get it? Leo=steak, Channing=french fries...no? The service was fantastic, atmosphere delightful - despite being a very busy Friday lunch. Thanks to my designated driver from the group for allowing me the opportunity to engage in alcoholic beverages at 12:30pm on a Friday. This is a must-visit restaurant.
<review# 750,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/15/2012,8/26/2012,13,213,,3,3>I started my education at MSVU in 2007. I am taking a part time business administration certificate program which is simply 6 full units or 12 courses of prescribed university study. I work full time and MSVU fits in my schedule nicely offering night class. I have never had to take one on-line course and I am on my last class this Sept. MSVU does PLAR as well so I got a credit for 1/2 unit of study for a combo of life experience and past work and education which was mostly professional cooking. I also love the campus, nice grounds and small class size. I still talk to one of my professors Joel as I see him around from time to time. Really glad to have had the university experience and MSVU was the place to do it.
<review# 751,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/31/2012,8/25/2012,42,100,6,9,5>Menz Bar might get a bad rap because of the reputation it might have based on the normal clientele and the part of town it's located in. Those are both issues separate from this review but all I'll say is that despite all the negative you *might* have heard, it's a great place to go.Having only been a few times myself, it surprises me each time the variety of people that do come here despite what people say. There are women. There are young people. The music is great! And the people are exceptionally friendly. I feel like Menz Bar caters more to being inclusive rather than trying to make a quick buck.Other than the typical weekend dancing nights they have, they also have many special events, whether cover is required or not depends on the event and the purpose which can occasionally be something community related, which is great!Maybe the worst thing that can happen to this bar is that everyone realizes the truth about it because then it can no longer be a well kept secret held only by those that are willing to come and find out for themselves.
<review# 752,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2012,8/24/2012,13,104,3,8,6>I've been working in Bedford for 5 years and have never tried the craze that is Finbar's. Today was a particularly spectacular day for me, so I decided to treat myself. As soon as I entered 2 waitresses promptly greeted me with warm smiles - It was love at first sight. I chose to sit outside as it was a pretty great day. I order my drink and wait for the succulent salmon that's supposedly heavenly.My food came up very quickly - like 15 minutes quick. It was a salmon penne in a creamy dill sauce - I'll leave it to you to see if that's a good or bad thing. What is a good thing however is how delicious it was - hot pasta, succulent salmon and the sauce just has enough dill not to overpower the salmon & veggies. Great job chef.I would give it 4 stars, but to be honest, the staff was probably one of the best set that I've ever dealt with. They were so friendly and attentive - but upheld their professionalism. That's what gives them 5 stars. I was leaving with a smile ear to ear.
<review# 753,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2012,8/23/2012,37,121,2,6,5>As many Haligonians, I've often found myself driving by Robie Food, looking to see if anyone was inside ad wondering "how is this place still standing?!?"Always curious, once in a while I'd ask some friends " Have you ever eaten at Robie Food?" and always the same no answer... Until last week, when a friend told me they had the best Singapore Noodles... I like noodles I told myself....As I was driving back from Dartmouth feeling a slight hunger I decided to finally take the plunge and try this place out...So I called in my order, Singapore Noodles! Misinterpreting the thick accent saying 20 minutes, I start giving my phone number... Then realize she's saying 20 minutes, not phone number :) Good sign!Now, if most of you are like me and have driven past here before... Well, the exterior  of the building pretty much gives you a preview of the inside. This re-defines "nothing fancy"! As I walk in, I see the cooks in the back working away at my dish. Already it smells fantastic. I grab my order and head home. It took all my might not to start eating as I drove as the smell filled the car!This was truly the best Singapore noodle dish I have had in this city. Sprouts, carrots, celery, onion, mushroom, baby shrimp, BBQ pork, fried egg and the perfect balance of curry, heat and sweetness! WOW!I'll definitely be going back again to try some of their other dishes. Especially the BBQ pork spring rolls.  Tbc...
<review# 754,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2012,8/22/2012,27,83,2,4,3>All I can say is it has a great service. The staff were friendly and very polite. They explained my car problem in detail as well. Went back twice and it was the same the 2nd time. It also has a cosy waiting area with wifi connection, tv and wii console. And if you had to use the bathroom, you'll be led to this room which is sort of a man cave (mini bar, pool table, etc)... Only setback is the location which is rather far for those who live in the downtown area like me, but for the price they offer, sometimes it may be worthwhile to go the distance. I've read on their facebook fan page that there is a restaurant tthat's open next door. So if you do get bored fromwaiting, you could just sneak in over to grab a bite or two.

<review# 756,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2012,8/20/2012,55,223,,5,3>Finally a good cafe for us Cole Harbour/Dartmouth folks.  It's a refreshing change from the chain cafes that seem to be popping up in every strip mall these days.Best thing... they are very local focused.  Local baked goods from various bakeries around town along with their made in house soups and sandwiches.Another thing to note, they now roast their own beans that you can buy by the bag.Plenty of parking, plenty of indoor seating, and a couple lovely arm chairs in the back corner to chill and enjoy your bevvy.
<review# 757,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2012,8/19/2012,8,168,2,2,3>When I first found this place I thought I had died and gone to sugar heaven.  I have been here at least 10-15 times now and find myself trying to trick my brain into not allowing my legs to take me up Dresden each time I find myself on Spring Garden.  There's some sort of gravitational pull for this place I swear.  The cupcake flavours change daily, with red velvet seeming to be a crowd favourite.  I personally tend to opt for a classic version of simply white or chocolate.  I am also a huge fan of the cake balls coated in chocolate....birthday cake is my personal fave.  The shortbread cookies melt in your mouth too.  I do find the icing on the cupcakes is almost a little too much to take and I think I have narrowly missed a sugar induced coma on more than one occasion.  It's not what I would call cheap either. That being said, Susie's is always one of my favourite stopping places on a Sunday afternoon stroll in Halifax.
<review# 758,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2012,8/18/2012,21,55,3,3,2>I was starting to think this place didn't exist, instead was just fantastic graffiti! For the past 4 months we've struggled to get dinner reservations, so one afternoon we were off and POPPED in for lunch! Success!I was so excited I could hardly sit still-- I was about to taste their ever so raved about Pad Thai! It comes out in a huge bowl and yup, filled to the brim! It has real chuncks of nuts, a kick to it (though, I will ask for much more spice next time), and much to my surprise it is home to some very baby shrimp. The wife lived on the edge and ordered the F.. burger. Unique to Fid they grind their own meat, big deal you say? Well, you can then order your meat to your taste. Medium rare hamburg is a no-no most everywhere as they are never really sure how the meat is ground or what preservatives have been mixed in, however Fid knows the deets.. so you can. This means a flavour filled.. juicy burger. Good job, Fid. The 'ingredients' to their dishes aren't outlined on their menu so I wasn't prepared for the baby shrimps, but it was a welcomed surprise. So if you're not into the seafood make a note to say no-no on the eenie weenie's! Definite hidden gem in the city. I can't wait to hit up dinner... mostly because they have churro's on their dessert menu.. eya mama!

I've had one very bad experience, but I'm certain it was a one-off), good prices, and a wonderful atmosphere. I'm a sucker for dimmed lights and conversation.The location really couldn't be better, too. Close to everything, standing out as a little gem on a fairly drab part of Barrington.

Cool place... I like it here.

We arrived (15 of us in HOT pink shirts) early, around 11, and were pleasantly surprised that while it wasn't super busy there were still a good amount of people there. Drinks were very reasonably priced ($3!!) and the bartenders were great! They were friendly, had some great suggestions and got to you very quickly. There are a bunch of bars, and several private areas, around the club and even a good amount of seating. We had most of the dance floor to ourselves for the first hour or two. After that it gout quite busy and we found the floor was a little too small for the amount of people that were trying to dance but none the less it was a great time. Fun atmosphere, great bartenders, fantastic music! Not somewhere I'd end up every weekend but a great venue to celebrate!
<review# 762,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2012,8/14/2012,43,449,3,2,2>I'd never heard of a Korean taco, but on a recommendation of a friend, the combination of two things I like separately sounded good enough to try together, and I was blown away by how awesome these are. I basically want to find excuses to eat them all the time, and in less than two weeks since my introduction, I've already been back twice. (And I have zero shame in admitting that.)  Yes, I'm forming an addiction. Yes, I'm 100% okay with that. So what is a Korean taco? Think of it like a soft shell Mexican taco exterior with Korean add-ins and Asian spices. And, what I didn't realize until the end of my initial visit is that they offer a Gluten-Free rice wrapper, so you can opt for a GF taco! Instantly my new favourite food just became belly-friendly, and that's a major plus. Pro tip: The GF wrappers are slightly bigger than the regular ones, so if you're feeling like more than one regular taco, and don't want to deal with two messy wrappers, go with the heftier GF option. It's the same price as two tacos, and it's just as tasty and satisfying.Now, this review shouldn't just be about the tacos - I mean, they do offer more than than just tacos. This past week I opted to place a delivery order for a work lunch, and the tacos + pho combo was fantastic. Delivery worked out well and the pho was hot and came with all the add-ins (sprouts, sauces) packaged separately so each person could customize their bowl. It was an awesome alternative for lunch and everyone enjoyed it. If you haven't taken notice of this spot on South Park yet, make sure you soon do. It's got the feel of a subway counter that's been classed up a notch or two and won't leave you with the stench of the submarine sandwich. Plus, the food is ah-maz-ing!
<review# 763,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/12/2012,8/13/2012,25,107,4,5,3>So this weekend I fell in love. With my massage therapist's hands.Wowza.After a long and stressful week, on a whim, I decided to book a massage. Not really knowing where to go, I turned to the Google. Be. Massage popped up as well as their accolade as being voted Best Massage Therapy Clinic from the Coast. Add to the fact that they're located literally a 5min walk from my front door and it was a match made in massage heaven.They have a handy feature where you can email to request an appointment which really sealed the deal for somebody who hates the phone as much as I do.Email response was lighting quick and they had quite a few open appointments which fit well with my schedule.And the massage. Oh the massage. They're #1 for a reason. Professional, knowledgeable staff made me feel at ease. Bonus points for Wilco being on the playlist when I first walked in to the massage room.  The playlist included some other great tunes which was beyond appreciated compared to the standard new age/ nature sounds crap that typically gets played.The only thing I wasn't completely down with was the physical location (hence the 4 star, not 5 rating). Be. Massage is located smack in the middle of the lobby at the YMCA. This means that on a Saturday morning, there were approximately 284587468 children running around screaming. While I get that the YMCA is all about families and blah blah blah, it was a little disruptive to my soft rock, massage love that was unfolding.That being said, I left feeling like I was about 3 inches taller and about 300lbs lighter. Seriously, I had the dopiest grin on my face afterward. The massage was that amazing. I will definitely be back.

Well... I'm glad that oversight has been resolved, because Choco Cafe is a wonderful little spot. True to its name, the store is half candy/chocolate shop (which is a-ok with me) and half coffee shop. Upon entry we were immediately greeted and offered several samples of their tasty wares. White chocolate-covered mango? Milk chocolate wafer? Chocolate-covered cheesecake bite? Um... yes to all of the above. They have a great selection of pre-packaged items which I think would make great Mother's Day and Grad Gifts, and the service is certainly top-notch as every employee in the store said hello to us and asked if there was anything they could do to help. I'm very happy I finally went in.

I finally stopped in for brunch one morning and was really pleased with my experience. I'm not a big brunch person, I love brunch food but I'm not a morning person and I don't want to wait in line to be surrounded by hoards of people for my first meal of the day. That being said Epicurious was a great brunch choice! It was busy but not overly so, with no wait and I loved the small intimate dining room, it reminded me of some cozy bistros in Paris. I also enjoy that they offer both the more breakfasty brunch menu as well as their full lunch menu on weekends. While checking out the menu, I discovered that a lot of the lunch dishes sound like they are right up my alley. I ordered the mimosa after reading another review recommending it, and it was a great choice. For $9 you get a flute 3/4 filled with orange juice, a small container with extra orange juice and a full 200 ml bottle of sparkling wine so you can customize your mimosa, how awesome is that?I had the waffles with cream and berries as my main and it was delightful. For bunch my friend and I split the Boca Negra, a super dense (I'm guessing flourless) chocolate cake which was also excellent. The service was great, the food was delightful and the menu made me want to pop in and try lunch or dinner sometime soon. I'll be back!
<review# 766,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2012,8/10/2012,54,227,3,7,3>I'll confess: I want to love cooking, but often I don't. Sometimes you get home from work, and you don't have any groceries, and you don't want to cook. Takeout? Sure, but it'll break the bank and it's rarely healthy. And then I met Jane's Next Door. Frozen, delicious, locally made food! You can eat it and not feel like the salt content took six years off your life. As we speak, I'm eating leftover buttercup squash rice noodle lasagna. It's amazing. Packed with veggies and all I had to do was pop it into the oven for 40 minutes when I got home last night. One serving had under 100 calories, and was absolutely delectable with a quick salad I whipped up and a fresh roll. It can seem pricy - most stuff is around $16, and I paid $19 for the lasagna. But it fed myself and my fiancee for dinner last night plus our lunches today. That's under $5 a meal, y'all. I will definitely be returning to try something new. Can't wait to return to try out their breakfast treats!
<review# 767,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2012,8/9/2012,12,118,,4,4>I have loved this place since it opened as my best friend's mother works here and my best friend had worked there during junior high and high school. I have never had anything bad here! Fries with the works, scallops, fish and chips, haddock tips, burgers, everything is fantastic and home-made (fresh cut fries, hand battered fish, and I believe the tartar sauce is made fresh as well, etc). As much as I love John's Lunch, I would prefer Classic any day. John's may be cheaper, but Classic's quality and taste is better overall. If you have not been here before and are in the Cole Harbour area, give it a try! :)
<review# 768,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2012,8/8/2012,5,27,3,5,3>I have been a huge fan of Wildflower since it opened.  While I do often prefer to keep my shopping gems under wraps (in a city like Halifax, everyone often has the same things to wear), I do feel I should spread the word about Jill and her wonderful store.Jill's dog is often in the store.  He is a golden doodle (I think), so he is not small.  He is absolutely adorable and sweet, but if you're afraid of big dogs, just be on the lookout for this greeter.The lines carried in the store are of high quality, and several are Canadian!  Great fabrics and colours are a guarantee, as well as a good selection of Paige and Felicity premium denims.  The store also doesn't carry a lot of each piece, so you don't run a big risk of seeing your outfit being mirrored at the next table if you're out to eat.  Aside from clothing, you can find scarves, hats, brightly coloured clutches, and jewelry.  There is also a baby section, with gorgeous swaddling blankets, onesies, and various other items that any stylin' baby could need.The prices are moderate to higher end for Halifax.  Definitely worth a small detour off the main Spring Garden drag.  Now that I've let you all in on my secret.... don't steal my size!!  ;)
<review# 769,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2012,8/7/2012,51,65,2,10,6>After loving the heck out of my meal at the original location in St. John's recently, I knew that I would have to make the trek to the brand spanking new location at the corner of Morris and Hollis. And yeah, the ensuing foodbaby and dent in my wallet were totally worth it. Let's actually get the price thing out of the way, because this place is definitely pricey. Mike B. and I each ordered a pizza, split an appetizer and each had soft drinks. The total with tip was $70. I didn't take off a star for these prices, because I really do love the food... but it will keep me from visiting the restaurant all too often. (Which is probably a good thing.)As for the food... let me just describe the aforementioned appetizer: balls of mozzarella, wrapped in prosciutto and baked in tomato sauce. So good! I ordered a white pizza for my main (a base of olive oil, instead of tomato sauce). It was fantastic. I just love how ooey-gooey the cheese on these pizzas is. Yum. Service was great, particularly for a pretty new restaurant. And they have super fancy debit machines. It gave me a big smile at the end. Woah. Of course, the big question is: can both Morris East and Piatto survive within a block of each other. My answer is an absolute yes. The two restaurants are doing very different things. Piatto is more of an amped up Italian pizza place executed very, very well. Morris East is more of a chef-inspired, innovative restaurant. I can't really compare the two beyond that, because they operate on such different levels. (Though I will say that I automatically feel like Morris East is more affordable, but that might just be because I haven't been there in a while, while the sting of the Piatto bill is still pretty fresh.)So the obvious choice is to just love both and support them equally!
<review# 770,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2012,8/6/2012,66,321,3,3,3>If you're not from Halifax, you may not know exactly what Grand Parade Square is, so I'm going to help you out.Let's start with the name: you'll it referred to as Grand Parade, Parade Square and the longer Grand Parade Square. Technically, "Grand Parade" is the right title but all three are used with equal measure. Location: right in the heart of downtown Halifax, bordered on either end by HRM City Hall and the oldest still-standing Anglican church in Canada (St. Paul's). Along the length, it faces the Province House (one block away but still visible)  and other side both the World Trade and Convention Centre (including Metro Centre) and the largest drinking establishment in Halfiax (The Dome).Contents: Grand Parade hosts two memorials at opposite sides of its "square;" one is the Cenotaph which honours those who served First World War, the Second World War and the Korean Conflict; the other is the Peace Officers Memorial arch, dedicated to fallen peace officers. There is also lots of green space and some pathways.Function: here's where it gets interesting. Things happen here. Lots and lots of things. Not every day but frequently. Halifax's New Year's Eve festivities? Here. Remembrance Day? Here. Official HRM Christmas Tree and Hanukkah Menorah? Here.  Public concerts? Free performances during the Tattoo? Here. Public rallies? Here.My favourite part of Grand Parade is actually lunch time in the summer. Office workers flee their cubicles to enjoy some of the sunlight in Halifax's downtown community space. Whether they grab something from a nearby restaurant, hit up a street vendor or brown bag it, you'll find lots of people here enjoying a beautiful day in the beauty of Grand Parade.
<review# 771,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2012,8/5/2012,28,42,,11,4>So, remember how I loved this place last year when they fixed up my old bike and got it working like new?  Well, my love for The Bike Pedaler hasn't changed but sadly, the love for my poor old bike has.The extensive tune up that was given my bike last year did me proud for last season and although I was told another tune up would suffice again, I thought, "What's the harm in checking out a new bike while I'm here?"I was very pleased with the knowledgeable staff member who helped me look around.  I love to bike but admittedly don't know how to pick the right bike for me and my needs.  When it comes to new bikes, they deal with a Canadian manufacturer called Brodie.  He spent a good deal of time explaining how to choose the right size and what kind of tire would be best for my riding style.  Although the bike I was looking at came with a tire that was more suited to off road, he suggested different tire that was better all around for pavement and light trails like the ones I frequent in Shubie Park.  When asked if swapping out the tires would cost anything, he said it shouldn't be a problem to simply charge me the difference in the price of the two tires.  I was sold.I should have my new bike in a couple weeks and the staff will not only assemble it, they'll also dismantle all of the gear on my current bike and put it on the new one (if I want).  I'm also under no obligation to buy.  I was told they'd let me take it for a day to try it out and make sure it's what I'm looking for.  How great is that?
<review# 772,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/2/2012,8/4/2012,11,51,,6,4>I've been by Darrell's so many times when I lived in Halifax, but never actually went in until the Peanut Butter Pilgrimage.First thing I picked up on was that there was two levels, which was great because the upstairs was pretty busy when I got there.The downstairs has a bit of a sports bar type feel to it, but in a compressed way, meaning it can get crowded fast, but can also make for a good atmosphere for watching the big game.Having been my first time, I felt pretty much obligated to have their legendary peanut butter burger (With the Darrell fries) and a matching PB & Chocolate shake on the suggestion of some others there with us.First thing was the fries, which are absolutely amazing.  It isn't often that you really get the crispy outside, soft inside thing just right; but they nailed it here.Then the shake.  Nice, thick and tons of flavour.  When they serve them up, they even bring you the metal shaker with what was left.  Talk about good to the last drop!Which leaves the centrepiece, the peanut butter burger.  It's been voted best burger in the city a whopping nine years running, and they continue to show why.  Imagine a juicy, delicious burger, you know, the kind everyone loves.  Now, imagine it with just the right amount of delicious, stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth peanut butter, and you've got the Darrell's peanut butter burger.  I never thought it was possible for the flavours to jive together so nicely, but they did, and it was awesome.Definitely a spot you won't want to miss and one of the city's best kept secrets!
<review# 773,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2012,8/2/2012,21,105,,3,2>Two weeks ago, on a gift certificate and recommendation, my husband Ben and I went to Mezza for a nice dinner on a Saturday evening. As we entered, the music was light and calming. The host was pleasant and took our coats while showing us to our seats.  The décor is relatively open, modern and has a nice combination of glass, wood, interesting art and a parquet floor.  We enjoyed a booth for two along the side wall. The only negative was that Ben found it too bright in the restaurant for that time of night.Our appetizers came quite quickly. I am a huge fan of grape leaves. They would make my list of top five favourite foods. I do only like them a bit warm. I know this is strange, but they are so much better. I even convinced Ben to try them warm and he liked them. Cold, neither of us are fans in the least. (A lot like our shared feelings toward cold pizza).  Mezza was kind enough to humour me and warm the grape leaves perfectly. The other appi was part of their prix fixe menu. They were fried folded pastries with beef and other ingredients that looked to me like an empanada. Very good. The Hazelnut Martini was great! Not too sweet, and could easily have disappeared in minutes if you're not careful. My husband has a single malt on the rocks.For mains, I enjoyed their mushroom basil pasta. it was well made, not too rich and reheated well the next day. Ben had the fatouch salad with chicken kabob and roasted potatoes. I gladly stole his perfectly cooked and seasoned potatoes. The salad was fresh. The chicken was cooked perfectly and well flavoured.   We decided to order wine with dinner. My husband asked to try a Lebanese wine but, unfortunately, they were out. However, the recommended wines to pair with our entrées were good. Despite ordering it to come with our entrées, the wine arrived much earlier, which allowed it to become a bit warm by the time our mains arrived (we both had whites). In fact, the timing of the whole meal was off a bit, as the appetizers arrived a long time before the entrees, which led to a large gap in between courses (and, because our wine was brought so early, the waitress didn't think to come around for another order of drinks). Our waters were kept full which is as it should be.What was super sweet was the house made Baklava.  We split a serving and found it to be plenty and a nice way to end our meal. Before leaving, a quick visit to the ladies room revealed a very clean, modern facility with fully enclosed stalls, frosted glass and soft lighting. Overall, we were pleased with our experience here and would recommend.
<review# 774,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2012,8/1/2012,9,59,3,6,2>My fiance and I went to Le Bistro for Valentine's Day. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get a reservation, but was able to score a spot even though I only called the day before (I'm such a lazy planner sometimes!).We showed up right on time, and the hostess led us to our seat. It was pretty romantic, with the checkered tablecloth and candle in a wine bottle. We quickly settled on a glass of wine each - which is quite generously portioned for the price. The food we ordered was delicious. Forgive me for not remembering the French names, but I had a delicious chicken breast with crispy ham pieces on top, sage butter sauce and smashed potatoes and asparagus. My fiance had steak, also with the smashed potatoes and asparagus. Both were delicious, and cooked to perfection. Before we had our mains though, we had pomme frites. They were delicious as well, but the way they served was a little unorthodox. They were put in a cone, which is pretty normal, but the holder for the cone looked like something I would have used in a chem lab in high school. Actually, I think I did use it, to hold my beaker over the bunsen burner. It was awkward to eat out of because I couldn't actually see what I was reaching for.The only other thing that bothered me was that the service was a little disjointed. Sometimes things were brought to us by our waiter, and sometimes by another person. It meant at the end we had our dessert delivered to take home with us, but no bill, and no waiter in sight. Then when we finally did get the bill, we weren't instructed where to go to pay. I'm guessing this may have been because it was Valentine's Day and busy, so I'll have to go again to see if it improves.
<review# 775,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2012,7/31/2012,14,61,2,4,3>We visited Cantina Mexicana for the first time on Father's Day, when they happened to be running a "2 for 1" burrito special for dads. Enticed by the siren song of free beans and cheese, we decided to give it a try. I ordered the veggie burrito and Peter opted for the beef. Both were delicious. There's a nice variety of toppings to choose from: veggies, rice, beans, guacamole (free if you have a vegetarian order), cheese and a selection of salsas ranging from mild to hot. Everything tasted really fresh and the portions were generous. We opted to get our lunch to go and eat in the Public Gardens across the seat, but there appeared to be lots of seating in the restaurant. The staff were upbeat and service was speedy. $10 for a burrito, not including a drink or side, seems a little pricey, but considering how filling and fresh these are it's worth it for a lunch treat. I tend to think of Mexican food as junk food, but this felt like a healthy meal rather than a greasy cheese bomb - no post-burrito regrets here!
<review# 776,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2012,7/30/2012,6,54,3,4,4>Despite the fact that this is located right on Spring Garden, I feel like Estia is one of Halifax's hidden gems. I'm a big fan of Greek food (I used to live in a town that had four Greek restaurants within two blocks of each other. And I'm talkin' a town of 10,000) and this place does not disappoint. My most recent visit was with around ten of my friends. The prices are super reasonable, the service was friendly and everything arrived quickly. Try the ekmek for dessert. The galaktoboureko is also very very tasty. (Although attempts at pronouncing it meant that we dubbed it the galactic burrito) I hear the brunch is good, too! But any time is good! Don't forget about this fabulous gem of reasonably-priced Greek delight.PS: sorry if I made you forever think of it as the galactic burrito.
<review# 777,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2012,7/29/2012,24,40,6,8,2>Whenever I have the need for a bottle of fish sauce, a package of szechuan peppercorns, tapioca pearls, tea, or a special soy sauce... I stop in here.While it is true that you must pay close attention to the labels before buying (like many stores), Ca Hoa Grocery carries many products that you can't easily get elsewhere in mainland Halifax. It is also the largest such store that I can think of in the area, with two floors and 4 rooms. Each area is separated into a specific section carrying everything from bags of rice to ceramic bowls to frozen chickens.Products often rotate around so that my eye always catches a new bottle of *something* that I just HAVE to have in my kitchen (maybe that's how I ended up with three varieties of fish sauce, soy sauce, and rice vinegar each...)Tricky, tricky, tricky.
<review# 778,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/21/2012,7/28/2012,5,31,2,5,3>When I go to Happy Sushi, it's for the lunch all-you-can-eat option because it's a great price. Although on weekends, this usually means it's busy and therefore has slow service. Anytime I've ever gone for dinner it's practically vacant and a lot faster but the price is too much for my poor student bank account.The sushi is good but I find it a little sloppy. There's been many times when I take friends there and the rolls start falling apart before we can pick them up. The other dishes are also pretty decent. I'm especially impressed with their yakitori because it's not the packaged superstore type skewers that a lot of other all-you-can-eat places use. The beef teriyaki seems to be the slowest dish on the menu. It always arrives at our table last (if at all!) and the portions are weird. I completely understand the portion sizes being small to give you a chance to have a wide variety, but whether you order 4 portions of beef teriyaki or 1, it's the same amount (which is a little annoying when you have 4 or more people with you). Service is alright. I have noticed that they only seem to hire Chinese workers and the owners are also Chinese. Sometimes it's hard to get your point across when talking/ asking questions to some of the waitresses. Also, sometimes things will come to the table that you didn't order, but it's bound to happen when multiple tables are placing orders with a bunch of different dishes. You can't expect your waitress to remember all 10+ dishes you checked off plus whatever everyone else in the restaurant is ordering. It's just too much. (but it'd be nice if they double check the orders more often before heading to the table with the wrong dish.) The waitresses are also pretty forgetful. We've found if you ask for a fork/spoon/knife, spicy mayo, or even sometimes ice cream...you usually have to ask at least twice. Only other thing I can think to mention is, bring cash! They actually include their own tip on the bill (which I'm pretty sure is illegal by the way) but they subtract 10% off your bill if you pay in cash.I give the restaurant 4 stars because it's the only all-you-can-eat restaurant I know of without having to go to Dartmouth and I do really enjoy the food for the most part. However, there are definitely some things that tick me off about this place.
<review# 779,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2012,7/27/2012,7,40,2,5,2>Does it really get any better then Brooklyn Warehouse, I really don't think it does. They have the best selection of local foods with lots of vegetarian and gluten free choices (I am not a vegetarian but I love the Carbonara). The Charcuterie and Cheese plates are a wonderful away to spend time hanging out and chatting with friends they offer a great selection of flavours that all work well with wine and cocktails (which they also have a great selection of). The menu is not giant but they manage to offer something for lots of different tastes.   As great as the food is the atmosphere might even be better. There is just a vibe about the place that makes you feel at home but still be cool and urban. The service is also great and they really have gone above and beyond every time I have been in.
<review# 780,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2012,7/26/2012,49,70,,3,2>We've been here a few times and we have an amazing experience every time. Our last trip in was a random night we had in Halifax for dinner and decided to go their on a whim. Meaghenne was our server and she was incredibly knowledgable and very passionate about her job and what the Middle Spoon has to offer their customers. She made us feels comfortable and relaxed in our decision making.I do find it a bit pricey, but feel it's worth what you get. We always go for the desert side of things and skip drinks, but have dabbled in one or two. They are delicious, but I've never really seen the need to spend a lot on drinks. It tends to be a waste for us. The more sweets however, the better.Peanut butter pie, sundaes, cookies.... We found out from our server the last trip in that they make their own syrups and bitters for their drinks. This was great news. This makes them that much cooler. Who can make their own bitters???Homemade deserts that are gourmet and decadent. a great ambiance that's a bit romantic and laid back to boot.what wouldn't you love about this place?
<review# 781,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/4/2012,7/25/2012,39,80,3,6,3>My Celtic Corner experience is limited. I've visited a grand total of once.But it was a hot summer evening, and we were headed to check out the patio upstairs. After the mysterious trek through the back stairs of the building, finding the parking garage out back where the green turf carpet somewhat elusively led us to the patio stairs, I was pleasantly surprised. This is one seriously fantastic summer patio hang out. there's a bar and wait service on the patio and the view of the Halifax harbour is not to be missed. The wait staff are quick and friendly and will either run a bar tab for you or let you pay as you go. The varied eats on the menu are your standard pub fare plus some Irish favorites. I didn't go to eat, but seriously enjoyed sociable time on their patio. Whether you head alone for a dinner or a drink, or bring a gaggle of friends, beat the heat, head for their patio and enjoy!
<review# 782,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/24/2012,7/24/2012,65,111,2,7,5>I have driven past this place so many times and have been perplexed by the pet store patio. Turns out Planet Paws has an ice cream stand attached to it!Funky Munky sells Farmer's ice cream by the scoop, with a rather wide variety of flavours to choose from. Prices are reasonable - I think my small scoop was $2.25. And wonder of wonders? An ice cream stand that accepts debit. I may be in love. I know decor isn't the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to ice cream stands, but this place is rocking a really modern look. The patio is quite lovely as well with well-appointed tables and chairs with umbrellas. Bonus points for cleanliness. When I stopped in on a warm Thursday in May around 5pm, the tunes were blaring and the place was hopping!I love that they also sell pet ice cream! Suitable for dogs and cats, the base is actually sweet potato. You can also choose from several toppings for your pet. I think it's a fantastic idea. I may have to snag a treat for my kitty next time.
<review# 783,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2012,7/23/2012,32,111,3,4,2>My cat is a 12-year-old cranky pants feline. We were going away for nine nights and there is no way she could be left at home with a visiting petsitter. One of her favourite displays of displeasure at being left alone for long periods of time is to poop on our bed. I'm not kidding.Our previous cat boarding kennel had closed so I was relieved to discover the friendly animal-loving staff at Vetcetera. Plus Vetcetera was recommended by our former boarding facility which had high standards.From the moment I called, I could tell these folks would look after my cat perhaps better than myself (well not really because she won't let people touch her), but they wanted to make sure they had all the cat's relevant health and personality information before we showed up.Upon showing up, they did a throrough assessment of my cat's health,made sure she didn't have fleas and, most impressively, weighed her to create a baseline for food consumption while she was there. I also had to initial that if her weight fell below a ceratin limit that the vetcetra folks could take measures, in this case tempting my cat with wet food, to keep her weight up.The "condo" was a bit small but my cat only weighs 7 pounds so small spaces suit her fine. If you have a larger beast, you might want to book a double. The staff is very caring and the price was right. Less expensive than our previous spot although here you have to provide your own food. The environment was super clean and the staff true animal lovers.I returned to discover that my cat had been well cared for and paid a lot of attention despite her cranky disposition. If you need boarding for your cat, definitely give them a call.
<review# 784,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2012,7/22/2012,38,87,3,4,3>I'm going to throw some serious love in the direction of this place and especially for its staff. As a non-skateboarder and non-snowboarder and non-owner-of-hoodies (friends were surprised by the last fact), Pro Skateboards is probably the last store I ever thought I'd ever need to visit. But when my roller skates lost their bearings (literally), it was the only place I could think of going to get new ones. I felt a little intimidated going in and my friend and I were having a total fish out of water feeling as we entered.Staff were immediately super helpful when they greeted me, pointing me in the direction of where I needed to go with bearings. When I walked up to what looks like a bar, they were again super helpful. And when it turned out the bearings in my vintage skates were super out of date and couldn't be replaced, they helped me find wheels, gave me a deal on said wheels (since I hadn't expected to purchase any) and then took the time to put the wheels on my skates for me. Both the staff and the customers hanging out were super friendly and helpful. It's not cheap to shop there, but I walked away feeling a-ok about my purchase of new wheels. Their roller skate stuff is limited since they've only recently started carrying it for the roller derby ladies, but I'm glad to know there's a place in town where my skates and I can go and talk to someone about my purchase (because I've been super hesitant to buy things online, seeing as how I didn't know the first thing about bearings and wheels). I'm not sure if I'll need to go back often, but I'll recommend this place to anyone I talk to as it was possibly one of the best customer service experiences I've had in Halifax.

The atmosphere is pleasant, design is nice, pretty much what we expected after being to sister restaurant Cheesecurds.The line moved quickly, but there are still plenty of options to choose from.I had a braised beef burrito, and it was pretty tasty. All of the ingredients were super fresh and the beef was tender in a way that made me want to eat more.On the downside, I would have liked my burrito to be grilled, but I wasn't offered the option. I'll ask next time. I'm also a bit of a hot sauce fanatic, so I could have used a much hotter sauce option. That being said, for being there 10 minutes after the opening, everything was great.There's a good chance I'll be seeing you next week, Habaneros.
<review# 786,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2012,7/20/2012,17,11,2,7,7>Have you ever heard of the 'hedgehog principle' (by Jim Collins in his business-excellence book 'Good to Great')?  It's based on the notion that achieving greatness boils down to simplicity; recognise what you do best, and do it well.  Just like the hedgehog, whose self-defense mechanism of rolling into a spiny ball to protect itself is really the only thing it needs to do to survive and succeed.Morris East is the restaurant equivalent.  You won't find a big menu here, and the 'main dish' section is PURELY pizza (except for their weekly 'specials' nights, which introduce a gnocci or burger dish).  But in terms of 'being the best at what you do', this restaurant is exemplary.The space itself is delightful; modern and tasteful, but at the same time completely unpretentious and cozy.  It's a very small space, and it is frequently full, so be prepared to wait (they don't take reservations) and when you sit, you will be close to your neighbouring table.  But it all adds to the experience.  Pizza is meant to share, and whether it's a quiet night or a bustling restaurant there's a lovely sense of shared intimacy.The pizzas are, in one word, INCREDIBLE.  In a time where pizza has become synonymous with the $3 slice and usually consists of refined and processed ingredients in an artery-clogging pie, Morris East has gone back to basics to create discs of edible art.  From the divine, crisp and light crusts (with whole-wheat and gluten-free options) to topping combinations that will blow your mind (too many to list, but such pants-wetting goodness as westphalian ham, red wine poached pear and tarragon aioli), there's a selection here that will appeal to both purists and adventurists. And all ingredients are locally sourced.Outside of the core pizza menu, there are amazing deserts (the salted caramel tort is probably the best desert in Halifax.  For real) appies and cocktails, plus at the weekends and at lunchtimes the menu expands to include brunch-style items and sandwiches made in the specially-imported wood-fired oven.I have a friend who says this place is pricey.  I disagree completely, because to my mind that view exists because pizza has become such a low-brow meal option and you can pick one up for $10 at a cookie-cutter late-night grease shop that buys all its ingredients in bulk from Costco.  But Morris East is a restaurant, and a fine one at that - and when viewed on this level, the prices are actually pretty decent considering the quality of the food and the overall dining experience.  And yes, they do take-out.As you can probably tell, I am a fan of this place!  It really is a Halifax gem.
<review# 787,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2012,7/19/2012,29,166,3,3,2>Do I get First to Review 2012? It is tough to add anything to what has already been said bout this centre piece of Halifax food and culture. I guess if anything I must admit to taking it for granted, not having enjoyed it for several months. This visit was on a cold Tuesday evening in February. We popped in in an effort to avoid some rush hour traffic thinking that it would be a nice quiet little place to spend some time. It was packed! People waiting for tables! Fortunately we were able to pick up one of the last vacant chairs.The food was great. The lamb burger with a side of their famous sweet potato fries was hot and delicious. The steak and mushroom thingy had gravy spilling onto the fries and drool spilling down the chin of my table mate. Both filled us up nicely.Now to say a few words about the atmosphere. On this cold Tuesday night there was a table of recognizable provincial MLA's, a couple of neighbours from way back when and a former colleague who pleasantly stopped by to say hi. Now Halifax is not that big a place, but still, it is notable that this is a place to be. Even if one doesn't "know" anyone, one just feels home here. This place should be listed in wikipedia under the definition for "pub" - more than just great food and beer.
<review# 788,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/23/2012,7/18/2012,61,77,2,3,4>The Chick!!! Hells to the yes. I've loved coming to this place eversince I was a kid. I think I appreciated a good milkshake andchickenburger from such a historical place at a little age. Now Irealize just how old school it is. 1940! Chhhyea.The oldest drive in restaurant in Canada, you know you want to checkit out if you haven't already. Drop a coin in the jukebox, sit on thecool 50's chairs and take a trip back 70 years ago.A simple yet sturdy menu. The portion sizes aren't huge but they workfor me. Jud was definitely still hungry. It certainly isn't gourmetbut you are really going for the atmosphere in combination with thefood. I've heard the soft serve ice cream is da bomb and I see a tonof the oldies rockin' the fish and chips. My go-to is the cheeseburgerwith fries. A chocolate milkshake doesn't hurt either.Be forewarned though, don't think you'll be spending all your timeyacking to your date. You'll be up out of your chairs checking out thecool photos on the walls. There is a ton of history in there! Justthink of how many butts sat on your very chair.The food is good but not awesome. You really have to look at it as a package deal.
<review# 789,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2012,7/16/2012,34,91,,8,5>Dropped by on the second day they were open. Sampled almost every flavor of gelato before picking the ones I wanted. Settled on the large size which he could squeeze 3 flavors in. I got pistachio, salted carmel and peanutbutter for 9.00. They were all great and the dining room was oh so cozy to enjoy my decadence. Nice spot to get away from the hustle-bustle of Spring Garden Road
<review# 790,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/15/2012,7/15/2012,20,178,,5,3>I've been in twice lately, the first time I got great advice on cleaning a beige suede handbag. Then I went back because they had so many shades of light brown shoe polish when I couldn't find it anywhere else; the owner even opened the jar to test it for me. Don't know how to polish your metallic colored leather shoes? They do!Everyone I know who has been to Quinpool Shoe Repair has gotten free services, at first I thought that was just for the ladies but reading the reviews I see it's not true. Finding a place to have your leather things repaired in Halifax is hard (Moneysworth & Best loses things). But Quinpool Shoe Repair knows their stuff, although I took off one star because black dust that covers everything.
<review# 791,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2012,7/14/2012,11,18,3,4,3>I tried 3 times to eat at Cheese Curds before I finally got in. I refused to stand in a 45 min. line. However, when I left I had a smile on my face and my clothes seemed a bit snugger on my body. There poutine is amazing! I had just a regular poutine, although you could change your sauces for an extra cost for example curry sauce or peppercorn. I also had a cheeseburger and chose from over 50 toppings to go on my burger. After much contemplation and a bit of anxiety I chose to keep it pretty simple so that I can taste the actual burger.I have to say it was fantastic! You don't even need to pile on toppings to have a high-quality burger. Surprisingly the line up moved quite fast, the staff were friendly and the food was served hot off the grill! It is a bit pricey, so if you just want a fast, cheap burger this is not your place.Overall, I have a huge craving to go back. And am proud to have another outstanding restaurant on the Dartmouth side.
<review# 792,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2012,7/13/2012,38,94,,5,4>Dropped by after my buddy went to the yelp event a few weeks before and just raved about the experience. No more maxwell house freeze dried coffee for him!I started with the fog city blend espresso, was able to come around and take a peak at the process, filling up my cup. Got a glass of water to along with it. Got to say it was my first cup of espresso, ever. And boy was it good. Velvety, smoky and a little bitter sweet. I took a Ethiopian brewed coffee for the road using the clover machine. Very nice also. The spot itself is small with a nice vibe to it. The barista well very helpful figuring out which blend to try (I drink my coffee straight up) .Appreciated having a closer look at the machines.  Both cups came up to 7$. It is not cheap but you instantly can taste the difference.If I'm nearby and needing a coffee, I'm coming back.
<review# 793,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/27/2012,7/12/2012,22,150,2,4,2>I make my own crepes and make my own flatbread pizza, but who ever thought to make a pizza on a crepe, Creperie Mobile, that's who. Nom nom, perfection.Had the Italian; mozza, tomato, ham and fresh basil all wrapped up in a buckwheat crepe.  Doesn't get much better than that.  I didn't experience the waits that others have found.  Only four people ahead of me and four crepe pans working.  The only suggestion I would make is to have a sign "Place Order at Cash".  Myself and a few other newbies weren't sure of the protocol upon arrival and a sign would have helped.  I think I've found my brunch spot when I'm at the market and a new dish to try at home when I can't make it to the market.
<review# 794,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2012,7/11/2012,19,131,2,2,2>I've been wanting to try this place since it opened -  I had never been to the previous establishment.I'm such a rookie when it comes to French food so having the descriptions under the meals was exactly what we needed to get through the ordering process. And now, I have the menu up so I can tell you all exactly what we had.We ventured in around 7:30 last night (Thursday), and the place was basically empty - My first thought: "oh, no!" but my reaction was premature. We were seated near the back, beautiful music was playing and a drink menu was placed in front of us right away - I like this concept; getting the drinks cleared out of the way before the food menu arrives. We opted for a 1/2 liter of Malbec. They were out so instead a Merlot, which was pretty good ( the bf prefers red, I prefer white) .I ordered the Duck Prosciutto, the bf ordered the Tuna Tartare (so that I could taste it, he said as he's not a huge tuna fan). Well, they were out of the prosciutto. I was told by the server that they make it in house, it takes time to cure and the last serving just went out. BUMMER, I love prosciutto and I was really looking forward to Duck Prosciutto ( I really like the word too - Prosciutto). So instead, because I wanted duck I went with the Duck Rillettes - which in English; is pretty much a pate. Both starters were accompanied with bread and mine with some homemade pickled carrots, potatoes, and pickles. The Duck Rillettes was great but the Tuna Tartare was outstanding, and will be my go-to next time I am in. Even the bf enjoyed it! Win!We both had steak for our mains; I had the Pavé de Boeuf au Poivre (centre cut filet of local beef with a green peppercorn sauce, brandy & cream, served with frites) and he had Steak Frites (8oz prime striploin, caramelized shallots, maître d' hôtel butter & frites). Our beef came out exactly as we wished; mine -bloody and his not so much. Bf opted to have the Duck Frites with his steak, I had the original ones. We agreed that mine were better.  My meal came with some fresh veggies as well.For desert, can you guess? Creme Brule for moi (you like that French I added in there?) which was perfect except as Vanessa has said the Madeleine's were lackluster - very dry. Bf had Kirsch Bûchette( french pastry filled with kirsch, berries & chantilly creams)  which was different but tasty. I love, love, love the decor. From the pictures on the wall, to the old elevator lights in the ceilings (bf works on elevators - that's what he said), to the tables and chairs everything was very welcoming. The lighting was just right; not too dark, not too bright.Our server was excellent, very friendly and had no problem pronouncing all the menu items. She even said them correctly, without judgement  after I pointed to the items on the menu and said " I want this" Next time: Brunch
<review# 795,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/14/2012,7/10/2012,30,26,5,3,3>Freak Lunchbox helped me pull off an at-home Japanese feast with style. Their candy selection is unprecedented in Halifax, and their small selection of unique Japanese treats and toys helped turn my date night dessert into a SUPER-HAPPY-FUN-TIME!Go here, with your kids in tow, and then go again while they're at school so you can enjoy the place for yourself.And if you really want to impress that special him/her, buy them some Giant Pocky.
<review# 796,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2012,7/9/2012,12,78,1,4,4>I stopped by this TIBS this morning on my trip to Halifax after getting off the ferry and I was glad I did. Great service and all around friendly moods. Zane was there this morning and happily made my beverage.I ordered an iced americano and a cinnamon bun to stay, and oh my sweet lord the cinnamon bun was amazing. THE best cinnamon bun I've had hands down. So buttery and just the right amount of sweet. Highly recommend to order it if you like them.I will frequent this place on my visits to Halifax now that I know it's so close to the ferry terminal.
<review# 797,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/30/2012,7/8/2012,4,24,4,8,4>Yoga...sigh. Something I actually really enjoy, but hate the atmosphere. Yoga enthusiasts tend to be slightly judgmental, overly serious and sometimes just plain nuts. I've tried many different studios and with the exception of a few hot yoga attempts (where you are so sweaty and gross no one cares) I've had some pretty bad experiences. 108 Yoga is the exception, if I could, I would give it 4.5 stars. The teachers are relaxed and most encourage a friendly, easy and no pressure atmosphere where you feel challenged without feeling intimidated.  You do not need to own an entire Lulu wardrobe to get in through the door. I've seen students in reasonably priced yoga wear and some even in their favourite gym t shirts and sweat pants. (One in particular, wore a pub crawl tee and is now my hero!)  You make a fairly obvious, incredibly embarrassing mistake? No worries. There will be no dirty looks, no exaggerated sighs and no teachers telling you to be quiet and stop being disruptive. In fact, feel free to laugh at yourself - you won't be shushed.Other great things: you can sign up for classes online (although not all the descriptions are accurate) and can create reoccurring appointments if you like a class in particular. They also provide you with blankets, blocks, stretch bands and mats free of charge. The location is also prime - right downtown!Issues: It is a small studio. If you are taking the popular classes (like Flow) show up early and be prepared to get into your neighbours personal space.  There's also only a changing station in the back and no bathroom - which means using the Brewery Market bathroom.Bottom line: If you want to take yoga for fitness and relaxation without all the pressure to be perfect (in both appearance and practice) this place is for you. If, however you are the kind of student who craves the intense discipline and strict codes of conduct, please stay away - I'd like to keep this place as it is.
<review# 798,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/19/2012,7/7/2012,24,41,3,3,3>I would estimate that I walk through the doors at Cabin Coffee 9 or 10 times per week. I'll normally go in the early morning before work and read a few comics while I drinks some delicious house blend coffee or a banana. Most days I will then come back around lunch time to enjoy a Beefeater Sandwich combo. Through all this, I've finally amassed enough confidence to write a full review on the Cabin. As someone that generally does not like coffee shop culture, the following should really show how much I enjoy the Cabin.Price:  4/5The prices at the Cabin are actually very reasonable. A Sandwich with a handfull of potato chips and a pickle (quarter pickle) comes to about $5. An extra large coffee come to roughly $2.25. The only things that seem a little over priced are the sweet snacks. Regardless of what you're looking for (muffin, cookie, scone, etc) it'll come to about $2.25. They're delicious and home made, but $2 is still a bit much for a single cookie.Location: 5/5Very convenient location. My workplace is only about a 5 minute walk away, and so is most of the downtown area, it being located a block down from the corner of Barrington and Spring Garden.Atmosphere: 5/5It may be the Cape Bretoner in me, but it's hard to not like a place that is decorated to feel like a cabin in the woods. A fake moose head over the fireplace, shabily constructed tables, comfy arm chairs and couches, foliage painted on some of the walls, etc. Also the music they've got playing ranges from Maritime to folk to easy listening, which is super chill. Food: 5/5Delicious. Can't put it any other way. Mostly serving sandwiches, soup, and homemade goodies all over. Great for lunches, breakfast or even a quick break. The only other reason that Cabin Coffee loses any more points is because of.....WIRELESS... Yes, Ben B. called it pretty good below. A coffee shop needs wireless. Cabin, unfortunately, has none. What they do have is a "Aliant Hotspot", which is useless if you're not a Bell Aliant customer, or don't want to shell out a randomly agreed upon $7 for anywhere between half an hour and 2 hours of internet time. You can grab SOME wireless if you sit in the very back of the room, but it's a pretty weak signal, and it's from the hotel across the street. A Coffee Shop should have enough appreciation for their customers to purchase Wifi, and give it to their customers to use for free (this would also encourage more customers to come stick around more).All in all, Cabin Coffee is a great coffee shop. Great for early mornings, great for lunches, great for meetings, great for dates, all around pretty great.
<review# 799,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2012,7/6/2012,11,41,2,3,3>After yelping and debating where to go for lunch after forgetting my lunch bag in my car (R.I.P. yogurt) I decided to take a trot down to Ciboulette for some lunchtime eatin'! I even went solo and I am pretty glad I did, space is limited but it's these kind of places that make lunch time fun in Halifax.After reading reviews about the grilled cheese panini, I gave it a try, along with the broccoli salad and a yummy cookie (more on that later!)I was the only one sat down inside but space is pretty limited although I hear there is more room upstairs.. I sat facing Barrington and watched people walk and have fun in the sun (I left my SPF60 at home), and the sandwich maidens gave me my sandwich and salad within a few minutes. The bread is to die for, the cheese is sharp and delish, but I wish the sundried tomatoes and basil were spread out more evenly in the sandwich, I had two bites of tomato and some basil, maybe? It was still good though! The broccoli salad was awesome but the almonds should be toasted, raw almonds are a bit too chewy for salads but that's just my opinion ;)The cookie! Omg the cookie. It was walnut fudge I believe, but it had a crisp flaky shell and a soft almost salty sweet gooey inside. I want more. MOAR!!I will go back! If anything to try more of their baked goods!
<review# 800,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/6/2012,7/5/2012,70,95,4,7,4>Sometimes you go somewhere without a clue what to expect and you leave feeling disappointed...This is not one of those times. As a pre-show get together for the Canada Heritage moments at the Carbon Arc (note to self: remember that review too), Meegan and I met some fellow yelpers here for some nosh and wine. We were the first to arrive (around 5ish) and if I can give anyone a little piece of advice about going to check this place out for the first time let it be this - that was the perfect time to be there. There were only a few patrons inside so we were able to get some great service (both fast and super friendly). As it is a music bar and grill they seem to have an extensive list of upcoming events but when we went all was quiet.While the menu can seem a little pricey we happened to go in during happy hour (4-6). Appetizers are 2 for 1, house wine $5 = Happy Tara!There seems to be a lot of talk about the grilled cheese sandwich this place serves up but Meegan and I opted to for the lamb lollipops ($10ish), the torpedo shrimp ($9ish but remember we were there for happy hour) and then shared the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich with Avocado ($11ish). It was plenty of food for the both of us and I really thought everything was very good. The house red was nothing to shake a stick at either (and three glasses later it was even better). I loved the look of the place. Dark wood and plenty of seating without feeling like you're bumping into one another. Located on the corner of Argyle and Prince it's looks to be an awesome place to hang out especially on the patio during the summer.If you go let me know how the grilled cheese sandwich is.
<review# 801,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2012,7/4/2012,20,226,2,4,2>After being warned how small this restaurant is, Mike and I headed down after my work and were there at 5:02 (they open at five).  It is indeed small, but there is actually space between the tables so when you remove/put on your jacket you don't accidentally smack a stranger with your zipper.Our server was very friendly and prompt, as was our food. Prompt, that is.  No big waits.  Warm crusty bread was brought to our table as soon as we sat down.  YUM.  I had the Sicilian sausage with rigatoni and a field greens salad to start.  The pasta was very good and the portion was a good size (ie, comfortably between skimpy and huge).  Mike had the cajun fettuccine and a butternut squash soup to start. He raved about both of his selections.  Unfortunately we were too full for dessert, but we will definitely try to save room on our next visit.  Prices are very reasonable as well.
<review# 802,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2012,7/3/2012,40,216,5,3,4>Hail to thee, Dawgfather, PHD (Professional Hot Dogger).There is no other street vendor and possibly any purveyor of food in this city with as much personality and generosity as this fixture in front of the Dal Student Union Building. He's got a van you can't miss and hot dog and sausages that you shouldn't miss either. At very reasonable prices and a huge selection of 30+ toppings, you can't go wrong with the Dawgfather when you need a quick bite between classes, as I often did during by days of higher learning.First he had more game than an XBox, now more than an XBox 360, he's a businessman who has been a fixture but isn't afraid to change.
<review# 803,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2012,7/2/2012,38,43,3,6,3>As a child I used to come across Rocky's little meat cart at local flea markets and events. Never in my life had I tasted such delicious and unique kabobs.And then Rocky's disappeared from my life- not to be seen again for several years.I searched and I searched- to no avail. Flash forward to age 19. I've just left the Dirty Dome headed for Pizza Corner in search for after DT munchies. As I stumbled up Blowers St I saw a crowd around a meat cart. Wondering what the excitement was, I followed suit. Imagine angels singing and a meat cart surrounded my a glowing orb. That's what it felt like.Meat on a stick! Glorious meat on a stick! I guess the secret is about a week of marinating the pork. The combination of flavours is just incredible. The way the meat caramelizes on the grill will have you ordering two more.Why would you ever get 1:00am pizza again when you could have this?Now that my Dirty Dome days are long behind me (thankfully!) I've found that this late night meat treat is just as good sober.
<review# 804,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2012,7/1/2012,12,153,,4,2>Having never been to Yuk Yuks I wasn't entirely sure what to expect.  I mean, I had the general gist of what the night would entail but the specific ins and outs I had no idea. Off I went to meet friends for an evening out.  I arrived just ahead of them and was lucky enough to be able to grab a table for us since they're assigned on a first come first serve basis.  While the tables are small it was nice to have somewhere to put our drinks and our munchies.  There are some rows without tables, however, if having more leg room is more important to you.  The table-less rows also eliminate the need for you having to get up to allow the people on the inside of your row to get out.  There is no moving room to be had otherwise. While the food, obviously, isn't the main focus of the evening, let's be honest and say it is important.  We opted for a round of nachos and wings.  The wings were crispy and hot, and there was a good amount of them.  The nachos were the same and came with healthy size portions of sour cream and salsa. A word of advice: if you decide to go pick your company wisely.  If you have a friend who is easily offended, this likely isn't a great option for them.   While I can't speak for others, the headline comedian we saw clearly knew no boundaries.  While I found him hilarious you could easily tell some of the people in the room weren't happy / were offended.   And if you don't want to be picked on/called out don't sit in the front row - there was a bachelorette party there with the bride in a tiara and sash sitting upfront and center.  Yeah, she fell into the "this probably isn't a great option for her" category. If you are looking for something fun to do that doesn't involve a movie theater or an over crowded bar this is may just been a good option.  I'll definitely go back!
<review# 805,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2012,6/30/2012,27,148,,3,5>This was SO good.  I ordered the pulled pork plate and it was a cafeteria-size tray with a huge helping of the pork, two large sides (I chose mac n cheese and fries), a small cup of coleslaw and a small cornbread.  The pork was moist and delicious.  The fries and mac and cheese were also both yummy and seemed homemade.  The coleslaw was a little more sweet and vinegary (yes, at the same time) than I like so I didn't eat all of it but that was fine with me.  The portions were HUGE and I could have easily split mine with someone.  I ended up bringing half of it home for lunch tomorrow.  They have Propeller sodas, Coke products, milk and beer.  The place is small and only has about 8 tables.  It gets pretty cramped.  We got there just after 5:00 on a Saturday and it was busy.  By the time we left people were waiting for tables.  It was really yummy and I'll definitely be back!
<review# 806,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2012,6/29/2012,65,55,2,3,4>Inkwell is one of my favorite places for gift ideas. Even if I'm just looking for a card, they have a large selection that offers more variety and character than a traditional Hallmark Card. If I don't know what to get someone, I know a quick visit to Inkwell will help solve that problem.Crisp and clean are the best words to describe the atmosphere and overall look and feel to the store. The simple colors highlight the product and allow you to picture every single item in your home! Resistance is necessary when entering the store. Luckily I find the prices very reasonable and, considering you are purchasing local products, you can always feel good walking out of the store with an item (or two ... or 10). Inkwell has done a great job of supporting local and I think they are a great addition to Halifax!
<review# 807,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/10/2012,6/28/2012,16,102,2,9,5>I have been here many times before, usually with my Grandfather and Dad, on multi-generational lunch dates. Recently popped in again, this time with bf. We ordered our meals to go. I got a 1 pc fish and chips and was convinced to try poutine. DELISH. Fact: If the size of the fish is smaller than avg in your order, they will give you a second piece free of charge. I ended up with a 2pc for the price of one, and bf got 4pc for the price of 3. That brings him giddy, child-like joy! The fish is wonderful. Not TOO battered, but golden and crispy and the fish is perfectly cooked. The fries are good, the poutine was fabulous. The tartar sauce is packaged, but that's not really a big deal. The service really makes this place a stand-out. The ladies I have dealt with here are just wonderful. They are always up for a chin-wag and are super friendly. I felt like I wanted to give them a hug before I left. I didnt, but maybe next time! :)
<review# 808,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2012,6/27/2012,35,61,2,3,2>I'm sure I'm going to become quite familiar with this place, and fast. Delicious, fresh ingredients. Fast and friendly service. The best thing to stuff your drunken face with in the middle of the night, bar none. If you want to get fancy, you can smother your poutine in mounds of steak and onions, and they don't skimp. Such squeaky curds!
<review# 809,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/13/2011,6/26/2012,33,173,4,6,5>Argyle street should be renamed Restaurant Row for all the food establishments that load the street.  The Foggy Goggle is as good as it gets on this culinary-painted road; the 5-star rating screams as much. If it's a beautiful and warm sunny day, I insist you take advantage of their patio.  Albeit the view isn't spectacular, (hello, big hole that is the future home of the convention centre!), it's a great spot for people-watching while catching some rays.  If you're visiting the other 10 months of the year, you can either grab a comfy chair, sit at a big table, or settle down at a table in front of the large windows.  The super friendly staff will be just as attentive to you no matter where you sit. Don't need to stress over what side to get, because I'mma break it down for you: get the Foggin' Spuds, plain and simple.  Tender taters in a creamy sauce with bacon and melted cheddar.  Have your tastebuds started lusting yet? Because mine are wet with desire just thinking about them. If you're a veggie, then I guess you'll have to miss out, but their regular roasted potatoes are pretty good too.Now you can start figuring out what to eat with your spuds. Some of my favourites are the burger and the mac and cheese.  Their steak sandwhich is also pretty good, but I think I would like it better if it were on a crispier baguette and already served with cheese.  As it is, I had to pay extra for an order of aged cheddar, but it did make the difference. Enjoy the food with a beer, some friends, and savour the casual, laid-back atmosphere. Foggy Goggle is the right place for just about any occasion for fun and food.
<review# 810,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/29/2012,6/24/2012,3,31,4,3,3>Ela, Opa, whatever you decide to call it, this is a downtown Halifax staple.On a recent Friday night, my husband and I were joined by another couple for dinner and we chose Ela.  We were able to walk in at 7 and get a table right a way, which will probably not be an option as the weather improves.  On this particular night the dining room was busy.We decided to order some starters as we were there for a leisurely childless meal, which meant we didn't have to shovel food into us one-handed as we entertained our son.  We started with three of what I feel are the best starters on the menu: the kopanisti dip with warm pita, the grilled halloumi cheese, and the loukaniko.I could make a meal of the kopanisti and warm pita.  It is made with whipped feta cheese combined with roasted red peppers and just a touch of jalapenos to add just a little heat.  The flavour is definitely dominated by the saltiness of the feta, but is tempered by the mellow flavour of the roasted red peppers.  The grilled halloumi cheese is fascinating to me, because I don't typically think of cheese as something that can be grilled.  The halloumi is first marinated in oil and spices and then lightly grilled to heat through.  The loukaniko, a house made sausage, has a wonderful flavour and texture.For the mains, we had two orders of souvlaki, one order of lamb kleflictico, and and a pastitsio.I love souvlaki, and I feel like Ela does it just right.   The lamb was cooked perfectly without being tough.  It is served with your choice of rice or lemon potatoes.  As an aside: if you go to Ela and they offer the potatoes, take them.  Don't question it, just take the potatoes.Based on the silence of my dinner companions after the food arrived, I would wager that everyone else enjoyed their meal just as much as I did.
<review# 811,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2012,6/23/2012,18,60,2,3,3>I went here with my cadet squadron as we wanted to do something fun with our kids. We went there after hours, and they had three staff volunteer their time for us. Very much appreciated! They brought us in and gave us an orientation. We had 38 kids, so they divided us into two groups. The first group went into the planetarium, while the other group was allowed to roam the two floors freely. The planetarium was quite fun and the staff was really knowledgeable. After both groups went through the planetarium they were allowed to freely play/learn in the Discovery Centre for an hour. I loved that our kids are aged 12-18 and everyone was having a great time. The staff were also roaming and teaching the kids  at various exhibits. After letting the kids roam they called them back to the Theatre and gave them a scavenger hunt. I thought this was an excellent idea as it slowed the kids down and actually made them read the exhibits and learn about science. The group that scored the highest were given a small prize.
<review# 812,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2012,6/22/2012,17,52,2,4,2>I.love.greek.foodJust thought that should be made clear, so when my friends picked me up from work asking where I wanted to go to eat, I yelled out ela! I usually head down to the Argyle St location but this time we made the trek to Bayers Lake and I have to say, I'm a little disappointed with this location compared to the downtown one.This location has more seating - bonus - but like everything in Bayers Lake, it's more boxy and lacks the character that the downtown location has. I overlooked this because I was so hungry and excited for some food... until I had the potatoes. I really don't remember the potatoes being that tomatoey (is that even a word?). There was something off about them and it wasn't just me, the others I was dining with had the same opinion. Besides these two flaws, the rest of the meal was AMAZING! I love the olive oil and bread they bring out as you wait for your meal, the chicken simply melts in your mouth, their wine selection is always great (skipped wine this time, but it's usually part of the meal at ela) and the service is superb. I gave this a 4 out of 5 stars simply because my love for Greek food could not bring me to giving it a 3 and because of the potatoes and lack of real character (plenty of big-box-fake character if you like that sort of thing), I couldn't give it a 5.
<review# 813,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/20/2011,6/21/2012,76,115,,6,2>Mary's Place has been on my "list" of places to try for a while - I love going out for breakfast/brunch, but due to budget constraints, I don't do it that often. So, I finally got to see what this place was all about a couple of weeks ago when they boy and I were looking for a fast, cheap, filling breakfast in the 'hood on a lazy Saturday morning. Mary's is just your basic mom-and-pop diner - small, nothing fancy, been there forever. It was full when we arrived, but we lucked out and got a booth (we went later in the morning - I think around 11:30 - so I supposed it's a bit less crazy at that time). We noticed a pretty steady stream of people going in and out, so it's obviously popular. And it's obviously geared toward fast food - the menus are on the table and our food arrived quickly. It was nice that we had our pick of lunch/dinner entrees as well as breakfast (nice to have options!). And the prices are awesome (you can easily get a huge breakfast for under $10 including coffee). Honestly, I have had better food -  my main complaint is that the hash browns were not thoroughly cooked. Many of the larger chunks were hard on the inside. I realize with a small place geared toward speed, you are not going to get a fancy meal, but it was a little disappointing, especially considering my enduring love for hash browns.However, the spice on the taters was nice, the service was fast and friendly, we got a lot of food for the price, it was cozy, and everything besides the taters were cooked fine - so, what more can you ask for from such a place? I will go back to Mary's again if I want a fuss-free breakfast in a hurry. I just won't expect to be blown away.
<review# 814,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2011,6/20/2012,8,31,4,3,2>I struggled with the rating here. I'll admit it: I'm a BC girl, so any park on the Atlantic will never be quite as good as a park on the Pacific. That snobbery didn't seem enough to withhold the star, but I had to get that out of the way. (Oh, and there's basically Christmas trees everywhere here. I could probably hug even the oldest trees. Okay, I'm done, I swear.)I love the hidden spots in this park the most. There's a few places with gorgeous views and even less foot traffic, though you have to go off the main trails to find them (keep an eye out for beaten paths) or come with just about anyone who grew up here.If you're interested in history, there's some kind of old fort that was undergoing reconstruction the last time I went and lots of cool statues and informational plaques. If you'd rather walk along the seashore and have fun slipping on wet rocks, finding shells (and less natural items, shall we say), and communing with nature, that's cool too.One warning: this park is not for those afraid of dogs. As noted, the off-leash areas aren't really clear. I don't mind, since I love making friends with dogs more than people (shh, don't tell anyone), but just be careful when you're sitting on a rock cliff face or eating!Several of my most peaceful solitary moments have occurred in this park -- sometimes on a brisk walk in the rain with my iPod in and very few others around, and other times alone by the seashore on a warm spring day. Point Pleasant is a little slice of heaven in the south end.
<review# 815,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/27/2012,6/19/2012,59,150,,3,2>I walk by The Henry House more often than I've been inside, but when I had to pick a place to eat after work it was a no brainer! I don't think anyone would say no to The Henry House. We were seated upstairs, which was great, sometimes I'm just not in the mood to eat in a low-lit room. The dining room isn't very big, but it doesn't feel stuffy or over crowded either, even when it is busy, and the service was fantastic! It blew my mind really. I wish I remembered our servers name because he was great! Super professional, speedy and attentive! It was like we were in a formal dining room!I ordered the chicken club wrap with their hand cut fries. The wrap was average, I really like lots of flavor - which it didn't have, but it was still filling. The fries on the other hand were delicious!They have a pretty good menu with lots of different options! Not to mention the character and charm that everyone loves so much! I will most definitely return~
<review# 816,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2012,6/18/2012,10,57,,6,5>So, I've written a review about this place before.  It is great.  Brian and Jocelyn are amazing.  But I have always walked down to get my lunch or called to pick it up.  This time I called them in a last minute panic and needed two salads and their WORLD FAMOUS CARROT CAKE.  I don't even like Carrot Cake and I love, LOVE this carrot cake.  Anyway, I called at 9:30am and picked it up at 2:30pm.  That's not the amazing part.  The cake was on a GLASS platter with a dome lid.  The salad was in little containers so that everything could be tossed fresh at home so no sogginess.  The dressing was homemade...it was unbelievable.  Above and beyond.  But that is not the best thing.  The best thing, the most thoughtful thing, is that I told them I was having lobster, and they clarified butter for me and threw that in as well.  What a nice, thoughtful surprise.PHARMACEUTICAL REPS TAKE NOTE:  when I was a rep, I was always looking for a different caterer - something awesome.  Well, look no further, they have it nailed.  I will only use them for all my catering in the future.
<review# 817,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2012,6/17/2012,13,213,3,3,2>The service here is good. I ending up getting kind of screwed at the bike auction last weekend and needed to visit a repair shop asap to get some help with what I ended up winning at the auction. The bike is fixable but not by any bike repair shops standards. These guys spent 20 mins trying to bring this bike back to life and just could not make it work. The frame where the seat meets the post is way too messed with among many other problems which I did not see while trying to decide which bikes I would bid on with over 200 bikes at the auction. I told the guys at the shop I was going to trash the bike and as soon as I said that they all stopped just as if a person died in the back of the ambulance it was over just like that. I walked out with the frame and my wife held the tires. I told a fib. I am going to try to fix the main problem myself and get a bit of use out of this bike before giving it a funeral. My advice just buy a new bike and this shop looks like it has many to choose from as does MEC as well. PS these guys never charged me a penny for the 20 mins of labour aka messing with the last owners problems which are now my problems.
<review# 818,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2012,6/16/2012,15,60,6,7,5>My kingdom for a half-star (albeit my kingdom currently consists of a mountain of semi-crappy furniture and a brand spanking new mortgage. But still... that's like a kingdom, right?). In any event, Evan's is a solid 4 1/2 stars -- but sneaks into 5 for me because of one thing: Location location location.I LOVE that Evan's has crept its way into my weekly routine! I'm pretty sure it's making me a better person. A better, fishier person. Right on my walk home from the ferry, Evan's means I can pop in and grab some fish that Boyfriend and I can pan fry up in a jiffy. Last week's fresh flounder was DELISH! And they had some kind of red fish, which apparently was a big deal according to the lovely woman who was purchasing it. Love that they have both fresh and frozen options, and the two girls are great to help walk you through a purchase, if you're not a fish savvy person.The clincher? I can grab a ceasar salad or fries to motor home with too, so it's like I've cooked a real dinner when really, all I've done is purchased items and thrown fish in a pan. IT IS AMAZING! And has changed my life. And the super ultra mega clincher? To skip doing anything at all, I can just grab the gluten free fish and chips and BAM! dinner is ready. And just ever so delicious. Here's my final tip: Buy the carrot cake. You will not regret it. Gluten free and totally amazing. Loving this addition to the Dartmouth waterfront, and my overall lifestyle. We straight up eat more healthy fish because of Evan's. So huge win for me.

I had been wanting to hit this spot up for a while now especially after walking by so many times on my way to Venus for my old faithful late night shawarma! ON my first attempt, a few months back, I was faced with a long line and the shock of having no place to sit to enjoy my late night snack.... so as per my usual, I continued walking down the hill towards ol'faithful! Last week brought new light to my world of late night dining. A friend convinced me to battle the line and patiently wait for what he promised would be 3am heaven. So off we went, and on we waited in line...Multi meat and meat prep choices... mmmm off to a good start; various degrees of heat and smokiness..... veg, beans, rice....  ooooohhhh I knew I was in for a treat just by looking at the chalk boards! The staff was awesome at helping me navigate through the menu as a first time B-Jax customer, and let me tell ya, I loved it (even the next morning).4 stars - wait was a bit long and although the space is very small, it would be nice to not have to walk and chew... but if you don't mind that, consider this a 5 star rating from East coat GIts by no means Mexico Lindo, but what a great change from the late night pizza, poutine or yes, even shawarma! Nice to have a bit of diversity. Good job Gordon for bringing us a fantastic late night alternative!
<review# 820,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2012,6/14/2012,42,100,,9,6>Venus Envy is a small store but what they offer is so much in comparison. Literature, magazines, and if you're feeling a little crafty in the bedroom, they can help you out there as well.They offer classes for sexually related topics as well and have talks throughout the year. I've only ever attended one during Pride Week a few years back but just the simple fact that they go beyond being a store makes them that much greater.The few times I drop by is typically if I'm looking for a book, whether it be of short stories, or a novel. Everything is organized based on category whether it be general sexual health, LGBT issues, trans issues, women's issues, men's issues, coming out to your parents, how to deal with homophobia, etc, etc, etc. For such a small space, there's just so much offered.The staff is friendly and nice, not imposing but definitely there to help. I feel that Venus Envy isn't really so much of a store as it is a focal point for the community. It helps to make us appreciate the community that Halifax has and the acceptance and openness that is here. Other cities should be envious.

And sometimes, being homesick forces me to seek out food that reminds me of home. A Taste of India and its dishes, is a place where a person like me can easily invoke the memories of my home, where I can simply go to any Indian shops that flood the city of Kuala Lumpur and order Indian rice serve on banana leaf. Of course they do not serve them on banana leaf here, but the food does strike a chord. Oh yeah, did I mention cheap too? You really get a decent amount for the price you pay. And for a small eater like me, that's easily 2 meals for the day.
<review# 822,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/5/2012,6/12/2012,27,107,3,4,3>Ok.  So I had no idea and I went in to order a coffee and tea to go.  The result was my friend and I being seated and looking at menus.To set the scene my friend had never had a crepe before... Of any type.  No idea what it meant.  Could have been a bologna sandwich for all he knew.  I gasped and said hold on to your hat sir...  I wanted a sweet crepe, he (as a healthier eating individual) went for a savory crepe.The girl who seated us and took care of us was lovely.  Tasty decaf coffee and green tea was brought to us promptly.  Hot and tasty...  Just the way I like it.We were there just before closing on Saturday - the place was almost full but not crushingly so.  Lovely ambiance and very relaxed.Sooooo.... Back to the food.  I was craving nutella and voila! there was one on the menu!!!  Hooooraaayyyy!!  Yes please!  The Euro!My friend had the eggs benny crepe with spinach, tomato and mushroom.  It was accompanied by a salad and a tasty polenta like addition.  He took one bite and his eyes opened like a kid who just rolled into a pool of candy.  He ate every single morsel there was - high praise from this guy.My Euro was di.... vine!  Fresh whipped cream, bananas, Nutella, slivered almonds just made a combination that satisfied and made my eyes roll slightly up.Prices were very reasonable.  And I will be back again and again.
<review# 823,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/8/2011,6/11/2012,15,91,2,6,4>A small but cozy little tea house. I went here on a recommendation from Ben B. (Thanks Ben!) and this is probably one of my new favorite spots. I have tried any sweets yet but next time, I'll make it a point to try them.I stopped in the first time when I was waiting for a play to start at the Neptune theatre because it was cold outside and I didn't want to stand in line longer than I had to. I ordered a Maritime Fog Latte. Most. Delicious. Tea. Latte. Ever. Just saying.Tea lines the many shelves of World Tea House and there are a few seats if you're going in with a few friends or if you came in by yourself. It's a great spot with friendly service.
<review# 824,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/14/2011,6/10/2012,21,55,4,4,2>If they'd allow it, I'd own a table. Not one person could ever sit there. Better yet, I'd have a tent and live there. Okay, I may be exaggerating but holy cow this place was designed and opened just for me. The lights are dim, the wait staff are awesome and knowledgeable, and their cheese and meat selection are to die for! It's a fantastic place to go with some friends and catch up, or to go to wind down after a busy night or week.Honesty is the best policy and I'd be lying if I said you could get a seat, but really the wait is worth it! Also, the seating is different; you do have your tables, but once they are filled up, you're left with a long table. This means, that if you need to get out you're disturbing strangers-- which isn't always the most comfortable task. Lastly, it is a bit on the costly side-- but your getting cheese and meat, I'd pay with limbs.
<review# 825,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2011,6/9/2012,33,8,3,3,4>A sushi bar, and a café?! I can't think of a better place for me to spend all of my time, and my money!Halifax is becoming quite the contender in the sushi business, and a lot of new shops are popping up in and around HRM. The B-Well Sushi and Café does a great job blending elements of a traditional Japanese sushi bar, and a cute, warm and welcoming café!I consider myself somewhat of a sushi aficionado, and I am always on the hunt for something new and exciting! I typically prefer vegetarian sushi rolls, as they tend to have the most exciting flavour combinations, and I heard this place had a lot of interesting options on the menu.During ONE of the few sunny days we had in May, I decided to take a stroll from downtown up to Quinpool to give this place a try. I had heard AMAZING things about their Samurai Balls (I'm doing everything in my power to keep this review clean and appropriate for children) so I was tempted to try them out!The space is small, but quaint. The decor is very Japanese-inspired and instantly reminded me of the small cafés that you would find on small side streets in Kyoto, or in Osaka. After coming back from Korea and Japan, I was really excited to find a place that really brings me back to the time I spent abroad.So, after hearing about all of the fuss, and avoiding a bad joke waiting to happen, I went up to the counter and placed my order. I got the Samurai Balls (very similar to Takoyaki ~ Japanese Octopus Balls) minus the octopus. You will find no fish inside of this appetizer, only melted mozzarella cheese and Takoyaki sauce drizzled on top. I also ordered the Banana Bonanza Roll which was a very interesting twist on traditional sushi. The soy sauce that came with it, complemented the Banana and seaweed beautifully, creating a terrific taste combination that I really enjoyed,To go along with my meal, I ordered the Iced Ginger Tea. It was the perfect combination to go along with my meal. It packed a nice punch, but it was still sweet enough that it wasn't too overpowering.All in all, this place is an absolute delight, and I would love to bring a few friends next time! (Dining alone isn't as much fun!)
<review# 826,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2011,6/8/2012,28,43,,3,2>If you like your Chinese food hot and spicy, this is the place to go. While the decor is pretty sparse, the dishes are not. Take-out is actually my preferred option. I highly recommend the Sesame Chicken which I've nicknamed the Opium Chicken for its addictive qualities. Try it once and it'll be hard to resist not ordering it every time.

They loved it however, proclaiming it one of the best they've had.Writing this made me hungry... there's still a few slices left...
<review# 828,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2012,6/6/2012,49,23,,5,3>My family and I are cheesecake fanatics. My little sister for example, constantly invents and re-consititutes cheesecake recipees from time to time and has us as her taste testers. So after hearing about this place, the siblings and I went to the Sweet Hereafter to test the waters albeit with a bit of skepticism.I have been there a few times now. Every time has been pure pleasure. We are a family that shares. After all sharing is caring right? We also brought with us a few friends. Which is a good because we would order 4-5 different cheesecakes based on what was available at the time and try eachothers dish. The cheescakes are of immaculate quality and the variety is always rotating its never the same old selection and appropriate as well in that there is always a cake for someone. My favorites so far have been the Apple Country (name?) and the Peanut Butter Chocolate cheese cake (with raspberry sauce). The constituency and thickness of the core of the cheesecake is important. This is what makes a good cheesecake from one that is just grainy, too sugary or stiff. Or sometimes you get cheesecakes that are devoid of flavour. This is never the case at Sweet Hereafter. The decor is sublime, I often think it looks like a the backdrop of (insert your favourite rnb singer) a music video. Its classy but fun. The price is ridiculously cheap. I think its too cheap for the quality if you ask me...this place is worth every penny. My bill was around $10 with two cups of coffee and a slice of cheesecake, taxes in. The only regret is I wish they had a liquor license because nothing beats eating cheesecake with a nice glass of white wine. The coffee and teas are great tho...and the host(s) are always amazing, appreciative and obviously proud of their establishment. Please support this heavenly little place and make sure it endures...its a favour to all of us...
<review# 829,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/30/2011,6/5/2012,25,107,4,7,4>I'm not going to lie, when I first heard there was a sushi place opening on Quinpool I was beyond skeptical. I for some reason just always associate Quinpool eateries as being cheap and cheerful and mostly just for breakfast. But I do love me some sushi and after hearing good reviews from some friends, I was anxious to go.We rolled in around 7pm a few days after Christmas and the place was packed. Then, that dreaded awkward moment happened, there was no sign indicating to wait to be seated, or just find a table and hope for the best. So I spotted a friend, and made my way over to sit at a table next to him. Yeah, turns out, this is a wait to be seated kind of place. Oops. Nothing more awkward than sitting down, and then standing awkwardly, and then being reseated in a busy restaurant. Luckily, we were seated in a little private nook so we could avoid the scrutinizing looks (real or imagined....) from the other diners. Service was a bit shaky starting off, one server gave us menus, and took a drink order and then forgot about us. Another server stepped in to take our order saying that the other server was really busy, she then became our server. It happens, and the place was quite busy. Our new server was great- friendly, but not overbearing.Due to some sketchy food allergies, my selection for sushi is shrinking, so I was stoked to see some different and unique rolls on the menu that I could actually eat. The fact that everything was incredibly delicious was a great added bonus. I'm a big fan of a place that offers a discount for paying with cash, which they do. PLUS! They give you Ovations with the bill. Best thing ever.In summary, I hope this little place sticks around for awhile and keeps on keeping on. They seem to have a good thing going. And I will be back.

<review# 831,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2011,6/3/2012,43,449,,4,3>Oh wow. Who wouldn't love this place? I've only dined here a couple times, and each time has been with a large group. Group dining in any setting can be a challenge, but at Da Maurizio's, they make it as enjoyable as possible without missing a beat. Service is impeccable and I personally found the waitstaff to be really on top of things. I've only sampled a few dishes here, but I keep going back for the risotto. It doesn't disappoint. Everything else on the table looked and smelled divine; it's rare to dine with a group where everyone raves about their choices, so thumbs up to that! I can't speak to the wine list, as I'm never the one selecting the bottle, but I've been told the choices are good and pare well with the food. Overall, if you're looking for a great fine dining experience, make a reservation here! PS - The entrance is inside the brewery market. But don't worry, every first-timer get's confused, too.
<review# 832,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/17/2011,6/2/2012,29,249,,5,2>It was a beautiful late summer day, so my mom and I decided to go for lunch at the Bicycle Thief. We were first seated in the inside. and the restaurant looks as beautiful during the day with the sunlight, as it does in the evening. Inside it was the professional lunching "see and be seen" crowd. As we were sitting down we saw a spot on the patio free up so we were able to nab it. The patio had a slightly more relaxed feeling, and because two cruise ships were in, the boardwalk was bustling.Our server was great, and we each started off a glass of wine from the rather large wine by the glass list. I had a Pinot Noir and my mom had the Nova 7. We each ordered the same dish, the red ravioli which was given it's red (more pinkish really) hue by being dyed by beets, which gave it a slight sweetness. It was filled with creamy marscapone, ricotta and spinach and had a light cream sauce. It was really good and really filling, when the dish arrived, I thought it looked like a small portion, but it was deceiving, I had to give my mom my last ravioli. What I love that they have for lunch (and maybe now at dinner too) is a dessert menu, instead of either having to see the cart, or go off the servers memory. The desserts this time around were much more appealing to me, and presented better than during my first visit. I went with the servers suggestion of the chocolate mousse torte and it was delicious, full of a creamy chocolate mousse that reminded me of all of the ones I had living in France. My mom had the creme brule and really enjoyed it, it was a tad on the runny side, but the sugar crust was amazing. Overall, this is a great spot for lunch and the prices are very reasonable. This spot is up there with Gio as my favourite fancy lunch spot.
<review# 833,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2011,6/1/2012,40,34,,4,3>Another staple for take out/delivery options in Dartmouth, I will qualify this review by saying I have never actually eaten in.  Wong's offers good Chinese food with decent portions at reasonable prices.  The menu has a fairly broad selection to suit various tastes, although the focus is definitely on Canadian-style Chinese food and not the authentic stuff.  Beairng that in mind, the General Tso's chicken is delicious.  Delivery is failry prompt and we have always found the food to be hot and tasty.  As an added bonus, their take out containers are the re-usable kind and make a great substitute for gladrware!
<review# 834,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/6/2012,5/31/2012,54,227,2,5,2>After visiting Onyx a few times recently, it's become one of my favorite places in the city. So much so, that I need to start thinking of excuses to visit more often. I've always been a fan of their Monday (mojitos for $7) and Tuesday (martinis for $6 or $7) night drink specials, and I've had some tasty apps. But I'd never really considered Onyx for dinner, probably because it's a bit pricey.For Valentine's Day this year, Rob and I went to Onyx and tried the special Dine Around fixed menu - $45 for an appetizer, main and dessert. My appetizer and dessert were both fantastic, and the only reason I didn't absolutely love my main was because it is duck and, as I know now, I'm not a big duck person. (Though I don't regret ordering it because how else would I learn I don't like it?)On top of the wonderful food, the service was probably the best I've ever had. They were attentive and quick without hovering, and incredibly friendly. The cherry on the top was all the extra unexpected touches: A delicious apertif drink, crackers and spread to munch on while we awaited our appetizers, palate cleansing sorbet and a warm towel at the end that expanded in water like one of those foam dinosaurs you'd have as a kid. I've never felt fancier.

<review# 836,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/25/2012,5/29/2012,74,22,2,9,5>I am going to try and write a fair review about The Vines despite being filled with rage!1) You are presumably named after the awesome Australian band! Yeaaaaaaaah!2) I've been coming here since I was a teenager and have always enjoyed their pasta. Yesterday, for the first time in probably two or more years, my family went out to celebrate my mom's birthday.My pizza was awesome. It was so cheesy and saucy and perfect. I'm having leftovers for lunch today and am so pumped. My mom's pasta was great and everyone else more or less liked their meal. So this would have been five stars.3) The issue I have is with the service at the restaurant. They treated my awesome granddad (who is a capital "B" BOSS) like a little kid. They messed up his order (which is fine. whatever), but when they brought back his plate you could see that they pretty much just threw the food there. Again, whatever... grampy chowed down. After two bites he pretty much stopped because the food wasn't palatable. The Vines rules at pasta/pizza, etc, but they didn't do so well with the fish. 4) I'm not going to get into too many specifics, but the way that staff talked to my granddad when he was trying to tell them about his food was THE WORST. I was cringing. Instead of answering him they would ask the rest of us what he wanted. Dude is an ADULT and when he is speaking to you, you can reply to HIM. There were a couple of other comments that were just stupid and said in a way that were very belittling to my awesome, tough Navy vet grampy. 5) So that is why I am rage-y. But I loved my pizza. Frig.
<review# 837,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2011,5/28/2012,51,65,3,6,2>Like The Economy Shoe Shoppe or Your Father's Moustache, Darrell's belongs to a certain category of Halifax restaurants that are must-eats for anyone visiting the city, regardless of the quality of the food. Luckily, unlike the Moustache or the Shoe Shoppe, the food at Darrell's tends to live up to the restaurant's reputation. Darrell's is a one-restaurant-fits-all kind of joint that should satisfy anyone you bring along, unless they're looking for something uber-healthy. You can get just about all of your basic fare at this south end restaurant - burgers, salads, wraps, a wide selection of appetizers, nachos, soups (corn chowder!)... the list, much like the beat, goes on!Somehow, in my first three years of living in Halifax, I failed to notice that there is actually a downstairs dining room at Darrell's. So, although I might have docked points for a tight space upstairs, the downstairs room easily makes up for this. A review of Darrell's would be blasphemy without a paragraph devoted to the peanut butter burger. It's everything it's supposed to be: very odd, very creative, very tasty. Just trust these guys and order it. They know what they're doing. And get it with Darrell fries (wedge-like slices of deep-fried awesome) and a milkshake. The burger is already going to give you a heart attack - just go for the whole experience. For the vegetarians amongst us, you can still have the peanut butter burger (just without the bacon). Darrell's has a great veggie patty that can be used as a substitute in all of the restaurant's burgers. When you need some greasy comfort food, head on down to the south end and indulge. Everyone else in Halifax has done it before.
<review# 838,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2012,5/27/2012,28,42,1,3,3>Love the place since they moved from up the street.  Lots of little sitting rooms where you can get away from the loud music if you so desire.  Wednesday's Karaoke night is always fun although Wednesday is really an inconvenient day for people like me who have to work in the morning.  I try to make it a point of taking the odd vacation day on a Thursday so I can stay out for karaoke the night before.I'm not a huge fan of the 'loud music dance scene' but occasionally, I've been know to cut a rug with folks at Menz and when I do, I must say the music selection is usually always just what I'm looking for.
<review# 839,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/20/2011,5/26/2012,66,321,5,4,3>A Catholic book/gift store.A gay Buddhist.Huh.So, we are not exactly a match made in heaven (That's the only pun. I promise.) but I'm actually a big fan of this little store.First off, let's talk about the "staff." It's actually run by volunteers. And you can tell - these aren't just people who are here to make a buck. They actually care about the store, the church and you! Always helpful and willing to spend time with you one-on-one but without being overbearing.The content is ... well, it's a Catholic bookstore. So there are lots and lots of books. I actually bought two books here; 1) a guide to being a godparent, 2) a picture bible for my goddaughter. Beyond my limited interest, they have a huge selection of reading material, covering all aspects of Catholicism and putting it into every day practice.Beyond the books though, they have vast array of paraphernalia - everything from jewelry to bumper stickers. If you're looking for a gift relating to a Catholic/Christian life event, this is the place to get it. Baptisms, communions, wedding days, etc are all covered in the gift selection here.The space itself is fantastic. It's very relaxing and warm. Shelves and racks are placed with enough space between them that you won't feel claustrophobic or worried about banging into things.All in all, this may not be the store for you, but it's great for what it is.
<review# 840,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/11/2012,5/25/2012,21,105,2,4,2>After a hard day off (wink), I picked up my husband as he got off work and we ventured downtown for a drink and appetizer. After much debate, we decided to try the Drawing Room and I am very glad that we did. Up the stairs in the Henry House, this room is classy, cozy, elegantly decorated and not over crowded. There are dark exposed rafter beams, wainscotting all around, Leather banquettes, dark wooden chairs and tables that have an old fashion more rich feel to them. There were windows all around with a nice view of the surroundings. The place looks well kept. We ordered the Warm Spincach Artichoke dip which I am quite certain is the best I've ever had!  We also had a serving of their hand cut fries that were perfect with malt vinegar.  I had mistakenly asked for balsamic, but the server was keen enough to catch my error and bring me Malt. We were very pleased with the service here! My drink of choice was Pimm's Cup. Gin with muddled strawberry and ginger syrup. It was garnished with a fresh strawberry half, a sliver of cucumber and sprig of mint. The straw was stainless steel with a stir disc on the end. I love a metal straw (no plastic waste). My husband enjoyed a 15yr Glenfiddich on the rocks and a Granite Brewery Peculiar. No complaints there. The music was old style, jazzy.  The bartenders seemed to know what they were doing and took pride in their artistry. We would gladly go back again. Just the two of us, or as a small group, it is a great little hidden gem. They are open limited days/hours.
<review# 841,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2012,5/24/2012,14,61,2,7,3>I haven't been to Saege in a couple of years, but visited recently to take in the $10 pizza and pasta special on Wednesday evening. Forget "cellar door" - for me, the two most beautiful words in the English language are "cheap carbs". I had previewed Saege's online menu picand ked out a pasta and a pizza that sounded especially tasty, so I was surprised once we arrived and the pizza/pasta menu was made up of completely different offerings. We learned that the Wednesday special menu changes every week - fair enough. I opted for the roasted vegetable pizza, which was lovely and big enough for leftovers the next day. We decided to get dessert as well. Saege's dessert menu is really impressive (in fact, it would be a great place to go just for dessert and coffee if that's your thing). I had a scoop of mango sorbet and one of coconut ice cream because I was in a tropical mood. Delicious!! I remember my first visit to Saege as being kind of 'meh' but after this experience I'll go back again. The menu is reasonably priced, even if you don't happen to go on a Wednesday, and they are very accommodating to vegetarian/vegan diners. The atmosphere is just fancy enough but still comfortable, and it's great for people watching.
<review# 842,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2012,5/23/2012,24,40,3,12,4>The other day I found myself craving an old restaurant. You know the type, wooden rafters and exposed brickwork... At first I couldn't think of any, but then it dawned on me that The Press Gang fit this description perfectly and I had been dying to try it for some time now!I looked first at the online menu and chose the sumac spiced lamb in a lavender sauce, and my mouth was watering the whole way there.A table was selected, and the menu arrived. I could not get over how truly intimate the restaurant was. A pianist played light classics in the main area illuminated by soft light. It truly was magical. I would expect nothing else from a restaurant that is based in one of the oldest stone structures in Halifax, dating back to 1759. If walls could talk!The server then approached to take my order, which I was firmly resolved to the lamb with the addition of the Dragon's Breath cheese & leek mussels (13$)... But then the waitress read off a choice that was too good to pass up, and might as well have been tailored directly to my tastes: rosemary spiced ostrich in a Jack Daniels sauce on a bed of German spaetzle (38$). After the requests were made, I lavished in Halifax fine linen dining at its finest. The bread was warm and crusty, the silver-wear was well designed, the waitstaff was attentive, and the water was amply dispensed. The majority of patrons were old friends and couples who all seemed to be having an equally wonderful time.My appetizer arrived strangely with a spoon. The mussels were delightfully light with a hint of cream to them. However, my real joy was to come... I tentatively dipped the bread in the sauce and relished in the rich taste of cream and blue cheese that soaked the bread. The waitress quickly glided in to explain the reason for the spoon, the broth is suggested to be drunk as the most delicious soup! And I am most surprised to say that I drank the entire thing, for the first time ever!The entree was next and was everything I had dreamed. The ostrich was cooked rare and was deliciously spiced. The many spices rubbed on it led to a symphony of flavours that culminated in the smoky sweetness of the sauce. I have to also admit that the spaetzle was scarily addicting.The Press Gang is the perfect place to go on a a special date with that very special someone. There is even the most intimate table that  have seen, behind a curtain in a secluded corner.One thing I will say about my trip to The Press Gang, is that I am glad I went off menu because it gives me an excuse to go back!
<review# 843,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2011,5/22/2012,15,59,2,4,2>If you're looking for comfort food, the Mic Mac Bar & Grill is your place. The Mic Mac Bar & Grill serves all types of pub/tavern fare. Although they're best known for their steak, burgers, and the steak/lobster combo. Prices are very fair and the portions are generously unfinishable. I always seem to have enough for a leftover late night snack. Servers are quick, friendly, and run the place like a well oiled machine. The menu is a picture filled seizure of choice with so many highlights. The "Try our Famous Mic Mac Burger" is one such gem. If you like choice this place is for you. Every pub favorite seems to grace the menu. Potato skins, nachos, ribs, fish and chips, and even lobster. If you arrive during the dinner rush you may have trouble finding a table, especially if you have more than two people. If you wait (and you should, because it's so worth it) it's usually not for long. The same goes for parking. The lot can be squishy but there is overflow directly across the street. Although the inside of the place is nothing to write home about (it's pretty ugly) the food more than makes up for it. I'm unsure why, but in the upper dining room there is an incredibly detailed painting of the Mic Mac Bar & Grill on fire. Tiny people flee from its doors while others continue to dine despite the horrific danger. A great conversation piece despite the strangeness factor.Overall, it's deliciously addictive an one of my few go-to restaurants in Dartmouth.
<review# 844,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2012,5/21/2012,49,70,2,2,2>I'm definitly a fan of sushi. There's no denying it.I love my raw fish wrapped in rice and seaweed.We stopped in at Hamachi house not that long ago and really enjoyed their food. Their take on sushi has to be one of the best in the city. It's fresh, flavourful and well rolled.My only complaint and why it's a 4 and not a 5 star rating is that the location is tiny. I felt like we had the smallest table in the back corner and not only were we sitting on top of other dinners and each other, but we were sitting on top of other dinners. It just seems like a shame to waste such great food on such a tiny location.The evening we went we had our very first experience with butterfish and wow. just wow.....It was an amazing experience and we can't wait to have it again!
<review# 845,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2012,5/20/2012,7,40,,4,3>So last Friday night a group of us made the long (not really but feels like it) drive to Bedford. This little pub was a jumping we had to wait for a seat (not long) and when we did get one they fit the 5 of us in no prob. Now this maybe bit of a odd complaint but I hated the chairs they were so uncomfortable and kind of the wrong height for the table. The food was really good, everything seemed fresh, well flavoured and really well priced. I did order something that I did not love (crab cakes) but these were something kind of different for me to order so I do not blame Finbars for this.The highlight for the evening was our server, I wish I got her name she was efficient, friendly and knew the menu inside and out. She made our experience 100% pleasant and if the rating was based on just her it would have been a 5.
<review# 846,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2012,5/19/2012,16,94,,3,3>I have only been here for drinks (cute little menu with lots of options) but would definitely love to come here for some food! :DGreat drinks -- Sparkling wine and blueberry (really any of the flavors)Try something new? -- Gin and Apple. Seriously its amazing, no lies!
<review# 847,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2012,5/17/2012,65,111,2,8,2>I've been coming to MacAskill's for years, yet I've only had a few meals here. A couple of my girlfriends and I used to come on Friday nights for dessert and coffee. What kept us coming back? The quiet, comfortable lounge (prettier now due to a recent renovation), the best view in HRM, friendly servers who didn't mind us lingering for long evenings of laughter and girl talk, and excellent coffee. I've had some great times here. MacAskill's has a decent selection of desserts from Swiss Lemon Mousse to German Chocolate Torte with Bavarian Cream to Creme Brulee and more. I was a little disappointed to see they removed the fondue for 2 and the mint chocolate brownie in the recent menu/decor overhaul. They did add Dee Dee's ice cream to the dessert menu, but it's still lacking a little something. The desserts are very... grown up. They could use an option or two with a simpler taste - even just a standard cheesecake in addition to the cheesecake of the day. Speaking of... I tried the cheesecake of the day a couple weeks ago - gingerbread cheesecake with butterscotch sauce. It was the best cheesecake I've had in a long time. And the coffee alone is worth the visit - I believe it's Java Blend. Today a friend and I decided to try out the brunch menu. We both had eggs benny, potato wedges, mimosas and coffee. I am an eggs benny fanatic, and let me tell you. This was one of the best I've had in the city. The eggs benny is served on a freshly baked biscuit, and you can choose spinach or caesar salad instead of potato wedges. I don't know how the salads are here, but trust me - get the potato wedges. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. So good. The mimosas were so tasty. And you already know how I feel about the coffee.I plan to come by for Happy Hour some day soon. Appys on the bar menu are half price from 4 - 6:30, and local beer and wine goes on special. Also, no corkage fees on Thursdays, and no corkage fee period if you bring a Nova Scotia wine.
<review# 848,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/6/2011,5/16/2012,32,111,,4,2>Last night I had dinner for the first time at Gio. Gio was a second choice because we couldn't get a reservation at our first choice and it turns out it should have been our first pick. Lucky us! I should have come here years ago.Yes, it's located in a hotel means it could be generic and stiff, but instead the dining room has a modern, relaxed feel. And it is fine dining which I thought meant the prices would be uberexpensive. My friends and I were surprised to discover the value-priced prix fixe menu--$45 for three courses. Needless to say all four of us went for that.The menu had a wide range of meat and seafood choices including lobster. All the dishes were creative and intriguing. No stuffy same old, conventional dishes here.I had the pork belly slider as my app. This high-end version of dim sum, tender pork belly on a steamed bun, was delicious. For my main, I had pheasant which our server accurately described as being similar to chicken (I had been thinking duck), but with a richer taste. The pheasant breast was stuffed with pear & pheasant confit, fois gras torchon, seared mushroom and served with onion cardamom purée, potato gnocchi, blueberry jus, and green beans. I'd never cook this myself so I enjoyed every bite and added pheasant to my favourite meat list.Often with a prix fixe menu, you have limited choices for dessert. We were surprised to be able to order off the regular dessert menu. Everything looked good, but I chose the Bee's Knees (burnt honey ice cream, crunchy honeycomb, angel food cake berry compote in lavender honey syrup, lemon curd) and now I have a new favourite dessert here in Hali. My friends ordered the crisps which also looked amazing and was served with a small glass of Jost ice wine.The service was attentive if not a little slow paced. Our server was helpful with directions as well. For example, when the palate cleansing sorbet arrived on a small disc-like plate and we were glancing around for our cutlery, she informed us it was meant to be tipped back. The only disappointment of the evening was a lemondrop martinin I ordered that didn't come with a sugared rim. The wine list had a wide variety of choices and we enjoyed a nice Spy Valley pinot noir with our meals.We closed the place down near midnight but didn't feel any pressure to leave. The whole experience was refreshing and a nice change from the typical Halifax dining scene. I'll definitely be back!
<review# 849,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2012,5/15/2012,38,87,3,5,4>You should take a class here. No, seriously. I took Intro to Letterpress through NSCAD Extended Studies and enjoyed my seven weeks so much that I signed up for a second time. I'm completely hooked on letterpress. The teacher (Niko) totally knows her stuff and getting your hands dirty with type and ink is so much fun. Classes aren't super cheap ($275+tx), but it includes all your supplies plus lots of chances to print yourself some pretty art or a recipe or a book cover or a nice poem. I also recommend stopping here if they have an open house for Nocturne or the holidays. You'll get a chance to try your hand at some letterpress and walk away with a small memento of the event (I have two posters of tweets by friends on my wall from a Nocturne two years ago).
<review# 850,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2012,5/14/2012,11,51,,8,3>I watched as this place was getting put in, and once I found out it was open, was chomping at the bit to go try it.The order sheet was a bit confusing, but the server was more than happy to walk me through it.  The first thing crossing my mind was how to not blow the budget, up until I found out it was the fixed cost.Once I ordered, dishes came fast and furious up to the point that the restaurant got extremely busy (near empty when I showed up, but filled really quickly).  After that there was a notable gap between dishes; during which a server actually came up and asked if I was finished, to which I had to point out that I wasn't even halfway through my order.  This was perhaps the biggest peeve.Aside from that, while the portions were modest, they tasted great and was a crazy good value for the price.Definitely going back!
<review# 851,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/29/2012,5/13/2012,39,80,,5,3>Tara and I love our North End neighbourhood. We waited with anticipation for the Highland Drive Storehouse and Butchery to open. We walked by for weeks and peeked through the tears in the brown paper on the windows to see how things were progressing...and finally - this weekend it was open! Jessi and the crew at Highland Drive were worth waiting for. Our first visit on Saturday (April 28/12) was really to explore and make our game plan for delicious meals to come. We sampled a complimentary gingerbread with whipped herb marrow butter and when Jessi heard that Tara and I eat paleo she gave us a brown paper back of crackins' to sample. (that's fried pork skin/fat which is quite the treat).We bought a jar of Apple Maple Butter and a jar of pickled beets to take home. Receipts are old school, just like the butchers you remember, and Jessi asked our names. Felt like top quality customer service to me. The Storehouse is a perfect addition to the Hydrostone, fresh local veggies, cheese, eggs and all of the meat of my dreams, plus preserves and delights on the shelves. Not to mention it seems Jessi and the crew at Highland Drive love to integrate their talents with the goodness already in the Hydrostone Market. Today (April 29.12) Tara and I walked by Liquid Gold and Jessi was exhibiting her salad making skills and how her greens pair well with some of the oils and vinegars for sale. Plus giving away homemade chocolate chip cookies. Heaven! I love the vintage style with modern flair. Even the clean cut and patterned uniforms that Jessi and team wear with vintage buttons add to the charm. Tara and I have every intention of being regulars around here.
<review# 852,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/1/2012,5/12/2012,17,11,2,5,4>Continuing my exposé on Halifax's 'Rock-Star Restos' with Estia, which is in one word, delightful.Greek restos are pretty common in Hali but Estia tops the lot of 'em.  Actually, the menu is more general 'Mediterranean' than exclusively Greek.  I eat here A LOT, I have tried many of the menu items and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed.  You know a place is good when you can't get a meal out of your head and at Estia there are at least five things on the menu that I get pregnancy-level cravings for.  The menu is HUGE, so set aside some time to peruse, savour and drool.  My go-to dish is the lamb burger with a side of lemon-roasted potatoes and tzatziki.  The saganaki (kefalograviera cheese flambéed table side with Metaxa brandy) is TDF, as is the pastitsio, yemista... hell, it's all amazing.   They do a pretty spectacular brunch and there are endless vegetarian options and a pretty extensive gluten-free menu to boot.  Plus if you let the staff know of any dietary requirements the kitchen will readily oblige.Man, the staff.  Estia gets my five-star vote just for the food but when you add the staff to the mix you just want to give this place six stars.  Maria and Peter, the owners, treat their staff like family and it truly shows.  Every person here is knowledgeable, friendly, happy and accommodating and Maria is always doing the rounds, visiting with customers.  If there was a 'Nicest Owners in Halifax' award, Estia would scoop it year after year.Estia's mantra is 'Yiamas!' (cheers to our health!) and you can taste the sincerity of this sentiment in every bite.
<review# 853,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2011,5/10/2012,29,166,,33,8>Couldn't resist giving this little place a 5 star!  Ok it is in a strip mall in Lower Sackville, but you will not be going here for the view. You will be going for the food. It seems everything in this place is made on site from cakes to sauces to cakes with sauces. I had the Rueben which is served on a pretzel bread. This is a great little loaf that has some sturdy texture to go with the smoked meat and sauerkraut. The meat was nicely warmed up in a skillet, the sauerkraut was nicely dry an crunchy and together they made up the tastiest Ruben ever!The French onion soup on the other side of the table was thick and filling. The homemade gingerbread came in a pool of rum butter sauce heaven.  The chef had the piece sitting upright in the sauce so as not to get waterlogged - saucelogged?  With whipped cream on one side and vanilla ice cream on the other it looked like the gingerbread was floating on clouds with its base surrounded by liquid gold. YUM!One note, this is not fast food. Our food arrived as soon as it was ready - as witnessed by the perfect temperatures - hot for the soup and fries, warm for the gingerbread and cold for the creams (whipped and iced respectfully). Fantastic place on the strip!
<review# 854,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2012,5/9/2012,12,118,2,5,2>So I have never had sushi before, and wanted to try something new so I was open minded. I definitely enjoyed the dining experience at Sushi Shige and I am no longer a sushi virgin!A group of us (7 in total) ventured to this location in Halifax and were comfortably seated after putting two tables together. I looked at the menu blankly not really understanding how to read it and what the different types of sushi meant, but family at the table helped me with this. I decided on the shrimp tempura roll, the California roll, and two peices of the Tamago (fried egg) Nigiri style. As a last minute decision, I also opted for the Gyoza as an appetizer. My boyfriend is not a sushi fan so he ordered the Chicken Teriyaki dinner with miso soup. Others ordered a variety of sushi types as well.The Gyoza (dumplings) were amazing, and I could have ate more than 5 of them. My boyfriend did not like the miso soup so I tried it and was not a huge fan either. Too much green onion and my palate was not a fan of the flavor combination. When my sushi came out it looked very pretty, and I enjoyed being able to see the Japanese chef make it in the open concept sushi kitchen. I loved the shrimp tempura roll but did not overly enjoy the california roll. I think the roe (fish eggs) put me off, but otherwise it was not too bad. The Tamago Nigiri was interesting as well, but it tasted fine. My boyfriend was disappointed with his dinner because it was quite a small portion for the price. It consisted of 1 peice of cauliflower, 1 piece of brocilli, 3-4 tiny carrots, and some chicken, with a small bowl of sticky rice. He understood it was a sushi place so theyre not known for non-sushi dishes but he was expecting more. Everyone else enjoyed their meals as well and our server was very nice and made sure our drinks were always full.Overall, I enjoyed the experience and my default sushi for now will be shrimp tempura, although next time I will try another type until I find something else that is yummy as well. Sushi Shige is a cozy place in Halifax that I would recommend as a reasonably priced sushi option for what you get - although I am still a newbie.
<review# 855,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/24/2012,5/8/2012,34,91,,5,2>Decided to try the newest offering to the burbs and see what it has to offer. Was there at 5:30 on a Sunday evening and it was surprisingly empty. We settled into a window booth to look through the ample menu. It was somewhat difficult to read as the print is small and the light is low. We started with California rolls and Dynamite rolls. Both were good but I liked the warm Dynamite rolls. I realized after we got them the waiter never asked if we wanted regular or spicy :) The presentation was nice on the plates.For our entrees we ordered Pad Thai and Pad Med Mamuang. I found the Pad Thai to be Ok, nothing exceptioanl but the Pad Med Mamuang was amazing. Believe it or not after all this food I still had a little room so I ordered the Banana Tempura. The warn fried banana and the mango and coconut ice cream was delicious and really topped the meal off.The restaurant had a really nice feel and the hosts at the door were very nice. There was two items that prevented me from rating it five star. One was our waiter, he really was unhelpful in suggesting anything and not asking fully what options we wanted with out meal. We are sushi noobs so that would have been nice. The other thing is soda refills, if you are going to charge 2.00 for a small glass at least give one refill, I don't drink pop but my other half does.All in all with this amount of food and for 2 of us to walk out stuffed for about 58.00 we will be back to give the wait staff another look

The veg are always fresh and crisp it gets so busy on the weekend that I prefer take out. The kitchen is really consistent except for a few shrimp had their veins. One of my favs in the neighbourhood! Could use a better interior decorator though.
<review# 857,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2012,5/6/2012,26,94,2,8,2>I am always excited by good eats arriving in Dartmouth, and even better about 3 minutes of driving from me, probably could've used the walk to and fro given I was about to eat a burger and poutine! I'm going to hit this in 3 ways: Atmosphere/location, Good, Not Quite There...Atmosphere: tucked into a strip mall in Woodside, the space is small with seating for 15-20 squeezed in, which is probably okay. However, while they are having constant line-ups out the door it seems on the small side. It looks like a nice spot, colors, and style work. What I found cool is because you see the line and are a foot from everyone serving you, you get to hear all the back and forth. The sous chef (I think he was) reject food that wasn't quite right, asking for answers to his questions, getting time on when the burger would be done... like watching a show on the Food Network.Good: Well, the food! I got the TNT Spicy Burger and a small poutine. The burger was a good burger and a good size too. It had sliced jalapenos, Chris Brothers (I think) slices of pepperoni, and chipotle mayo. Jack cheese too. There look like a number of other great choices too: Lamb burger, Salmon, etc. The fries were good fries and the gravy was fine, not outstanding. Chef Michael Smith was on hand and for the over an hour I was there he was largely perched at the back of the place by where your burger gets finished. By the time I got there I think he was being put to work doing some prep.Not Quite: Others have mentioned this and I found the same, skimpy on toppings. I love guac and thought it would be a good foil to all the spice of my burger, but so little was put on it was lost in the heat. I asked for more onions because about 4 small slivers made it on the first attempt. Also, I found there to not be a lot of cheese curds on the poutine.I went with the 4 stars because I think the burger is good enough for it and am hopeful the skimpyness will subside. I will reserve the right to revisit the rating on subsequent visits.Finally, the owner made a point of at least once coming out from behind the counter (where he was working - fries, gravy, stocking stuff) to talk to folks and tell him he appreciated their patience.
<review# 858,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/20/2012,5/4/2012,61,77,5,4,3>Slight confession. I knew the street Tom's was on for awhile but Icould NEVER find it. Partly because I don't wear my glasses half thetime when I should. But I'm super glad I found it because I super loveTom's. It's so quaint with SO much personality from ceiling to floor.I just can't even describe it. Like if the walls could talk. Adornwith empty scotch boxes, dim lighting, and candles everywhere thisplace is a peach. It's the perfect collection of a wild bunch ofpeople. The guy who drinks alone, the hipsters, the couple on a firstdate, etc. It's super electic.We popped in and didn't really have a place to sit but the place wasjust so charming we forgave it. We stood and drank our caesar's whichI've placed far up on my list of favorites. I knew it was going to bedelicious when she asked if we wanted horseradish. HELLS to the YES. Icould've had another and another and another. As The Coast's secondrunner up for the best caesar in 2011, I should've mentally prepared.Our visit was short and sweet but I so desparately need to go back andsoak in a few more hours with the walls.
<review# 859,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2012,5/3/2012,38,94,,6,3>Monday lunch time visit after their 1st week being opened. I dropped shortly after 11am, place was more or less empty but it was expected as Dartmouth crossing was pretty dead. Got seated right away and got my Sam Adams lager right away. The menu was standard pub fair and prices were inline with what you would expect.Nachos with guacamole and 3 beer (I was there for a while) came up ~32$ while the beef barley soup came up to just above 12$. Nice presentation with the dishes, the nachos were good but like every other pub, seems overpriced IMO.It's not a large spot, maybe seating for 30, but while it ended up being half full at peak lunch time, the tunes was a little too loud.The seating are either high top table & stools or tables with a couple of booths.The staff were friendly and were able to pay at our table with the debit machine.I'll drop by here again, this might be the right kind of spot if you are here non typical hours, like waiting for someone while they shop.

YaySo as you may know, I'm a huge Butter Chicken fan and this place has got one of the best Butter Chicken plates in the HRM. Wanting to try this place for a while I decided to grab some take-out tonight. The combo BC plate came with a large portion of basmati rice, salad and naan bread lightly toasted with garlic. It was pretty amazing. The BC was creamy and flavorful, and the rice was seasoned.DE offers a buffet on Monday evenings and Saturday lunchtime which I will be participating in. Yes, yes I will.The restaurant itself is quite small, but very cute. I look forward to dining in soon. Although my interaction with staff was limited, they left a great first impression.
<review# 861,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/11/2011,5/1/2012,30,26,2,3,2>Ever walked into a place and felt like you were being taken for a ride? Like not a good one, one where you feel like everything about their products are just BS and you can see right through the fancy pants marketing and signage? Well my friends, Liquid Gold is the complete opposite. I wandered in here last Christmas having heard about the concept and looking for a good present for my foodie/chef mother. Amongst a large group of women I was greeted by a kind man with a beard (who I'd come to find out is one of the owners) who immediately made me feel welcome. He gave me the low down on the place in an unpretentious manner that didn't make me feel like as a 26 year old I should be out drinking Red Bull and not tasting olive oil. I still can't get over how distinctive each one of their olive oils and vinegars are. Wine, I find, is very subjective, while I found the palette descriptions for each of their oils and vinegars to be very accurate to what I was tasting. The setup is very nice with large stainless steel vessels and little spouts to pour yourself a sampler. Everytime I've been in the staff have been always helpful, offering pairing suggestions and recommendations. I've tasted a variety of their oils and vinegars and truly feel they are worth their weight in... well liquid gold.

You might get better prices elsewhere but only on a  sale. The place is clean, clean and the staff is very helpful. You won't believe how much they can put in one big room.There is not only meat but, prepackaged deli meats, cheese, dairy and all kinds of frozen product including meat, veg, fruit & berries and frozen entrees.  And the the best part of their new expansion is the produce department.  Great prices and the best looking fresh veg and fruit I've seen anywhere.  Any time I've been there the produce manager is working hard at keeping everything stocked and looking good.They have a $100 meat draw monthly for $1 with proceeds going to local charities. You can sign up for their weekly emails and find out all the great deals.  I'm guessing their recent expansion means they are doing well which means they will be around a long time.  I hope so it's so nice to see the local grocers doing well.

Ranging from vintage, gourmet and common goodies to weird and wacky toys, etc. Freak Lunchbox is a fun place to visit if you haven't before or even if you have.I went there the first time the other day with big expectations, and although I was struck with some nostalgia seeing candies I haven't seen since I was a wee one, I was a little disappointed in how small the size of the store was because of how crowded it was.I could hardly enjoy browsing all the products, because there was almost always someone trying to get through the tight quarters. For how popular the store is you'd think they would expand to a bigger place, but I guess that could be easier said than done.Great place for candy if you don't mind small crowded areas.
<review# 864,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2012,4/28/2012,4,24,3,3,3>I've only been to a Mano twice and the first time, although I was impressed with the decor the food didn't blow me away. This time however, boy did they change my opinion! The atmosphere is still really great - black and white movies on plasma screens and cozy tables for small groups with a great view.We got there without a reservation so we did need to wait at the bar for a bit - but we all ordered drinks and chatted with the bartender.  Before we knew it our table was ready our drinks were taken to our seats and we decided to spend all night here. We ordered apps to share, big mains and tall desserts and every last one of them were delicious!  I ordered the calamari, beef tenderloin and the coppa meringata and let me tell you they were all a sight to behold. Plus they tasted amazing!! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals (and their drinks) and before we knew it we has spent 4 hours there. The prices are decent - pricey for some, but it doesn't have to be if you choose wisely (not that I ever do). It does get a little lively (aka loud) in the evenings but honestly that's kind of what I'd expect from a good Italian restaurant. The service is good and they will take your cue on the speed you want your meal to take, which is much appreciated!

Toys, games, single issue comics, trades/graphic novels/hard covers, books, card games, if you've got a nerd passion for it, they have it or will order it for you!Check the place out if you're shopping for a new shop, or even just looking for a break from the same old thing everywhere else!
<review# 866,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/16/2012,4/26/2012,11,41,2,2,2>After visiting this place tonight, I have found my new pet shop! After going through round one of obedience training with my westie puppy (luckily she didn't eat her certificate like a friend's pup did), the trainer at Fetch highly recommended Planet Paws because of their love of Shubie Park and the food-knowledge of the owner, I decided to trot over to see what all the fuss was about.I went with many purposes in mind - to check out different food options for my possibly-allergic-to-everything puppy, to get a harness so I can walk my dog in harmony with all the other new (delicious?) springtime animals roaming around, and to get some new chewy snacks for my dog to munch on. This place has it all, I was so impressed not only by the variety of the products but also by the staff who were all super helpful! We tried on a few harnesses and I got to walk my pup around the store to try it out, and I waited my turn to talk to the food guru who gave me some great insight into what's best to feed my dog. I walked out with a new harness, a free bag of shubie snacks (their own homemade snackies, all proceeds go to the shubie park fund!) and a couple small bags of food that are low on the food allergy scale to see if my dog stops her butt munching.The staff genuinely care about my dog and answered all questions that I had, I will definitely go back (I was encouraged to, so they can see how my doggie is faring), and luckily I can transfer my food bag counts that I had accrued at another local store to their store so I can still get my free bag eventually. Fab! And the store is super pet friendly, so bring your dog for a drink and a snack :)

The walls of my apartment are covered with strange photos or paintings i have found on my day to day travels. With that said ...Around chistmas time I have found this local artist, it was love at first sight !  He can be found weekly at the Halifax farmers market each weekend. His table is littered with a mix of screen printed tops ;which feature his quirky works of art, tote bags large and small prints of all of his work. My ultimate favorite is the zombie beaver " welcome to Canada" baseball top and it cosst as much as any other top you would buy in the mall. Plus it has zombie beavers !! Should there not be any in your size or in the style you want he does take orders however it might take about a week to receive it. I highly recommend you go to the market and check out the awesomeness that is The Quarrelsome Yetti.
<review# 868,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2012,4/24/2012,8,168,3,2,3>I was asked to go to Duncan's Cove by a friend who had never been and her friend who had been several times.  I was told we would be going on a hike, but there are certainly different interpretations of that word, so I was still a little unsure of what to expect. I think I was anticipating a step up from Shubie Park.  Well it certainly was. For those of you reading this, this is what I like to call the "princess perspective".  I am not what you would call "outdoorsy" but certainly have an appreciation for nature and enjoy getting outside. That being said, this was a little out of my wheelhouse.  Just a short drive from the city, Duncan's Cove is one of the most beautiful spots I have been in a long time.  Reminded me a lot of Peggy's Cove.  Keeping in mind my girly  perspective, the hike itself was a little more on the hike side than the walking side.  There were several spots where you have to avoid some muckiness, do some rock jumping and a few spots where I found myself thinking, "don't look down".  I was very happy to be there with someone who had been before because she knew the trail well, but if you are a first timer I would say it is pretty self explanatory, especially if you are an experienced outdoorsman/woman unlike myself :)  When we arrived at the turnaround spot, a small old barracks from which I can assume was used as a lookout for approaching enemy ships, I was happy for the rest.  The way back seemed easier that the way up, although just as well were approaching the final minutes of the hike, I did stumble on a rock resulting in a yucky bruise the following day.  Be sure to watch where you're going!  Overall, Duncan's Cove passes the princess test. It was beautiful, not too hard to navigate and a great workout.  I would recommend wearing proper footwear, sneakers will do if you don't have hiking shoes, but you might not want to wear your sparkly white ones, as they won't be sparkly white at the end!

I had a favorite spot called "Mad Hat Tea" that fulfilled all my needs in the drinkage of the tea. When I moved to Halifax, I brought the last of my favorite blend of Mad Hat Tea because I just couldn't leave it behind ("My Throat Hurts"). A few days ago, I used the last of the tea.I was sad. Until I found Sawadee. It was early in the morning so there were no other patrons in this cute little "if you don't know what you're looking for you'd miss it" hole in the wall place. Hundreds of teas to choose from I didn't know where to start until Mie Mie asked me what I was looking for."Something spicy"5 minutes later and a few good sniffs of some tasty tasty blends I left with two bags of tea, a fig bar and an extra teabag sample of something she thought I might like. It's small and cozy with a few tables in a loft like area to stay and enjoy lunch along with shelves of all the necessary tea accesories and I think I would have a hard time if there was a large crowd (which I hear it can get pretty busy) but I went at the perfect time, found the perfect tea and don't long for my Mad Hat tea quite as much.

<review# 872,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2012,4/20/2012,40,216,6,4,2>First off the bat, if your restaurant is named "Wang's", you probably shouldn't have a phallus-like fish in your logo, just sayin.'. Now that that is out of the way, the review.I have been here a couple times before, so I thought this would be a good location to ring in the (Chinese) new year by stuffing my face with some good Chinese food, and Wang's didn't disappoint. The restaurant is decorated with more subtlety and less kitsch than many Chinese restaurants, although it has a noticeable Chinese flare with some red lantern shades and ink paintings which are a nice choice instead of the typical water-colour landscapes. My other half and I arrive early as I wanted to beat any potential rush, but even at its worst, the front part of the restaurant was never much more than half full.We order a few different dishes to cover our bases - almond chicken gai ding, black bean sauce beef, mushrooms with tender greens and a large order of steamed rice, as well as a pot of jasmine tea from their impressively large selection of teas. The food took a surprisingly long time to arrive considering only one table ordered before us, but fortunately my girlfriend and I are a talkative bunch....and there was a guy with a rat tail at the table next to us to judge and mock. Oh, and he had a borderline mullet too. When our food arrived, we realized we should have either ordered less or sat at a larger table because there was a LOT. The chicken was tender and plentiful although the mushrooms that came with the greens were on the chewy side, either from overcooking or because they were rehydrated, I'm not sure. The black bean beef was definitely the highlight - tender beef with lots of flavour and a bit of a spicy kick, you definitely want to try this dish.Service was like it is at a lot of family restaurants - friendly and adequate, but it doesn't blow you out of the water.There were lots of leftovers which made for a great lunch the next day and the bill came to less than $50 after tax and tip. For quality food and sheer dollar value,  Wang's is a great choice!

<review# 874,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2012,4/18/2012,65,55,3,5,3>I'm in sooooooo much trouble with this new addition to Historic Properties. Although they have only just opened, my office is in the same area so I have already visited numerous times and have tried three different types of croissants. Not that I'm complaining....It looks as though they have already established themselves in a short period of time. The lounge area is now almost always full of patrons and it brings a welcome energy and smell to the building.This might shock you but the croissants are actually not my favorite item on their menu. Their chocolate chip cookies are so delicious, I just can't resist. They are perfectly baked and so large that it takes me two days to finish (I don't like sharing so that's not an option).Everyone who works there is super friendly, the prices are good and the treats are to die for. Welcome to the neighbourhood TIBS Halifax :)
<review# 875,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/4/2012,4/17/2012,0,3,2,4,2>Great place. I like the atmosphere, and the variety is great. The baristas are very friendly, and not in that obviously fake way that so many customer service people are.  Either very good actors or genuinely enjoy their job?I only tried one item off the menu so far, a chicken club wrap. For a wrap it's decently filling, and they didn't skimp on the chicken or bacon which is a plus. The price, while fair, is closer to what I'd expect to pay in a restaurant than a cafe.The only thing on my mind that could improve it is being open a little later. Since it's the only internet cafe here (that I'm aware of...) that sells liquor. The first few times I was thinking of coming here, I wanted to come in for a pint, but it was already closing time by then.

So, when I walked into Fredie's for the first time and heard they had seafood chowder, I had to get it.The thing that struck me right away was the extremely friendly staff and the time they took to introduce themselves to you. Lynn took my order and asked my name, wrote it in on top of the order, then asked for my order.  It was a small thing, but being called by name immediately makes you feel at home. The Chowder was loaded with fresh lobster, scallops, haddock bits, potatoes, onions and more... the best chowder I've had in  a long time. Just a pinch of dill would make it all the better.5 Stars for the Seafood Chowder family recipe!

No, now even business types can dab their ties in gravy before their 1 o'clock meeting.The adventurous types can top their cheesy fries with other exotic toppings, like  pulled pork, butter chicken, donair meat or stuffing, but this Quebecoise likes her poutine done the traditional way. My one complaint, while I appreciate the use of real curds, is their lack of freshness.  The best poutine will use day-of fresh curds to top their poutine.  You can tell how fresh the batch is by its squeaky resistance when you bite down on one.  These curds are soft and squeak-free, an indication that they are at least a couple of days old.  The flavour is still there, but I do miss the squeak.  Even still, it won't prevent me from chowing down on a carton of the stuff.
<review# 878,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2011,4/13/2012,18,60,2,3,3>I went to Dirty Nelly's with a friend to catch up. We started with the Rustic Potato chips, which are essentially Potato Skins made with Kettle Chips. They were  awesome. There were lots of them. Definitely enough for two to share, but I would say they would feed up to four. Then I had the Fish and Chips. They were decent. I've had bigger pieces of fish, but it was enough to fill me. They make their own tartar sauce, which (I think) was chipotle style. It was good, but I would have preferred normal tartar. My friend had the cheese steak sandwich. She liked hers as well. I tried it, and the sauce was a little too sweet for me. I really enjoyed the service. Our waitress never left us waiting, but was also not too over-bearing. Offered good advice, and the food was quick. Ambiance was perfect for catching up with a friend.
<review# 879,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2011,4/12/2012,76,115,2,9,3>Last month I realized I needed a haircut more then I have ever needed a haircut in my entire life. My hair had not been trimmed in several months, I had 6-month old half-grown out colour that had faded to the max, and I was *thisclose* to taking the razor to the whole thing ala. Britney. I am particular about my hair and about it looking good so I don't like to trust it to just anyone. Seeing as my hairstylist I have had since BIRTH is in Cole Harbour, I now live in the North end of Halifax with no car, and she is extremely hard to get an appointment with anyway, I decided it was high time to find a place in my own hood.I had noticed Flaunt salon open up a few months before (it opened mid-October 2010) because I walk by the old house it's located in every day after work (you can't miss that big, round window in the front!). It looked like a nice, fun place, plus, you can't beat a 5 minute walk from my apartment. So, I thought I would give it a try. Well, seriously I think I had the best haircut of my LIFE that day. Now, I really really needed a haircut so to be honest, ANY change to my style would probably have made me completely over-the-moon, but it was more than that. I was randomly paired up with Laurel and she was lovely - very friendly with a sunny personality - so I felt in good hands right from the beginning. I brought a picture to give her an idea of the kind of look I wanted and she made it look exactly like that! She gave me a great asymmetrical bob style with tons of layers, but kept it long enough that I could still pull at least the front back - you know, she actually LISTENED to me (which doesn't always happen at salons, am I right, other high-maintainence hair people?).The salon itself is small (I think only 5 chairs) and so it's quiet but also encourages conversation amongst patrons. There is an air of exclusivity to it - like you are at a place that requires you to make an appointment 6 months in advance and where you could easily shell out $200 for a cut. Now, don't get me wrong, this place is a tad pricey - I was actually surprised when she told me the total at the end of my appointment and it came to $57 before tip (so almost $70 total - eeps). However, to me it was worth it because she did a great job with my cut. Also, I don't necessarily mind paying a bit more money for the convenience and experienced stylists. Unfortunately I can't speak for how much a colour or other treatments would cost but I imagine they are not cheap either.One thing that I also found a tad odd was that they don't take credit cards (only debit, cash or cheque) so those of you on a budget and who like your plastic, be forewarned. Also keep in mind that they have more limited hours than other salons (the latest they are open is 8pm and that's only one or two nights a week I think...the other nights I believe it is 6pm) and they are limiting their hours even more over the summer, so book at least a week ahead. One thing is for sure about this place - you will definitely walk out of here with something to Flaunt!
<review# 880,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2012,4/11/2012,3,14,5,3,2>My girlfriend had recently been on a radical (well, to me anyway) vegan fast when she finally succumbed to her inner carnivore and declared, "I want meat!". Of course I was more than happy to oblige.  Plus I was looking for an excuse to check out Boneheads, oh...and a good place to have my "last supper" as I was joining Weight Watchers the very next morning.  No word of a lie. I am still and will always be a foodie.  I just plan to eat differently...and less...I hope.  Anyway, I digress.  We couldn't have picked a better place to pig out.  I knew we hit the jackpot when we walked in and the place was packed, even mid afternoon on a weekday.  These people looked like they were ready to eat.  Seriously, bring your appetite and forget about table manners 'cause there ain't nothin' ladylike about eating at Boneheads.  We each ordered a "platter". Holy smokes! So much food!  You get your choice of meat (a huge honking pile of it) with corn bread, slaw and not one but TWO scrumptious sides.  I chose the mac n' cheese and sweet potato chips.  So delicious!  The pork was amazing and the mac n' cheese heavenly.I ate my face off and still had more than half leftover.  So as the old lady in the hot sauce commercial says, "I put that sh*t on everything!"...the leftover pork that is.  Made a great sandwich, topping for my salad, I could go on.And the staff seemed quite nice. The person at the counter was friendly and patient as I took forever to make up my mind and when i couldn't decide, she was helpful with suggestions.  I had to move it after all.  The people behind me looked ravenous.I am seriously contemplating saving up all my Weight Watchers bonus points for another Boneheads feast.  It would definitely be worth it.
<review# 881,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2012,4/10/2012,17,52,2,2,2>One of my Top 5 places to hang out on a sunny afternoon. What more could you ask of a park? There's cannons to play on, a number of trails to explore, a beach (which I wouldn't swim in but it's there) and a beautiful view of the harbour entrance. If you don't like dogs, this may not be the best place to go as there are tonnes of dogs with their owners - me included - but other than that, it's one of the city's many gems that make me proud to call Halifax home.
<review# 882,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2012,4/9/2012,1,3,,4,3>You can't beat the location. This Goodlife is found in the heart of the business district, and is extremely convenient for anyone living downtown.The best times to go are after 6 or the weekends, when the work crowd is nowhere to be found. The trainers are great, and the regulars are helpful - everyone is willing to spot you.The reason I'm withholding the 5 star rating is due to the size - its not the biggest location, and during peak hours (morning or 4 - 6) good luck finding time on the squat rack or bench press.

Friendly staff, free wi-fi, cheap refils (thats right!!! they only charge you $1.25 for a refil if you're there long enough and want that caffeine jolt!!!), good variety of seating choices (love seats, tables and chairs, single sofas) oh and did I mention friendly staff?!? Of course a coffee shop isn't much if the coffee isn't good; in this case, locally roasted small batch coffee is always a treat!I also love how they make you work to give them a tip :-) Huh??? Thats right!!! Although right or wrong, they'll still take your tip but rather than the boring bowl with a "tip" sign over it, these guys put some effort into finding a new multiple choice trivia question for the tip jar! Well done!Top of the morning to ya!

Then I cut myself off mid story and said "I should totally Yelp about that!"I never ate hamburgers or anything with ground beef in it. For as long as I could remember that's how it has been. And then I got drunk...... (That's how it always happens isn't it!) I had my first hamburger a little over a year ago now, a Big Mac out of all things, and fell in love.My roommate has always ordered cheeseburgers platters from Jessy's. I thought that was so weird. Who orders a hamburger from a pizza place? Well, now I do too!There burgers are very large (I think so anyway) around the same size as a Whopper actually, and very, very tasty. I don't even know what else to say about them, but if you're in the mood for a good burger in the Clayton Park area, and don't want "fast food" get one from Jessy's!
<review# 887,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2012,4/4/2012,47,445,3,6,4>I had heard a lot about Jane's on the Common as the best breakfast in Halifax. I still haven't been so I can't vouch for that, but I can say, the Coastal Cafe is AMAZING. Breakfast is my favorite meal and this unassuming cafe makes quality and innovative dishes. My husband had the Durty South and I had the Durty Burd. The Durty Burd was a nicely done breaded chicken breast topped with an egg and guacamole and bacon on a thick english muffin with a side of hash browns. The Durty South had a good amount of pulled pork on cornbread served with a side of baked beans. The prices are quite reasonable and similar to what you would pay for an average breakfast. I am definitely willing to leave the South End for this gem. My only minor gripe is that they give you very tiny beverage napkins, so be prepared to ask for more napkins. I am drooling now just thinking about that Durty Burd....

<review# 889,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2012,4/2/2012,42,100,4,8,4>This place has singlehandedly revolutionized the way I make fajitas and tacos at home. And for me, that's a big deal because taco wraps are among my favourite foods. I won't get into details about how I *now* make my mexican food but I will say I was inspired when I got beef tacos here my first time.Every time I've been here, I will admit I've gotten the same thing and it's because it was so delicious the first time. The fries are perhaps among the best fries in Halifax but it was the beef tacos that won me over. Jalapeño peppers sliced on top of the beef with your choice of salsa or sour cream in taco shells (or soft shell the second time I came here). I won't say Halifax has a wide variety of mexican choices and the way this place makes tacos likely isn't even authentic but as far as Americanized tacos go, these are the best I've had.The service was very personable. What you'd expect in a family restaurant. Why they're located all the way out in the dead side of Bayer's Lake is beyond me but it's worth the trip if you can find it. Consider it a treasure hunt. Your reward is revolutionary tacos. If only I could get beyond these tacos to actually try something else.... I'll keep you posted.
<review# 890,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2012,4/1/2012,4,11,2,3,2>First of all how can you not have a good spa experience when there are cocktails involved?? LOVE IT.  We went there on the weekend for part of a bachelorette party, recovering from the night before this was just what the doctor ordered. There were 5 of us, and they were able to accomadate us all.  We all got pedicures, and the bride got a mani and a pedi.  My esthetician was Ashley she rocked! The other girls were amazing as well, we each had a great experience and the drinks were pretty darn good too!  We brought in a veggie and fruit tray to nibble on while we got our services, but you could order in sushi or whatever else fancied your taste buds!You can tell these ladies like their job, they had great chemistry with one another which added to the whole experience. We loved the atmosphere and I would reccomend this spa for a girls night out, bachelorette parties, or just to pamper yourself!
<review# 891,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/23/2012,3/31/2012,27,83,3,4,3>For me TIBS is definitely the place to get my croissant fix. Look out for the specials like the olive croissant. Sadly, they don't make it as often. It is pricey, but for a once-in-a-while sinful and buttery indulgence, its definitely worth the price. My favourite is always the savoury types rather the sweet ones. Try the one with prosciutto if you're like me. If all those doesn't delight you than just go for the original flavoured.Thankfully they've opened a branch in Halifax, so you don't have to go all the way to Dartmouth when you have the urge to eat great croissant. The good part is, the quality is just the same. Staff are as friendly as ever - except at times when they are busy, so its understood that they'd probably won't pay much attention but, heck! you are there for the croissant, so put up with it :)
<review# 892,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2011,3/30/2012,33,8,4,5,5>Haligonians love food. This is a well-known fact, and the barrage of new restos, pubs and eateries that are popping up around Halifax reflect that irresistible desire to get our nomnom on.A while back, I heard rumours of a new bistro that was to open in the old space that Mosiac used to occupy. Before Bistro Le Coq opened, there wasn't really an outlet for foodies on the hunt for authentic French cuisine.(Before I start, let me mention that this review is a combined review, taking points from all 3 times that I have eaten at Bistro Le Coq since their grand opening in the summer.)First, let me start off by pointing out how much I appreciate authenticity in a restaurant. Everything about Bistro Le Coq hits the nail right on the head. The interior is stunning (that tin roof, c'est magnifique!), I love the black and white striped shirt uniforms and the cork menus and receipt boards are adorable!Now, let's chat about food, drinks and desserts. Bistro Le Coq has a small, specialized menu of offerings that cover a wide range of options that attempts to include everyone from vegetarians to serious carnivores. Their chicken is moist, flavourful and extremely tasty. Their gnocchi was not what I was expecting, but was still very, very kind to my taste buds. Their veggie side dishes (especially the cheesy cauliflower and savory spinach) are simple and seriously satisfying. I haven't tried everything on the menu, but thus far, nothing has left me feeling disappointed.The Fleur De Lis and Limonade Rose are the only two drinks I have tried in the three times I have visited, but they were refreshing and complemented my meals nicely.Finally, the only dessert I have tried (and the one I feel the need to mention) is the Soufflé. Mind you, the first time I went to the Bistro, our Soufflé fell flat after coming out the oven. The server apologized and offered to get us two glasses of ice wine on the house. This was unnecessary, but was a great touch to the already fabulous service. When we got it back for the second time, it was done to perfection. It was warm, luscious and creamy - the perfect end to a delicious meal. Also, after all was said and done, they didn't even charge us for the dessert!Note: I went back to the bistro again last night, and I ordered the Soufflé once again. It was light, fluffy and baked to perfection. It seems they have finally perfected the technique! Kudos. I love Bistro Le Coq, and I truly have nothing negative to say about it. The servers are all friendly, welcoming and willing to listen to any questions or concerns you may have. The atmosphere is warm and comfortable and it is the ultimate French countryside getaway in Halifax.If you haven't tried the Coq yet, check it out! (No pun intended.)
<review# 893,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2012,3/29/2012,3,31,3,4,2>I haven't been to the Argyle in many years, and the last time I was there it was strictly for late drinks with some friends.My four-year-old son and I were having a day of fun and were looking for a place to eat.  He actually picked The Argyle, he stopped right in front of the door and said "this looks like a good place for our lunch date."  So I really couldn't possibly say no to that.We both had burgers, he had The Argyle with cheese and a side Cesar salad.  I had the Southwest Burger with a side spinach salad.The burgers were great, nice size patties on toasted buns.  The patties were cooked perfectly and nice and juicy and flavourful.  The salads were just OK.  The lettuce of the Cesar was practically floating in a thick and overpowering and obviously store bought dressing.  The croutons ha a really weird fake chemically garlic and Parmesan flavour.I could go on a bit of a tangent here about the spinach salad but I won't because it's partly my own fault for not reading about the salad on the menu.  I just feel that when a restaurant is serving a "spinach salad" you have certain expectations of what that is going to be.  The spinach salad at The Argyle isn't your typical spinach salad- no mushrooms, egg slices, or mozzarella here.  It was good, but again it was swimming in dressing.  It also had more than its fair share of goat cheese.The service was fine, noting remarkable either way.  It wasn't anywhere near busy in there at 12:30 on a Friday afternoon.All in all I would have to say that we were both pleased with our meals. Nothing to write home about but good, well cooked, and promptly served with a smile.
<review# 894,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2011,3/28/2012,28,43,2,4,2>Hand-cut fries and yummy battered fish. Don't forget to try the other equally tasty items on the menu though like the poutine and fish tacos. Service is always friendly. Another great spot for take-out or hanging out at their picnic tables (weather permitting).
<review# 895,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2012,3/27/2012,2,8,,2,2>Very nice to see something like this in Halifax, the places for sartorial men to shop in Halifax is lacking. I hate to resort to online shopping rather than supporting local but it's sometimes necessary. I essentially went for the one purpose of Naked & Famous jeans (for those that don't know, they're a Canadian brand with a strong reputation all over). I was pleased to see that had quite a large inventory of the brand (which is good since there's so many types). The service was also great. I tried on an excessive amount of pairs before deciding, and he happily ran back and forth getting me new sizes types. Then I even got a 15% (or was it 10%?) student discount. Walked out a happy customer.
<review# 896,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/11/2012,3/26/2012,49,23,,4,3>Chez Tess Strikes gold again. The BrunchService: Let me begin with a slight negative. We arrived as a party of 3 with the expectation of 4th. There was no 4th, a no show.  I think the waitress thought we were waiting for the 4th so it took forever to be served. In the end we did not care as we love this place. But the waitress felt so bad she discounted our beverages from the menu. How amazing is that? Restaurant owners take heed this is service 101. We were blown away. considering most of this situation was probably partly our fault. The Food: My friend and I had the Croque Madame Sandwhich. Done proper with grilled ham, swiss and gruyere topped with a fried egg and drizzled with Dijon mustard sauce. The bread was magical and as usual from Julien's Bakery. I cannot stress how outstanding this plate was...we were in gastronomical heaven. The bread practically melted and morphed into the ham without being soggy or over saturated. It was perfection. The honey dijon sauce tasted more like a hybrid Hollondaise sauce, it was also out of this world. I have been thinking about this meal all week. We also topped off the meal by sharing the infamous Euro dessert crepe with Banana, Nutella, Caramel and whipped cream wrapped in a sweet Vanilla Crepe sprinkled with toasted almonds. We were on a high. If the sole purpose of Brunch is not to re-energize your life, then I dont know any better way to do this than to visit this place at least once a week. You will be doing yourself a favour. Chez Tess is the perfect oasis for the weekend.
<review# 897,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2012,3/25/2012,39,130,3,3,3>When it comes to quality of food and quality of service, Morris East always goes above and beyond the call of duty. We showed up at 6:30 on a Friday night to a full house and were told the wait would be about 15 minutes. 15 minutes turned in to 20 which turned in to 30, but as compensation for the wait we were treated to a few beverages and appetizers on the house. It felt like the entire staff was doing everything in their power to make us as comfortable as possible. When we did get seated our order was taken right away and the food came out quickly.1. Maple roasted butternut squash with candied walnut salad - SO delicious. It's sweet, it's savoury, it's a salad with candy in it. What's not to like?2. Stuffed mushroom cap - A good-sized portabello cap stuffed with tomato, cheese, and artichoke-cashew pesto. Delectable. If I was a vegetarian, I could eat only this and be very very happy.3. Cappriciosa pizza - I love a pizza loaded high with toppings, and this one fit the bill with mushroom, tomatoes, artichokes and chicken piled on.4. Daily special pizza - I don't know what it was, but it was like a caprese salad on a pizza with the addition of large slices of a turkey-based salami (or pastrami or pepperoni or some other meat ending in "i"). Tasty, tasty stuff. Beyond the fact that the food is fabulous, it's really the serving staff that make this place an absolute treat to visit. It just doesn't get any better than Jennie Dobbs and her crew.
<review# 898,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2012,3/24/2012,25,107,4,4,5>I really couldn't wait to write about this place. I visited this evening with a friend and though I am still feeling the effects of a (blissful, cheesecake induced) food coma, I needed to share how awesome this place is.The service was amazing- hands down the best I've had in Halifax. I felt like I was having tea and cake in an old friend's (very fancy) sitting room, not a restaurant (cheesecakery?) .I'm a big fan of the decor too- kind of boudoir, meets club, meets Gothic, meets awesome.But really, the standout above all else, was the delicious cheesecake.Pure perfection. I had a slice of cookies and cream, my friend tried the Oh Henry. Both were phenomenal. I almost got a piece of vegan Oreo cheesecake- it looked that appealing. For reals. Who knew.Anyway, while I don't think my waist line can accommodate frequent visits here, it was sure a decadent treat and will be high on my list of places to check out again.It's a shame the liquor laws on Quinpool are so backward- this place would be even more awesome than awesomesauce if I could enjoy a nice glass of wine along side of my cake. A girl can dream.....
<review# 899,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2012,3/23/2012,43,449,2,7,3>Love this little local spot that has charm and character to boot. Staff treat you like they know you, and the window to the kitchen's proximity to the tables will make you feel as if you were actually in the kitchen. (It's a good thing, though). Coffee is good, eggs are good, and when they say "ham" they mean the real stuff, not the weird sliced processed stuff. They have two potato options for breakfast - home fries and hash browns  - make sure you get clarification on which you'd like, as one is more potato chip like. Both are good, but it's good to know what'll be on your plate, especially if you're suffering from effects of the previous night! Cash only - so make sure your wallet is prepped, although it's pretty affordable fare.

Yes, you charge $5, but as I found out last night, it was so worth it. From the time I picked up the phone, until the time the bag of yummy foods was sitting on my counter was 18 minutes! Most times, my food sitting down at restaurants doesn't come that fast. The best part of the speedy delivery (besides the fact that I was super hungry) was that the quality of the food didn't diminish. The red curry chicken and cashew vegetables were pipping hot and full of hot spicy flavour. And the spring rolls, oh man the spring rolls. Generally I skip spring rolls in Asian restaurants because I find them bland and too filling. But these ones are amazing, full of textures and flavours, I could have made a meal on these alone. The fast delivery meant they were still crispy, not soggy like a typical take out roll.
<review# 901,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/30/2011,3/21/2012,74,22,4,6,5>Damn fine burritos (my go-to is a veggie with the works sans hot peppers plus mole sauce, cranberry salsa, and a bit of sour cream). I haven't tried any of their meat-y options, but the veggie is so good I don't feel like straying.Warning: you will be forced to listen to circa 1997-2005 horrible nu-metal during your visit. It is inevitable. It will be loud. Crank up your iPod and drown it out.Despite that relapse in taste, the service is fast and the food is cheap. No real complaints. I sometimes even like the music. They played Incubus the other day and my inner 16-year old squealed.
<review# 902,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2011,3/20/2012,40,34,,4,5>This convenience store has been around for years, but recently renovated and re-opened under new management.  What a change!  The old place was overpriced, dank, cramped, and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in decades.   The lady that ran it was crabby and not particularly nice to kids, which, when you are located immediately across from a school is not exactly a sound marketing strategy.  Although they promised the best milkshake in the city, I was always a little afraid to order one.The new place is bright, clean and friendly.  It has a reasonably good selection and the prices are quite reasonable.  They have expanded their selection of ice cream offerings, and at a dollar for a one scoop ice cream cone, it is very kid-friendly.  They have also added coffee, and although I have not tried it myself, I have noticed alot more people stopping in for their morning cup of joe on my way to work.  They have held little get-togethers during community events like the fireworks, and with sitting areas inside and out, it has become a bit of a gathering spot for people in the neighbourhood.  My only complaint is their selection of whole wheat baked items is virtually non-existent and they occasionally run out of the very item I am looking for: such are the limitations of this size of operation.  All in all, the new owners have done a great job, and I really hope the neighbourhood supports them and they make a go of it.
<review# 903,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/9/2012,3/19/2012,19,100,3,4,3>This has got to be the prettiest little boutique downtown. Any time of the year it's worth a browse - for edgy clothes, gorgeous jewelry, nifty housewares, interesting cosmetics, even kid and baby gear. I have to admit I'm usually too cheap (and sometimes too curvy) to shop for clothes very often here, but I've been pleased when I've splurged on an investment piece. Not to be missed is the bargain basement, where the last items from different lines are marked down to move-move-move. And let's talk shoes. Biscuit's carefully curated collection is unlike anything you'll find elsewhere (save the now-sorta-ubiquitous Tom's). The prices are entirely reasonable, and the staff are really helpful when it comes time to try them on. It's not for nothing that my house is stocked with a small selection of Biscuit shopping bags.
<review# 904,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/7/2012,3/18/2012,51,65,3,3,5>Unlike Mike B., I tend to not really do any extensive shopping here. Based on what I've seen, I wouldn't be disappointed if I needed to pick up a healthy number of basics. But the truth is that I tend to only go here when I'm in need of a junk food fix. (Which is probably too often and has also probably caused the staff here to think I need help.) And they fix me. They fix me right up. Mostly, I love that they have Pop Shoppe drinks and Magzy's Kettle Corn. That alone makes my Hydrostone rent worth it. Sometimes I think the price is too high, but that's likely more a product of me feeling the need to buy a jug of skim milk almost every time I go, to make sure the cashier knows that, in addition to the chips and chocolate, I'm also *a bit* of a health nut. As others have mentioned, everyone is super friendly and the place is crammed tight. A great store and yet another example of what makes this neighbourhood so great.

I'm not a big wine drinker, so you'd think this place might not be my cup of tea (or glass of wine - I don't know, there's a crappy pun in there somewhere). Not so! I don't think you can ever go wrong with a glass of bubbly and, of course, a cheese plate. Holy crap, do I love a cheese board from Obladee. They're probably meant to be shared, but whatever - just eat light all day and then hoard one for yourself. That's healthy, right? I also suggest asking staff for recommendations. They're super knowledgeable and always happy to help.
<review# 906,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/8/2011,3/16/2012,66,321,3,5,2>I'm told Villa Madina has been in Mic Mac Mall for a while but I only recently discovered them. I was walking around, looking for something to try when the very ... let's say enthusiastic guy behind the counter offered me a sample. Free food? For sure. I assumed it was because they were just opening and this was a sales pitch. He went to get me some chicken shwwarma but I declined, citing my vegetarianism. So he gave me a sample of something that I realize now I can't remember but it was good. Real good. So he whipped me up a plate. A big plate. A plate that far outstripped my appetite but it all looked very good. Throw in a drink and the bill came to about $12. Which, considering I'd been thinking a pizza slice was going to be my lunch, was more than I wanted to spend. But, I figured, I should be more adventurous.And the food was good. Very good. So good I kept eating long after the point of being full and I still had tons of food left. So, for food court fare, it's a bit more expensive than I might like to pay. But it's also better than most food court fare in terms of taste and health. You'll have to weight the pros and cons for yourself.

<review# 908,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2012,3/14/2012,24,40,5,7,4>I have been nervous to write this review and give justice to this glittering jewel of Halifax cuisine.Always nervous of Vietnamese food, I was urged by a friend to give it a try, and within a week, I had made 5 trips for lunch. Since then, I have tried every meat sandwich on the menu as well as the noodle bowls, smoothies, and new Korean tacos.I have never had a banh mi better. Anywhere.The new spicy bbq chicken on a whole wheat bun is my favourite, but I also highly recommend the pineapple beef and pork meatball subs. What is a banh mi exactly? You can't really call it a submarine sandwich as that is trivializing it...Picture a warm baguette bread (in either white or wheat), piled with the meat or veggie option of your choice, and smothered in pickled daikon, shredded carrot, and cucumber with a squeeze of citrus mayo.For a lighter option, there is the Korean taco. Similar to the banh mi in toppings but uses bulgogi beef or chicken (as well as tofu) in a tortilla. Delicious.Then comes the wide variety of drinks, from local Propellor soda to coconut water. The best option though, are their bubble tea smoothies (4.50$) made with real fruit and blended on demand (kiwi-banana is my personal favourite.)With sandwiches averaging at about 6.95$ this makes one of the best working lunches that I can think of in town.The only downside is their early closing time of 7pm on weekdays.Seriously. Go here. Now.But don't blame me if you become hooked. Or actually, go ahead, I'll probably be there anyway...
<review# 909,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/10/2012,3/13/2012,49,70,,4,2>I recently have become a fan of the Mic Mac.A friend suggeted we go there for a dinner date one night as I had never eaten there and had always heard how good the food was.We ventured over and I have to say, they have got to ahve some of the best steaks I have ever eaten! They're great steaks and a great price! You can't really argue with amazing food and amazing prices!On one trip my husband had a French Onion Soup wile I ordered the mussles, when the soup came it was the size of a very large bowl and actualy gave us both a hard time on the size as we still had entrees coming shortly there after.The mussles were cooked beautifuly and tasted very fresh.The staff has to be some of the most efficient staff in the HRM, and they'd have to be with the crowds of people they get in every night!The only downfall to this place is that they can't seem to get enough cooks to cover the Monday night shift and thus close for the day.A must for anyone visiting the HRM or even Dartmouth for that matter!
<review# 910,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/10/2011,3/12/2012,39,42,,4,3>I guess I've been to Local Jo Cafe a few times now, and I think they've all been Sunday afternoons. Today's visit was the longest, and most fun. It was steady, but not super-packed. Perfect for what was essentially a triple date meets Sunday snack-a-thon. I had a pakora which I'd guess came from Staff of Life. Humongous and spicy and this time not too greasy. I also opted for a date square and a chai latte which was large and well-made. I appreciate that they have an appreciable selection of vegan options.I dig Local Jo's. I like their style. I'm a fan of orange, so I'm a fan of their decor. The staff were friendly and helpful. And there weren't even any kids there today, which was neither here nor there, just notable considering the idea behind the business coupled with my previous experiences.I tend to forget about this place since I'm rarely in this neighbourhood, but I won't forget it next time I want to hang out in a cafe for a few hours on a Sunday.
<review# 911,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2012,3/11/2012,21,105,,3,3>Fid is a location that has come highly recommended and we have been meaning to try for some time. Last Friday, with family visiting, it was our lunch spot before a skate at the Oval. Fid is clean, modern, and bright. For a Friday lunch, there were several other tables occupied, but it was not overly busy. The down stairs wash-rooms make interesting use of the exposed brick walls and deep narrow space while being clean. The high speed hand dryers are a plus, while no paper towel is a negative when one wants to clean a spill from your dress shirt. Myself along with another family member ordered the D's Pad Thai which was fresh and delicious. Plenty of noodles, shrimp bites and not too soupy for my liking. My husband enjoyed the Kao Soi which he did find very rich - I also enjoyed some and kind of wish I had personally ordered it, as I love curry and this was an terrific dish. (I did share a few bites of my dish in return).Two other family members ordered the Fid burger with pork belly bacon and local cheese. They were very pleased with the option to choose how done their burger would be. Their side of super skinny frites where much like hickory sticks and shared among the table. The seasonal soup and sandwich combo was a hit with my mother-in-law too. There is a nice diverse menu which is perfect for groups. Over all, we were pleased with the food, the service, our waters were always full, we received just enough attention and we would be happy to return for a future down-town lunch!
<review# 912,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2011,3/10/2012,21,55,4,3,3>OK, I'm admitting it, I walked by this tucked away gem daily for close to 2 years! Then one glorious, yet hungover, afternoon we stopped in. It felt like Moses split the seas and directed us in!We choose a table (downstairs), and then quickly ordered something greasy that would ease the pain of the previous night. I ordered their famous club wrap, and from the first bite decided I would never order another thing off the menu. My girlfriend is less stubborn, and has tried several options on the menu and has loved everything equally.  Also, the service is always great, and very casual. You're not pestered, nor are you forgotten.Darrell's isn't swanky by any standard, and if you're looking for a fine dining experience keep on Yelping. But if you're looking for a place with exceptional food, great service, and something to ease the ache of last night than this is place for you!
<review# 913,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2011,3/9/2012,65,111,3,11,3>Finally tried this place out today, and I'm very glad I did. I showed up at what was clearly not a peak time - mid-afternoon on a Sunday. The place was completely empty and no one was at the counter, so I just went ahead and seated myself (didn't appear to be the type of place you have to wait to be seated anyway). I waited a few minutes, made a few noises to let someone know I was there - cleared throat, scraped the chair back a bit, coughed, etc. Eventually someone came out and brought me a menu. The menu was more varied than I expected - even had a whole pizza section. But I was there for the good stuff. I almost went for the small clams and chips @ $8.50, but I figured I couldn't pass up the deal of $5.99 for a 1-piece fish and chips made with haddock. I also ordered a side of coleslaw at the server's suggestion. My food arrived very promptly and looked as great as it tasted. Perfectly battered haddock, hand-cut fries cooked just right, and the freshest coleslaw I've ever had. The grease level was just what I was looking for - just a smidge of grease. You don't order fish and chips without expecting some grease, though, am I right? The fries were ever so lightly salted, which I appreciate as I prefer to season to my own taste. Nothing worse than biting into an over-salted fry. Okay, well... yes there are worse things than that, but you get my drift. I also had my choice of white or malt vinegar, plus a delicious tartar sauce. As fresh as the coleslaw was, it was slightly lacking in the flavour department.I understand the space has recently been renovated, and they've done a great job. Very clean and modern - I was expecting much less from a fish 'n chips joint, I must admit. Prompt service, once they realized I was there. A few others patrons showed up during my meal. When I walked by a couple hours later, I was not at all surprised to see a full house. A North End gem!
<review# 914,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/14/2012,3/8/2012,16,94,4,3,3>When you just want to have some good beer in a pub and not pay cover, this is your place. On a Friday night, it seems Halifax pubs like to charge cover...silly pubs! When we went they had $10 pitchers of beer (Moosehead, Canadian, and a few others) YAY! Cheap beer. As far as the menu, we only had the mozza stick appy, it was delicious and perfectly cooked, all stringy and delicious. Only downside; it was served with mayo, not ranch or marinara sauce (I know the horror!!). Everyone seemed to be enjoying the pizza and nachos (every table at at least 2 of each on it) so I definitely will be back to try more.The pub was nice, dark, but not too dark, classic semi run down pub filled with great staff and people just wanting to have a good time. Only negative would be the bathrooms, grungy toilets and sink. Its pretty bad when you don't even want to touch the soap dispenser because its so dirty.
<review# 915,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2012,3/7/2012,15,91,,3,2>I saw "Edward II" here a little while ago and it was a great performance (including epic sword fighting!). I recommend you go see a performance here when you get the chance.Seating is very limited as they are a small theatre but it makes the experience way more personal. There's also a bar in front if you want to grab a drink before the play or during intermission.
<review# 916,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/25/2012,3/6/2012,55,223,6,4,3>This was my usual Thursday night wing and beer hang out in University (a decade ago), and I recently went back when a bunch of old pals from school got together.  I'm happy to say the place hasn't changed, maybe a little brighter and possible a fresh(ish) coast of paint... and they moved the shuffle board table.Wings are the same as I remember, cheap and greasy.  Sauce on.Beer is cheap as well during their wing power hours, my eating capacity for these delicious morsels has drastically reduced as has by ability to consume beer by the pitcher... oh age... so cruel.The place was pretty busy and the service was a bit spotty, the servers where paying attention to the young jocks in the other table... but can I blame them?  I used to be sitting in that table 10 years ago :) and I loved (still do) the attention.  I felt a little out of place being over (well over) 30 -sigh-Thanks for the memories Oasis!  I'll be back next time I'm feel nostalgic.
<review# 917,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/7/2011,3/5/2012,32,111,2,5,2>It is what it is. Vinnie's is Vinnie's. It's not Il Mercato. So when you go to Vinnie's, go with expectations of having a large portion of inexpensive, filling food. No, it's not gourmet, but it is tasty.I visited Vinnie's tonight with my husband and two daughters. The highlight of the evening was the personal-sized loaves of heated bread. I'm sure it's frozen but we had lots of it and it's a nice touch. With each pasta, you can have a house salad (very fresh with Italian dressing) or a soup. Tonight the soup was Cream of Asparagus which was creamy and had obvious pieces of asparagus. Not Michelin 3 star, but once again tasty.We ordered a variety of mains. I had the steak on rigatoni noodles in a rich tomato sauce. About 4 or 5 oz. of steak is custom cooked (mine was cooked perfectly) and sliced and put on the noodles. There were lots of noodles and the sauce was flavourful and not salty. The lasagne my daughters ordered appeared a bit crispy. It did taste better than it looked. Lots of cheese and meat. My husband had the special which was pasta with chicken and scallops. I will say I've had dishes with chicken in them before from Vinnie's and it tasted very processed so I stay away from those.We arrived at 5:10 and by 5:30, the dining room was full. If you want to get a seat come early at 5 when the place opens or after the dinner rush is over around 7. We came one night at 6 on a Saturday to find a 30 minute wait. It's one of those places that people don't really talk about, but you know people must like it because the dining room is usually full.For the most part, the crowd was a cross selection of older people, a few families, some university students and some middle aged value seeking diners. The tables are a bit tight and the washrooms remind me of an airplane, but the ambiance is pleasant. The service was attentive and very patient with my younger diners.Again, it's not fine dining, but Vinnie's is a comfortable and casual spot to enjoy some tasty, well-priced food.
<review# 918,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/24/2011,3/4/2012,38,87,3,5,3>Inside is small and always kind of crowded, but I do like it a lot. Steve-o's serves some of my favourite coffee in all of Halifax. Maybe even in my top five coffees of all time. I love their Americano and Canadianas, but usually go for a straight up black dark roast. I will sometimes go out of my way for their coffee. Their baked goods aren't really my bag. I've only had the oatcake and it was a bit on the seedy side for me (literally. It has seeds in it) and not quite sweet enough. But that's just my oatcake preference. FYI: I do believe it is cash only. On the plus side, I find it reasonably priced for such delicious coffee (I could be wrong, but I believe it is cheaper than Starbucks and the coffee is better).
<review# 919,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2011,3/3/2012,52,21,3,6,6>I am incapable of not eating here. When asked where we should go, The Bicycle Thief has quickly become my default. I adore the atmosphere, the location (the fact that it's on the waterfront and not downtown), the food, the bar and wine menu and, as is the case with all Bertossi Group restaurants, the impeccable, but never stuffy service. Having spent an awful lot of time, and consequently money, at this joint, let me share a few tips to maximize your experience here:1. Make plans to linger - the atmosphere is beautifully lively. There's something really special about the rhythm of this restaurant, so plan to stay and enjoy it as much as you enjoy the food and drink. 2. Sit at the bar - if only for the first part of your visit. It puts you at the centre of the restaurant and gives you a bird's-eye view of what's happening. Plus, the folks behind the bar won't fail to disappoint. Ask for a Pink Diamond Fizz and the rest of your night will be set, I assure you. Oh, and don't be shy to eat that truffle popcorn and the homemade potato chips. Stellar. 3. Eat the risotto - for heaven's sake, make sure someone at your table orders this. It's a different type every day and no one in the city does risotto better than Maurizio. 4. Drink the Brunello - to get Brunello by the glass is a complete treat. The price tag is hefty by comparison to some of the other wines, but it's completely worth it in my opinion. 5. Order as you're ready - this is a philosophy I tend to employ anywhere I go, but I especially appreciate it here. Order your app (or First Gear, as they call it) only. Eat it. Then order what you feel like next. This not only supports my reco in point #1, but I think you'll enjoy your meal much more. The menu is large and a bit overwhelming, so ordering everything at once can sometimes mean that your second course doesn't complement your first as much as you thought it would. I really believe you'll enjoy your evening far more by doing this. And don't worry, they're never behind in the kitchen. You won't wait that much longer by doing this. 6. Make reservations - you'll be hard-pressed to get in, otherwise. Regardless of how you engage in your experience here, I don't think you can ever go wrong. So, walk, run or, ahem, bike to the Bicycle Thief if you haven't already made its acquaintance. Regardless, just go.
<review# 920,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2011,3/2/2012,56,312,,7,3>There's a listing for "As You Like It 2" on Hollis which sounds like it's related, but this is a hidden gem in Clayton Park.  I've worked here for over a year and I had absolutely no idea that just inside the Clayton Park Professional Centre is a fantastic little deli.  A couple of coworkers I asked for lunch suggestions today mentioned it.Today's special was a generous chicken salad wrap which I walked out with for $5.25 all in.  Not bad at all.The jovial owner (I presume she's the owner, anyhow) seemed stunned I had never been.  She said "good choice on the special.  Have it my way, trust me..." and started loading up toppings - cucumber, lettuce, cranberries (not usually a fan, but hey, they were good!), and some red onion.  I added some pickles and green olives (hey, Halifax, get onto this green olive thing, why are they so hard to find here?!).She even said, "next time - grilled chicken on a panini - or many the tuna salad - well, we'll see what the special is".  I can tell she takes a lot of pride in her products and there's good reason I discovered when I actually sat down to eat.  I think I have a new lunch stop - reasonably priced, fresh ingredients.  How can you go wrong?The guy in front of me was raving about her homemade rice pudding as well, which she apologetically explained she hadn't had time to make that morning despite trying to get started on it.  So there's that to try too - and soups - and lots more.So five stars for me - and that comes supported by several of my colleagues at the office too.
<review# 921,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2012,3/1/2012,29,166,6,6,4>Yup - I have found a place that has salt cod fishcakes as the headliner - not those less flavourful haddock variety. This is the way fishcakes should be. They have some internal texture with identifiable fish and potato chunks. They are cooked at high temperature so the have a delightful crispy coating. Now sit them on a plate between home-cooked beans and home-cooked scone (did I mention that they are home-cooked), then you have a dish to fix whatever ails you on a cold February Sunday morning. The rest of the table enjoyed specials which were special, but I can't quite remember the details as they couldn't penetrate my fishcake happiness.Definitely making the trip out to Emma's again soon.
<review# 922,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2011,2/29/2012,15,59,,4,2>Dartmouth Sportsplex is a great place to go for a swim. The plex boasts two pools, one moderately shallow one for kids and another deeper one for the water slides and lane swimming.  With kids or without there are several types of swims: open swims, member swims, adults only, lane swims, and family swims. If you're bringing kids or you're just a big kid, Pirates Cove is a favorite at the pool. The Cove is a giant Pirate Ship bursting with water slides, every kids dream. If you're going for the cove make sure you check and see if it's open during your swim, as it's not always operating. They have some pretty strict rules about who can ride the slides so make sure you check them out too before you go. The plex has lockers for your stuff while you swim but most require you bring your own lock, don't forget like I always do! The parking lot is large but may be full if you're swimming during the week during working hours. If you're without a car there is a bus terminal right in the parking lot, and a number of buses coming and going from both Dartmouth and Halifax. Sportsplex is probably one of the easiest places to get to on a bus. The location of Sportsplex makes it easy for both Dartmouth and Halifax people to get to..

This was my family's go to Chinese place when we used to live in Colby Village, it was a quick walk or drive away. When I moved away for university I definitely missed it as it took me awhile to find a comparable Chinese place in NB. Since I have moved back, Tan's has become my favorite Chinese restaurant again and my boyfriend loves it as well. The combo's are great and reasonably priced, and their egg rolls are yummy. The portions are pretty big as well. The place is small but most people get take out here anyways. I have not had much on the menu outside of the combos, but I am sure everything is pretty good. I have never had bad service or a bad eating experience here. I would recommend it to anyone in the Cole Harbour/Dartmouth area who want some delicious but reasonably priced Chinese food.

You would be missing out on one of the best pizzas you will ever try. Fred's is a family owned shop in Woodside that has great service, great prices, and delicious pizza. Fred slow cooks his pizzas in a propane oven and they are always cooked to perfection. The dough is crispy on the bottom and light and airy in the middle. Covered in delicious fresh toppings and the perfect amount of cheese. My mouth waters just thinking about it!! The garlic fingers are second to none. And trust me, I have tried a lot of garlic fingers. Fred's, I can say, is my new favorite pizza place. A great location, friendly service, and free delivery! What more is there?

I have always had problem skin but now my breakouts have stopped and I regularly get compliments on how great my skin looks ! The very friendly and knowledgeable owner Yeon analzyes your skin and tailor makes each facial accordingly.She has all the latest and greatest equipment that you read about the Hollywood stars using, including diamond microdermabrasion and oxygen therapy.I had my eyebrows and eyeliner done permanently here as well.It was painful (eyeliner) but SO worth it !

The waitress was slow to get started but after a word with the hostess everything was back on track. We had sashimi, maki rolls, tempura, soup, green tea ice cream. There were four of us so we hit all areas of the menu but the rice and noodles, don't want to fill up on that. A great variety of sushi hit the table all night long and we had to double check at the end to make sure there wasn't more food for the table. Some of the maki rolls had more rice than fish but we made up for that in the sashimi department.

The burger was delicious and the fries were awesome, best burger meal I think I ever had. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The only caveats I would say is the restaurant is small so it may be difficult to get a seat at peak times and it takes a while to get your food so make sure you have a little extra time to wait but I tell you it is definitely worth it
<review# 928,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2012,2/22/2012,2,6,,5,2>My fiancé and I stopped in for a couple of drinks all spontaneous-like. We chose to remain in the downstairs area near the bar. The stools were comfy and the atmosphere nice. It felt a little bare but I didn't mind since I feel as though it was designed that way on purpose to accommodate a busier night with a crowd interested in milling about and mingling. The drinks were priced on the high end but delicious and worth the extra cash; I had a couple lemon drop martinis and Jack had a few mid-level scotches. My only complaints are: - I find the hours unfortunate - they tend to close on early side. I can understand this as most of the late night scene happens in Halifax, but I wish they closed at 12 rather than 10 or 11 on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays.- The happy hour is a little too early for me to take advantage of since I have to come back from Halifax.
<review# 929,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/14/2011,2/21/2012,38,94,,4,3>My first time here was within the context of a staff xmas party, so I have no idea how stuff cost in the end - just happy I was able to be part of the party.First impression after climbing the stairs was "oh, smaller than I thought". the bar had Garrison red & St-Ambroise Blonde on tap and I noticed a safe door, a big one.I stuck my head inside and saw the cutest table for two I've ever seen. Then I noticed that this was the wine cellar. Guys, this is where you bring your lady friend for the special moment - the kind where you get on your knee.Meal started with their buttermilk biscuits with whipped butter & molasses. They served it warm inside a paper bag. Sorry mom, these biscuits were awesome.Next was roasted celery root & Parsnip soup - wow.Second course was panzanella stuffed tomato salad. Served cold, this was the first time I ate such an item. Main course was basil pesto stuffed chicken breast. Presentation was great. At the end of it, I was satisfied...but wait desert!Warm chocolate cake with eggnog creme brulee. Holy Moley. very small portion, but extremely delicious.Needless to say that if you want  an interesting menu sourced locally as much as possible, then this is a good option.Servers were friendly and quick, being on Barrington means quick in & out by cab or if you are parked nearby at the Metro park.I'd probably call ahead to make reservations during those busy times of year such as xmas or feb 14 just to be on the safe side.
<review# 930,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2011,2/20/2012,61,77,12,9,8>I'm really not a daytime pizza person. Of course, I'm more of a half a bottle of wine in, pizza corner, kind of girl. Hello trans fat and carbohydrates before bed, nice doing business with ya. This was again, another football Sunday or as I like to call them 'too hungover to cook' Sunday's. I live close by Peter's Pizzeria and I just have to tell you right off the bat that the tree inside is REAL! I touched it. Pretty cool. Also got a pretty cool look from the dude working the counter. I heard from a friend that Peter made a good slice, so I figured why not. The somewhat hilarious and inconvenient part is that I cannot for the life of me find them online. Peter isn't exactly internet friendly.  We walked in and were immediately greeted by the 16 year old behind the counter. Since we were having a hard time trying to figure out the menu, we had to ask the little dude where the deals were. It could've been that we were hungover or it could've been that there was a humungous amount of options. Either or we ended up getting the 16" and garlic fingers for like 30 bones. Certainly not cheap, but average. 20 minutes later we were stuffing our face while Manning threw some touchdown passes. The pizza was yummy but the garlic fingers were even better. I would recommend doing take out from Peter's just because there is limited seating and in the summer that real tree attracts the bugs. Unless of course you're into extra wee size protein bits landing on your slice. I'd probably pop on over to Peter's again, based purely on the fact that it is so convenient for me. Next time, 100% garlic fingers though. Or at least 80:20.
<review# 931,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/23/2011,2/19/2012,19,131,4,3,4>I hadn't played lazer tag since I was a young teen, and I had forgotten how much fun it can be. My first visit to Alpha Strike was in celebration for the 30-Day Yelp Challenge - 30 reviews in 30 days. Alpha Strike is located in Burnside, a place that seems to shut down at dark. You may have difficulty getting there, although you can see it from the highway my GPS didn't know where it was. Myself and the other victorious Yelpers played three rounds; 2 in teams of 4 and 1 in pairs. It was late in the evening, therefore leaving the playing field just to our group.You purchase your game passes from the counter, and the staff let you know when to enter. First, you watch a brief video that instructs you how to use the guns. After the video finishes you are moved to another room where it's time to suit up! Let the games begin!For the basic players (which we were), there are two weapon types; the blazer and the phazer. There are also two ways to play; with one-hit kills and three-hit kills. ( I recommend the one-hit kill) The field is large with plenty of nooks to hide in, the maze is colorful and lit with black light.  There are power stations where you can receive additional points.There seemed to have been two kinds of players in our group; those who went for it and those who hid and waited.  I'm no COD sniper by any means, but did enjoy some good hits while sneaking up behind my opponents. At the end of the 8 minute rounds we were provided with print-outs with our game stats, which let us know exactly where we stood in comparison to our opponents. Stats include as well with your point total; "Most Accurate" and "Mr. Trigger Happy" ( I got one on those). In the waiting lobby there are big booths to sit, a canteen and arcade games to tie you over until your next round or to review your strategies. Trash talk highly recommended.
<review# 932,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/13/2011,2/18/2012,6,54,4,17,4>My friend and I have this tradition. Once a year, we pretend we're rich. We choose one of Halifax's topnotch dining establishments, make a reservation, dress up nice and do it up right. I mean, the whole nine yards - pre-dinner cocktails, apps, mains, desserts, a bottle of wine and an aperitif. It ain't cheap, but we save up for it. We also do it in lieu of buying each other gifts. We could not possibly have chosen a better spot. I had seriously, some of the best food of my life. My friend was late because she couldn't get a cab, which left me sipping a cucumber martini and watching other plates pass with anticipation. When my friend arrived, she ordered a Manhattan and we sipped our cocktails as we pored over the appetizers.I give major kudos to our server who I think was named Casey. She read us right and figured out this was a special occasion for us. She was polite and friendly, but very genuine. It would be easy for us to feel uncomfortable in a high-end restaurant that is generally out of our league. Not so here. She made sure not to rush us and went to confer with the sommelier when we presented her with a challenging wine request. I can't have red because of an allergy, I don't like Pinot Grigio and my friend doesn't like Chardonnay. I had decided on the duck and my friend the salmon. Hmm. A challenge! A challenge our server actually seemed interested in solving for us. In the end, we went with an un-oaked Chardonnay that lacked the characteristics that my friend disliked. Turns out the scavenger hunt of wine yielded a Chardonnay my friend now likes. Bonus!My duck was so, so good. It was fatty and thick with a rub on it that was magically salty on one part of my palate and sweet on another. The fig bread pudding was a total discovery beneath the duck. I had several bites of duck meat before I even realized it was there. The potatoes were rich and creamy and topped with caramelized onions and braised parsnips. Each bite was better than the last. My friend likewise raved about her huge piece of salmon. She gave me a bite of her salad which I think had braised raisins or some kind of witchcraft like that. We had split the Henry's Platter (or was it Harry? Either way, it was delish) for an app, so we had room for dessert. My friend opted for the pumpkin creme brulee while I got the dessert that combines two of my favourite words: tiramisu cheesecake. We topped it all off with a wee dram of whiskey, again helpfully suggested by our server who helped us sort out the over 70 selections. All in all, this is a visit we'll be talking about forever. The backdrop of the jazz piano playing some of our favourites were just gravy. When our server said it was a pleasure serving us at the end of the night, we both felt like she meant it. Lovely. Merry Christmas to us.
<review# 933,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2012,2/17/2012,4,24,,4,4>I've been meaning to check out the Foggy Goggle for some time now and finally managed to convince a friend to hit it up. It did not disappoint! First, the atmosphere is just too cozy for words: big comfy arm chairs, chalk board with the specials and a nice long bar. Second, I don't know about the guy's bathroom, but the girls one is just plain awesome!! As an adult with the equivalent of a 2 year old's bladder, I've seen pretty much every restaurant bathroom in a five mile radius and this one takes the cake! I mean any place that has mouthwash and hairspray in it is going to have me coming back, let me tell you! Finally, the food and service. We grabbed the pizza points (get the extra garlic dip, you'll thank me later) and each got the burger. All of it was good, not mind-boggling, but definitely good. I will say that I love that nothing is deep fried and the food actually tastes like the ingredients used - next time I'll be trying the steak sandwich. Our waitresses (I think we had a good 4 of them at one point) were friendly, helpful and speedy. Overall, a good experience and will be back for more!
<review# 934,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2011,2/16/2012,8,31,5,6,4>Hands-down the best dairy you can get. I totally agree with Chris' assessment of the milk as the freshest in NS. I've been buying their glass bottles of milk since they introduced them in February.I've always gotten great customer service (even when I pulled a clumsy moment and dropped a bottle... but I don't talk about that) and prompt help, even when they're busy. The stall is laid out perfectly, with gelato on the left of the counter and milk, cheese, yogurt, curds (poutine lovers rejoice) and other dairy in the large cooler on the right side to separate the "kitchen treat" shoppers from those looking for a sweet treat.They're open nice long hours, even in the winter, so you can get your dairy fix when the main market isn't open.But I can't write much more about the stall itself... its products are the real gem here. I've tried cheeses with garlic and chives and herbs, cheddar and gouda, cubed or melted in a flour cheese sauce... mmmm. Like I said, the milk is an absolute treat and what I get every week or two. I used to go through 4L a week of grocery store milk (yes, I'm an addict), but after discovering Fox Hill's milk, I've cut back to 2L and I don't feel deprived. I can drink less and still get that satiated milky taste. Right now, the bottles cost $2.25 each, but they're a one-time expense, as you swap one for another every week. The milk itself costs $3 per litre. $6 for 2L a week instead of $7 for 4L of stuff that always goes bad early and I need to drink a lot of in order to taste.I'm totally sold and get so disappointed if I run out of milk and can't get out to the market to buy more for a few days. So, Fox Hill... will you provide me with an IV?
<review# 935,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2012,2/15/2012,15,5,,4,2>This is one of my favourite salons.  I go to Katie Lake there for my hair and she is fantastic, young, spunky and open to chat about just about anything.  The prices are very reasonable.  The staff seem to have a great camaraderie.  It's a great atmosphere without pretension.  I try my best to get all of my haircuts there!
<review# 936,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/2/2012,2/14/2012,5,8,,2,2>What a charming find in downtown Halifax!I had read about Love, Me on Yelp a while back and finally remembered to go in on the weekend. Fell. In. Love.The staff (owner?) was great - very friendly but gave me space in the store and very informative on all the pieces I was interested in.What a find to have a local shop with so many diverse artists represented and reasonably priced! I got a fabulous birthday gift for a friends but I can't wait to go back and get baby-shower gifts and some gorgeous scarves and earrings for myself.Yes there's construction out front and it obstructs the shop, but this is temporary folks. This awesome little shop deserves its props for great service, selection and local love!
<review# 937,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/15/2011,2/13/2012,20,226,2,4,2>I'm a little confused by the Yelpers complaining about how much their meals cost at Mongolie.  Just how many bowls are you filling??  I personally have never had a meal over $12 there, and that's before the veggie discount.  The restaurant is a large, cavernous place; lots of unused space.  They really should look at redesigning it to make better use of it.  Great selection of meats, veggies and sauces. This is another mandatory-starter restaurant (see my review of  Baton Rouge), so whether you like it or not, you're paying for a soup you may or may not want.  Because I'm paying regardless I choose one of the grand total of TWO soup choices, eat a few spoonfuls, then pass it on to my husband.  I don't care for either choice; they just taste like run-of-the-mill "Asian" style soups that have been sitting in a vat for three days.I gave this place four stars because really, I very much like having full control over my entree.  You can choose only veggies you like, chicken, beef, tofu, fish ... whatever your heart desires.  Hot rice is brought to your table so you have complete portion control.  The staff are usually friendly and helpful, as is management.  Desserts are not really worth looking at as again, they aren't made in-house and are pretty much the same as the Jack Astor's/East Side Mario's/Boston Pizza franchises.  However, Mongolie is a great place to get cheap, healthy, filling food.
<review# 938,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2012,2/12/2012,40,216,2,5,3>The scene: it's January 25th, the birthday of Scottish poet Robert Burns. Naturally, I want to partake in some haggish and Scotch to honour a dead poet whose only work that I recognize is Auld Lang Syne, and that thanks only to the wonders of Wikipedia. To fulfill this desire, The Loose Cannon was a no-brainer, as there aren't exactly a lot of pubs in Halifax that bill themselves as Scottish. I popped my haggis cherry here a year or two ago and this Robbie Burns Day happened to coincide with the Cannon's Wednesday Scotch day, when most of their single malts are a mere $5.50. It was destiny.While I was only able to wrangle one friend to go, that was all I needed to avoid dining by myself, which I can't do expect at fast food joints. We sat in the back, slightly raised area of the Cannon. It's a cozy area with old looking upholstered chairs, quirky wallpaper and lots of darkly stained wood. Although they're Irish, the Dropkick Murphy's are playing in the background (I suppose there's not a plethora of Scottish rock out there). I, of course, order their haggis special. I've had it a couple times previously, back when they only had haggis on the 25th of each month, although I believe it now occupies a permanent spot on their menu. Today, the haggis comes with mashed potatoes, red cabbage, pickled onions and a half pint of beer for the very reasonable price of $10.99. My not-as-adventurous friend goes with the burger, although he promises he will try some of my haggis. Our food arrives after not too long, presented nicely on rectangular white plates which I like to think of as boats of deliciousness. The haggis doesn't look anything like the horror shows that you'll see on Google images, it looks very much like a hash of finely chopped meat and oats; nothing that's super fancy, but the flavour more than makes up for it. It's seasoned very well, almost reminiscent of Italian meatballs, with lots of herbs and a little kick from pepper. The potatoes contain a pool of gravy which is my favourite presentation for potatoes and gravy, although the potatoes themselves are a little bland, but the gravy pool helps fix this. When I had ordered my food, our waitress raved about the pickled onions that come with this dish, and both my friend and I agreed that she was right to do so - they're sweet and flavourful, without any sort of overwhelming onion flavour that you would expect from eating red onions straight, along with a pungent pickle flavour. It all combines in a way that reminds me of a Big Mac. In a good way. My friend extols the virtues of his burger, saying it's one of the best he's had, although it should be noted that he hadn't eaten all day.The service is friendly and attentive over the course of our night, taking our empty glasses of Scotch away as we each sample a few of their many offerings. I was pretty on the fence about the rating about this review since I've had some mediocre visits to the Cannon before - them being out of multiple beers on beer special days, meh food, etc. But I felt that this time there should stand on its own. I look forward to going back to sample more Scotches and to see if their burger really is up to par.
<review# 939,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2011,2/11/2012,11,51,,3,3>I've attended events at the Westin and stayed when I've had company in town, and I really must hand it to them, they do what they do extremely well (I'm not one for fancier hotels, more a hostel kind of traveler).The rooms are spacious enough, if a bit plain, but nothing particularly wrong with them.  The pool and hot tub are excellent, as is the food at events.If you're looking for a place for an event, this is it.  If you're looking for an upscale place to stay a stone's throw from the action downtown and a very short jaunt to the waterfront, you'd be right at home.
<review# 940,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2011,2/10/2012,65,55,3,4,4>The Freak Lunchbox might be one of my favorite spots in the city. Following in my fathers chocolate monster footsteps, I find myself running up over my lunch break at least one a month for a sweet snack. Things I love about the Freak Lunchbox: (1) The amazingly friendly staff members who are always smiling and engaging from the second you walk in the door(2) The bulk candy that you can mix and match into one bag for the same overall price... brilliant!(3) The amazing assortment of old school candy that takes you back to elementary school. Helllo pez dispensers!! I also continue to look for bubble gum toothpaste when I go in - I used to love that junk!(4) The overall atmosphere is so up-beat and high energy that even when you go in on a gross rainy day, which, let's be honest, is about 50% of the time in Halifax, you are instantly in a better mood. Delicious!
<review# 941,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2011,2/9/2012,33,173,4,5,4>I was rudely awoken on Sunday by the sounds of dueling chainsaws at 7:30 AM.  By 11 AM, our quasi-inebriated neighbours, whose backyard abuts ours, had chopped down the lovely natural property dividers. In effect, they had cut down about 8 full bushes and mature trees to use as firewood.  Oh, it was on.Fuming that we now had a very clear view of their litter-strewn yard, we headed out to Lakeland to see if we could recover what once was a beautifully treed-in hammock oasis.Both of the employees working there that day were aghast at our situation, and more than happy to help us fight back. They made so many helpful suggestions on what types of shrubs to get and what to avoid for our area. They informed us on how to plant and maintain our new tree line. We left with several new bushes, and even some berry plants so that I can enjoy some fresh fruit from my patio next season.  They also gave us wonderful tips on where to find some naturally grown sapplings to grow our own Maples.Their wonderful service helped us turn our day around. Thanks to them, we've foiled our neighbour's plan to make more room for, what we can only assume, their growing 1989 Mustang car part collection. We'll have our lush backyard back in no time thanks in no small part to Lakeland.
<review# 942,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2012,2/7/2012,40,5,2,4,2>I'm lazy in general, so making the effort to write a review is a task I don't often challenge myself to engage upon. How's that for a pretentious intro sentence? Simply put, Dharma Sushi has the best, freshest and most melt-in-your-mouth sushi in HRM. Their menu may not be the largest in town, but it's my opinion that they limit their options in order to knock out such great product each and every time I visit. The service is also fantastic, they are always slammed at lunch time, but their staff are friendly and happy to accommodate your requests to substitute things within the lunch specials (within reason of course). The price range is great - particularly with the lunch specials. While some might say that the small size of the restaurant is a downside, I see it as an intimate environment where they care more about their food then putting on airs with their design. It's not a place where I would take my husband for a romantic meal with candlelight and...I know know...violins or stuff, but we hate that jazz anyway. When I leave the suburbs I want to be fed right, Dharma never fails me.
<review# 943,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/27/2012,2/6/2012,17,3,,2,2>Rogues is my go-to place when I feel like a beer and maybe a bite.There are five or so micro-brews on tap as well as a selection of local and imported beers.  I love the cream ale and the raspberry wheat is a great choice on a hot summer day.The food isn't bad either; if you're a fan of steak-cut fries, this is one of the only places I've seen them lately.  It could also be a good date spot.  They have a small seating area on the 2nd floor that is quite cozy and cute.  Give it a try :)They also always have great music playing and trivia on Wednesday nights.  So if you just want to enjoy a beer with friends, or even solo, this is a great option for the Spring Garden area.
<review# 944,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/24/2011,2/5/2012,18,60,,4,2>I love this place for pizza. The first time I went I was with a group of 10 people. We all showed up, unannounced, and were greeted quite warmly. The waiter at the time was quick to serve us all water and get our orders ready. I had the garlic fingers with whole wheat crust (as recommended by a friend), and they were awesome. I'm a huge fan of thin crust and they did it well. The second time I went was between two apartment viewings. My friend and I were time crunched and starving. We let the waiter know, and he whipped things up quickly. Pizza was delicious (I had a chicken pizza).  I also asked for some additional sauce for dipping my crust, and they handed it over with no problem - and didn't charge me either. I think little things (such as dipping sauce) really tell how a restaurant is run. I hate restaurants who charge you for every minor change - here, they were just happy to please me. Good job! I love their unique toppings, and I think the price is pretty fair. The service has also always been top notch.
<review# 945,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2011,2/4/2012,76,115,3,7,6>I should start by saying that I am really not a sci-fi or comic buff. I don't participate in cosplay or steampunk or watch Anime in my spare time. However, I do enjoy the occasional supernatural or sci-fi movie and tv show, and above all I can respect the creativity and passion of those that ARE sci-fi/comic buffs!Hal-Con is like the mecca for my local city's contigent of such folks. I actually attended as a volunteer for Yelp Halifax Saturday morning, then attended the events in the afternoon with my sister and boyfriend (who is part of the sci-fi/comic buff group previously mentioned), more out of curiosity than anything. I had never been to such an event before, and wanted to see what it was like. I had SO much fun. I didn't buy anything that the vendors were selling, and to be honest I would never really do so since (again) this stuff really isn't my thing. However, I enjoyed looking and admiring everything so much - some of the detail and technical knowledge that goes into making the models, pictures and costumes that filled the rooms everywhere I looked was mind-boggling. Plus the crowd was just "nice" - people were actually saying 'excuse me' and 'sorry' when they bumped into you, which was a revelation. The real reason I attended this year was to take my sister to meet Nicholas Brendon, aka Xander Harris from Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I succeeded! (see attached photographic proof). I totally turned into a dorky superfan upon meeting him, I am not even going to lie. Even though the meeting was about 1 minute from start-to-finish (hello, photo, goodbye) it was still the highlight of my day. I mean, come on, what person who was a teenager in the mid-to-late 90's did NOT watch Buffy and want live in it?! (No? Just me? Oh....ok)The event seemed super busy and the crowd seemed to be enjoying everything, so I would say kudos to the organizers. This looks good for next year! Even though I had no idea what 90% of the costumes or references were, I still had a great time.
<review# 946,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/30/2011,2/3/2012,3,14,6,5,5>I admit it.  For many years I was one of those snots who turned my nose up at Bearly's.  I always associated the place with truckers (no offense, but not exactly my demographic), country music (not sure why because duh, it's cleary well known as the Hali House of Blues/Jazz) and beer swigging.  I don't drink beer...at all.  Not that I have anything against beer, but I simply cannot digest the stuff.  You don't even want to know what happens when I try.  Shudder.I now heart Bearly's...big time.  Two reasons:  For the third year in a row Bearly's has been our Halloween party spot.  Yes, their annual Halloween party featuring the awesome, funkadelic Mellotones is hands down the best venue for Halloween.  So. Much.  Fun.  Great mixed age crowd of super fun people who clearly dig Halloween.  Always entertaining to see all the fantastic costumes and of course, get down with the best live funk/R&B, dance band in Halifax.  And then the other night I discovered another reason to love Bearly's...Karaoke!  I know, where have I been?  Honestly.  I can't believe I am only discovering this now.  My bestie from Toronto was visiting and we wanted something cool and different to do on a Wednesday night between Christmas and New Years when the rest of downtown was dead.  We're talking crickets.  So I said, at first as a joke, let's check out karaoke night at Bearly's!  Boy we were in for a pleasant surprise.  This was the most fun I've had in ages...and I didn't even go up and sing!  I know, what?! I was actually too shy this time.  We did dance our butts off though, and sang along at the top of our lungs. Anyway, this was SO the opposite of everything I hate about other bars and nightclubs, i.e. too young, too many sk*nks (sorry, but it's true), terrible music, pretentious staff, I could go on.  On the contrary, these were "real" people from all different walks of life coming together and having a blast.  And man do they love their karaoke.  Clearly these were regulars.  Everyone seemed to know each other and what was so endearing is how they all cheered and supported each other, not just the great singers/performers (and we were blown away by some of them, in particular the "AC/DC guy...unbelievable!), but also the ones who couldn't really carry a tune but loved being on stage anyway.  How frigging cute is that!My friend said I need to find a way to infiltrate this karaoke gang so that will be my new year's resolution.  I don't think it will be hard.  After all, everyone was so lovely and welcoming.  And how excited am I that I no longer have to karaoke alone in my living room!  Yes, I do that.  Hello, I'm Filipino.  Need I say more?I haven't tried the food but I will next time.  Drinks were decent and bar staff quite friendly and normal, which is really all I ask for.So...maybe see you on karaoke night.  I'll be rockin' the Blondie.   :o)
<review# 947,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/15/2012,2/2/2012,22,150,,3,2>It took awhile and trying a few other local popular spots before we stumbled upon this hidden gem by chance and have found our new favourite Chinese food restaurant.When we first discovered Wong's they were in the middle of a makeover.  I love their décor, with rich purple and terra cotta on the walls. There are hand painted bamboo shoots and a large coy pond mural decorating the walls as well. The aquarium is a nice amusement while waiting to pay your bill. It's a relatively small dining area and usually fairly busy.  The service is great and the staff very friendly, making you feel like a regular on your first visit. We've done both eat in and take out and both are very quick.While they may not make their own plum sauce or egg rolls, we find their menu to be extensive and everything we've tried so far arrives at the table hot, fresh and tasty.  My husband likes their egg rolls and would make a meal of them, I prefer the spring rolls.  There's quite a large menu so take your time going through it.  My husband isn't too adventurous so we tend to stick to the more traditional Canadian/Chinese dishes.  We really like the beef and green peppers, pork lo mein and ginger beef but I think you're pretty safe in having a good meal with whatever you order.  I like to order a few different dishes and with just the two of us there is usually enough to take home for lunches for a couple days.We'll continue to dine at Wongs to satisfy my frequent Chinese food cravings and would recommend it to others looking for well priced, served hot, tasty food.
<review# 948,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2012,2/1/2012,5,6,4,2,2>My 4 year old boy is a "finicky" eater.  In parental language, "finicky" is the euphemism for "doesn't eat."Actually, my son eats healthily and has managed to try a few things beyond his favourites.  But he definitely has his favourites.One of his favourites is the standard Vietnamese soup, Pho, complete with the cutest beef meatballs.We're not Vietnamese, but this soup is.  And my boy likes it when we share a bowl.  We split one bowl between us.  The staff gets him a small bowl, where I share broth, the thick noodles and a few of the meatballs.   I add a few ice cubes from his apple juice glass to cool it down fast (because he's in a hurry at this point), and we're both very happy.If you're in the mood for Vietnamese fare -- go there.  And if we're friends, my son might like to go with you.

If the saying is " Its all about Quality not Quantity" then Boneheads changed it to " ITs all about BOTH Quality and Quantity!" People might argue about the price of the meal . But for real . check my picture and for $20 Dollars , this is too Much !. For a DINO rib plate, my fav, you get a Whole plate of hand cut fries that could be a meal by itself ( and trust me its nothing like the junk food fries, this is quality!) , a HUGE Beef rib dipped, marinated and cooked with BBQ sauce, and side of mac&cheese, potato salad. I recommend the potato salad its just too good ! Another good thing about the restaurant is the experience. Makes you feel like that you're not in Halifax. With a Southern look to it, the smell, the atmosphere, the music, they send you back to the southern Cow boy times !. An experience you have to "Devour" !Not to forget, their customer service is by far the best and most interactive. WIth Full utilization of the Social Media, Boneheads answer back to your comments on Facebook and Twitter pretty fast. If they are slow, its probably because there too Much meat in HAND :)! but they always answer back ! Hands Down for another 5 Star Restaurant.

Friends suggest we go to Curly Portables. It was a little out of our way, but it was worth the drive.The inside décor is very cool. I love the atmosphere. Our server was fantastic! Very personable and charming, and the food was to die for. I didn't pay so I'm not sure how the prices were, but I didn't hear any complaints when we left so they must have been good! I had the hot turkey sandwich plate; the portion was huge! My father and brother got the Bigger than Burly Burger, which was bigger then their heads! Give this place a try, you wont be disappointed!
<review# 951,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2012,1/29/2012,3,8,,5,2>I love Song's. I really like Korean food, and this is my favourite of all of them. They have such delicious and yummy Kim Che, the Bee Bim Bop is really good, and the servers are nice, although they may lack a little English (some of them).

<review# 952,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/6/2011,1/28/2012,15,60,4,4,3>Working just down the road from Pete's, you'd really think I'd get over there more often. And I really should -- it's a great little lunch spot. And I'm always pleasantly surprised by the shortness of the lines and waiting. Maybe I've been lucky, because every time I get over there, I expect madness, but it's always very manageable. Wander in, stare at the snadwich/soup boards for a while, and make the choice. And damn, making the choice of what to have is HARD.First, you've got the ready packaged stuff--the BEST for those days when you have to cram curry chicken pasta salad into yourself at your desk, praying to make deadline and not get curry sauce down your front or on work laptop. Then, there are always daily soups, which are so yummy in my experience. My only complaint: I often find that their vegetarian selections aren't that robust. Tomato bacon sounds amazing, but that pork product ruins the fun for me (weird, I know). The fresh salads and sandwiches are probably the pinnacle of mini-Pete's. The grilled veggie, with cheese, smothered in guac and grilled? Drool is happing a la Homer Simpson just thinking about it. And the choose-your-own-adventure salad bar? Inspired. I love me some beets in just about anything. Yes, you're paying slightly more than you would at other lunch joints in downtown Hali, but the service, selection and freshness totally make it worth it on those days when I've slept in and can't be bothered to make lunch. Love!
<review# 953,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/16/2011,1/27/2012,47,445,,6,2>Apparently this restaurant had a renovation and renaming, but is owned by the same people. I just came here for a drink and enjoyed the chocolate martini. It sounds too girly but it was strong and well made (and on special for $6-not bad). The service was slow initially but it was the waitress' first night so you have to give her some slack. The tables and chairs are up against the wall so it's easy to have a private conversation. They have a different special every day so it's worth checking out the Fickle Frog.Mondays: 3 sliders/32 oz mug, $10Tuesdays: Toonie Tacos ($2), $4 tequila/well shotsWednesdays: 12" pizza + pitcher, $19.99Thursdays: Unlimited spaghetti $7, pints $3.75Fridays: $4.95 mussels/steiners $7.50Saturdays: Ladies Night, double martinis $6Sundays: $5 chili / 5 bottle buckets $20So many options!

<review# 954,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2011,1/26/2012,42,100,,5,4>I thought I wrote a review about the Italian Market but I guess I haven't. I felt compelled to because they now sell FRENCH MACARONS! And I must say, of the few places in Halifax that does sell them, they are the best ones in town! And cheapest! (almost 50 cents cheaper than the nearest priced competitor).It's nice because I do find most of their other food dishes to be a bit on the pricy side. I do enjoy the lasagna though (don't I always?) as it has certain spices on it that makes it stand out from other places and their lasagna. Also a nice variety of fun desserts like cakes, pies and puddings.And note that they do make a lot of the baked goods that are served in places around town. So if you thought that muffin tasted familiar, it liked did and this is the source.
<review# 955,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2011,1/25/2012,27,107,3,5,3>So I will admit that I rarely get too excited about hotel restaurants. Overpriced and underwhelming.  This past weekend I was at a convention at the Delta Halifax and on two occassions had a bite at the Harbour City Bar and Grill with my girlfriends.  They have been doing renos and the grill is very modern but cool.   Visit one....  Clubhouse sandwich and the house fries.  Simply???  Delicious.  Chicken was a breast, not deli slices and it lacked the 3rd piece of bread which I welcomed.  The star to me was the house fries (which you can order as a separate item).  Served with ketchup and a onion dip in individual espresso cups.  Nice touch and the onion dip was great.  Time two was all about dessert (although perhaps I did have the house fries again- they look like potato chips but are warm...). Back to dessert-the parade of sail... Oh my, happiness on a plate.  I had no less than 3 people stop me and tell me I had to have it.  I took their advice and was NOT disappointed.  The plate arrived with (and this is my summary) a chocolate ship (chocolate cheesecake covered with chocolate ganache on a crust of praline-similar to the inside of a ferrero rocher). The sail was a moulded sugar cookie and the mast a hazelnut encapulated in spun sugar. There was a praline, some orange caramel, vanilla sauce and finally a gelato (tasted like a lemon- although they have chocolate gelato with a touch of chili).  I almost licked the plate.  Is that wrong?Summary, don't walk-sprint to get this dessert.  Well worth $9. Reasonable prices, good food and great service. All things considered, a top notch spot.Oh and I am going back Monday.
<review# 956,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/16/2012,1/24/2012,37,10,2,4,3>I can't believe that my first time at Café Chianti was only this past week. I've heard good things from friends and the local Twitter community and have wanted to try as I love Italian food and had heard it was very reasonably priced, I only sealed the deal on Friday at the request of my lunch date who had been there before and wanted to go again. Trying to find parking wasn't ideal as it's on Barrington but you'll find that with most restos downtown. We eventually found something nearby on South Street. Immediately I was pleased with the decor and ambiance. Seemed like a classy place ideal for lunch and dinner but not too stuffy where you might feel under-dressed if you showed up in jeans and a blazer (which is what I did.) We decided to sit on the bar side since we had my friend's baby in tow and didn't want to disturb other diners if she were to get fussy. The dining side was quite busy and was a little loud but the bar side was much quieter with very comfy chairs à la The Fireside.Right away the hostess and the manager were very accommodating suggesting a high chair or booster seat for the baby. While I wouldn't say this restaurant is great for small children (not much to entertain a child and limited menu options), they can seat you comfortably if you have one, and the help-yourself plate of cookies they have at the bar came in handy in this regard as well.We started with the Calamari Fritti at the suggestion of a Twitter follower. While I agree slightly with Jenny W. that the presentation wasn't ideal and that it was a little soggy, having it in the tomato sauce was a new way to try it and they got us some dill dipping sauce when we said we wouldn't like the tomato chilli dip that it's traditionally served with. The menu shows a hot pepper next to this item but thankfully the spice was very mild. We enjoyed it.My friend had the Quatro Fromagio pizza that looked delicious and that she loved. I was torn between the Linguine alla Marco Polo, the smoked salmon panini, and the Transylvanian Goulash that was recommended to me by a friend, but I settled on the linguine. (I love a restaurant menu that has so many good looking options that it's hard to decide.) I was very pleased with my selection and I finished every bite.Overall, time and money well spent. My bill was what I would traditionally pay at a place like Jack Astor's or Montana's and the food and environment was much better. Our waiter was kind and speedy and the hostess and manager seemed genuinely interested in our experience. I agree with Ben that I wish it was possible to give a 3.5 rating because the experience was a little beyond just A-OK. I'll return some day for sure and try the goulash.
<review# 957,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/30/2011,1/23/2012,33,8,4,6,3>After two visits, I am officially convinced that Halifax wouldn't be the same without The Middle Spoon. Scrumptious desserts (that are all made fresh in-house) and spectacular drinks! My first visit, I only dabbled in desserts. I brought two friends along, and we decided to head to the Spoon to give in to our inner devil and satisfy our sweet tooth after only eating dinner 20 minutes earlier.I got the Peanut Butter Pie. It was different from what I was expecting, but still managed to be interesting in its own unique way. It was light and just sweet enough to reel me in. Both of my friends ordered the Cookie Brownie Sundae (which I managed to grab a few bites of) and it was DELICIOUS. The perfect remedy for a hot, sticky and muggy day...or any day, really.Last night, I decided to bring another group of friends to give it another try. The second time was even better than the first. After a tasty Thai meal, we went to the Spoon looking for delightful drinks and divine desserts.I started with the Black Current Press. It tickled my tastebuds in ways they have never been tickled before. My friend and I shared the Chocolate Lava Cake. I'm trying really hard to come up with something sophisticated to say, but I can't find the words. The Lava Cake was heavenly.. that's the best I can come up with. I suppose my drooling says enough about my feeling toward the lava cake, so fancy words aren't really necessary. It was moist, melted in my mouth and the center was gooey, fudgy and warm - just as it should have been. I realize my description may sound a tad dirty, but how else am I supposed to describe a lava cake?Ahem, back to the review...Our servers were friendly and welcoming, and kept us giggling throughout the evening. Honestly, the atmosphere, decor, food and drinks are all fantastic. My only issue with the Middle Spoon is that the prices are a little steep, but it is more of a high class Desserterie/Bar and I'm sure they will start expanding their menu and offering more specials as business continues to pick up.AS A SIDE NOTE: Our server told us to come in on a Tuesday night for their experimental martini night, where their fabulously talented bartender would whip up something on the fly that included all of our favorite flavour combinations. Sounds good to me!
<review# 958,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/19/2011,1/22/2012,2,24,4,4,3>My husband and I find Durty Nelly's a great location for some pub food and a drink. I had to laugh at some of the reviews noting the age of the clientele, and I guess, at 52... I fit right in! :-) It is definitely not a hot-spot for the youth of Halifax. We arrived on a packed Saturday night, but our drinks and food arrived promptly. Food is actually quite good for pub food and the waitress was nice. We also took advantage of the 15% off food deal with our Neptune Theatre cards. The owner is there almost all the time, which, I think helps with the service and quality of the food preparation. Only complaint is that it could have been cleaner, but it was crazy, busy that night. Nice to see they were raising money for the Run for the Cure.
<review# 959,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2011,1/21/2012,28,43,,4,2>Looking for a bit of adventure in your dining experience? You've come to the right spot. While their seafood really is incredible (thanks, no doubt, to the local bounty) I've not been disappointed by anything on the menu. Great for tapas and sangria (red, white, or sparkling), specialty cachaca based drinks like their signature caipirinha, or a full meal including monthly fixed price menus during their off season, there's really something for anyone who's looking for something a little different.
<review# 960,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2012,1/20/2012,1,16,,2,2>One of the best place to get a cheeseburger in Halifax hands down, if not THE best. Hand made patties, not flippin' machine pressed. Chicken fingers are nice an big (sadly not hand made, but delicious none the less), fish hand battered. And sides ( fries and rings) quite plentiful. The decor is not most professional, it has a great down home feeling though. Bev and Tyler are a great pair to get to know, my daughter loves visiting them just to say "hi". Sure gets busy during lunch though, but with the fry and one fry top, it can be alittle slow. Have patience and you end up with a great cheap eat.This is the greasy spoon that beats all other 'spoons in Halifax for cost and taste.
<review# 961,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/31/2011,1/19/2012,5,6,,4,1>We continue to love going to the CGC. The kids have a great time in the various pools. The lifeguards have always been attentive not only to their safety but to requests for information (asked today when the diving boards would be open - was asked which ones I would prefer before he went off to inquire!). The facilities are always clean and safe. I'm loving that we've invested in a membership.
<review# 962,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2011,1/18/2012,49,23,,2,2>Best Brunch. Best muffins and best brownie in the city. I have told 100 people this and none have called me a liar yet. :)The coffee is legendary, my friends and I cannot find a place that serves better coffee...I can only think of one place in Montreal in Little Italy that even compares....The staff is amazing, caring, thoughtful, prompt and always fun to talk to...Also addictive is the soup and the dessert menu. I dare you not to indulge or peel your eyes away from the menu board while you are eating...
<review# 963,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2011,1/17/2012,39,130,,3,3>When I was a kid, going to the library on Spring Garden Road was high on my list of things to do for a good time. (Anyone remember the puppet shows?) We also used to take trips there in elementary school and it was always a thrill to get my paws on a book I'd never read before. Flash forward 20ish years, and I'm still a fan of the library, albeit for slightly different reasons:1) The library is not just for books anymore. Sad that Blockbuster closed? The library has movies! Good ones! And seasons of your favorite TV shows... I'm all caught up on Mad Men thanks to the library.2) You can do a lot of stuff online - like see the newest additions to the collection, reserve a book or movie, or renew the books you already have. You can also see where you are in the queue and change your account information. It's very user-friendly.3) I love a bargain, and the library may offer one of the best deals of all time. It's FREE! As long as you return your items on time, the library doesn't cost you one red cent. What's not to love about that?
<review# 964,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/7/2012,1/16/2012,0,8,1,4,2>Good Croissants, the coffee is different than anywhere else in Halifax. I am glad I don't have to drive, to Dartmouth anymore. The location will be awesome, for business in the summer.   It's rare that you find someone doing something different in Halifax, It's usually the same old garbage. The downside is parking and seating, but I can see the upside to their location choice.
<review# 965,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2011,1/15/2012,25,107,5,15,4>I have a pretty ghetto car. Let's just put that out there right away. I like Corbin's because they don't treat me like an idiot for not knowing much about cars, nor do they try to fleece me into fixing every single thing on my beater of a car. I'm pretty sure this is a family run place and the guys working there seem to know most of their customers by name and always stop to chat with everybody who comes in. Nobody wants to go to a mechanic, but when it has to happen, these guys are a solid choice.
<review# 966,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2011,1/14/2012,29,249,2,7,2>The Drawing Room is Henry House's older, more sophisticated sister. It is located upstairs from the restaurant, and only open on Thursday, Fridays and Saturdays. The room is dark and cozy, and I love the drink menu, it's broken down into different sections, which helps narrow down all of the good sounding options. The cocktails are fancy, and some of the drinks can me upgraded with a dry ice smoking concoction, which is pretty cool. Unfortunately the Drawing Room suffers from the same problems as down below" slow, sometimes unfriendly service. They also have a weird rule of no more than 8 people to a group and no moving chairs around. We were a quiet, group of nine, and they refused to serve us as nine, saying the integrity of the drinks would suffer. We mentioned we were happy to wait a little longer for drinks, but they still said no. So we broke up into 2 smaller groups... Bottom line, drinks still took the same amount of time, and it didn't shed a positive light on the place, so I don't know what the servers thought they were accomplishing...
<review# 967,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2011,1/13/2012,10,118,,3,2>One of my favourite places to eat in the summer time when it's just too hot to cook. Their fried clams are beyond amazing as are their Milk Shakes. You can take out or dine in here and I find the quality of the food to be the same for either choice. I prefer dining in with the regulars and being surrounded by some 50's throwback decor. This isn't a place I'd recommend for groups that have plus 5 people. The place IS always busy and the waitresses can only do so much. They're great at what they do but they're not robots.
<review# 968,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/24/2011,1/12/2012,74,22,5,6,3>Rock Bottom has the best trivia night in Halifax. Period. Don't believe me? Wander down on a Tuesday night at 10 PM and duke it out with the city's best nerds. We will crush you!The trivia host is very amiable and hilarious without turning the night into an extended stand-up routine. He usually does theme rounds and has an affinity for Ben Affleck, Patrick Swayze, Nic Cage, Star Trek, Seinfeld, and the Simpsons. The questions aren't just pop culture, though, and you may be forced to do a bit of math now and again. I bring one or two engineers, just in case.The food is pretty good and the micro-brew beer is tasty. The staff there are among the most pleasant and fun folks I've encountered in the city. Definitely a great place to hang out and test your brain.
<review# 969,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/12/2011,1/11/2012,43,449,3,7,3>Chocolate + coffee shop = heaven. Seriously. This place has two of my favorite things all wrapped up in a cute atmosphere that is warm, welcoming and super cute. (Did I say it was cute yet? It's very cute.) I've been there twice in two days - possibly due to the enticement of free chocolate samples at the door, but it's really about the incredible service you receive.Delicious samples aside, the staff are extremely attentive and the gift offerings look simply charming. If you like hot chocolate, this is hands down the best hot cocoa in the city.
<review# 970,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/13/2011,1/10/2012,19,100,2,3,2>Brooklyn Warehouse is a cozy little neighbourhood spot. And by cozy, I do mean little, so come early or expect to wait at the door.The kitchen is as tiny as the restaurant, so there's a small, focussed menu - but there should be something there for everyone. Some of the menu titles are a little whimsical, so be sure to read the descriptions. Don't hesitate to ask questions of the servers, they're on the whole super-friendly and know their stuff about both the food and drink menus. Brooklyn has a number of local beers on tap and a wider selection of curiosities in bottles - one of the few places to carry Blanche de Chambly and Dieu du Ciel beers. They also have a short list of wines, starring Nova Scotia whites and hand-picked reds. On a recent visit I tried the 'Spaghetti and Meatballs' which is actually parpadelle in a delicious tomato sauce, topped with feta-stuffed lamb meatballs. Absolutely delicious. Tablemates were equally impressed with the pork chop and the steak, though the 'carbonara', which, being vegan, contains no actual components of a carbonara, was not as well received. (As I said, read the menu!)I got the mushroom salad as well, as I was sharing with a toddler, and was a little surprised to find it spinach-based as the menu reads as though you're mostly going to see fungi. Still, it was very tasty.The portions are ample, and you'll certainly not walk away hungry.
<review# 971,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2011,1/9/2012,51,65,3,3,4>I recently signed a lease on an apartment in the Hydrostone and, after unpacking a few things one night, took a walk in this park with my boyfriend. This seems like a great, quiet park. It was nice walking through the mostly-empty grounds. Perhaps my favourite part was coming across a swingset and swinging away while a man nearby played the bagpipes and locals walked their incredibly cute dogs. A uniquely Nova Scotian experience, I'd say. There's also a tennis court, where I look forward to embarrassing myself repeatedly.
<review# 972,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2011,1/8/2012,66,321,3,5,3>I get myself into trouble all the time by saying: "I don't drink coffee, I drink tea." How can that lead to trouble? Well, I know nothing about tea, in fact. I mostly know that I don't like coffee.Even my love for tea is a recent development. However, I still tend to stick to the more "mainstream" teas. Thankfully, the World Tea House gives me the chance to explore with a (quite frankly) insane selection of teas. How is that not overwhelming, you may ask? Well, it's the staff: they know their stuff. Which is good because, again, I don't. Beyond their stupefying selection of teas, they also have snacks. Delicious snacks.You might fear (as I once did) that a tea house would be stuffy and proper. You probably imagine uptight British folk, right? Admit it, you hear "tea house" and you think of cummerbunds and crumpets, don't you. Well, that's not this place. It's very relaxed and mellow. There's always great music playing in the background.On a final note, it's a great spot for people watching downtown.
<review# 973,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/22/2011,1/7/2012,54,227,5,4,3>I tend not to frequent sports bars since I'm not a fan of sports, beer or crowds of cheering people who spill beer on me, but I stopped in on a slow Friday night with my boyfriend thanks to a serious craving for wings. Ten minutes later, I was practically having an anxiety attack over all the different decisions I needed to make so I could order them. It was worse than Starbucks! The selection is crazypants. First you choose your style of wing - I went for a 1/2 mega-sized breaded ones. Then you choose how you want your sauce - I got mine tossed, because I think on the side is just plain crazy talk. Then you choose one of about sixty difference sauces for the wings. SIXTY! Or somewhere in the neighborhood of sixty. Seriously, guys? What's the difference between "suicide" and "death"? Is one better/worse? Naturally, I went with the second choice on the list before my poor little indecisive brain exploded - Franks Chili & Lime. It was delicious. The boyfriend bought two 1/2 pounds, one in "Saute" and one in "Maple"...I tried the maple and thought it was weird and gross, but no surprise there.The service was great and it was nice to see they carried my favorite beer substitute beverage, Strongbow Cider. Since the Peel Pub gave me food poisoning on two different occasions, I'd say Bubba Ray's is a major step up for this location.
<review# 974,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/16/2011,1/6/2012,48,65,,3,2>Amazing art, jewelry, and other fun things, and lots at very affordable prices!Just stop in and check it out. It's a super no-pressure place, so take your time and have a look.I'll definitely be back soon. I picked up a really cool ring for the girlfriend while I was there that she absolutely adores, so it's definitely a great place for unique, fun gifts for friends and family.
<review# 975,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/6/2011,1/5/2012,49,70,,3,2>This has to be one of my favorite restaurants. We are starting to become regulars @ilmercatosunnyside! And honestly! Who doesn't love great Italian?!It may be located in a mall but it definitely doesn't have that "mall restaurant" feel at all. It feels more like an upscaled casual restaurant.We go about twice a month sometimes more. I often get a craving for the the mushroom and chicken ravioli. I have tried a few things on the menu but can never seem to shake my love for this ravioli dish. It is by far my all-time fave pasta dish. Make sure you give this place a try. You won't be disappointed. Whole you're at it make sure you order the Zucato (sp?) cake at the end of your meal. It's handmade and delicious!! We often have to choose between our fave apps or this cake. Sometimes we will switch it up for the ever famous maritzio styled gelatos but this cake always makes it back to us!Do yourself the favor and try this restaurant.
<review# 976,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2011,1/4/2012,14,61,2,3,2>I love sushi. Sometimes I love "authentic" sushi, all slimy and fishy. Other times I like sushi made with things like mango and coconut and deep-fried bits that are probably akin to deep-fried-battered Mars Bars to someone from Japan. Whatever I'm after, I have always had a great meal at Hamachi Kita. Located in the Hydrostone, it's a nice break from downtown but still centrally located. The food always tastes fresh. Best of all, the extensive menu means it's great for groups where one or more people may not be sushi lovers. There's a wide variety of curries, noodle dishes, and other entrees that provide generous portions and lots of flavour for even the biggest sushiphobes.My only gripes are the washrooms (down the hall, past a creepy doorway, turn right and still have to squint at the doors to make sure you're going in the right one) and the size - it gets pretty packed on weekend evenings so you might feel like you're sitting with the neighbouring table at times. One bonus - they are open for lunch on Sundays. It seems like many sushi places don't open until 4:30 or later on Sundays. Hamachi Kita is open from 12-11, which is great if you're looking for a midday meal.

<review# 978,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2011,1/2/2012,24,40,1,8,5>Last winter, I went to Istanbul for a week and among all the delicious food I had, breakfast was the glittering jewel. So you can imagine the thoughts of jams, olives, and cheeses that swirled through my head when Istanbul Cafe announced its brunch.I have never been to Cafe Istanbul for dinner before, but (believe you and me, that will be a yelp for another day) I was very excited for the classic turkish breakfast.It was off-putting at first when I saw a giant cartoon chicken on the wooden sign outside the door beckoning me for a brunch that might be like Denny's, but I still pressed on.The interior was very bright and cheery with iznik style plates and tiles, blue and tan walls, bright lamps with evil eyes (nazar boncuk), and a large mural of ships passing through the Bosphorus. The tables and chairs were made of dark wood which gave a great contrast to the light walls and ample light coming through the large bay window. This was guaranteed to be a great meal...I ordered the classic turkish breakfast (feta cheese, cheese score, 2 jams, kalamata olives, pickled peppers, red and green peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and a hard boiled egg for 8.25$) with an extra side of the house made lamb sausage (1.75$)Whilst waiting for my brunch I couldn't help but start grooving to the light turkish pop on the radio that I found irresistible and tried to not dance to in public. The best part of the meal was brought, a pitcher of water. Every time I go to a restaurant, I find myself repeatedly flagging down the waiter for more water (like Shania Twain) and waiting forever. This was a wonderful change of pace.Then the tea arrived, and I held my breath, thinking that it might come  in an english tea cup, but NO it came in the traditional tulip glass that I came to love during my trip to Turkey. Although there were no sugar cubes, the tea was strong and delicious.When the turkish breakfast arrived, I was pleased to find the vegetables fresh and crunchy, the kalamata olives were NOT pitted, which is how I like them (pitted olives are often less salty and bland), the feta was dense and tasty, and the pickled peppers suitably brined. However there were two real stars to this meal, the lamb sausage and the cheese scone. The lamb sausage was pure divinity. In a patty form instead of links, it was bursting with otherworldy flavour. I recommend getting several order, as you get 4 patties per side order, to experience this properly.The cheese scone was wonderfully crumbly with spots of melted cheddar cheese and came with two jams. The first was rose which had a light sweet rose flavour which was my favourite of the two, even though I do not like rose flavoured foods. The second jam was a quince jam that had a thick honey flavour which I did not enjoy as much as the airy lightness of the rose. It is turkish custom to leave some food on the plate, so as to not invite famine or to show that a guest is filled. After this breakfast of wonders, I left not a trace of any of the foods mentioned above, but I knew I wouldn't go hungry!As I awaited my check, I looked out onto the bright sun shining down on Spring Garden pedestrians, and sipped endless glasses of tea, I realized that I easily spend hours here, and it seemed the wait staff was just as happy for me to do this. I have not yet gone to dinner at Istanbul Cafe, but I am excited to try it now that I know the wonders they can perform at bunch,  I highly recommend brunch here for a good morning among friends, a morning rendezvous with a loved one, or for those that are health conscious. A light breakfast of vegetables, cheeses, and olives is much healthy for the body than a gutbusting meal of pancakes and syrup. So for what ever your reason, try and stop by some weekend soon for a good meal.Note: At dinner for the month of April 2011, all kebabs are 15% off
<review# 979,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2011,1/1/2012,26,94,,6,4>This is one of those reviews when half stars aren't necessary unless they are bonus stars. I'm sure my review will echo much of what is in the ones before, but this place deserves as many positive acknowledgments as possible. This was an impromptu stop in as we were in the area having just visited the Italian Market (awesome too!). It is a smallish but inviting and cozy store filled with ``All Things Olive``. There were probably 4 or 5 staff present to greet, tour, and educate. I have a friend who has told me he believes that coffee, cheese, and chocolate are among the great culinary treasure of we normal folk (non-chef or hugely rich people who could afford truffles twice a week). While I agree, although I don`t drink coffee, I have to add olive oil and balsamic vinegar to the list. Sorry, I went on a tangent as I was talking about the staff. All of them were friendly and knowledgeable. They were happy to share their favorites or suggest couplings of oils and vinegars.One was suggesting to use the little spoons to stir the oil and vinegar to emulsify them before trying and also said she always splatters herself when doing... yea, so did I!Now to the star of the show. The Oils are amazing! You can often taste the flavors individually of the oils as the description purports. Almonds, grassy, a touch bitter, etc. The infused oils are excellent... wild mushrooms and sage, Tuscan mix, and so many more. We then moved on to the balsamic vinegars and started with a Jalapeno one before trying most of them.My favorites: Chipotle Oil and then paired with an Apricot balsamic vinegar; Blood Orange Oil paired with Cinnamon and Pear balsamic.Wild mushroom and Sage oil; Meyer Lemon Oil.Go with some time to taste and enjoy the experience!
<review# 980,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2011,12/31/2011,39,42,3,8,4>When I first saw The B-Well Sushi and  Cafe sign on Quinpool Road, I developed a blind crush. Ever since the sad closure of Andy's Restaurant, the oddly-named sushi restaurant of Quinpool Road past, I've longed for another restaurant to fill the painful gap. B-Well is that gap-filler, and what a good gap-filler it is! It also happens to be in the old home of Samosa Plus, another spot I sorely miss. Anyway, down to business. I think I've been to B-Well five or so times, every time with awesome experiences. Even though on my very first visit, I was served a fish roll when I asked for a vegetarian one, I let it slide. We were offered apologies up the ying yang, and my bf was happy to find a tummy-home for the fish dish. I'm delighted to report that there are a LOT of vegetarian and vegan options which is rare for sushi restaurants in Halifax. Usually there are a couple of options, but B-Well has many! Also, they declare on their menus and signs that their dressing includes egg and their miso soup contains fish. Full disclosure is sexy!Today, I shared three rolls with some gal pals of mine. We chose the ever-delicious Yummy Yam Dragon Roll (sweet potato, avo + special sauce- WHAT?!), the I LOVE Roll (avo, ginger, tempura and inari), and the new-to-me Bonus Banana Bonanza. Yes, that's right, at B-Well Sushi and Cafe, they think it's okay to put bananas in sushi, and lo and behold, they're right! So, let's see, the staff are great (not so much at first, but definitely lately), the location is awesome, the cafe itself has many seating options including sometimes outside, and there are lots of unique vegetarian options. Oh, and as far as I can see, it's the cheapest sushi in Halifax, without sacrificing quality or authenticity one iota. The B-Well Sushi and Cafe is definitely winning.
<review# 981,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2011,12/30/2011,21,55,4,8,2>Casual Fine Dining.. that's their motto. What is that? You got me. However, there is absolutely nothing casual about what is delivered on your plate. I've been there several times, and each time get blown away with how amazing meat really is. I've had almost everything on the menu, but notable mentions are: Their steak which is as thick as a tree, topped with cheese and served with delectable potatoes and veges. The bison, ordered rare will have you smiling with every bite, and their hen is cooked heavenly. Stories is famous for their scallops. They, well, are the best thing I've ever had in my mouth. You could order a few apps and still leave incredibly full and satisfied, but I really suggest making this a full experience.The servers are very educated on the menu and entertaining. I'm guessing the casual in fine dining refers to the pleasant and welcoming nature of the restaurant, and the fine dining refers to the price you're paying. Hey, you're not paying just for the food-- it's an experience you surely won't forget!
<review# 982,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2011,12/29/2011,65,111,2,5,5>I used to work in Burnside, so I'd been to Kababji a couple times over the years and never had anything but great food and service. Tried it again last night for the first time in a year or two, and was blown away. One of the best meals I've had in awhile.My friend and I were both having a hard time choosing which platter to get. Since each platter comes with 2 skewers of meat, we decided one of us would get lamb and the other shish taouk, and just trade a skewer (all platters are the same price: $17). Best decision ever! The lamb was so flavourful and tender (though my friend found hers a little on the greasy side), and the chicken was unbelievably moist and delicious. The platters come with rice, salad of your choice, and hummus with pita. The rice was perfectly cooked. I'll admit here that I sometimes find rice to be nothing more than flavourless filler, with a few exceptions. Kababji's rice definitely qualifies as an exception. We both chose fattoush for our salad, and both agreed it was fresh and very tasty. The hummus and pita? So good. Perhaps the best hummus I've had in the city - if not, definitely high on the list.Sort of like Burnside's Chabaa Thai, you walk in not expecting the best in atmosphere, but you're pleasantly surprised. Let's face it - Burnside is kinda ugly. But Kababji has done a wonderful job of transporting its patrons to another land when they walk in the door. Our server was friendly, helpful and attentive. Highly recommend!
<review# 983,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/24/2011,12/28/2011,38,87,,8,4>One of my biggest complaints after moving to the North End was lack of places to get an ice cream on a hot day. Dee Dee's is a bit out of my way (15 min walk, maybe), but it's worth it. Their ice cream is delicious. I've tried three different kinds and have yet to be disappointed. I enjoy that their mint chocolate chip isn't dyed bright green (not that I am opposed to bright green ice creams, but I like that this one isn't) and the Mexican chocolate has got a kick to it. I still have to go back to try the burrito.Inside the store is quite small and there was some confusion over who was serving who what on one of my visits. A guy was making burritos and I couldn't tell who was waiting for a burrito and who was hmming and hawing over ice cream flavours. I'd love it if there was a better system for ordering on busy days, but I don't hold that against them and I continue to go back.
<review# 984,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/12/2011,12/27/2011,108,39,1,9,8>It was like walking into 1992 all over again, only this time I could actually afford to buy my own lunch.I've been anxiously awaiting the opening of Le Bistro - mostly out of nostalgia for a place that holds a million and one memories for me. First real date, first profiterole, first fancy meal (I was 16 ok?)...So my bestie and I (we were regulars in high school - sad no?) went for lunch on their first day and were so happy to see that Liz's dream has come to fruition. Every diner in the restaurant that day had a similar story - all old regulars, all carrying fond memories of a lovely Bistro that cited Francs on their menu, as well as CDN $$ (now they have the Euro on the menu - nice touch LIz!).As for the food - sweet and simple and delicious. It was fun to see some old faves still on the menu as well.I will definitely return and will most likely become a regular again. There's something nice about a dining venue that's not pretentious, that makes you feel at home, where everybody knows your name again.
<review# 985,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2011,12/26/2011,56,312,,4,3>Well, it's fitting that my 100th Yelp review is a five-star. And A Mano definitely deserved it based on my experience last night. Entertaining friends in town, I managed to steer them away from the tourist trap Five Fishermen, and we decided, with their kids in tow, to check out A Mano. I made a quick call ahead to get them started on putting a table together, and they quickly had somewhere for us to sit.Here's what I liked - a friendly, attentive staff that kept good track of what we wanted, and managed to not make us feel rushed even though throughput is clearly important for them. The menu is well put together, not too overwhelming but with a lot of variety. A lot of starters were on offer, and we picked a few on the recommendation of our server.The food, excellent. My wife and I had pasta dishes, tortellini and gnocci. Great portions, great tasting food, and the presentation was quite good. The pizzas were amazing - we had four different ones come out, far too much for the seven of us so we left with leftovers.  Literally nothing that I tried there last night was anything but incredible, and as I generally remark, why hadn't I gone sooner.  I think I have a new favourite downtown.
<review# 986,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/5/2011,12/25/2011,16,94,2,2,2>This is a wonderful place that you can go to without driving an hour and still get the quiet of the countryside. Its a great little park full of paths that cut through history and trees! You can learn while you walk! (If school was like this I would be Smart and fit) It's a beautiful walk no matter the time of day! My favorite is when its foggy and a little misty! Makes the place seem so far away.The park is well maintained and for the most part doesn't have any issues with hooligans! The people who walk their dogs are so friendly and make sure to pick up after their pooches which is always nice cause I like my shoes!Take a walk in the park! I guarantee you will love it!
<review# 987,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2011,12/24/2011,29,166,4,5,3>Nous avons passé un après-midi merveilleux . . . opps, forgot that I was back in English speaking Halifax.It was a great late afternoon of fun in Paris - or was it Halifax.  Le Coq has just opened up and it took only seconds to realize that they have a real winner. As we opened the door we were greeted by a chorus of "Bon apres-midi!" - welcome to Bistro LeCoq where all of the servers speak French - even amongst themselves. The striped tops and custom serviettes completes the Paris mood. The place has been totally redone and the tin roof and bar are unbelievable. There are at least three zones: somewhat formal, relaxed or hanging at the bar chatting with the French speaking barmen. Take your pick of zone - this is a great place to hang out for hours on end.In keeping with the physical layout, the menu encourages lots of options. For our first visit we stuck with the cheese board ($12) and the foie gras ($10) - both of which were tasty and plentiful.  Enough to get two hunger people through the evening with flavour to spare.The drinks are also an experience. The drink of the day was a very special brew with a flower cordial base - fantastic. We tried a gin/tonic/rosemary concoction that had everyone licking their lips.After enjoying a couple of hours in "Paris" with some new "friends", the bill was most digestible considering the food and liquor consumed. Certainly one can ritz it up by choosing from their entrees - as we will do in the future - but for our first visit this place served as an impressive short stopover on the way home.  We are still smiling - or should I say "nous sourions toujours."
<review# 988,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2011,12/23/2011,32,111,,10,3>I have a very handsome pair of winter boots which get me through these crazy Hali winters. So I fell into the depths of despair when the pull tab on one of the zippers broke. The zipper had been acting a bit strangely anyway. I will add that in addition to these boots being handsome, they were also expensive as they came from KAS down on Spring Garden. I was becoming semi-hysterical about what seemed to be the certain demise of my Hali. essential winter footwear.Anticipating a big repair bill or that the zipper was beyond repair, I procrastinated but got it together today to go to Quinpool Shoe Repair. I had never been in, but the illustration of the cat on the window reassured me.What a find! That place is the real deal. Stepping inside the tiny shop, you smell the leather and the shoefixing elixirs. The place is a bit of a throwback to another time with posters of the original brat pack and old Vegas hotels on the walls and funky jazz music playing. To me the nostalgia was a sign that these people are still in business after a long time because they clearly know what they're doing. Three other customers came in while I was waiting and they all left happy.I had to wait all of ten minutes while the very kind cobbler (not sure if that is the correct term and I didn't see any elves, but hey the guy wears an apron and fixes shoes) replaced the pull tab with something just as luxe looking as the original part and cleaned up the zipper so it worked better. The repair was done while I waited and, best of all, for the low, low price of $5. He did tell me that another customer had experienced an issue with the same pull tab, so if I had any issues just bring it back. You don't get that kind of honesty or guarantee every day of the week in the retail world. I would definitely bring any other shoes or boots needing fixing here. Another plus is that they cut keys for a reasonable price. You can never have enough spare keys.

<review# 990,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2011,12/22/2011,12,57,3,3,5>For my daughter's 1st birthday, we decided to get cupcakes from here as we had a both a lot of people, and a lot of little people. A cupcake to a little kid is really just a personal-sized cake, without all the slicing and "How big of a piece do you want?" question asking.We got vanilla cupcakes with fresh strawberry icing, and chocolate cupcakes with cookies and cream icing. It's kind of sad that at this point in the baking industry you're shocked when the icing actually tastes like what it's supposed to taste like, but I'll be damned if Ma Belle's didn't taste EXACTLY as described. The fresh strawberry icing especially is dead-on strawberrytacular.Aside from the food, the guy inside was really nice and made sure everything was good before giving us the cupcakes.I would definitely get their cupcakes again for similar events, and I'm desperately trying to find time to get down there for lunch or high tea.
<review# 991,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/14/2011,12/21/2011,12,118,,3,2>I visited Cha Baa Thai in Halifax for the first time with a group of 8 family members last Friday evening and it certainly lived up to my expectations!I called ahead of time to make the reservation and when we arrived we were seated in the back area separated from the rest of the restaurant with a divider. We were promptly given water and asked if we would like other drinks. My boyfriend ordered tea and was thrilled when it came in a fancy elephant teapot. He also asked if he could sample the sweet and sour sauce because he is picky about that. The waitress checked with the kitchen and they gladly provided a small tasting of it. We all ordered appetizers, the Spring Rolls. They were delicious, and would have loved more but the price for the 4 of them ($6.95) was reasonable. When ordering I asked the waitress how spicy the Pad Thai was and she was very kind in stating that it was medium, but it also depends on a persons taste buds. I then asked about the Pad See Eew and was told it was mild, so I ordered that. Three people at the table were ordering meals that would go with rice, so she suggested getting a large Jasmin rice and sharing it, which we did. We did not wait long for appetizers or the main meal. We were given chopsticks with our main meals and more water. Our server checked on us routinely to make sure nothing else was needed. My meal was delicious and not spicy at all, which was fine. My Boyfriend (who was iffy about the whole Thai food thing initially) enjoyed his Cashew Chicken immensely, but wished that there was more. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the overall dining experience. When it was time to pay the waitress confirmed the number of bills and gave us our bills, and directed how to pay. We stayed for at least 30min after paying and we did not feel rushed at all to leave. My boyfriend and I will definitely be coming back to this restaurant, and we will be trying the Dartmouth location this weekend. I highly recommend this restaurant, but be sure to call for a reservation if you plan on going in a group.
<review# 992,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/20/2011,12/20/2011,15,59,3,5,2>I'm not a beer drinker, but maybe some day I will be. I find a hard time distinguishing the flavors and subtle differences between brews. So you'll have to take everyone else's word that Propeller's beer is some of the best. I love Propeller for their non-alcoholic selections. They have some of the best flavored pops around. I like to think of the Crush brand pop as MacDonald's, while Propeller is a delicious local gastropub with a talented chef. They have three sodas right now (and hopefully more in the future), vanilla cream soda, root beer, and ginger beer. All three are deliciously amazing. At the start of every summer we pick up a huge case of mixed soda to slowly drink while at the beach or BBQ'ing. The Root Beer is nice and strong but not too overpowering. The cream soda is one of my favorites of any brand. Ginger beer is a family favorite, as Propeller is the only local seller of this flavor that I'm aware of. It has a nice bite to the taste, and I love how it maintains the ginger smell. It'd be nice to see a orange or even lime pop from them. I consider myself some sort of soda expert, having tried all the brands the grocery and candy stores have to offer. Propeller is definitely up there in terms of quality and taste.

<review# 995,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2011,12/17/2011,10,20,,2,1>The Cellar Bar and Grill has a very pleasant atmosphere. As much as it is a wonderful spot for a cozy lunch or dinner for two, three, or four, it also works well for a larger group such as the business luncheon I attended. A semi private room near the back provided enough space and privacy for our networking group to feel comfortable. I loved the bread they provided beforehand, very yummy and everyone was very happy with their meals. I am a picky eater and had the Chicken Pesto Penne.  I absolutely loved it and the serving size was more than adequate. I definately did not have room for dessert. Our servers were attentive, kept our waters full, and very friendly. I will be back!
<review# 996,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/28/2011,12/16/2011,9,20,1,8,4>This is one of my favorite places to eat when I have the time.  That is really the main problem here is time.  This is a family run restaurant and the staff is usually just a husband and wife team who hail from Taiwan.  They are very sweet and the husband will talk quite a lot with you if your are inclined to do so.  He is difficult to understand at times but has managed to communicate well enough to help customers with menu choices.  I don't really like saying anything negative about this restaurant because I love it.  The food is vegetarian Chinese and all home made, nutritious and delicious.  Portions are generous, the prices are unbelievable and you will swear your eating meat at times.  I really don't know how they do it.  In addition to a good variety of food items on the menu, there is tea..... lots of tea.  probably hundreds of teas including the flower tea where you watch the flower unfold in your tea,  How cool is that!  So what I'm saying is get tea too if you go.  The food is not over salted and has no MSG that I know of.  Let them know if you have allergies because they will accommodate.  Make sure you have extra time and you will be happy and relaxed.  I don't recommend going here on a busy lunch hour.  You will walk away frustrated.  Try an off time if you in a hurry and you will get faster service.  Soak up the atmosphere which feels like you are in a little Chinese shop tucked away in some authentic back alley in Chinatown.  Enjoy the tea which can be refilled up to 5 times and will be refilled 5 times if you want it to be.  The Husband of the team, who serves will seem bent on fattening  you up with more food.  I love to be fattened so of course I like this.  A serving of fresh fruit appears at the end of the meal to help digestion....and it does!  There is a little room adjacent to the main eating area that has an abundant assortment of trinkets and Chinese art and even some clothing items.  If you are in the market for a new tea set  you won't be disappointed.  There are some real gems her, mostly hand crafted tea sets that are amazing.  Fine porcelain cup and saucer sets can also be purchased here as well as some jewelry.  If you have a group to feed they can accommodate that with notice two hours for larger numbers.  You have to let them know what you are ordering in advance for this to work.  There is ample seating upstairs for these groups and this would make a great place for a business pow-wow or intimate party of friends.  As I said, notice must be give for this to work or they will be overwhelmed and you will be frustrated with service.  I'm giving this four stars even though it is slow service because I believe everything else makes up for that.

<review# 998,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2011,12/14/2011,21,105,,6,2>This was my first Jamaican restaurant and I was extremely pleased, as were the other 3 diners I had eaten with.  This place should have line ups out the door! We had the Jerk Pork (ribs no less), Jerk chicken, Ackee Veg delight and the BBQ Chicken. All came with heaping piles of rice and a second side of Cabbage or curry potatoes.  We are a group that likes to share and we all agreed that everything was fantastic! Everything was cooked to perfection and not a morsel was left on our plates. The Jerk was spicy, and still had great flavour. We are not usually ones for dessert, but ordered the pineapple upside down cake as well as the coconut cream pie. I rarely care for coconut, but this pie was by far the best I've ever had, which was the consensus around the table. I highly recommend this location. The staff were very pleasant and want to ensure you are pleased with your meal. Even close to closing, they did not rush us out.

The Foggy Goggle (my friend calls it the Google because that tends to come out first) has become a go-to place and a welcome change from other go-to places. It's a place to go and have slightly less guilty pub food (though let's not kid ourselves. The food might not be deep-fried here, but this ain't a salad bar.) Service can be pretty good or kinda slow. But when I go there, I'm there for the evening. I don't mind if my beer's a little slow to come. And the food is good enough to wait for.Speaking of. The food. Oh em gee. THE FOOD. The Goggle Burger is seriously the best, hands down burger not only in Halifax, but that I've ever eaten. It's spectacular. The steak sandwich occasionally has me cravin' too. Beer selection is great local brews. Decor is unique, yet familiar. It's also a cool, intimate live music venue. All in all, a fave.
<review# 1000,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2011,12/12/2011,61,77,5,12,7>I'm really not a fancy pants kind of gal but The Bicycle Thief has such a solid location it's almost a must-to-check-out kind of place. In celebration of our friends 30th birthday we headed down to the waterfront to check it out. The website paints you a pretty historical picture that is perfectly mirrored on the inside. With picture upon picture on the wall of history, this establishment makes you want to eat and wander! It is absolutely gorgeous inside and you don't have to be as nearly as fancy as I had imagined. It's almost like a fine Italian dining pub experience. A confusing mixure of words that hopefully paint a picture? We sat at a fairly big table to the left of the entrance and I was strategically placed by a HUGE bookshelf of cookbooks. I therefore wasn't a very good socialite and stuck to ogling over the amazing recipes on the case. Needless to say the ambiance and atmosphere is A1 and excites me a little bit. Not that it is entirely key, but the washrooms were phenominal. I could've spent half the evening in there. The majority of the items at the Thief are from the sea with a couple red meat options to boot. We had already eaten and just settled on a beverage and the Mussels. They were deliciously prepared in a tomato based sauce with basil pesto. They also had very scrumptious croutons within the mixture that as you can imagine soaked up all the flavours left in the pot-- yum! My only complaint was the fact we didn't have a bowl or anything to put the empty shells in (sorry for dirty-ing your table cloth). Our drinks came in some pretty classy-rugged glasses that seemed to please all the gentlemen at the table. A couple of my other friends ordered the jumbo shrimp with cognac and the slow roasted ribs with polenta. Everything was fantastic even though the shrimp was a 'little bouncy' when chewed and perhaps cooked a little too long. The birthday boy's fries were sent around the table and I must say they were gourmet with a capital 'G'. Seasoned with what I presume was garlic salt and served in a white cup, I would've stopped the rotation around the table and finished them there on the spot. I also managed to snag a nibble of the cake which was white chocolate, creamy, and luscious even. Yeah I went there, called a cake luscious. The rest of their dessert menu had me wishing I just ordered 3 courses of dessert all night.Service wise I was very impressed, we were late diners at around 930-10 and our meal were brought out within 20 minutes by a whole crew of servers. Of course the menu is a bit on the pricier side with 10-16 bones for an appetizer. But that is to be expected based on the freshness of their ingredients. They have a stellar wine menu with choices that would make even the biggest wine connessieur scream: "off the hook." Not to mention the crazy list of cocktails! My only request would be for there to be more chicken on the menu!
<review# 1001,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/13/2011,12/11/2011,19,131,3,6,4>If I had one word to describe the Biscuit General Store, that word would be "fun". I find myself casually walking into this store all the time, not necessarily looking for anything in particular. I mean all the different  things you can browse and buy.. it's endless. Fully stocked with clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, housewares and gadgets, Biscuit has something for everyone. The decor and layout of the store alone fills my mind with happy thoughts every time I walk in. I have to agree that items can be pricey ( for those of you who have read my previous reviews,you know that I am a cheapy) But that being said, they do have a "Bargain Basement" where you can find some cute things that are easier on the wallet. The Biscuit General Store is a unique place like no other in Halifax. It can be a hit-or-miss experience but it is definitely worth checking out.

Third time's the charm, and boy, was it ever!Things I know for future: --Bring a warm jacket and scarf and gloves if you're going to be near the waterfront.--Bring either as many friends as possible because groups are fun or just one friend so you don't have the awkward "three people have already been to this but two haven't and really want to go" moments.--It's worth bringing a water bottle of your own, to save money and avoid overwhelming the poor convenience store attendant who clearly hadn't been informed about this event.--Bring some money along, because pretty much everything is free but you might feel like a snack somewhere.--Be prepared for five- or ten-minute lineups for some attractions, particularly as it gets later.--PLAN. A. ROUTE. Can't say this enough. I didn't, and we still had fun, but not as much as we could have.--Bring a program along for last minute "prioritizing attraction" huddles. And maybe a second one if you're feeling generous, because you'll probably run into someone looking lost and trying to find the next attraction.Oh yeah, and I really want Happy Wash back again. Like, seriously. That was probably the highlight of my entire week. My friend and I went through twice because we loved it so much.
<review# 1003,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2011,12/9/2011,44,118,,2,3>I've been here twice now. The first time would have gotten a five star review, I had to take off a few points for the second time. If I could I'd give it 4.5 stars.First, the positive. The staff are all really friendly and helpful. Food arrives fairly quickly, and very tasty. The atmosphere is nice and laid back but with some energy. And I LOVE seeing the all pictures of crazy moustaches on the way up the stairs!The not-so positive: The walls are covered in TVs. It's like they're trying to be a sports bar and not a sports bar at the same time. I'd vote for not a sports bar and take down the the many silent TVs. When I went the second time, I ordered the veggie burger. Our waitress came back about five minutes later to say that they were out of veggie burgers! It was only 4:30pm, how could they be out? I looked over the menu again at my limited veggie options and ordered the Manicotti instead. It was good, if only a tube of pasta with cheese and sauce. And to be fair, my dining companions very much enjoyed their meals.
<review# 1004,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2011,12/8/2011,40,34,3,4,4>This cool cafe is one of a handful of businesses on Ochterloney that are helping Downtown Dartmouth get its sexy back.  They have fantastic coffee, great big baked goods, all served by hip young tattooed staff in a plain but vibrant atmosphere.  No wonder this place has busy day in day out, positively packed on weekends, and has become a destination of choice not just for Dartmouthians, but for our friends from across the bridge.I try to stop in every Saturday, and there is a time when I would not have hesitated to give TIBS five stars.  However, I have noticed a couple of things lately that have bothered me.  First of all, I have noticed that a slight note of superiority has crept into the service from some of the staff.  Maybe the success is going to their heads a little bit?  In any event, I don't need to be talked down to when ordering a coffee and I don't need my croissant with a side of attitude.  I've talked to other people that have noticed this as well.  The other thing is that the legendary baked goods seem to have shrunk in size a little bit: the only thing that has remained huge is the price tag.  I don't mind paying five dollars for a prosciutto and provolone croissant if I can basically make a meal out of it.  But the last few I got were down to ordinary croissant size, which isn't what I have come to expect from TIBS: their croissants were worth paying for because they were different.Anyway, I hope these trends turn out to be a blip on the radar, and that I'll soon be able to do a follow-up review where I can say that everything is back to awesome.  Keep up the good work TIBS and don't rest on your laurels.
<review# 1005,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2011,12/7/2011,55,223,2,4,3>They put steak spice on their potato skins!!!  Yum.This place has been on Waverly rd for as long as I've been in Dartmouth (over 20 yrs now) and it's become quite a land mark.  They have fantastic daily specials, and if you want one of the best burgers in town, try the Mic Mac Burger.  Be warned, it's big, sloppy and delicious.I remember when they used to have $2 burger and fri nights on Tuesdays (years ago).  Our beers would cost more then our food!  The burgers were smaller, but for 2 bucks you could just get 2 (or 3).Since we moved from the area a couple years ago we find ourselves reflecting on the good times at the Mic Mac.  Great staff, good eats, friendly atmosphere, good for all ages, it never disappoints.
<review# 1006,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/28/2011,12/6/2011,25,18,,6,4>Went to Stayner's last Friday and I was very impressed by just about everything! Our servers were all great. The best part was that they have a running series where they hand out tickets and if your ticket it called, they get you to go up and spin the wheel to win some fun prizes. A server and the OWNER did this. The owner was really funny and seeing him out in the crowd making people laugh and be excited was awesome.The food was delicious- as usual. I had the turkey meatloaf which was highly recommended and the whole dish was bursting with flavor. Sounds boring but it was the complete opposite. When my 2 male friends and I left, another server got our coats and put them on us! Now that's service.I can't wait to go back and I highly recommend Stayner's- especially on a Friday night for Happy Hour and Spin the Wheel.
<review# 1007,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2011,12/5/2011,65,55,1,7,6>I've been to Saege a couple times for dinner and have yet to be disappointed with my experience. With a menu that provides a wide selection, I always have a hard time deciding. I usually end up going with what my friend and I refer to as the 'bacon salad', which is their spinach salad. Trust me... you wouldn't regret it! I am also a big fan of the specials they have throughout the week ($10 pizza night is my favorite)!I also recently hosted a networking reception in Purple Saege, their private dinning room at the back of the restaurant. From the great servers to the nicely decorated room, the experience was fantastic and our guests really enjoyed themselves. They were able to provide us with a great selection of hot h'ordeuvres for a great price point. It was a standing reception and, although I wouldn't invite more than 40 or 50 people, it proved to be the perfect venue for an intimate gathering!
<review# 1008,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2011,12/4/2011,33,173,7,7,7>As much as I love going to the farmer's market on the weekend, it's usually not convenient for me.  I live in Cole Harbour and don't drive, and I love sleeping in on Saturdays more than anything in the world. I can now rely on Dave's to hook me up with fresh Valley produce.  Their prices are better than the grocery store's, and their quality is unmatched. I don't feel guilty walking out with $40 worth of groceries because I know it's all healthy noms. But hey, if you really need something salty and sea-salted roasted cauliflower florets just won't cut it, you can pick up a bag of chips from the front display.It's also a great spot to run in and grab some pre-made meals that aren't entirely made of sodium and fillers.  If I'm feeling lazy and can't be bothered to cook dinner, I know that I can just pick up a sheppard's pie  or chicken pot pie with my fresh fruit and eggs, and throw it in the oven when I get home.  It's convenient, cheap, and way more satisfying than a greasy meal from a certain red-headed siren. Plus, if it's your turn to pick up dessert for the family dinner, you know you can bring home a delicious homemade pie or cheesecake from Dave's.Luckily, I don't drive, so all I need to worry about is how many ears of corn I'm going to buy, and not on the sometimes dare-devil driving it takes to get in or out of the parking lot. But if you're the one at the wheel, take a deep breath and gun it.  Don't worry, Dave's wares are worth the risk.
<review# 1009,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2011,12/2/2011,19,4,3,8,4>My sister called me Wednesday night asking if I had plans Friday 'cause she wanted to try the new sushi place that just opened on Quinpool Rd. My sister doesn't even like sushi but saw the menu and really wanted to go. Having just come home from a sushi dinner and despite having plans Friday evening (which I would go to later), I jumped at the chance for another sushi feed. We arrived around 5:50 pm to a packed house but a table cleared within a couple of minutes and we were seated next to a table of four guys with a garbage bag of laundry. Turns out that one of the guys was a waiter (Hyun? sp?), on his day off, having dinner with his friends and the garbage bag of laundry was full of napkins that the waiter had taken home to launder and proceeded to fold when his friends left. He was very friendly and offered his assistance with the menu....then he offered for us to try the maki rolls on the tray that he and his friends were sharing since he had already started on his red bean ice cream. We tried the rolls...an appetizer if you will, and were very impressed...I with the Paris roll and my sister with one that was vegetarian. Another treat we got to try was FRESH WASABI...aka awesome-sauce! Apparently it's much more expensive per pound than sushi grade tuna but I would be willing to pay for it. We chat with Hyun some more and find out that , Michelle (I recognize her from when she worked at Hamachi on Morris a couple years ago), one of the owners makes great gyoza and I think that I will have to try next time. I suddenly remember that I forgot to order my sushi with brown rice (I always forget) but just shrug and say "oh, well". Hyun gets up and upon return tells me he was able to changed my order to brown rice (and my sister's too after he asks her if she wanted the same and went back again). The miso soup and salad arrive. The miso soup is nice and hot and not too salty as it can sometimes be. The house-made ginger dressing on the salad is yummy, my sister wants to drink what's left in the bowl (we would if we were home). Our combo plates arrive, my sister's is vegetarian and mine is the Maki Crystal (spicy tuna, spicy salmon and spicy dragon roll....but that's not all that arrives....a bowl with two gyoza (one each) for us to try (and yes, they were delish) and my plate has two pieces of salmon sashimi. But wait...that"s not all...Hyun had them put the FRESH WASABI on our plates!! (as well as the regular wasabi, which I also use up...I always do!)The meal was yummy. The service from the 'off duty'  Hyun was incredible (they did forget about us at first but we didn't really notice since we we talking to Hyun and had 'appetizers' if I could only take 1/2 a star off  for this I would but to be fair, it was SUPER BUSY and people were being turned away as we ate...so it will remain 5 stars)I mentioned to Hyan that it would be great to have the #twushi group there sometime. He has heard of the #twushi group and they would welcome us with open arms (we'd just have to make an advanced reservation) and gave me a handful of 10% coupons. My sister has some and I will share the rest with my #twushi friends.My brother-in-law asked my sister before we went out, "Why would you want to go to a place that just opened?" Whatever she answered him at the time, it doesn't matter. All I can say now is, "I'm so glad we did!"
<review# 1010,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/19/2011,12/1/2011,38,94,,3,3>Stopped by here on recommendation from the missus since the spot seemed to be a work favourite for lunch.Too bad the daily special are not on during the weekend. I walked into the door and expected the usual scenery, small space but tables were well spaced apart, it doesn't allow for more than 24 people (unless there were hidden areas that I didn't see). Very clean.We got a table for 2 at the window overlooking Barrington st. We opted for the Crab Rangoon since it seemed to be a popular appetizer on four square. Then I ordered a combo plate (#8, curry chicken with veggies. rice & spring roll).Staff very pleasant and food came well present and ready to eat - and delicious.  The bill came up to 42$ for 2 combos, 1 appetizer & 1 beer. About average for us.
<review# 1011,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/15/2011,11/30/2011,6,5,,3,3>I recently went to Cut and had the best appetizer in my life! I had heard about the Lobster Poutine and was told by my colleague that it was awesome. It was really the best thing I've ever eaten. My steak was almost disappointing after the poutine. If you go, eat it, eat it, eat it!
<review# 1012,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/21/2011,11/29/2011,1,9,,4,2>We arranged to have my mother-in-law's 80th birthday party at the diner. She prefers more casual places to go to and True North Diner was perfect.We arrived at True North Diner and there was seating reserved just for our party. The staff took the cake we had brought and said they would take care of it for us. The place makes you feel like you have gone back in time with its authentic vintage jukebox and classic cake display case filled with pies.I got the cheeseburger with the sweet potato fries which were amazing! A thicker cut fry can sometimes be less crisp but these were perfect and tasted delicious. The burger was moist and flavourful. Perfect diner food.Of course I also had to have a chocolate milkshake! Talk about classic. I prefer my shakes to be thicker but this one was very good and came with the metallic canister with additional shake. What a treat!True North Diner was a comfortable hang-out spot with casual food and seriously, the most patient staff in the whole world. They let us just wander and talk to everyone and gave us all time to catch up and say happy birthday to the birthday girl who had the greatest time.My only complaint? The floors were not very clean. Not just ours but around the restaurant which is a shame because I would have given it a perfect score had there been more attention taken to keeping the floors food-free. The fabulous service by our sweet and thoughtful waitress more than made up for it.We had a great party and the birthday girl was very happy. Thank you True North Diner!
<review# 1013,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/21/2011,11/28/2011,40,216,2,2,2>The Henry House has always been one of my favourite higher end pubs in the city. You don't come here for cheap drinks or women with short skirts (although the latter is never frowned upon). The HH is all about good food and drinks in a respectable pub atmosphere where you're not trying to avoid stepping on glass or mystery spills.Over the years, I've become a big fan of their Halifamous Ultimate Burger, so on my visit last week I wanted to get something more traditional from their menu and continued the fish cakes kick that I've been on this fall. Our orders are promptly taken by an Aussie waiter that my co-workers may have liked more than the food, if they hadn't raved so much about the fries, but I digress. When our meals arrived I was greet my two sizable salt cod fish cakes. Golden brown and crisp on the outside, the cakes still gave way to my fork and knife without squishing, which always bothers me when this happens to a fish cake. The salt cod is, naturally, fairly salty but not in an unpleasant way, and the tasty fish is mixed thoroughly throughout the fluffy potato filling. The green tomato chow that is advertised on the menu wasn't available, and I found that the tomatillo salsa that came instead of the chow was too overpowering for the fish. Fortunately, there was a bottle of Heinz to save the day. Maybe it's unrefined, but I'm a sucker for ketchup and fish cakes.Accompanying my fish cakes was an bowl of baked beans and brown bread. While the bread didn't seem particularly brown, it was fine, if unremarkable and served as a delivery vessel for the beans. The beans themselves had a delicious sweet onion flavour from what I would assume were caramelized onions as well as a rich earthiness from the sauce, although the beans were a tad too firm.It was a solid lunch, and with rave reviews around the table for the food and service, and without a doubt I'll be back at the HH for food cider and general good times.
<review# 1014,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/23/2011,11/27/2011,3,4,,5,3>I loved my stay at the Inn on the Lake!     Recently engaged, my fiance and I were looking for a romantic weekend outside of the city (we live downtown Halifax).    Our room was great; with a big big balcony overlooking Lake Thomas and the pool, a very spacious 2 person jacuzzi (when they say two-person tub they mean it!), an electric fireplace, and the front desk even sent us a complimentary bottle of Champagne and decadent chocolate truffles to congratulate us on our engagement.  Needless to say we felt very welcome and were very pleased with our room!     We had breakfast at the Encore restaurant, which is a very tastefully decorated and well-maintained restaurant, a real must-see!  The food was delicious, and the service was friendly and professional.     Every time we passed the front desk they remembered who we were and greeted us with smiles.     The housekeeping staff were friendly and polite, our wonderful room speaks to their abilities.     I loved my stay at the Inn on the Lake, and look forward to going back many more times.     It really is the perfect little escape just outside of Halifax.  (We were home to feed the pets on Saturday and back to the Inn in less than an hour!)
<review# 1015,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/25/2011,11/26/2011,76,115,,6,5>I have heard a lot of buzz about this place, but never got a chance to visit until recently. It's cute inside, albeit a bit small and rough (it's nothing fancy), and you are greeted warmly as soon as you walk in. There are a few employees who are are actually FROM Mexico, and I thought this was nice to see (obviously not essential but it just sort of made the whole experience feel more authentic).The boy and I ordered the dinner for two which includes one burrito, one enchilada, one chimichanga, one quesadilla plus a side of rice and beans (or one or the other). Everything came out quickly, piping hot, and looked delicious on the plate (lots of condiments - just how I like it!). Everything tasted as delicious as it looked! It all tasted very fresh. I am not normally a huge beef lover but the beef was really tasty (we are talking shredded, roast beef NOT hamburger - ya know, the authentic way of doing it, not the Americanized way that we North American's expect). I also liked that you could mix up the meat - you could have chicken on two, beef on two if you wanted. Everything was spicy enough to be flavourful without being too hot, which was great for me (I don't like too much spice).Our server was very friendly, and since the boy speaks spanish, she and he chatted a bit and we learned from her that there are a lot of people here from the Mexican city that the boy lived in when he was a kid, which I thought was interesting. She said there is an "american" school there that a lot of Canadians and such teach at, so that may explain the connection. This obviously has nothing to do with the food, but I always like to consider the WHOLE experience of eating out at a place, and for me her warmth and conversation added that little something extra to our meal.We were completely stuffed by the time we finished, so in retrospect the dinner for two was probably a bit too much food for us. But I am glad I got to try a little bit of everything. I love that they have freshly squeezed, natural fruit juices as an option instead of your usual pop and iced tea. We had the cantalope juice and it was really really good! Very fresh. The 1/2 pitcher is a really good deal for 2 people too - $3.99! We each had two glasses and still didn't even finish it.I really enjoyed this place and will be back next time I need a kick of Mexican carbs!
<review# 1016,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/19/2011,11/25/2011,18,60,,5,4>I've only recently discovered this joint as I've just moved to the South end. I've been here three times. Twice, I was sober and looking for poutine. I really enjoyed theirs. While it is not tradition, with cheese curds - I really enjoy the gravy, and there is a lot of cheese - so it's tasty. The other time I was a little intoxicated, and grabbed a slice and a drink for 5$ (not a bad price). I really enjoyed that they put shawarma garlic sauce on the crust for me. Cheap, greasy food. Perfect for a quick bite.
<review# 1017,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2011,11/24/2011,15,60,5,11,9>As a proud Dartmouth lady, I love me some D-town farmer's market. But it's not just civic pride that makes this market, that's for sure, and every year it's getting better. A couple of the highlights:1. German bakery guy! Boyfriend and I used to drive to Wolfville just to visit German bakery and now they're here! Their turnovers are UNBELIEVABLE. So flaky, so much filling, so worth the mountain of calories you're ingesting. And they have neat flavours, like gooseberry and plum, along with the more traditional apples and cherries. Such a huge bonus for this market.2. Noggins farm. A staple at the Halifax market, Noggins has a huge stall over on the Dark Side as well. Great produce, friendly service. J'aime. They usually have late season berries as well, which is lovely. And excellent basil from Taproot Farms as well. 3. New fish stand! I have yet to try their fishcakes (next week), but the new fish joint in Alderney is probably my new mecca. For a mostly meatless household, access to fresh and frozen local fish options is huge. Great great great addition. 4. Pakoras and samosas! There's a stall run by lovely Indian couple, and their samosas are massive. Like, size of face massive, and are quite delicious. They've also got pakoras, butter chicken, rice, and lots of other options for those craving a little Indian takeaway on a Saturday morning. YUMMY.For the convenience alone I love this market, and I love how it's growing and improving. Encourage everyone to come check it out, just for a change of pace from the bustle of Halifax. Oh and in August, free pancake breakfast. Need I say more?
<review# 1018,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/11/2011,11/23/2011,47,445,,5,3>After an afternoon of hiking at Crystal Crescent Park, this convenience store is a great place to stop because there is a take out kitchen area included in the store. They have pizza, sandwiches and fish and chips for take out and there are picnic tables on the porch. They were really quick and brought the food out to us and I was really happy that they were ok with my dogs hanging out on the porch as well. Two pieces of haddock with fries for under $9 including tax? Really good deal and good quality, plus the view of the water is pretty nice.
<review# 1019,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2011,11/22/2011,15,91,,5,4>Hal-Con was an all around great experience. I only went for Saturday but I got to see a lot of great costumes and workshops. The "Zombie Apocalypse Survival" workshop was by far my favorite. The artist alley seemed a little under appreciated and so did the model makers. Many amazing conversations were had with model makers, artists, and con-goers.There should be a spot specifically for cosplayers to go for photos. I know that they probably don't mind being stopped but having a separate place for photos would be better so they aren't getting stopped and there's no one running in front while you try to snap a picture. Wi-fi sucked unless you went to the only hotspot at the con.There was no place to go for snacks or drinks unless you wanted to leave the convention center. If there are worries about food in certain areas have a "food only" section and ban food elsewhere.
<review# 1020,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2011,11/21/2011,42,100,5,7,3>To start off this review, plain and simple, Pacifico is what Halifax needs for a gay bar.Only it's not a gay bar. And that's fine. Because if it were, the music might be slightly less Top 40, less indulgent in the 90s dance era, and less diverse.There are a few different bars inside the club to get drinks. The decor is very swanky. I do very much enjoy the music when I want current and classic mingled together, most of which are songs I know and a lot of them I do enjoy. I could use more in the way of what a gay bar would play (ie. Madonna, Lady GaGa maybe throw in some Dragonette and other dance/pop-without-a-rap-verse hit) but you can also hear that classic hit that hasn't graced your ears in ten years.Not into that? There is a room in the back that specializes in heavier beats.Pacifico is also quite clean. Of course, as the night processes, it gets less clean but it never feels dirty. I don't think there's a drink special but cover can range from cheap to average. ($1 for students I hear? Never more than $5?). And if your bracelet has a specific number on it, you can spin the big wheel for a chance at money, prizes, free booze, free cover (for next time), nothing or barred for a month. :/On the downside, on a busy night it can get really hot. There may not be air conditioning or at least it's not noticeable. The dance floor is a bit small so it's usually crowded. I've seen a few fights here but I think they're rare and perhaps the ones I have seen were because come 2am, everyone is trying to get out and the line-up to exit can take longer than the line-up to get in, which can get frustrated so leave ahead of the rush if you can.Now, if only I can convince my friends to just start coming here when we all go out...
<review# 1021,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2011,11/20/2011,3,5,4,4,3>In a trendy North end neighbourhood Humani-T Café is a great fit.Serving a wonderful array of home made soups, sandwiches, gelato, gluten free baked goods and organic free-trade coffee Humani_T has it all. They also have a small speciality section of natural, organic health foods which is both good and bad.  Good because it is really great products (really brings you back into apothecary times with a selection of teas, herbs, potions, and such) but for the more claustrophobic individual the massive amount of product in a tiny space can be overwhelming.Personally I hate clutter and being a little on the OCD/Super organizational side of the thought spectrum I tend to zero in on the counter of foodgasm  and bypass the shop part of the café altogether.But since it makes for more interesting conversation let's get back to the foodgasm shall we?I have NEVER been disappointed with the fare offerings at Humani-T. Whether you are there for a latte, sandwich, baked good or one of their amazing home made gelato flavours you find something that makes you go "mmmm."I also love the vibe at Humani-T. It's a great place for meeting with a group of friends, co-workers or just hanging out with yourself-because face it, we are all super fun people and don't need others around to have a fabulous time! They have comfy sofas, lots of tables, a great upstairs loft space with more tables and a super cute patio, play great music and have free wi-fi!We are blessed to have so many great café's in Halifax and Humani-T ranks up there among my most favourite! So what are you waiting for? Hit up the gelato, your taste buds will thank you :)

We tried out  Happy Sushi on a Saturday night and the place was busy. Not too busy but there was a constant flow of customers.The menu was quite extensive with an appetizer section, tempura section, maki section, sushi section, handroll section and sashimi section. For a cost of about $24, you can order all the sushi you can eat, plus have a pop or tea and ice cream for dessert.The two of us just ordered dishes to split all night. We probably ended up eating what would be about $100 worth of sushi at any other restaurant. As for the food, it is good--not the best in the city--but the best bang for your buck.The atmosphere was nice and the service was excellent. There was no point when we had to chase down a server. That is saying a lot for the amount of dishes that we constantly coming to people's tables.All in all, it is an experience you need to have. I know that we will be back there soon!Oh and if you pay cash you save 10%

He had the Candied Date & Prosciutto Crositini appetizer (he loved it), roasted pork tenderloin for the entree and the trio of creme brulee (pear, raspberry and chocolate) for dessert - all big hits for him. I had the beef tenderloin with an espresso and chocolate reduction. Three of my favorite things together!The staff were helpful, the service was quick but not rushed and you did not feel pressed to finish. They had a great drink and wine menu. There were plenty of patrons there, but it maintained a nice intimacy (I loved the booths). The decor was very sleek but not sterile.The costs were on par with other casual/upscale restaurants in the area.We will visit again!
<review# 1024,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/9/2011,11/17/2011,0,3,,4,1>I've been going to Chrysalis Spa for eyebrow shaping for years. In fact, before I lived here, I used to make time in every visit. Staff here are consistently good - consulting about shape, using high quality products, taking the time to do the job well.My only complaint is that, in the last half dozen times I've been there, my appointment started at least 15 minutes late. This is a major problem when you're trying to squeeze a wax in at lunch!

I can't get over the prices - cheaaaaaaaaap. Unlike some other indian restos in the city, you arent paying with your firstborn for a meal. My indian aunties came to visit from Toronto and proclaimed the daal to the the best they have ever had! Rowwwwwr! The buffet is amazing as are the dosas.. now im hungry!
<review# 1026,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2011,11/15/2011,4,24,2,2,2>I should start by saying I'm not really a spa person. Or at least I never thought so. The only reason I ever tried it out was because one of my best friends was having her birthday shindig there.You can make it a pretty girly day by going early and enjoying their pool (or the Marriot's Pool) and the steam shower (which really is pretty fantastic!). The first time I went I tried the pedicures and I will confirm here and now they really are the best in the city. I've gone back multiple times for them and have recommended them to even my pregnant friends. I've also had some waxing done there and had varying experiences. I would recommend Sandra - she's quick, relatively painless and has a soft touch (without feeling creepy).Most of my friends swear by the massages and in Nathan in particular, but I have yet to have one done myself.  My treatment of choice is the clinical facial. My first experience sold me in the first 5 minutes: the esthetician shone an impossibly bright light in my face for a couple of minutes and then diagnosed the exact issues I had with my skin. She then recommended a treatment plan with both expensive and inexpensive options (some were even drug store options). Not only was she knowledgeable and understanding but she didn't try to push products or treatments on me as other spas have in the past. She told me what I definitely needed and explained other things were optional. After each treatment she made herself available (even on days she was not working) for any questions and gave me lots of information on each treatment and their side effects. I even called her in a grocery store freaking out about a product and whether or not I could use it. That is client-service delivery. The best part? She recommended outside help. To say that the recommendations/treatments worked is an understatement.  I feel like I could do a late night infomercial and am silently kicking myself for not taking before and after photos (mostly for the shock value).  Seriously. This face could sell anything now!Although I really do love this place there are a few issues.  If you are heading to Spirit for a clinical esthetician beware that they do not stay long. I'm not sure why and have often wondered if there are some staffing  or management issues, but in the past year I've gone through 3 different estheticians. It can be frustrating as they will all recommend different things and it does take some time to get a rapport or trust going with each other. It is also not the cheapest spa. The location and polish of the spa make it pretty easy to charge a fair amount so don't be surprised when you receive the bill. Frankly, I do not even want to think about how much I've spent there in the year alone.

When I first stumbled upon this gem, I took note of their decadent peanut butter squares, and their outrageously delicious date smiles (a date square wrapped in a half-moon).I haven't tried everything, and thank god for that. I would be 50 pounds heavier, and none too pleased. However, the baked goods I have tried have all been prepared and baked to perfection. It is perfect for those days when you need a quick pick-me-up, or something to satisfy your sweet tooth. The ladies who work the front counter are sweet, and are more than happy to help you pick your poison.If you haven't had the opportunity to check it out, I suggest you do so next time you are in Sunnyside!
<review# 1028,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/9/2011,11/13/2011,28,43,2,2,2>The owners certainly went all out in their attempt to recreate an authentic Irish pub. From the refacing of a genuinely hideous building, to the gorgeous bar as centerpiece, to the fine glass work on the doors, and the spare but cozy furnishings the place just felt right. They even had the good sense to not demean their staff by requiring them to dress like serving wenches and stable boys (I'm looking at you Halifax Alehouse).The food is above average pub fare. Be sure to check out their annual Annual Irish Beer dinner in January.
<review# 1029,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2011,11/12/2011,27,148,,30,23>This place is REALLY good!  I have been waiting for good Indian to come to Halifax and I've finally found it.  I had the butter chicken combination place ($10) which came with a salad, a good portion of fluffy basmati rice and a half circle of naan.  Everything was fresh, flavourful and not heavy or oily.  The mango lassi wasn't too sweet, either.   The service was very friendly and prompt.  They only have about 8 tables, so either go early or make reservations.  I am absolutely going back and recommending it to friends!
<review# 1030,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2011,11/11/2011,39,130,3,3,2>Like I always say... any place that gives out free samples of cake is a good place, and any place that gives out free samples of three different kinds of cake is a GREAT place.  Ok, I don't always say that, but I may start. In addition to the delightfully delicious cakes that Rum Runners is so famous for, they also sell a variety of merchandise including t-shirts, sweaters, mugs, and of course - shot glasses.  Much of it is humorous, which I appreciate, and the staff is friendly. They won't even give you a look when you sneak an extra sample on your way out. Whether you're looking for a fun gift or a treat for yourself, Rum Runners is a great place to check out.
<review# 1031,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2011,11/10/2011,25,107,5,5,5>It's a bit of a weekly tradition for folks from my office to grab lunch here on Fridays. Being the new kid in the office I was pretty excited to hop on the Friday Pho train. When we rolled in with 10+ people they didn't even flinch, a server pulled some tables together and off we went. The menu is on the small side, but there are lots of delicious choices. Our server was super knowledgeable about the menu and made several recos for vegetarian friendly dishes and modifications that could be made to other dishes on the menu. Um and the craziest part?! SHE KNEW EVERYBODY'S NAME! It was unreal. And knew pretty much what everybody was getting to eat before they even ordered. Regulars or what?!Lunch was delicious and for dessert they have the most amazing and delicious ENORMOUS rice krispy squares. I can't wait to go back!
<review# 1032,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/9/2011,11/9/2011,29,249,,3,3>It has taken me a long time to try Ciboulette, but I finally met a friend here yesterday. The small, warm cozy atmosphere was a great remedy to the cold wet weather outside. The staff were friendly and let us take our time before deciding. The menu mainly features sandwiches and there is a soup of the day. The sandwiches are premade and are finished in the panini press. This is good if you're in a rush, but not great if you want to make a substitution. Because we met for an early lunch, I decided to have breakfast instead, and opted for one of their famous muffins, I snagged the last blueberry oatmeal. It lived up to it's reputation, bursting with flavour and blueberries, moist,  it was a real muffin and not a frostling-less cupcake. I had a cafe au lait with it, which was also good. I noted with delight that their scones are served with clotted cream. If you've never had the opportunity to have clotted cream, you are missing out. Overall, I am not a huge fan of sandwiches (weird I know, who doesn't like sandwiches?) so this won't be my usual lunch spot, but I will definitely be popping in to try some more muffins and have some scones with my clotted cream.
<review# 1033,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/20/2011,11/8/2011,74,22,,5,3>My new Saturday AM tradition is to wake up bright and early and go for a walk across the Common to Jane's Next Door. Their coffee is always perfect, and what's more, they have incredible goodies for breakfast.Case in point: the sweet potato breakfast biscuit. This innocuous looking creation is filled with egg, cheese, bacon, and veggies (there's a non-meat version, too). It is pure deliciousness, and I don't care if I become obese eating these babies. So. Good.Their take-out food is also quite nice. I'm a fan of their sweet potato/black bean casserole and their sticky toffee pudding. They also sell Jane's famous tomato butter there, which, weirdly enough, goes with basically everything.A bonus to shopping at this little store: everyone who I've encountered working where is basically The. Nicest. Ever. They smile and make awesome chit-chat as I stumble in at 8 AM. Such pleasant folks. Love having this store in my neighbourhood!
<review# 1034,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2011,11/7/2011,10,118,4,1,2>Also one of my favourite places to shop in Halifax due to it's diversity. I appreciate good sailor hats, sailor anything really and combat boots. CHEAP (in cost) combat boots! Also Gas Masks. So many gas masks. Oh how I love Gas Masks. They have a good selection of clothing, a good selection of vintage army everything and some antiques. Their prices are good and the people who work there typically add an extra Hmmmm to the store. Love it.
<review# 1035,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/25/2011,11/6/2011,43,449,,4,3>I've been to Sospeso twice now, and I'm positive that I'm going to add this to my rotation of local coffee shops. I really like the vibe, it's not ever too busy (hopefully that will change, but for now, I'll happily enjoy the solace), and the quality of the coffee is unmatched. The atmosphere is friendly - all of the baristas have been chatty, and the ambiance is eclectic and fun. Various art is displayed on the colourful walls and the music is always a great mix of tunes. I like to sit in the window ledge and watch the street, but there are plenty of comfy options, including a futon that looks like it would welcome a nap in the back room. I'm hoping that in time I can learn more about the awesome selection of coffees they have - it's all awesome!
<review# 1036,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2011,11/5/2011,19,100,,3,4>I heart Bookmark so much. I am so pleased at the amazing online customer service for special orders, as well as the service with a smile when I go pick up. I admit to being easily overwhelmed in bookstores, so I will admit I don't go in to browse that very often, but, and especially since there are so few indies left in town, Bookmark has my new book dollar, any day of the week.
<review# 1037,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/26/2011,11/4/2011,52,21,7,7,8>I've been a reluctant FRED visitor. I think it's my absence of hipster persona. That and I was admittedly a bit scared that Fred himself would give me the Manhattan once-over and roll his eyes at my Banana Republic-fueled wardrobe and misplaced hair. But, alas, my fears were unfounded. The place is, indeed, cool. But not in any way inaccessible. It's cool in an inviting sort of way. The staff played a big part in that. Our server was a warm hipster. And the service was fantastic. The decor was beautiful. Simple, but dramatic. The cappuccino was delightful. But the icing on the lovely, dainty little cupcake was, in fact, the icing. Real raspberry with pistachio. Quite simply one of the most delicious things I've eaten. Perhaps ever. That wee cupcake gets five stars all on its own.
<review# 1038,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2011,11/3/2011,51,65,4,4,4>I visited Chez Tess a few days ago for brunch with a small group of friends and was pleasantly surprised by this little gem. I first drove around for a little bit to find parking. There were actually a few open spaces near the restaurant, but Charles St. is one-way and the spaces were on the right hand side. My parallel parking is already a bit of a gong show at times, so I figured it best to not try it backwards. Once inside, I was struck by the cozy interior and the friendly staff. Similar to The Coastal Cafe, Chez Tess's brunch menu is very egg heavy. I'm not much of an egg-eater, so I ordered the french toast. Unfortunately, the banana bread french toast listed on their website menu doesn't seem to be offered anymore. That said, the non-banana bread french toast was resting peacefully in my tummy long before any of my friends had finished their meals, so I guess the banana bread really wasn't a deal breaker. The entree menu looks fantastic and I'm very much looking forward to trying a savoury crepe, like the Chicken Florentine. To be perfectly honest, had my friends not been ordering their egg-laden breakfasts, I probably would've gone for one of the restaurant's dessert crepes masquerading as brunch crepes. But I'll save that for another trip, when I can be ashamed in private...

It's right across from the Public Gardens, it's just off Spring Garden Road and is the huge strip of green running along South Park. Why do I love it? Despite it's small size, it can do almost anything.Looking to hold a public rally? Done. Use the SGR end.Looking to laze in the shade? Done. Use the grassy stretch.Looking to host a car show?

<review# 1040,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/3/2011,11/1/2011,54,227,,5,4>Da Maurizio is one of those popular Halifax restaurants that I've always wanted to try, but didn't have the chance until recently. Now I can't wait to go back.First of all, the service was outstanding. We were eating rather early (probably around 6:30pm) on a Monday, so the restaurant was not busy at all. Every need we had, or could have had, was met quickly. Drinks, questions about the menu, suggestions on wine, everything. I ordered a Bellini, and as they were out of peach nectar it was replaced with apricot - still delicious! With my meal, I had a glass of white wine recommended by the waiter, and it was perfect.The food itself was impeccable. We shared the gnocchi (all pastas and risottos come as appetizers at Da Maurizio, but are also available as mains) thanks to a recommendation from Ben B. Delicious doesn't even begin to describe the gnocchi.I ordered the lamb shank for my main, and it was great - but it didn't compare to Boyfriend's main, the grilled AAA tenderloin. I don't think I've ever tasted beef so delicious. We were wildly impressed with both meals.If you're a vegetarian, there are some great pasta options. Personally, I can't wait to return so I can try the ravioli with pumpkin and apple - it sounded divine! And I unfortunately didn't have room for dessert this time, but there's a cheesecake I have my eye on as well. Overall, it was a fantastic evening out. We were celebrating an anniversary, and the service and food really helped make it a special one. It is expensive, but definitely somewhere I'd recommend for special occasions...or all the time, if you can afford it.
<review# 1041,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2011,10/31/2011,48,65,,3,2>Another place that I go to way too many times a week. The staff are always helpful and friendly, and their coffee is very good. The decor is relaxing and the food is great. A gem of downtown.I actually like that it's not a coffee full of students on laptops. It's a place to go read a book, have a quiet lunch, or meet a friend. Starbucks this is not. And that's very, very good.
<review# 1042,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2011,10/30/2011,39,33,,5,3>Noon on a Saturday and this place is EMPTY. I knew Ben B had a great brunch review so we decided to take a seat and brave the empty restaurant. We ended up having one of the best brunches we have ever had. The complete breakfast was stunning. Homemade sausage, perfectly smoked bacon and an omelette that was done just right.Fid outdoes almost every other brunch spot in Halifax on quality, price and service (that part is easy I guess). There should be lineups out the door, I can't figure out why it isn't more popular.
<review# 1043,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2011,10/29/2011,14,61,,3,2>When the hubby and I feel like a nice dinner out but not like trekking the whole way into the city, Il Mercato in Bedford is always our number one pick. Don't be tricked into thinking it's subpar because it's located above a shopping mall! The decor and atmosphere is excellent, service is always prompt and friendly, and the food is outstanding. Every meal starts off with bread and olive oil, a nice touch that we always appreciate. I don't even know what dish to recommend - they have some amazing thin-crust pizzas (the veggie is my favourite, with artichokes, asparagus, and baby tomatoes). Hubby orders the chicken ravioli every single time and raves about it and wishes there was more. They're very accommodating about special requests if you have food allergies or are vegetarian/vegan. It's consistently awesome!

I was greeted by silver canteen after silver canteen of olive oil and more importantly, balsamic vinegar.I happen to love vinegar much more than olive oil (leading to balsamic shots back in college), so I walked to that side of the store, but was then led away by sales girl."You can't have dessert before the main course..."I then tasted many, many, olive oils such as blood orange, garlic, herb, and many vintage special pressings. Some of these oils are better than others, but the only way to tell is if you try them, which is the best feature of this tasting bar.However, I ran as quickly as I could to the vinegar side of the store for cinnamon pear, jalapeno, and strawberry (my favourite.)In addition to the great selection of olive oils and vinegars, there are also great gift ideas here. Some of these include, olive oil soap, olive wood products, and shampoos.Liquid Gold is a great place to stop by to brighten your day  and imagine that you are in sunny Italy, which is desperately needed in a city of fog and rain
<review# 1045,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2011,10/27/2011,39,42,5,8,3>There was a time when I could never remember the name of this store. My friend and I used to call it "10 000 Watts of Indian Groceries" in reference to the "220 Volts" mentioned on their sign outside. I've come to be a huge fan of "10 000 Watts." I do a ton of Indian cooking at home and really appreciate their bargain prices on various lentils, more difficult-to-find spices such as mango powder, black salt, dried galangal and curry leaves. They also carry a selection of Indian body care products such as the fun Ayurvedic Vicco toothpaste, as well as various soaps and hair treatments. It's certainly worth checking out their wide array of boxed spice mixtures-- they seem to have one for every possible type of dish you'd want to create-- as well as their delicious spicy snack mixes. Indian Groceries is an awesome store to browse even if you never intend to cook an Indian meal. They seem to be open reasonably late too, to serve all your 220 Volt needs.

This lil' corner joint is easy to miss; it blends into the building quite well but once in there their local art (which is for sale) will inspire you, their food will ignite you, and their service will engage you! Morris East offers different pizzas which to prove to be unique; mushroom- about 6 different mushrooms sliced with mozzarella and greens! This is just one of many! The crust is crispy, thin, and is offered in traditional and whole wheat, and they both taste fantastic. It's a cute date spot that offers a nice lunch and dinner. But beware, you will frequent until you've tasted the menu.

<review# 1048,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2011,10/24/2011,65,111,,5,4>I heart Obladee Wine Bar. This place was so needed in downtown Halifax. It's so lovely to head down for a glass of wine after work or start an evening there before heading out to dinner. They have an excellent selection of wines by the glass, covering many price points. I love that their wine list is ever changing, so there's always something new to try. The servers have always given excellent recommendations if I'm unsure. And the charcuterie boards are fantastic. You can choose a combination of meats and cheeses, which are provided with bread and condiments. These boards are the perfect size for sharing with a couple friends, and the combination choices are almost endless. You'll find a lot of local meat and cheese options, and even the boards themselves were made in the province.The atmosphere, both inside and on the sidewalk patio, is conducive to both intimate chats/dates and group conversations among friends. The service has always been very friendly, fun and so helpful.You can tell a lot of time, thought and heart went into creating this place. Halifax is lucky to reap the rewards.

I'm a big fan of the huevos rancheros and have trouble ordering anything else (I have and I've enjoyed it, but I can't recall what it was). The menu changes often, but I always return to my rancheros for super tasty times. Take the extra veggies if they offer it. The coffee is quite good. Someday, I will be brave enough to try the Elvis.My biggest problem with this joint is that getting a seat is a total crapshoot. It's tiny and there aren't a lot of tables. If you're not there early or just as someone is leaving, forget it. Since you order at the counter, it's kind of confusing to figure out if you're supposed to order first and then get a table or snag a table and then order.  A clearly indicated system would be nice. Bonus: if you ever have a chance to eat dinner here, DO IT. Don't think about it, just do it. I had a New Year's Eve dinner here in 2009 and it was amazing. The other customers provided dinner theatre (like the guy whose date abandoned him before the main course), the staff was wonderful and the food was superb.

A beautiful and eclectic marvel in contrast to the stoic catholic boys school building next door. The Black Market primarily stocks the sort of otherworldly goods that you would likely come home with after a trip around India/South East Asia. -been there, bought the t-shirt, or sari in this case. Notable  finds: summer skirts (on sale) in deep rich colours, incense in all sorts of scents, as well as earrings galore. Looking for some funky ear jewels on the cheap (but not plastic looking)? BMB has something for every taste from fancier sterling silver with gem stones right down to swirly bits of fabric with earring piece attached. Couple other notables: earthen dishware, silk drapery, and organic cotton tops/skirts and dresses!This is a great place to stop and check out! BMB can get extremely overcrowded at times so beware bringing your impatient significant other or small kidlits. Actually, this place is pretty much just stacked to the gills with things kids aren't allowed to touch so maybe leave your monsters at home or install them at a pizza corner table down the road while you whip over. Best to give yourself a budget as well or you'll end up like me with 1/2 dozen more wrap skirts than one gal has any need for! Enjoy!
<review# 1053,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/16/2011,10/19/2011,32,111,,5,4>I paid my first visit to Ma Belle's yesterday and discovered a sure bet for lunch in Dartmouth. I was looking for a lunch spot in downtown Dartmouth and had heard about this tea room. It's a small, cozy space with five or six tables and a small patio out front. With a definite local feel (I think Ma was the server who checked with us after our meal), the place could feel cramped, but we mostly found it charming with its decor of teapots and faux painted walls.The three of us were quickly shown a table and proceeded to be intrigued by the menu which offered homemade quiches, sandwiches, paninis, soups, salads and breakfast. Our table was right by the kitchen so we could see everything being freshly prepared and, best of all, the dessert case. I choose the special, a steak sandwich on soft pretzel bread with a garden salad. It was delicious. My friends chose the crustless quiche special which looked fabulous as well. They had quite a selection of teas as well as some more exotic beverages like sparkling lemonade and ginger beer.While our main courses were great, the best part was dessert. We split a sticky toffee pudding that served warm oozed with sweetness and a very moist gluten-free chocolate brownie. All that homemade goodness for three cost $55 and change. Very reasonable for such good food.The service was friendly, attentive and fast. The next time I'm in Dartmouth craving a great dessert, I know where I'll be heading.

That said, I love coming here.When I come, it's to buy magic cards. It's worth making my way out here rather than just stopping in at walmart because I can save lots of money. Their prices are much cheaper than the big box stores, so I can get a lot more bang for my buck. But, it is inconvenient for me to head out here, so it's not some place I come often. The real reason I'd like to give it five stars is the service. I've only ever been helped out by two people (maybe they only have two regulars employees, who knows), but they are both amazing. Super friendly, very helpful. They talk to you like you're a person, not a customer, and it's all very relaxed feeling. I can't wait to come here again; I have a newfound love for tabletop gaming, and this is where I'm gonna spend my dough.
<review# 1056,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2011,10/16/2011,15,59,,4,3>Tattletales is an independent Dartmouth bookstore that has been around since 1995. First in Penhorn Mall, and now in the newly opened Penhorn Plaza. They're a good mixture of a children's bookstore, a toy store, and an excellent resource for teachers.  The new store has a spacious clean setup and the displays are an inviting feast for the eyes. The toy section has a wide array of educational and just plain fun stuff. There's a great selection of Lego and Playmobile with some sets I haven't seen elsewhere. They also stock board games and puzzles. This is a toy store I could spend quite a while perusing. I don't have any children, but I adore this store with my childhood heart and love of whimsy. I've found the prices to be fair and often less than the big competitors. They also offer orders on any book or product they don't have in stock.The book section is exactly what a children's bookstore should be. There is a ton of variety in titles and the layout offers a much more intimate setting than the big box stores. The displays offer suggestions on the best pics for books and prominently shows what's new. In the exploding market of youth books they seem to carry everything. Not just Twilight. They shelve all the top titles along with little known gems.Tattletales' staff are friendly and helpful. They give you that local feel only an independent bookstore can. A definite must for book and toy lovers.
<review# 1057,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2011,10/15/2011,16,94,3,3,3>Ok ok ok, let me start by saying...I LOVE Thai food. I have had my fair share of Thai food, both in thailand and all over. Now that being said, I have had some good Thai and more then enough bad!But what a breath of fresh air when I heard about Cha Baa Thai. Tonight I had the Chicken Pad Thai, always a classic never a failure. And Cha Baa's is one of the BEST!! Nom Nom Nom Nom. Both my boyfriend and I didn't even speak while eating, unless it was to discuss the the  deliciousness before us. I was going to take a photo of it, but was too caught up in eating and enjoying...that should be a big enough clue...THAT YOU SHOULD GO!!!! PS. their take out containers are awesome, no leaking or cracking! yay for restaurants that care enough that the plastic bag isn't soaked with sauce!Please go and enjoy!
<review# 1058,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2010,10/14/2011,29,269,,2,1>Be warned, this place is packed in the summer.  Perfect location - Bishop's Landing near the cruise ships, doesn't hurt.   The service is friendly and, although you can eat on the terrace and people watch, I prefer to visit off tourist season.The food is fresh and the prices are just right!   Typically, my husband will order pizza - lots of carnivore choices for him.  I favor the pastas and even though every dish looks tasty, I usually end up with the Spaghettini Frutti di Mare.   It's a great place to chill with friends.
<review# 1059,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2009,10/13/2011,8,242,,4,1>This is my new favourite place in Halifax. When I run away from home, you will find me here in this unpretentious little bar with the friendly staff.  I've only ever been in the space twice (once to buy tickets to a concert, once to attend the concert) and already Janet (owner? manager? barkeep?) treats me like a regular, complete with joking abuse and clever quips. Who doesn't love that kind of treatment? The bar hosts a lot of live music - there's probably someone playing there most nights of the week. This week they brought in the fantastic Emm Gryner who did an amazing show for the intimate little audience of maybe 100. It's not a restaurant, but they offer snacks like nachos and samosas if you get a little peckish. Atmosphere is casual and neighbourhoody. Now that I've been, they are going to have a hard time keeping me out.

<review# 1061,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2010,10/11/2011,20,253,,2,2>Schooner Books seems like the kind of place where, if it were ever going to happen, you would find an enchanted book. It's an old house converted into a rambling bookstore with shelves full of all sorts of treasures. If you know a book hound, this is a great place to take them to impress, but even if you just find yourself in the neighbourhood one day I recommend stopping in. Prices range from five or ten dollars up into the hundreds for really rare items. And there are some rare items here among the thousands of novels, magazines, textbooks, children's books and photographs that they have amassed. Beautiful old bindings are everywhere, and that "old book scent" permeates the place. Worth a trip.
<review# 1062,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2010,10/10/2011,17,263,1,2,2>Since I don't live in the south end, the point pleasant grocery is mostly useless to me as a corner store. This doesn't mean I don't like the place, quite to the contrary, I really love it during certain times of year.When the sun is out and the days are warm point pleasant park is a great spot to spend a day with a friend and an ice cream. Point Pleasant Grocery is a great spot to grab the aforementioned ice cream. The store has a lot of flavors and offers fairly large scoops for a decent price. In addition to the ice cream, the older couple who run the store are a hoot and love to have a little chat if the ice cream line isn't too busy!As a corner store, the Point Pleasant Grocery is alright, but a little out of the way to be a real option for anybody outside the south end. Hot Hint: Point Plesant Grocery is the last pit stop by the entrance to point plesant park which makes it a great place to use the restroom grab some water or snacks for a walk.
<review# 1063,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2009,10/9/2011,71,306,,1,2>Late at night, I used to work at an editing studio on Gottingen street. I'd always forget to make a dinner so my kudos goes out to Island Greek for hooking me up with pizza, cheeseburgers and some times Greek food. The quality is great and what I love most about it is the taste and the presentation. They package your takeout order, if its cheeseburgers for example, in these smaller boxes with checkerboard colored wrapping paper.  So presentation and quality is great, but what about the pricing? Its not bad. Its just a dollar or two more than I'd like to pay but I have never eaten anything from Island Greek and didn't think I got my money's worth. The staff are about average. Sometimes they are forgetful but they will get your order done and done right. The place is also very clean which means a lot for a local takeout business. They can have such a high turnaround that I can sympathize if they'd want to cut corners in cleanliness from time to time. But Island Greek doesn't which is good. This is a great takeout restaurant. The staff do a good enough job, the food is great, love the presentation and they definitely give me all I could eat. So if you're hurting for some cheeseburgers, pizza and sometimes a Caesar salad, this is a good place to stop on by.
<review# 1064,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/21/2010,10/8/2011,14,258,,2,3>Located in the North End of Halifax, Obsolete Records is a pretty bold move. Opening a record shop this day in age takes a lot of guts and I wish the owner nothing but the best. This is probably going to be an uphill battle.The store is bright and clean and feels like the kind of place you'd feel really bad about spilling a drink. Lot's of white, the kind of place you don't feel silly wearing sunglasses. There's a pretty decent selection of music here and last time I checked, their website keeps a pretty updated record of what they have in stock and what they can order in for you. It's a nice feature that can save you a trip (even though the best part of a record store is finding something you didn't expect).Like the other reviewer, I feel like the guy working felt a little too cool for school to do things like, you know, say hello. I don't want to be pestered when I'm shopping, but I appreciate being acknowledged when I check out a store.This is a good place and has a lot of potential. It's new and has some kinks to work out, but will hopefully stick around to go through traditional growing pains and emerge as a solid competitor for Taz as the best vinyl joint in town.
<review# 1065,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/28/2011,10/7/2011,1,8,5,12,5>This isn't a review so much about the shop more actually about a specific stylist. Melissa is my go to girl for anything hair. She has been cutting my unruly head of curly hair for two years and is the only one I let around my hair.After an extremely unfortunate quasi mullet incident about 8 years ago I decided to cut my own hair, which went well but my husband talked me into going somewhere for a touch up. I went to Melissa who was in another shop at that point intending to get her to cut an easy cut that I would be able to follow on my own. She is so awesome that I kept going back to her and then followed her when she moved to Helen's and I will continue to follow her if she ever moves. If you have curly hair you can appreciate how hard it is to get a good hair cut or well any hair cut that doesn't make you look like a drowned poodle.Visit Melissa at Helen's...she's great and very sweet!

FREE?! Why?! O.k. well this deserved a super tip and some gushing, which I did...when I asked to break my ten $ bill...Seconds later two FREE cookies showed up at our table from our waiter who was so happy to be making our jaded day he skipped slightly, presumably from the joy of giving, as he walked away.  Now I am sure this isn't their regular policy and I would be mortified if people started demanding free stuff from this truly cozy place.  However I know I will be back and ordering some of their famous breakfast.
<review# 1067,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2011,10/5/2011,61,77,8,13,10>I love me some good dill pickles, so while looking for something tasty to woof down in Scotia Square, I figured I'd stop there. I must say that my first initial reaction was that it was going to be average, if that. I mean we are talking food served on cafeteria trays and stuffed in styrofoam dishes (boo). The line is always rather huge and you immediately have to give them props for being a healthy vender surrounded by grease.  They are a family run business and cater great fresh and healthy products. You can even put your order in online. What about the food? There are plenty of healthy options from salads, to soups, to sandwiches. My classic go to is the  1/2 sandwich and soup deal for like 5 bones. Super cheap! The bread is always fresh with whole wheat, white, and ciabatta options. Tons of veggie and sauce options to sex up your sandy. The roasted red pepper mayo is my fav. I'm not the biggest fan of their pasta and potato salads. They just don't pack enough flavor for me. Perhaps Mom just doesn't make it fair for me to compare other salads to. For some reason they just seem incredibly dry and bland. I must say though, Dill Pickle's cream of mushroom soup is to die for!!! It is the best cream of mushroom soup I've ever hard, served in a styrofoam bowl or not. My eyes light up like a Christmas tree when this soup is on the board. It's rich but not too rich and has tons of thinly sliced mushrooms. I personally like a little something to chew in my soup, so the mushrooms are a seller for me. Their chicken noodle soup is pretty fab as well. Make sure you request soda crackers with your soup though. They like to hide those behind the counter and hog them. Overall this is a great healthy food court option and who doesn't love locally owned? Get out and grab some cream of mushroom.

Make sure you try a house roll with which ever our preference of fish. We usually get the red snapper. VERY yummy and full of flavour!They have to have the best dragon rolls I've had in a long time!We are making plans to return often and hopefully experience their tapenyaki (sp?) grill for an upcoming birthday!Make sure you try this out next time you're out in Dartmouth Crossing.
<review# 1069,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/28/2011,10/3/2011,8,31,4,6,5>I'm surprised there aren't yet any reviews on this library! It's definitely lesser-known and harder to get to, but the selection is mind-boggling compared to the Spring Garden Public Library.There's three floors of awesomeness to be found here, freshly renovated and ready for you. The first is the entrance, with a ton of study spaces and meeting places, comfy chairs, and a little coffee shop right next to it. You don't need a library card to get in, and I'll talk more about that in a minute.On the first floor, there's a sizeable reference section with every government document you could need, religious texts, and hey, Writer's Markets galore (just a hint...). Lots of magazines are available, too -- back issues are on the third floor. Public computers are against the wall just around the corner from the checkout desk, though depending on the time of day you visit, it might be hard to get one. Finally, there's a rack in the corner where they display new acquisitions, which is always worth checking out.The second floor has books, books, glorious books. Social sciences, history, and generally interesting topics that you don't have to be an academic nerd to appreciate are all here.On the third floor, you'll find hard sciences (math, physics, nerd heaven...) and the journals. Ever wanted to see what the New York Times Book Review looked like on the day you were born? Have fun!The second and third floors are quiet zones. No loud whispers or talking. Seriously. Kangaroo courts are real. You can eat and drink and sleep there if you like, though! There's lots of desks and even some comfy chairs hidden away on the third floor in particular. If you're not a SMU student and don't have access to the wireless, you can use the free library computers I mentioned earlier or take an internet-free break from life. :)Now, the sticky issue of library cards and "but I'm not a SMU student!". Check out their circulation policies here: smu.ca/administration/li"Students, staff and faculty at all Nova Scotia post-secondary libraries, some high school students, and adult members of the general public are eligible for borrowing privileges at the Patrick Power Library.  Most of those associated with universities and colleges automatically have borrowing rights; other categories of borrowers must apply for privileges.  In most cases, members of the public need only present an official picture ID, such as a driver's license, for privileges to be granted right away.""Our general loan period is three weeks for books, and one week for periodicals...""Once borrowed, an item may be returned to most post-secondary libraries and any public library in Nova Scotia."You're welcome. :D
<review# 1070,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2011,10/2/2011,1,5,3,3,3>I ventured to "Your Fathers Mustache" on a Saturday evening. The downstairs looked to be quite busy and noise polluted but I was quickly lead up to the roof, where it was much calmer. The view from the roof was splendid, especially because the sun was starting to set, which made for a lovely atmosphere. The menu covered the basics, it had nothing that I would call innovative or different. I ended up going with the Mustache burger and fries, which had onion rings, banana pepers, pulled pork, cheese, tomato, lettuce. The burger was pretty tastey, the patty was a little too hidden with all the fixin's on top. The fries were perfectly crispy and enjoyable. Service was just a'ight for me, dawg. The waitress seemed a bit impatient and barely made eye contact when she floated passed. I felt like it was because she was afraid we'd ask her for something. The check took longer than I would of liked it to, it surpassed the amount of time I like to sit and let my feast settle. The restaurants  few shortcomings were nothing major, I certainly did enjoy the rooftop scene, and perhaps most importantly my meal. I'd visit agian.

<review# 1072,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2011,9/30/2011,1,6,,2,2>I Love This Place!This is a restaurant that has been around longer than ive been alive. I normally stick with one of two types of meals when i come here. Its either the steak supper or the steak breakfast. Whatever their recipe is, everytime i eat here, i leave speechless. Im not normally the type of person to eat out somewhere and order something i can easily make for myself at home, but the Mic Mac Tavern's steak is mouthwatering! I love a salty marinade and whatever they use, it is salty and sweet and the steak just melts in your mouth everytime. In my opinion, the best meal of the week, is a steak from Mic Mac with an ice cold beer.The breakfast is fantastic as well! You get a good size steak (6oz) and on top of that, more food than you can possibly need to eat in the morning (it can include the normal eggs [cooked anyway], hashbrowns, sausage and/or bacon). The hash browns are delictable and a spicy ceasar always tastes delicious with it.I suggest this restraurant to everyone i know! Some people have come back to say the steak is tooo salty, however in my mind, thats just a sign of a well aged steak :)Enjoy!!!

Unfortunately due to healthy eating issues, I couldn't order the famous peanut butter burger but the salad I had was yummy. Nice size and good price. The milkshakes my friends ordered were large enough to share. You can get 2 glasses per shake. The restaurant was smaller than I thought it was. It's like an older style retro diner- I think that's an appropriate description?I did get to have a bite of the burger and I can't stop thinking about it! The 'Darrell's Fries' were also delish. I'll be back soon for sure to try out ol' faithful peanut butter burger.
<review# 1074,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2011,9/28/2011,65,55,,3,5>Delicious! Definitely my favorite sushi spot in the city.I've been to fujiyama quite a bit and am never disappointed. The atmopshere is quite charming with the various sections and litle nooks. I was lucky enough to get a private nook one evening and it provided my date and I with the the perfect private dining experience.My all time favorites are the spicy tuna and scallop (can't choose which I like best) and the hawaii roll. I find the prices very fair for the quality of food you receive. Although the service we experienced the other night was not 100% up to par, once the food hit the table, the wait was worth it.They also have amazing lunch specials - $8.99 for two maki rolls and your choice of either salad or miso soup. I highly recommend this spot!

I always leave in a much better mood.The Armview is my #1 spot for breakfast. I love Breakfast; I love Breakfast anytime of the day. It is my fave meal of the day. I love Breakfast. (another one of those "b" words that deserves a capital)That being said, The Armview has something special going on. It reminds me of an old time diner with spectacular grub and fantastic service. I throughly enjoy the many options for eggs benny( smoked salmon, roasted asparagus, ham, or bacon) which is my fave breakfast meal.The Brunch menu is perfect for the bf and me, since he does not get as excited as I do over breakfast.Their lunch and dinner menu has some great options as well. I LOVE LOVE the avacado wrap. Yum yum. Service is A-1, and prices are very good. I have yet to have a bad experience and I have absolutely nothing to complain about.
<review# 1076,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/7/2011,9/26/2011,33,173,2,3,2>The first time we tried Coles, the little restaurant was so busy that we never even had a chance to get a table. The hype around the new place seems to have cooled down, because just two weeks later the place was only half full at dinner time on a Thursday. The spot is in the same place where several other little restaurants have failed, most recently India Palace. Hopefully Coles will have enough staying power to stick around, because it's a decent spot.The menu contains your typical appies, with nachos, potato skins, and other pub staples.  Their burgers are their specialty, as they have a whole page devoted to regular, spicy, and other twists on the sandwich.  Each patty is homemade and made to order. The Pittsburger is the only stuffed burger, with cheddar. The gooey center is very hot and messy, so be careful, but the waitress is nice enough to alert you of this. My companion had the Roadhouse burger, topped with onion rings and BBQ sauce. He enjoyed it as much as he enjoyed saying "Roadhouse." The fries, both sweet potato and regular, are home cut and fried to golden perfection. If burgers, (beef, chicken, or fish) are not your thing, there are a few other options, like club houses, chicken wraps, salads, and a few seafood options.The place is nicely decorated, if simple. A few banquettes line the back area, and the main dining area have simple wooden tables small and large enough to seat any party size. A few TVs are placed on the wall but seem unnecessary and out of place. A small bar is also available at the front.The staff are friendly. Our waitress was nice, and seemed knowledgeable enough of the menu to offer recommendations.Parking is limited, so come early. But if you're in a rush, you can order take out. The only downside is that they don't have a a website with an online menu, so unless you're familiar with the place or have been there before and have a copy of their menu, you'll have to walk in to place your order.

<review# 1078,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/11/2011,9/23/2011,2,8,,2,2>One of my favourite places to eat downtown. I've probably had half a dozen of the pulled pork po-boy's by now. Their chicken breasts are also very good (very moist) and the half rack of ribs is huge and tasty. Don't forget the lemonade, they hand press each glass when ordered, and it's always delicious.I've never been somewhere with such friendly people at the counter, and counter service makes it a great place to grab a fast, casual bite to eat. They've always been very fast, and bring the food out to you.They also have some interesting group items (require 48 hour notice) such as whole pig, whole turkey, saddle of beef, and a few others (goat and lamb options). While expensive, they also include a number of sides, 16 for the whole pig, 12 for the turkey, so if you split it up and get a good group of people it's not too bad. Some friends and I are definitely considering trying this out.Edit: So I finally tried the pig with a group of friends. There was 17 of us, they brought out the pig, sat it on the table, and let us take pictures for a bit, then they took the pig back and started bringing out sides while they cut up the pig. Shortly after that plate after plate of pork kept coming out of the kitchen. The pork was very tender, very tasty. They also gave us three different bowls of BBQ sauces. And when I say sides, I mean they actually brought out two big plates of every side they offer (and they offer a lot), there was mac n cheese, baked beans, fries, corn on the cob, corn bread, and some more I can't remember. It was a feast. After we were all stuffed, they brought out a bunch of doggy bags and stuff them full of whatever we couldn't finish.
<review# 1079,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/12/2011,9/22/2011,2,7,4,5,4>This tiny restaurant has been in Bedford for quite some time now, and it is flat-out the best Chinese food I've ever had. The mushu pork is what takeout dreams are made of, the spring rolls are crisp- never soggy, and the house rice is deliciously spicy and textured with many ingredients. The dish prices are great for ordering for a large group, but I recommend getting two combos with your friend/date so you can try tons of dishes. The only downside is Szechaun is SLOW. Often there is one server manning cash and the dining room, so during busy takeout hours it takes a long time to be served. I have often waited 10-20 extra minutes for my takeout, but honestly it is worth it.
<review# 1080,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/16/2011,9/21/2011,7,53,,3,2>We started out with 1/2 dozen of the variety oysters and the Henry Platter.  We both lover our appetizers and I have to say the oysters were the best I've had in some time.  I found my husband's platter a bit on the skimpy side but overall it was very good.The main course - my husband had the daily chef offering for fish which was crab coated snapper.  He said it was very good but again my main complaint is small portions and I mean small.I ordered the rack of lamb and it was divine BUT it was 3 wee medallions with likewise 3 ribs (no meat).  The veggies were 1 bean, 1 carrot, ...need I say more.  I'm seriously not a big eater and having had the oysters which are not filling I was looking forward to a real meal....simply delicious but so small.  The saving grace was the potato mix - a decent size formed in a nice round and very tasty (alas I am allergic to potatoes :)) The service was spectacular and the tip was in proportion - very attentive and helpful without dotting.The wine list is extensive and we found no problem picking one that suited our meal.  My overall impression unfortunately has been dampened by the portion size.  I feel so badly since most time I send food back the meal  unfinished or take it home because I've had enough, but for this I was lacking and wanting a treat on the way home.  Total ~$300 for two with tip.

I was so pleased with the service and selection that I actually walked out with a pair of dress sandals, a pair of beautiful heels and a pair of amazing boots! Getting lots of compliments...

<review# 1082,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2011,9/19/2011,76,115,2,3,3>I absolutely love Greek food so I often will choose a Greek-style restaurant when I go out to eat. With an old family friend in town, my mom and I wanted to take her somewhere with a great atmosphere, reasonable prices, good wine/drinks and food in the downtown area so we decided to go with Ela.I ate here a few times back when it was 'Opa' and wondered if the new name would also mean changes inside, but I was happy to see everything was still the same! I love the sitting area in the back - it is so bright and sunny and is decorated in such a way that you feel like you are sitting on a vine-covered patio outdoors in Greece. We each started with a glass of sangria (white for me and mum, red for the friend) and it was delicious. Very fresh with lots of yummy looking fruit. Our calamari appetizer was also tasty, and they start you with bread and a delicious olive oil/garlic combo for dipping that I really enjoyed. I ordered the LOUKANIKO PENNE (crumbled in house sausage, sautéed in garlic and chili flakes, spinach and feta in an orange, olive oil sauce) and it was really tasty. My only complaints would be that there was a lot of oil - the sauce was mostly oil actually (there was a shallow layer of it in the bottom of the bowl when I finished) which for me was too much. It was still tasty, just a bit greasy for my liking. The sausage was delish though - lots of herbs/spices, but not too hot. One other small complaint I would have to make is that there were a lot of flies buzzing around our table, especially once the food came. I would say there were 5, and they got to be quite intrusive. One even fell into our friend's spaghetti and unfortunately she lost her appetite after that. I have no idea where they were coming from, but I think they need to invest in a couple of fly traps around the large windows. That being said, the waiter was very sympathetic - they brought our friend a whole new dish, and didn't charge us for our dessert as an apology for the fly situation. I thought that was a great gesture. (btw, the feta cheesecake? TO DIE FOR). Our server was great in general, very friendly and prompt. He also recommended the stuffed chicken to my mother when she could not decide what to order and I think we now agree it is the best dish on the menu. I will probably order that next time, or stick to a more authentic Greek entree with a more liberal dose of olive oil!

Tonight (August 23, 2011) I found myself heading to my Aunt's apartment as we were delivered some unfortunate family news. After hashing it out for a little while, we decided to venture downtown for some eats. We found ourselves outside the doors of Pretty Things at 6:50 and wandered in to browse for the last 10 minutes before the place closed. When I entered, I apologized for coming in so close to closing time, but the staff member (Stephanie) brightly told us to not worry. We started looking, and loved everything. I especially loved that they had sizing for all. Being a curvier lady - I was very excited. I told Stephanie that I was in love with one of the dresses, and she told me to try it on - despite them closing in 5 minutes. I declined, but then realized that I could not resist at least (quickly) seeing what the dress looked liked on me. I stepped out the change room, where Stephanie was there to offer her advise. She let me look, and even showed me a few more options to try on. She also did the same for my Aunt, who was browsing the dresses. Around 7:30 (half an hour after closing) I walked out with the perfect dress for an upcoming wedding. Stephanie, to me, has been one of the best customer service people I have met. She did not give us grief for showing up 10 minutes before closing and encouraged us to look around and take our  time. With this customer service, and great products - you cannot go wrong at Pretty Things.
<review# 1084,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/4/2011,9/17/2011,15,60,4,4,3>So PR school work term has taken me to the outlands of Burnside, where Boyfriend works, so we've decided to try the local lunch fare. Kababji was one of our top contenders, so we headed in with some high hopes. I was definitely not disappointed. Arrived at promptly 12 p.m. (Boyfriend and I are very punctual), place was busy, but not overly full. Lots of places to sit, though with only one cook (who also helped serve occasionally) and one server, I thought they were understaffed. If it had gotten any busier, poor woman would've been swamped. As it was, she was busy and never lingered at the table, but was friendly and helpful. I got the falafel pita and Boyfriend ordered the chicken shwarma pita with soup. I thought just having a pita might not be enough food and damn, I was so very wrong. These pitas are gigantic. This thing was the size of my forearm! Crazy town. I can't imagine how many little falafels they crammed into it. And by itself, only $5.99 and I challenge anyone to want any more food afterwards. Amazeballs. Chicken schwarma pita was equally huge and delicious, though very very messy. Be prepared for drippies. The lentil soup was the only thing I didn't totally love, but that may have been because I was crammed with falafel. It was very different, seemed lemony? to me. Good, but not great like the pitas. The platters are on our list to try and from my food eavesdropping, looked very good. If you work in Burnside or are in the area, check this place out!PS - Update from Boyfriend, who went back to Kababji with friend (frankly, I am incensed that a pita wasn't hand delivered to my tiny cubicle yesterday), and he raved about the kafka pita too. Less greasy than the schwarma (Boyfriend is often weirdly health conscious) and the word is the hummus is to die for. I needs me some hummus.
<review# 1085,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2011,9/16/2011,42,100,,5,4>The Drawing Room has become almost a regular piece of conversation and an assumed destination for me lately, thanks to the discovery of this secret bar on Yelp a month ago.Not yet is known about the upstairs-from-the-Henry-House bar yet other than it's wonderful decor and fancy drink menu. This isn't a beer-drinking spot, folks. This is where you go to feel important, share some drinks with a few friends and enjoy a couple hours of elegancy without feeling out of place. The Drawing Room has a timeless feel to it. You could be having a flashback to any period over the last hundred years and know that no matter what year you're in, you're enjoying it like royalty.The drink menu offers martinis, wines, and drinks of all sorts. I ordered a Burie'd Mojito, which was white rum, an assortment of berry juices and mint leaves. It was fantastic! My second drink was a vodka-based green lime drink that was just as delicious. Mind you, the drinks are $10+ so unless your wallet is loaded, don't come here to join it. Of course, the Drawing Room isn't the type of environment to get drunk but the drinks are made strong so be wary of your perception because you may be surprised once you stand up.
<review# 1086,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/28/2011,9/15/2011,47,445,,1,2>This is a good place to stop by for brunch and the patio is a good spot to check out the people walking by. The seafood chowder is among the best I have had (chunks of salmon, 2 yummy mussels and the right amount of creaminess and thickness). The mimosas ($4 or $5) were a bit weak but good, however the bloody mary was too spicy and watery. I tried the Captain's Brunch - salmon, potatoes with a hollaindaise sauce, and cucumbers and tomatoes with a vinagrette. The brunch was priced reasonably ($13) and was quite satisfying. My husband tried the pan fried haddock with rice and vegetables and he was a fan.
<review# 1087,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2011,9/14/2011,3,5,3,6,2>When I got engaged a few months ago I started researching bridal stores in HRM and naturally gravitated towards YELP to see what other bride-to-be's thought about their experience.To say I wasn't expecting much in terms of service when I went is an understatement but I have nothing but praise for the store and wonderful staff working on this beautiful Saturday morning.I arrived with my eldest sister (who is also my unofficial stylist and all around super shopper extraordinaire) and was greeted immediately by a very friendly sales lady who asked if I had been there before. I said "no" and she explained the Winchester system.1. Fill out a card with all of your details2. Tour the dresses with four coloured rings and tag the dresses you want to try on3. Let your consultant know you are ready4. After trying on some gowns the consultant will pull a few based on your budget that she thinks you will look divine in.So, my sister and I went off on our hunting adventure. I browsed through some of the sale gowns but since my wedding is a year away, I decided not to waste one of my four pics on a sale (aka-take as is) gown.Now we had been shopping at a different bridal store the previous day (see my review of Felicity Bridal for that experience - also a good one) and knew that the chiffon gowns were very flattering on me so with laser like precision we were off searching for chiffon!We flagged two gowns upstairs and two down and then let our consultant know we were ready to roll!The very first dress I tried on was THE ONE! It flattered me in every which way and was about half of the price I had budgeted for, so SCORE!!!!I did try on the other three gowns to be sure and another picked by our consultant but they did not come close to the perfection of the first one!I have read a lot of reviews saying that Winchester's gowns are all over the top, expensive and the service stuffy and unfriendly but that was not my experience at all.I had a great day, met a few wonderful consultants and found my dream dress (simple, romantic and uber flattering) at half the price I was prepared to shell out!WIN
<review# 1088,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2011,9/13/2011,1,10,,3,2>We got onto Java Blend coffee due to their close location to our home. Love this place!  Lots of coffee selection, with well made coffee, and a fantastic alternative to chains. We also got onto their take home beans due to them posting a group buy. Their barristas were very knowledgable abou the various coffees and grinding to suit our needs. I also love walking by when they are roasting. Makes me drool to smell the coffee in the air!Do not park in the Robin's mini plaza parking lot beside it. A friend got 'booted' because of this but it was completely reasonable. There are signs that indicate parking is for customers only.
<review# 1089,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/29/2011,9/12/2011,3,14,2,4,2>So this was a surprise. I don't normally expect much from hotel lobby restaurants, other than inflated tourist prices and mediocre brunch buffets. Boy, was I in for a treat! An impromptu lunch at the Harbour City Bar and Grill (with the purpose of sampling the quality of food for an upcoming corporate event we booked at the Delta Halifax) turned out to be one of the best freaking lunches ever...at least, in a very long time. I thought perhaps it was just the high I was on from spotting Pierce Brosnan mere moments before (who knew he was filming here?...not me!). But no, it was definitely the food. De-frigging-licious. I started off with the soup du jour - a delightful corn chowder with fresh leeks and bacon. I'm talking REAL bacon. Can you say, "Yum!" And for my main I chose their gourmet pizza. Many people claim to serve "gourmet pizza" but it almost always turns out to be Bo-o-o-RING. Not this. The homemade herbed foccacia crust was done to perfection. Fluffy, yummy goodness. Toppings were simple but perfect: fresh, and I mean fresh, pesto (apparently the basil was picked from their rooftop garden that very morning), sweet tomatoes, bocconcini and a balsamic drizzle. I've been fantasizing about this pizza for a week now. I was actually able to meet Chef Les Stevens to compliment him in person. I'm pretty sure he thought I was crazy, but I couldn't help it. Good food makes me happy. The atmosphere wasn't bad either. Newly renovated this year, it has an airy urban feel and despite the dark wood, appears surprisingly bright. If you're looking for a place for a nice lunch date or business lunch, I'd certainly recommend the Harbour City. And order that pizza...I mean it.
<review# 1090,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/21/2011,9/11/2011,33,8,2,3,4>Bishop's Cellar is a little slice of heaven, hidden down on the waterfront in the Bishop's Landing Piazza. Considering a significant percentage of our population is University students, most people think to hit up the NSLC for all of their weekend alcohol supply.However, those who know and love Bishop's Cellar, will walk the extra 5-10 minutes from the Spring Garden area to pick up a bottle of sunshine for those relaxing evenings at home.The reason why Bishop's Cellar is the best spot when you're searching out the best bottle of wine for your weekend? Because the staff are knowledgeable, friendly and have a recommendation to go along with whatever you may have planned. Are you hosting a wine and cheese party? No? Maybe you are like me, and you're hosting a dessert-lovers party - what wine best complements the dessert you made? The employees at Bishop's Cellar will help narrow it down for you.So, really, what is it about Bishop's Cellar that keeps me coming back time and time again? The atmosphere, the positive energy and the fact that they are open later than any other establishment in the city! Love, love, love.

I forget what night of the week it was, but it was pretty busy.  I don't think there was an empty seat in the place.  After studying the menu we each decided on the same thing: turkey avocado burger (which I don't think is on the menu anymore...I see they have a chicken avocado though), and two glasses of the raspberry wheat beer.   The beer was delicious and the burgers were fantastic!   Our server was great, and cute too!  A great experience at Rock Bottom.  Will definitely go back!

One thing I wish they did though was post which instructor was teaching which class. While the majority of the instructors here are amazing, everybody has a different personality and some people jive better than others.Overall though, a great place to sweat it out!
<review# 1095,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2011,9/6/2011,39,130,2,5,2>There are quite a few things to love about Bistro Le Coq. Let's get right in to it, shall we? 1. It was comfortably busy, but not super crowded.2. The servers' uniforms are so cute. Also, the servers were very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and all appear to actually speak French. 3. Mon dieu, they did a great job decorating this place! It genuinely feels like a bistro you might find in Paris. Great ambience.4. Price points were very reasonable. While my budget is not able to accommodate trips to Paris as often as I would like (so... never), this Argyle Street establishment is an acceptable substitution that even a penny-pincher like myself can afford every now and then. 5. Food was delicious. I would never in a million years ask to see the nutritional value of what we ate, lest our hearts stop immediately in shock (or perhaps on account of the clogged arteries), but fresh baguettes, truffle aioli, duck-fat fries, Quiche Lorraine... c'est vraiment magnifique!
<review# 1096,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/29/2011,9/5/2011,26,94,2,3,1>I've been running by Two If By Sea for a couple of years now on Saturday morning long runs and have meant to try it, but hadn't until today. I've heard a lot about it and almost all extremely positive, so I was looking forward to it.I ordered a Chai latte, a chocolate croissant, and a scone to take home. Let's get the not so good out of the way: I didn't prefer my Chai. It lacked spiciness and while I can appreciate a mellow Chai, for me this was far too mellow.Holy colossal croissant! I think it was the size of my forearm! The chocolate inside was very good and overall I enjoyed the croissant. While not a French pastry expert, I'd imagine the croissants here to be a bit doughier than a traditional croissant, yet very good!Sadly, the scone was forgotten; but, I look forward to trying the scone on my next time here.

If I wasn't thoroughly addicted to Ezekiel bread at home, this would be my absolute bread of choice. That's Reason #1 why I love their Tofu Sandwich so much.Reason #2 is the positively magical, mysterious and unmockable mixture of tasty tofu that is so generously slathered throughout the center of this babe of a sammy. Even the mayo is vegan on this puppy. Goooooodness gracious, I could never decline the opportunity to chow on this should I find myself in the Gottingen street area.The coffee is great (self serve!) with random and charming mugs. The ladies and gents of the GFE are quirky and also of the charming variety. Oh, if you love the cheese and the avocado do yourself a sweet little favor and GET THE GHETTOSOCKS. My girlfriend loves the crap out of that thing. It also has the fiiiiiiiiiiinest bread in all the HFX land. Toasted. Don't forget to check out the local art! Always impressive.Oh, and the peanut butter crisp rice chocolate chip ball is a crunchy little vegan treasure one must experience.Until we meet again, GFE!
<review# 1098,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/11/2011,9/3/2011,74,22,,9,7>Penelope's Boutique has set up shop in the former home of Pretty Things Boutique on Cunard Street. It's a sweet little space crammed to the rafters with vintage clothes, jewelery, and accessories. On my first visit I had a great chat with the store owner (Penny herself) who talked about the selection process (nary a Suzy Shier item to be found) and the devoted clients who bring her some of the best used clothing in the city. I found two amazing dresses right off the bat and spotted a few shoes that had me wishing my size tens could squeeze into a nine (Michael Kors, anyone?).Penny is such a sweet lady and provides an amazing customer experience. She offers food and drink if you just want to come in and read a magazine. She also attaches discounts to your receipt--I'll get three dollars off my next purchase, and then the next time I buy something a few dollars will be added to that. Great incentive! I'll definitely be back.

Delivery took about 35 minutes at peak hours and I live out in Fairview so it's impressive they even came out here. Now on to the good stuff! The food and prices!I rarely eat potatoes. We just don't get along. I make two exceptions: Christmas dinner and Greek places cause good liftin' they're good. The salads were fantastic, the rice delightful and the Soulvakis (lamb and chicken) were divine. My days in Halifax are numbered but this is deffo a place I'll be bringing friends to before I leave. Excellent on every level.
<review# 1100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/28/2011,9/1/2011,43,449,,7,4>Since moving into the neighbourhood, I've become a huge fan of the Cosy. Yes, it's old, the seats are cracked and the coffee isn't great. But, it's got just what I'm looking for on a weekend morning - eggs, sausage, and a huge plate of home fries, all for under $7. I like that the staff get to know their customers. I like that there isn't much in the way of decor. I like the family staff who chit chat with everyone who comes in. At the Cosy, the vibe is always warm, friendly, and because I'm not looking for gourmet, this greasy spoon is my favourite place to be for breakfast!
<review# 1101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2011,8/31/2011,29,249,,3,3>I tried the Bicycle thief for my dad's birthday. Overall the experience was great, a welcome addition to Halifax's restaurant scene. The atmosphere is great , we went on a Friday night and the place was packed. The good - The drink menu is creative, and the wine list has a good selection of options. I had the Bellini which was lovely. The bread plate was delicious, with a roasted red pepper hummus which made a nice change from butter. For my appetizer, I had the Frito Misto, which was fab, all items were perfectly fried. One of my dining companions had the polenta, with sausage and mushrooms, I tried the mushroom side (I don't eat red meat) and it was amazing, I would ask if they would do just a mushroom polenta for me next time I go. The menu is very meat heavy, but there were some lighter options, I had the hallibut, with a Italian sweet and sour sauce and capers, which hit the spot. The Frites are yummy as well. My espresso at the end of the meal was perfect. The service from out waitress was great. Minor quibbles - the noise level, the place was packed which was great to see, so it's realistic for the noise level to be above average, but you could still hear the music over the noise, which made it hard to talk with my dinner companions, we had to yell. It would be nice if the turned the music down on the really busy nights. Also our table was a little on the small side which made for a juggling act, with cocktails, wine, water, bread plates and our regular plates.  Finally the dessert cart, while I love the idea of it, I personally prefer a plated dessert and geneally like a warm or cold dessert option.  Wile all of the desserts I sampled tasted good, the presentation left a bit to be desired. Over all, my experience was overwhelmingly postive, and I can't wait to go and sample the bar menu.

Lots and lots of nifty little gadgets, geegaws and knick-knacks, but even more lovely, lovely furniture from EQ3 and similar designers. Four floors to explore means you should leave yourself a little time - though if you're child-free you can skim the third floor pretty quickly. (Though it's a good place to shop for friends who're having babies, if you're so inclined.)Walk up, enjoying the art posted along the stairwell, and zip back down in the elevator when you've seen what there is to see.
<review# 1103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2011,8/29/2011,51,65,5,7,3>I was going to give Thumpers Salon a four star review. I've never left the place feeling unhappy about my hair. I have, however, left Thumpers feeling like I had just punched my bank account in the face. Yes, it is likely one of the most expensive hair salons in the city. All that was put into perspective recently, when I had dinner with a friend in New York City. I mentioned that I had to pay $40 ($40!) for my haircut and then another chunk of change for the truly wonderful Sumo Tech product that smells like crack and berries. Her response: "Honey, that price is less than what I *tip* at my hair salon." Consider me humbled. Going into most hair salons, I'm not all that fussy. I usually book with whatever stylist is available and tell them that they can do whatever they think will look good. Unfortunately, I'm more picky when I leave the salon and often wonder why I gave such a reckless person free reign on my precious scalp. Not so, at Thumpers!These people truly know what they're doing and you get to feel like a very rich person while they're doing it. (Just keep in mind that you will be *slightly* less rich when they're done.) The place has a great atmosphere and I like that it's in a less-busy part of downtown. Though, given its location, parking could be a challenge. You do need an appointment, as this place is too popular for walk-ins. For those of us who are petrified of talking on the phone and prefer our conversations to have more emoticons than voice inflections, they do have an online booking system. Otherwise, just give them a ring and see when they can fit you in.Personally, I'm looking forward to my next haircut! (Those who are forced to look at me on any kind of regular basis are likely looking forward to it, too.)
<review# 1104,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/4/2011,8/28/2011,66,321,3,7,4>This was an intriguing prospect: I'm a vegetarian. Boneheads is all about the meat. So how did this situation come to be? A friend's birthday party. Otherwise, I probably never would've come. But I did. So let's get right to the heart of the matter: FoodWhat did I eat?Well, they actually have quite a few vegetarian items (but no vegan options from what I could tell) but they're pretty much all sides. I opted to get the Mac Daddy & Cheese, minus the sausage. It's basically mac'n'cheese but with breadcrumbs and some tomato and greens thrown on top. It was very filling. It's a small plate and I didn't finish it. I would've liked it to be a tad cheesier but it was good. Cornbread on the side was okay but a bit dry.My meat-eating friends? They almost all got plates. Which should really be labelled platters. Huge amounts of EVERYTHING. There were many "I can't possibly finish all of this" followed up by "No, really, I don't know where I'll put it" followed by "Wow, that was really  good, I wish I had more."If I were to go back again, I'd definitely opt for the side of mac-n-cheese and the sweet potato fries. I sampled some of those fries from my friends' plates and they were fantastic! They also had a dip some of my friends raved about but I didn't care for it.ServiceStaff were very friendly, especially given that for a while, four of us were holding a table for eight without ordering. When I asked what was in the Mac Daddy & Cheese, they were quick to offer to make one without sausage which I really appreciated. Whoever runs their Twitter account gets a special shout-out. I had tweeted my concerns earlier in the day and they had replied with a list of their vegetarian options. Well done.AmbianceThis is a small space, I would not encourage this as a venue for large groups. It's a "seat yourself, order at the counter" kinda joint and that really works for them. I would strongly encourage you to secure a table (if you can) before ordering. They go fast! Despite the relatively small space, it is surprisingly quiet. Maybe it's how few people can eat there at one time but I didn't find it to be overly loud.For a nice day, there are also picnic tables outside.My only complaint? I get that this is all about "fast meat" but the disposable everything (plates, utensils) and Styrofoam to-go containers leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

I'm much more content to hit up a cute, well-decorated spot for cocktails. I also love cake. So you can see why The Middle Spoon is basically heaven for me. The dessert menu is diverse and exciting - there are so many things that I want to go back and try. I settled on the brownie pie (brownies AND pie, two of my favorite things in life, you guys!) and it was absolutely divine. I didn't indulge in a drink, but the cocktail menu looked fun. The prices are a teensy bit high, but the portions are generous. I'd recommend either sharing with a friend or - get ready, this is crazy - having dessert as your meal. OK, not so crazy. We all do it. Right? Right.

Their pizza is also delicious, although the crust is a tiny bit too thin for my taste. But that's just me.As far as independent places go, Alexandra's always seems physically clean, and the pizza is not of the cardboard-flavoured variety found at most local joints. I can tell that this stuff is made with love instead of copious amounts of grease. How can I tell? It's a feeling that I've ingested something that will provide my body with nutrition of some kind, and there's a tasty freshness to it. And to top it all off, the staff are always friendly.

This is one of my favourite meals ever, ever, ever, and it's ready in probably 10 minutes and is as easy to prepare as Kraft Dinner. It's worth the drive to Bedford and the Sunnyside Mall parking lot dramaz just for that gnocchi. Their produce section is always wonderful, and the staff are very knowledgeable and friendly. My favourite place to buy groceries in HRM!
<review# 1109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/24/2011,8/23/2011,24,40,4,3,3>This past weekend I attended a brunch at Jane's On The Common, another restaurant I have been dying to eat at every time the bus passes it by. I had I high hopes and expectations starting with, that this would be my first out on the town brunch in many years.While drinking a well priced mimosa, I made my decision to dine on the char-broiled pork burger. The burger arrived with delicious caramelized apple slices, horseradish aioli, and what I really ordered the burger for, dragon's breath blue cheese. It sadly turned out that, although tasty, the burger was on the dry side. A friend had ordered a random dessert, which turned out to be the passionfruit panna cotta. Asking for a taste, I dipped my fork into pure heaven and easily the most delicious dessert of my life.I highly recommend Jane's for brunch, though I am sure it is just as wonderful for a later meal.However, I will give you few sage words of advice. Number 1: the glass plate near the exit, is not the door, the door is a curtain. Number 2: do not throw the curtain on your way out as you may smack someone in the face.Words to the wise....

It's divided into Asian/North American grocery sections so you can peruse for some interesting Asian groceries or just swing by for a can of tomato paste or an avocado as your needs dictate. My two fave staples from this place are the insanely huge packs of inari (fried tofu) shells for $2.49 (not organic, but I'll make an exception for this mad deal); and bags of yam noodles in water (no calories, have an interesting texture which make an awesome addition to many dishes. Try that shit. Pasta forever!) M Mart also carries stone bowls to make Dolsot Bibimbap and whatever else one could cook in stone bowls.Most of the staff are knowledgable and friendly. One of the owners once gave me a free perfectly ripe avocado!  I've even seen Japanese cooking classes being offered through the store which hopefully they plan to host again. There's also a cat that sometimes hangs out in the store which may not be sanitary, but it is cute.If you like Asian cooking or grocery stores close to Gottingen Street, the M Mart might be just what you've been looking for. If you plan to make this store a frequent stop, make sure to ask for a membership discount card which I believe entitles you to a 10% discount. You really can't turn down a deal like that.

<review# 1112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2011,8/20/2011,65,111,7,11,4>Okay so I finally made it to Trendz for brunch. Before I begin my review I will slightly humiliate myself with the following anecdote. I love eggs benny. Like unhealthy lust. But I also like variety. So I tend to struggle between ordering eggs benny or going with pancakes/french toast/waffles etc (clearly I also love my carbs). And I heart bacon. So as I opened the extensive brunch menu, I happened to lament to my friend that I would never end up with the perfect breakfast. If I get pancakes/french toast/waffles, I usually order a side of bacon to go with it. But if I get eggs benny, I can't very well order a side of bacon (well, technically I could but I'm not that far gone... yet). So it basically comes down to bacon or eggs benny. It's like Sophie's Freaking Choice over here. There's also the issue of home fries. As I perused the menu, my heart skipped a beat (probably due to impending heart failure). Trendz offers a proscuitto version of eggs benny that comes with home fries, fresh fruit, toast, and (wait for it) your choice of bacon, ham or sausage. WHAT? That is a seriously crazy amount of food, but OH MY GAWD! Oh, and did I mention it also comes with coffee (as do all of their "Off the Griddle" and "Egg Dishes" menu items). It's pricey at $13.25, but considering everything you get it's actually not a bad deal.But let me go back to the beginning and start a proper review of the overall experience. We walked in to a completely empty dining room. No diners, no hostess, nothing. We waited a couple minutes, and I stuck my head out a bit so I could see if anyone was at the bar in the lounge section past the dining room. The bartender was indeed there, but not looking in our direction. But a moment later, our hostess/server came out to greet us. We chose to sit in the lounge area, and nope - not a single soul dining there either. Though a few people showed up after we sat down. It's really a shame to have such a gorgeous spot in Dartmouth, and no one seems to know about it. Our server took our coffee and tea order, and left us with menus. We eagerly opened them to find we both had wine lists. It's like the universe was telling us we deserved a liquid brunch! No biggie - just added some humour to the experience. Our server was back in a flash with our beverages, and swapped our wine lists for breakfast menus.So, as you can guess, I ordered the prosciutto eggs benny. Our server gave it the thumbs up and mentioned that they make their own hollandaise sauce. My friend had a bit of a hiccup with his order due to a refusal on a substitution. I won't change my rating based on that, nor will I go into it further because he'll be reviewing himself at some point. But it was disappointing. I've said this in other reviews, but I'll say it again. When I go out to brunch, I am in no hurry. I like to have lots of time to gab with my friends and relax. I found the timing perfect here. The only instance timing came up was while waiting for my first coffee refill. At one point I pronounced to my friend that our server had 2 minutes to bring me a refill, lest my Trendz review lose half a star. It's entirely possible she heard me (not my intent!) as she showed up moments later with the coffee. Refill offers were frequent from that point on.And now... the eggs benny. It was sooooooo good. In fact, I was so excited I dug into it before taking a photo. The homemade hollandaise was excellent, the eggs were perfectly poached, and the prosciutto added a lovely flavour to the mix. Texture-wise, prosciutto can be a little more difficult to cut with a fork and knife, so it was a bit of a workout at times, but so worth it. The fresh fruit was delightful, the bacon was delicious, and the home fries were just right. I only had a half slice of toast, because seriously - so much food! But my friend had some sugar moon maple syrup left over from his pancakes, so I drizzled some on my toast and it was heaven.Service was attentive (coffee incident aside) and very friendly. As we paid our bills we chatted a bit with our server, and she remembered me from the Burnside lunch crowd, despite the fact I haven't been there in over 6 months and only went for lunch 2 or 3 times. We also discussed how unfortunate it is that so few people know about this Dartmouth gem. She commented jokingly that it's a great place to take someone if you don't want to run into anyone you know. Fair point!If Yelp had 1/2 star ratings, I'd probably do 4.5 due to some minor issues, but it's definitely closer to a 5 than a 4 for me overall.Please folks - check this place out (and be sure to read my initial review for more info on lunch/dinner). I hope Trendz sticks around for a long time.
<review# 1113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2011,8/19/2011,55,223,,8,3>So this review is 4 years late, but hey, better late then never as the saying goes.These folks were our saviour at our wedding.  Our flower provider (a family member who was growing them at home) had a mishap with their garden and left us 1 week before the wedding in August with no flowers.  Try getting a florist in August with 1 weeks notice.  They came through for us, and we will always be grateful.The staff were professional, easy to talk to and they were very reasonably prices when they could have pretty much charged what they wanted in our case.
<review# 1114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2011,8/18/2011,5,11,1,12,5>After two years in Korea I feel pretty confident calling JJ Mart the most authentic Korean store in Halifax. It has the look, the feel, the kind and adorable family, and most importantly THE KIMCHI.There are a few places in Halifax to buy kimchi. I've tried three of these places and while I won't point fingers, the boring and the MYSTIFYINGLY HORRIBLE kimchi I found elsewhere only made the sweet familiar perfection of JJ Mart's kimchi more satisfying. I've eaten A LOT of kimchi. It's delicious, and it's incredibly healthy. JJ mart sells some of the best kimchi I've ever had, anywhere. It deserves 5 stars just for that.
<review# 1115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2011,8/17/2011,15,9,4,5,3>If you live in the Clayton Park area, you've GOT to order from Pizzadelic, stat! This new addition to our hood is conveniently located, open late (like, skip pizza corner and get your cabbie to make a pit stop here instead kinda late), and owns that sweet spot between dirty pizza (e.g. Jesse's Pizza) and the gourmet, wood-oven type stuff (e.g. Morris East). The Ultimate Pepperoni and BBQ Chicken are my personal faves so far, although cheese lovers will pretty much think they've died and gone to heaven when they sink their teeth into the 4-Cheese Medley.This place is reasonably priced (again, rocking that middle ground), the people who work there are actually polite, delivery is speedy, AND they have debit at the door. I'm becoming a HUGE fan of this place and can't wait to try more of their goodies. So far, the burger and poutine are also delicious - for greasy, oh-so-bad-for-you-food, that is - and the Nacho Supreme on their menu has been calling my name for weeks, literally. It's only a matter of time before I order that bad boy up and probably polish off the whole thing myself. 'Nuff said, yes?P.S. Pizzadelic also has locations in Lower Sackville, Mount Uniacke, Burnside, and Fall River.
<review# 1116,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/9/2011,8/16/2011,38,87,5,4,3>If you were to take all of my favourite things - letterpress, ampersands, stationery, tote bags, pugs, kittens, cupcakes and well-designed things - and shove them all into one space, you'd come up with Inkwell.  I stopped  in while they were still cash and visa only, so I haven't purchased anything yet (making my husband happy), but I instantly fell in love with the store and everything in it. The store is all white and turquoisey blue and pretty and full of pretty letterpress and other stationery goodies. I could do some serious damage in this store. In fact, I fully intend to do some serious damage and have new letterpress art for my apartment. They also carry Uppercase magazine - which I love big time. This store may be my kryptonite. p.s. the pugs, kittens and cupcakes are illustrations. You can't actually buy pets or baked goods there.
<review# 1117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/20/2010,8/15/2011,12,57,1,4,2>I want to stress one thing here: Large portion size. A lot of people, including myself, often underestimate portion size, especially when they can eat a lot. Let me be clear here: The portion sizes at Roberts are HUGE. Full stop. The large donair fed me for 3 meals, and every time I was absolutely stuffed and ready to slip into a meat coma. My girlfriend's large donair will probably feed her every day for a week. If you get a chance, go on YouTube and look up the Robert's Belly Buster, it is truly an epic donair.Often when places have huge portion sizes, it's either really pricey or the quality is crap. Not so with Robert's: the price is VERY reasonable, and the quality is very, very good - the best so far in my limited donair experience. The large chunks of sliced beef are spicy, and it's not oversauced like so many other donairs.. there's just enough sweet donair sauce to compliment the savoury spiciness of the beef, onions, and tomatoes. I will definitely be ordering from Robert's again. Next time I think I'm going to order the large donair and ask for extra pitas so I can build my own.
<review# 1118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2011,8/14/2011,108,39,2,4,3>This hole in the wall diner in Dartmouth (I have no idea where I was in Dartmouth - I just know i was on the darkside) truly lived up to it's reputation.I had only heard about this place a few years ago, on a flight back to Halifax on Porter Airlines. In their in flight magazine they reviewed a few local haunts that were a must try while in Halifax - and this place was one of them.. I've been wanting to go ever since.Typical diner  menu, only heavily peppered with seafood options. Clams, halibut tips (YUM), scallops, fish & chips - plus some burger options.The line cooks are all working out in the open, and their 'kitchen' was spotless. A +++ for me. Uber friendly staff.. so far so good.My mate ordered the halibut tips. The portion was massive - so def a dish that could be shared between two people (if you're not hungry). The coleslaw is freshly made and good.  I had a burger w/ cheese (wasn't in the mood for fried fish) - which was diner-delicious.  I suspect this place is packed on weekends around lunch time so try and go during off-ish hours.So overall, if you're a fish lover - it appears this is the place to go. So long as you're ok with the deep or flash fried variety.
<review# 1119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2011,8/13/2011,56,312,,7,2>Went to Happy Sushi for lunch with a big gaggle of my coworkers yesterday, and we were pretty impressed.  Coming from Toronto, AYCE sushi is nothing new to me, but Happy Sushi had a selection of things available that was really quite good - more I think than I'd usually get at the place close to where I used to work.Overall, the fish was was fresh and tasty.  Chicken teriyaki was nice and peppery, and the beef while a little gristly was good too.  It's AYCE so I don't expect the top-notch of everything I might expect at a more conventional sushi bar.  We tried amongst us a very broad selection of their offerings and nothing was disappointing I don't think.Service was cheerful and when they forgot one of the things ordered for one of our guests, they offered to pack it to go for her.  Noteworthy.As some warn, and you might not realize if you're new to the AYCE sushi experience, don't get overboard with your order.  If you waste food they will charge you for it at the a la carte price.  Far better to fill out an order slip for what you want, you can always order more if you feel like afterward.
<review# 1120,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/15/2010,8/12/2011,123,426,8,8,3>I feel compelled to remove a Remedy Spa star based on my experiences here in the last 6 months. What with being a pretty big fan of this spa when it initially opened I was (evidently) one of the first people to end up on the spam list. I remember why I had initially forked over my contact details to RS and it was because they occasionally have open house events where you can try products and even receive free (micro session) services like paraffin treatments. Uhh, free spa services!? Show me the dotted line! Several months later I did however start to notice that I was receiving multiple promotional offers/month in my email as well as being sent junk mail in snail mail version! Haughtily, I informed RS that I wanted to receive no more junk and yet somehow still receive the occasional email... At least the paper waste has stopped... I guess? My second gripe with RS was over an encounter I had in late July. I even booked this 50% off wax session from Vancouver, weeks in advance... I was THAT pumped about being back to the land of reasonably priced lady services! Upon arriving, I had an extremely awkward conversation with my esthetician about what *type* of service I would be getting. Trying to cajole someone into ripping MORE hair from between your legs is, I assure you, uncomfortable even for an extrovert. Perhaps you have had this happen before? Where you have been inadvertently booked into a smaller time window than your desired service will take? The real crux in all of this was that whomever I had booked with had not asked which service I wanted and what ultimately came to light was that my wax lady had NEVER DONE A FULL BIKINI WAX BEFORE. She was therefor too nervous to try on me (hey, me too once I found this out!) and I ended up paying for and leaving with a) not the service I had wanted and b) a rather crooked and sloppy job upon at home inspection. To be fair, we've all started new jobs before and I guess there's no school for bikini waxing with faux hippy bush dummies to practice on but come on... I hope my next experience at Remedy is more customer oriented! I will for sure be clarifying repeatedly in future which service I want as well as requesting a more experienced wax-er.
<review# 1121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/20/2010,8/11/2011,32,111,,10,5>I went into Liquid Gold to taste olives as I mistakenly thought it was an olive tasting store. That's how much of a foodie I am. I missed the Liquid Gold reference. What I discovered was an olive oil and vinegar tasting bar carrying top-quality products. Rows of shiny urns line the walls of the wood paneled store located in the Hydrostone market. Beside each urn is a stack of cups which are used for tasting the liquid gold. You can try as many flavours as you like. Bread is provided to cleanse your palate between tastes. It's like a wine tasting but with olive oil and vinegar. The staff is friendly and very helpful. As foodies are obviously a target group and I am so not a foodie, I confessed my ignorance about balsamic vinegars other than knowing what's sold in supermarket chains is not that tasty. The clerk was happy to tell me that most balsamic vinegars sold in supermarkets are aged for only four years. The ones sold in this store are aged between twelve and eighteen years and urged me to taste a vinegar that had been aged eighteen years.I was instantly wowed. The vinegar was light with notes of strawberries and other fruits, perfect to be used as a salad dressing. It was like a fantastic wine, but the price was much less, around $18. The oils and vinegars are sold in reusable bottles. If you bring your bottle back, then you get a 10% discount off your next purchase.I went home with a bottle to try and look forward to sampling the olive oils next time. I may well be on my way to becoming a serious foodie.
<review# 1122,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2011,8/10/2011,29,166,4,5,3>FYI - the JiXiang is open again after its Winter break. The food is still the best hot spicy food in Halifax! I dare you to find such a diverse menu - not that I am in any way a fan of some of the dishes. Just for conversation you should drop in for a meal and to read their offerings.But back to the food - if you want to get away from the "sweet and sour chicken" crowd this is a must. If you are accompanied but such a person, I think there are 5 or 6 items at the very back of the menu to keep them happy.Yesterday our waitress was able to put a bit of a scare in me that maybe the dish that I ordered (stir fried pork with spicy green peppers) would be too hot. It was not too hot, but it was great with lots of flavour.
<review# 1123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2011,8/9/2011,15,59,3,8,3>Ronnie's 2 For 1 does everything well. Donairs, pizza, salads. They have some of the best prices in Dartmouth when it comes to the almighty pie. With the exception parties I've always ended up having leftovers which work great for lunches. Did I mention that Ronnie's pizza reheats from frozen like no other?They deliver most everywhere and have a few locations to cover all of Dartmouth. If you're picking your pizza up at the Main Street location make sure you check out the portrait hanging beside the cash. There are four or five young guys in suits next to one very hairy man in a wife beater. It's one of the strangest photos to grace the walls of an eatery. I was eating at the Mic Mac Tavern once and I saw Ronnie with his family, and I can say he is an all around nice guy.Of all the offerings I enjoy the donairs and the classic pepperoni and cheese the most. They keep late hours for the night owls or party-goers.
<review# 1124,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2011,8/8/2011,21,5,,18,3>Since moving to Bedford last summer, I have quietly complained about the lack of a sushi restaurant.  So when I heard that my wish had come true, I had to go check it out!First off, I would consider myself somewhat of a sushi fanatic.  I've been to just about every sushi restaurant in the HRM more than once.  In fact, some would call me somewhat of a sushi snob (I'm OK with it).  I really didn't have high expectations the first time I went to Sakura (primarily because it's in Bedford), which has been open for a little over three weeks now.  I went with two friends on a Wednesday night and my experience was fantastic.  They have a really great menu with everything you would expect and more.  We ordered their house salad with ginger dressing, their sashimi combo (their octopus sashimi is delicious), spicy salmon roll, dynamite roll, sweet potato tempura roll, and one of their specialty rolls, the Golden Lobster Roll (my new favourite!).  Sakura exceeded my expectations in every way.  The service was great and Ivan, the sushi chef, came over to our table personally to check on us.  He was so friendly and welcoming.  Considering what we ordered, it was also one of the most affordable sushi nights I've had.  I would go back in a heartbeat.  Not only because it's close to home, but because it's now one of my favourite sushi restaurants in the city.As an FYI, they have only been open for about a month so it will be another month or so before they are licensed.

Just too expensive!! So this July I took my car to Yuille for some minor work, advice and an MVI. I was blown away at how fast, ethical and honest the whole crew was over there. Cordial and up for a fleeting banter about "this and that" I immediately felt at ease and comfortable.All the word of mouth and good rumors of Yuille's services are legit so I recommend anybody with any car to go there and if you own a European car, the specialize. Desire nothing but honesty, integrity and fair pricing; this is your place.Hats off to you Yuille Auto Works - I'll be back & keep up the good work!

We sat on the balcony and had a fantastic lunch. Two of us split a chef salad in a taco shell (delish) and one of the platters with pork, chicken Yuca and Tostenos (spelling?). It was all SOOO good. Neil the bartender was great and he makes a wonderful Mojito - it was better than the ones I had in Cuba! I hear there is free salsa lessons on Fri and Sat night and then dancing till 2AM. I will be back for food, Mojitos and dancing!
<review# 1127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2011,8/5/2011,28,16,,3,2>This is my favorite book store in Halifax. I'd stop by almost everyday to look for a pre-owned copy of Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. Not just any old copy though, it HAD to be a the copy with the orange Merry-go-Round horse on it. I would settle for nothing else! Then, on that fateful day on March 1, 2011, I saw a vintage, hard-cover copy displayed in the window. That very bright, orange Merry-go-Round horse, designed by artist Michael Mitchell, could have caught my eye from a mile away.  I was ecstatic as the bookstore owner retrieved it from the display. While she rang me in, I admired it's pre-loved, tattered jacket and as I opened and leafed through, I noticed a magazine clipping tucked between the pages. It was an article penned by Leonard Slater for McCall's Magazine. A 50 year old piece dated July 1961, celebrating 10 years since The Catcher in the Rye debuted.  It won me over!

I completely get that the owner has a unique vision of his venue.Being over 35 I highly recommend as a Fabulous place to meet and mingle while enjoying their vast selection of cocktails. Contrary to the previous reviews I don't want to go to a totally grunge style venue where the staff look like they just rolled out of bed. Ladies can actually dress in a cocktail dress or a guy in a suit and feel completely in their element. Coming from Boston I was worried that Halifax had lost it's flair for the business professional to have a FUN place to unwind. G Lounge has restored my faith in the city. Bravo to the owners and staff. I will be returning and spreading the word of your Fabulous Place.

It was an awesome take away and I'm still relishing it as I write this from my desk just down the street. Oh and they made a glass of iced tea that's somewhat lemony - tart, yet sweet? Not sure how they made it but it's also fantastic. The $11 was a bit steep for the two items, but I certainly enjoyed it and wish I had more! I'll be back for sure.
<review# 1130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/12/2011,8/2/2011,8,31,2,3,3>Confession: I'm not really a foodie. I don't eat much, and when I do, I'm not that picky. (Well, I'm pescetarian, but that's another story.) Yet despite the fact that I don't generally fall in love with restaurants, I love Doraku.I can't quite explain it. I've been to Doraku about four or five times now, sometimes with a friend and sometimes by myself. Every time, I've gotten great service from the two lovely ladies there, and a gentleman on my last visit. All of them are busy-busy, but they don't use it as an excuse to neglect you. The atmosphere is beautiful -- don't let the tucked-away location fool you. You'll feel like you're in Japan the minute you walk inside.Even on a late-night visit half an hour before closing, they didn't rush me. (I still ate quickly so I wouldn't inconvenience them, but they were fantastic about not pressuring me!)And the food? Oh yes. I get the Philly roll and BC roll every time I'm there, and then choose a third roll depending on what I feel like at the time. Sometimes I get edamame if I want salty indulgence. Banana tempura with ginger ice cream (I was scared the first time I tried it, and then I had a bite and subsequently vowed to order it every time) for dessert. Sake if I want to feel authentic.This is my comfort food. I'll drag every friend and relative there, but eating alone there is fun, too. Now, let me go to the menu on their website and plan my next trip... mmmm.

I absolutely adore this place, my favorite Chinese food joint without any more thought to the matter. The food quality is amazing, as is the service. Some honorable mentions include the ginger beef, sweet and sour chicken with pineapple and black bean sauce noodles. Also, I don't know what they do to their plum sauce, but I want to bath everything I own in it. I always leave satisfied and with leftovers for the next day, which is always a treat. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
<review# 1132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2011,7/31/2011,26,10,4,4,2>I've taken on The Coast's Food and Drink Halifax guide as my own personal summer conquest. After checking off all of the places I've been and highlighting the ones I'm eager to try, I set out on my mouth-watering mission. First off the mark was Fid Resto on Dresden Row.  Known for their local and sustainable fare, I was eager to sink my teeth into their French-Asian inspired dishes. The spot itself is very cozy. I felt more like a guest at a bed and breakfast, than a random off the street patron. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about their products, processes and off course had great expertise on wine pairing. You could tell she was passionate about the food and really took pride in satisfying the customer - which unfortunately these days is a rarity. My friend and I shared an appetizer of scallops covered in an olive dust ...delish.  She had the Artic Char with fresh vegetables and I devoured the 7-day marinated hanger steak, served rare. The steak was gorgeous, but the true star of the show was the roasted garlic mashed potatoes and greens. Seriously, these potatoes were crush worthy, literally playing love games with me. To top it all off, we shared churros with a side of chocolate and caramel sauce. I more a fan of the super rich, mega-calorie, dairy-filled deserts, but the churros were a nice end to a fantastic meal and experience. Next mission: Try their brunch.
<review# 1133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2011,7/30/2011,20,4,,4,2>I don't think I have ever been dissatisfied with a meal here- I guess that is why the name of the restaurant is so perfect. I also used to work right next-door to Satisfaction when I worked at a wine bar on Grafton. Then was pleasantly surprised when it popped open in its new location 1 block away from my townhouse. Hello cravings, I drive by this place every single day. This location is warmer, brighter and bigger, but still gives a nod to his humble roots and un-cluttered style of decor. You will feel at home as soon as you walk in.Their daily burgers, dahl soup, and amazing vegan french toast never leaves your belly empty. Samosa dinner is a fan favourite between my family and friends who know this veggie hot spot well. To me satisfaction always feels more like a spiritual experience than just another place to fill a hole, their amazing books, take-away quote cards and all other this Sri Chinmoy fill your soul as you dine. "simplicity is an advanced course" -Sri Chinmoy and so are too are the complexities of flavours housed in the under-rated neighbourhood gem.
<review# 1134,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2011,7/29/2011,11,51,,4,2>I visited Song's in April, and when I arrived was the only person in the restaurant, which made for some of the fastest service I've ever had at a sit-down restaurant.I can't recall exactly what I got, but I ordered a couple different things to try, and with the portions, it definitely satisfied the monster hunger I had at the time.The staff at the restaurant were great, passing by every so often, not even just to see how everything was, but it became a bit of a running conversation, which really helped to make the mood lighter.Small little place on Quinpool, but perfect if you're looking for something different at dinner time!
<review# 1135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/1/2011,7/28/2011,30,26,,2,2>I grew up near Martha's, and let me say they've done a complete 180 from the pizza joint I remember. Their menu of gourmet pizzas satisfy a grown-ups taste with fresh ingredients. The service is quick and pleasant, and If fancy pizza isn't your taste their classic pies are also delicious. Definitely one of the best places for pizza in the area.
<review# 1136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/6/2011,7/27/2011,19,4,3,9,3>It's been a while since I signed in and wrote a review (still waiting for an improved Blackberry app) but I couldn't clam up about Willman's. It was the first time I stopped for takeout since the the resurrection of the permanent restaurant. The new diggs are SUCH an improvement over the old building. A much larger/nicer dining room and a washroom  (interior unknown...I didn't have to go...and I only mention that there is a washroom because I'm pretty sure the old Willman's didn't have one) greet you and from what I could see the kitchen is bigger and better than ever to cook the food which, as far as my experiences have allowed me to say, is yummy! The menu doesn't seem to be different than my first visit (in the old building and I had the classic 2pc Fish and Chips to go) and I could find fault in the fact that it looked like it could have been the same piece of paper that I ordered from a year ago...but...the choice of the small clams and chips makes this complaint disappear.I was surprised to be asked if I wanted my meal cooked medium or well done. I thought, 'You can choose how your clams are cooked?' Apparently you can! I asked for medium but added that I'd like my fries (which are not frozen) well done. I had time to reply to a direct message and started a phone call when I was told that my order was ready. Talk about quick!!I brought my dinner home...it was well after 5pm and I had lunch at 9am, so hunger may have played a factor in how much I enjoyed the clams and fries. Nah! They were just really good. The clams were lightly coated and crispy and not too greasy. Kudos, Willman's....I will bring the pickiest fish eater I know to try your wares the next time she visits. Mom is gonna 'really like' you! ...and that says a lot!
<review# 1137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2011,7/26/2011,25,18,3,5,3>The service industry is all about pleasing your customers- even before you enter the front doors. Did they do this? You bet! How did they do it? Read on:1. Nice website2. They use Open Table for reservations- I used it3. Someone called to confirm my reservation 2 days beforeWhat about the actual service experience? Did they meet my high expectations Again, you bet! How did they do it? Read on:1. I was greeted at the door by a friendly, warm, and professional host who took our coats and hung them up for us.2. They decorated for Valentine's Day with hearts, candles, etc. Just the right amount of cheese.3. My glass of water never stood a chance at becoming pessimistic. The servers never gave us a chance to argue is the glass half empty of half full? It was refilled every 3 sips.4. They gave us a choice in tables and gave us the coziest, and only booth in the restaurant. We got to have privacy while being able to 'people watch'.5. In typical fine dining fashion, there were long waits between courses. It's great - you can really enjoy your time there. What about the food? Did they meet our high expectations? Yes- but I won't lie- it wasn't my favorite meal.  It was close, but it didn't make the top 5. How did they do it? Read on:1. Bread to start with some yummy butter. I have to admit- not my favorite selection of breads but at least it was fresh.  2. Most delicious asparagus prosciutto soup ever. 3. Perfectly cooked pork tenderloin, potato, and veg. Small portion but surprisingly, I was full. That's what happens when you get lots of time between courses. You realize that you don't need to eat nearly as much. 4. I had the warm crepe filled with cinnamon apple- the apples were too sweet and tart. They also could have used less. Brennan had the pumpkin cheesecake with mascarpone cheese- the best cheesecake i have ever eaten.I am really happy about my experience here and I will return again for another special celebration but it's really out of my price range. We had the prix fixe menu as part of the month long Savour Festival.
<review# 1138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2011,7/25/2011,1,15,1,14,3>I'm what you'd probably call an addict. I climb a lot. Maybe there is something in the white chalky powder everyone uses on their hands while climbing. Maybe it's because it's the only thing I've ever been even a little bit good at. The point is Ground Zero provides my fix. If you're new to climbing or old hat, ground zero has a lot to offer. The rope routes change somewhat frequently, and there are usually about 40 new bouldering problems once a month.A great community of regulars can typically be found in the bouldering area. If you're new to climbing and want to learn more, or if you're new to the area and need someone to show you where all the great local outdoor climbing is, then strike up a conversation with one of them.
<review# 1139,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/13/2011,7/24/2011,65,55,,2,3>I've only ever been to Hart and Thistle for lunch but have had very good experiences each time. During my last visit I tried their vegetarian burger as per a recommendation by a friend and was definitely not disappointed! The burger is made with oats, rice, tofu & sautéed veggies and is topped with peppered Havarti, caramelized onions & sweet chilli mayo... delicious! As a big burger fan, I was very sceptical but all the flavours combined together was yuuummmmy!Overall their menu has a variety of light and heavy menu items. The service has been great each time and I am looking forward to meals and after work drinks on their fabulous waterfront padio!
<review# 1140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2011,7/23/2011,19,131,2,5,3>Garrison Beer has stole my heart. First, the beer is tasty and refreshing. My favorite is the Raspberry Wheat. Cool and refreshing. There are tons to choose from as well, Hopyard, Jalapeno, Blackberry Wheat (which is second to my Raspberry Wheat) etc..and you can mix 'n' match bottles. They also have their own pop now too!Second, you can sample anything on tap for cheap! Third, Garrison offers a brewery tour for $12 per person which includes 5 beer. (Hello, buzz!)Fourth, and most importantly Garrison was open on Canada Day!!

<review# 1142,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2011,7/21/2011,33,173,2,5,2>Bowling was the one sport I enjoyed doing in gym class.  Not because I was any good at it, per se, but because it didn't involve running nor having balls thrown at you.The first thing that I enjoy about the Bowlarama is that their website has the functionality to book lanes online.  While it does suggest to book 24 hours in advance, I was able to book two lanes the morning of our party, and received a confirmation by e-mail within minutes.The Bowlarama offers Cosmic (glow in the dark) bowling by 9:30 at night, but on our visit the black lamps were turned on at 8:30. The lanes are clear, the shoes are clean and don't smell, and the chairs are actually comfy for when you need to take your break and record your third strike on the score sheet.There's a soft drink vending machine and a couple of coin-operated game machines, like the Claw.  They also serve alcoholic drinks, which while I'm sure would increase the fun factor, would heavily hamper my aim.We all had a great time.  For $10, we each got shoes and two strings, which worked out to around two hours of fun!  These days, you can't find many cheap fun places for groups or dates.  We'll definitely be going again.  Maybe next time I'll break 60.
<review# 1143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2011,7/20/2011,9,59,1,5,4>I have been to Coastal Cafe many times, and it is truly consistently excellent. They are always changing their delicious menu so you can't get bored, and always have a couple vegetarian options. The service is really good, even when they're busy but if you're not careful about timing lunch correctly, it can be tough to get a seat! I find going a little bit earlier than noon usually means less wait for a table.I took a friend here last week and both of our meals were perfect. I had a beans and rice that was spicy and filling, with tortilla chips on the side for dipping. She had a chicken burger with those delicious homemade fries. In the past I've enjoyed pad thai, the butter chicken nanwich, seafood curry and several breakfast items. I am drooling just thinking about it. Check it out, and I'm sure you'll love it.
<review# 1144,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2011,7/18/2011,76,115,,2,2>Considering there are so many pubs downtown, it can be tough to pick one and I imagine the competition for customers is fierce. However, there are a few places downtown that are "die-hards" for me and DN's has become one of those places. Anytime I have been there, it has been full of people conducting lively chatter and listening to a great band. To be honest, given this criteria, you could be in ANY pub downtown (they can all feel a little homogenous in that way). But one thing that sets DN's apart is their atmosphere - it feels so cozy and warm, like a library - all dark wood, amber/low lighting, and pretty stained-glass windows. You step inside, order a pint and are immediately transported to the Irish countryside. You almost expect to turn around the see a table of tweed-clad farmers discussing football or something.The last time I was there I had their sweet potato fries, which were delicious (give the Old Triangle's a run for their money!) and they have a good selection of beer. The service was quite prompt considering how busy it was. We sat inside, but I have sat on the patio before and it's in a nice location - you're blocked from the wind/damp coming off the harbour, and you are in line with the other colourful patios of the Argyle St district so there is usually some neat people-watching to be had and fun energy to absorb.However, the last time I was there it was also extremely loud - I had to yell at the people next to me in order for them to hear what I was saying, which was a little annoying, especially since we were on the opposite end of the bar from the band. So, I wouldn't necessarily recommend this as a place to have an extensive conversation (at least not on Saturday night) unless you are comfortable having your faces within inches of each other and yelling into one another's ears. But if you want to hear some great music, have a drink, snack and a few laughs, this is a great choice!
<review# 1145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/6/2011,7/17/2011,18,60,5,5,2>Alright, I was craving Greek like a fat kid craves cake. All afternoon I had been reading over the menu at Estia (because I saw it on Yelp). So, when I learnt that my friend wanted to go to dinner, and found out that she did not have an aversion to Greek food as I thought she had  (I still stick to the thinking that ONE of our Vancouver friend hated Greek food and none of my Halifax friends really like it either) we were ready to go! I had chosen the Greek platter (21$) because I wanted it all. The Greekplatter gives you  the choice between moussaka or pastitsio, stuffed pepper or tomato and chicken, pork, lamb or scallop souvlaki, and is served with lemon roasted potatoes, rice and tzatziki. Comes with Greek salad too.  Before dinner they offered a basket of great seedy warm bread, with a lemony spiced oil to dip in. Was fantastic. I went with the pastitsio, stuffed pepper, chicken souvlaki and the rice,potato and salad. Everything was wonderful. I loved the fact that this was a sampler plate, but they still give you enough of everything to actually taste it - and everything tasted delish! I will definitely going back. Probably soon as this review is making me want it again.
<review# 1146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/18/2010,7/16/2011,21,55,3,3,3>What's shakin'? My lady and I were looking for a fine place for a date, and we sure did find one.The menu is a little scary for people in their 20's because it's around 17 big dollars for a burger, but holy smokes.. When it arrived I wanted to take a picture of it. The cheese and onions looked like fine art, but when I bit into it I swear I heard Celine Dion singing her "Titanic" hit. It was delicious, and the meat was grade A-- whatever that means. But it tastes like REAL fresh meat.The beer list wasn't as complex as I'd hope for a gastropub but they do have some; dark & light, and yes, they were locally brewed which is great. The wine availability again was limited, but for a supper date it gets the job done.Check it out.
<review# 1147,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/14/2011,7/15/2011,17,8,4,6,6>When the hunt club opened this year people weren't sure what it was all about... A place where you could drink, eat and shop for trendy casual clothing?? Fact is the hunt club is exactly what it says on the tin ... plus the staff are fab. The place is relaxed yet you feel like you are in a 'happening' hideaway. I had my 34th birthday at the hunt club and really enjoyed. Chris the dishy - witty bartender made us laugh and shook up some quality cockshmails... all the while the lovely Krissy (owner) took me around the shop helping me pick out something HOT for my guests to pitch in and buy for me! There's nothing like trying on cute stuff with a drink in your dressing room and your close friends nearby giving you their 2 cents on the 'look'... At this stage in life birthday presents are scarce so it was opportunistic for sure.I don't care much about bar food when I'm shopping AND drinking but my brother, father, boyfriend and all their buddies rave about the wings. Hopefully another yelper can review the culinary side of the hunt club. I love the place - whenever I come into town it's a destination.
<review# 1148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2011,7/14/2011,12,10,4,7,5>I think I'm adding a new thing to my Halifax Bucket List: Try one of everything at the Gingerbread Haus. Dangerously enough, this bakery is close to where I just moved to. I always want to buy a cake from here to take to take a birthday party but just can't afford them, so I window shop them instead. Much more affordable are their treats, from sweet to cheesy, chocolatey to fruity, there is more than one thing in here for everyone. Their breads are fabulous as well and you can even grab a day old baked good if you're lucky. The service is prompt and friendly and the atmosphere is good for a day of exploring what Halifax has to offer. There are usually couples drinking coffee at the cafe (they sell their own roast here). You'll be sharing this place with all your friends once you try it!
<review# 1149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2011,7/13/2011,14,2,,6,4>I'd often walked past Tom's Little Havana Cafe without ever knowing it was there.  We were looking for somewhere to meet on a Friday after work for some happy hour drinks and a friend suggested Tom's.  It is a small place, with around 12-15 tables, but this gives it a great atmosphere.  We got there just in time to get the best seats!  It got really busy about 5:30pm - 5:45pm and you would have struggled to get a table at this time.The happy hour specials were good, with discounts on wine, beer and spirits.  We opted for the house white wine which was $5 for a large glass, and was surprisingly drinkable.We only shared one appetizer.  A Mediterranean dip which was amazing.  The staff was really friendly and always on hand when you were looking for a refill.Tom's is a great spot for chatting with a small group of friends.  It is a lovely place away from the busier bars in Halifax for a nice relaxing evening.  I would love to try more of the food next time.
<review# 1150,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2011,7/12/2011,15,60,4,5,3>Burnside rocks, no? Well, at least it doesn't suck as much as it used to. Boyfriend maintains that all it needs now is a great sushi place. We will see, as we tour the local eateries! So happy that there is close-to-work thai, doing the thai food happy dance (which is always followed by thai food coma). So Boyfriend and I went for lunch, during the rush time, so they were slamming busy. Still, though, we were seated promptly and drinks and order were taken quickly. Love that they have a lunch rush process. I got the green curry lunch special, Boyfriend got the red curry (both with chicken). Both were fantastic and spicy, just what you expect. Just the right amount of food too (enough that I get full a little early so Boyfriend finishes his and mine) and can't argue with the $10 lunch special price tag. The spring rolls are good too--though I have to say I like Talay Thai's a little better. But only a very little. Atmosphere is... well, they've done what they can with weird strip mall in Burnside location. Like the little tiki hut things on the side of the room. And really, who cares when the curry is this good?Definitely going to stay on the Burnside lunchtime circuit. And if you live close enough, they'll deliver (for a fee). WIN.
<review# 1151,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2011,7/11/2011,1,24,5,5,5>Every city should have one of these. I always make sure to come to Venus Envy every time I'm in Halifax. I've been to a couple of other 'sex' stores, usually with a lingering feeling of disgust and awkwardness as I pass my purchase to a slightly scary looking older man... This is not the case at Venus Envy, the feeling I get there is comparable to being in a candy store, it is clean and fun and has a great vibe. The staff are friendly and super knowledgeable. I must say that it is really nice to see a store like this oriented toward women. YES! A store that supports real sex for real people in actual relationships! Oh... and they offer a student discount!
<review# 1152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2011,7/10/2011,42,100,2,3,3>I remember when Pete's first opened in its Dresden Row location. Because I didn't step foot in there until months after. No particular reason other than I didn't quite know what to expect and I wasn't as adventurous as I am now. I was a young university student and I stuck with what I was familiar with. Of course once I did my world was turned.Coming from small town Newfoundland and having done no traveling at all at that point, having markets such as these were unheard of for me. So stepping through the sliding doors was like transporting to another country. A country where fruits and breads and treats were visible, side by side with each other and people socialized while they shopped. It wasn't so much a chore doing into Pete's as it was an experience. With the amount of variety they have, going in there can always result in a new discovery.Along with their grocery options, they also offer sushi to go and a lunch section with soups, salads and sandwiches. I do enjoy their sandwiches and paninis but when I get lunch here, it's usually to get a salad which are easily the best in the city. Be sure to also grab a fruit smoothie. They're delicious and a more-than-suitable substitute for Booster Juice's winter hours (ie. they have none).One thing about Pete's that I remember when they first opened was the grand piano they had in the centre of the store. During the middle of the afternoons, there would often be someone there playing tunes and it made a world of difference for the atmosphere. I can understand why they removed it but it's still an aspect I miss.
<review# 1153,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2011,7/9/2011,52,21,2,7,5>In the past year, I've become an uneducated, but loving fan of Vietnamese food. Well, at least the Pho (pronounced Faaa, apparently), the yummy spring rolls and the salad rolls. An aficianado I am not, but having been to most of the restaurants in Halifax that serve Vietnamese, I can at least speak with comparison. Tu Do was exceptional and a tremendous addition to the Bedford restaurant scene. The beef in the Pho arrived rare, it was chock full of herbs, and accompanied by the usual assortment of lime and bean sprouts. And it was delicious! As good, if not better, than any other Pho I've had in town. But perhaps the best part of the meal was the family-owned and operated atmosphere. Albeit the service was a little slow and the walls a little bare, it was easily forgiven in the midst of chatting with our server (the son of the owners) and knowing that the food was being prepared by the family themselves. Bottom line: if you like Vietnamese, it's well worth the trip to Bedford. I was there twice last week and it won't be long before my next visit. I predict "regular" status in my future.
<review# 1154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2011,7/8/2011,59,150,2,4,2>This is my favorite place to eat for many, many reasons! Wanna hear them?? #1. It is sooo cozy, comfy and cute! They should rename it 3C and C3... maybe not. I love sitting next to the fireplaces (well, it is the fireside!!) I do believe it was also voted best first date spot in Halifax by Faces Magazine.#2. Super fast and friendly service; I can't remember a time when I did not receive this.#3. SEAFOOD CREPES! They have fresh scallops, shrimp, salmon and muscles wrapped in a thin crepe and smothered in a delicious creamy dill sauce! I'm making myself drool writing this, they are just so yum. I usually, actually always, pare it with a spinach salad. There is just something about the garlic dressing they use that I cannot get enough of. #4. Martini Monday! They are only $5.00 and you have lots to choose from; only another reason to keep going back.#5. Happy Hour! Monday-Friday 4:30-6:30 (when you really need a drink) you can get well shots (rum and coke, vodka lime etc), beer and wine for only $3.50!! WHAT! They're crazy.... or you are for not going :)#6. Overall the prices can't be beat. They range from about $7.00 - $20.00 a dish; most of the main courses are around $14.00. #7. The desserts are very inexpensive price wise, max $6.00, but expensive in taste! They do offer two sizes, a single dessert, and one to share! Try the raspberry kuchen; it is a warm butter cake covered in raspberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream! Now that you're done, what are you waiting for? GO TO THE FIRESIDE and enjoy :)

It may be little, tucked away on Brenton street, but bursts with the loveliest pieces from long gone times- from shoes to dresses to cowboy shirts to motorcycle jackets whew! A veritable oasis of hip for all the cool cats and babes in town.You can easily while away hours sorting through the neatly arranged racks of clothing, listening to Neil Young- who always seems to be on when I'm there :) and chatting with the owners who are basically the bees' knees: helpful without being pushy, keen to shoot the breeze; they always make you feel comfortable. So, with a selection that never ceases to make my heart sing, prices that are still pretty affordable for a student like me, and the coziest setting you could ask for in a shop, Dressed in Time is pretty swell in my book!
<review# 1156,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2011,7/6/2011,39,130,,3,4>If you're a food snob who only eats the freshest organic and locally grown ingredients, then the Wooden Monkey is for you. If you simply enjoy delicious food, (organic or otherwise) then the Wooden Monkey is for you too. Over the years, I've had several meals at the Wooden Monkey and I have never been disappointed. Their diverse menu has something for everyone, from the virtuous roasted chickpea salad and vegan rice bowl, to the more indulgent bacon-wrapped scallops or free-range steak with potatoes.  But the tasty offerings don't end with the food; they've also got a great selection of out-of-the-ordinary beverages, including gluten-free beer and a lychee-spiked sangria. Though it's on the higher-end of mid-priced restaurants, when you consider the quality of the food and the service, it's definitely worth the few extra bucks.

<review# 1160,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/31/2011,7/2/2011,26,94,,3,2>My first trip to the new location of the Halifax Farmer's Market was this weekend and I liked it. Really liked it in fact. I'm going on record as saying I loved the uniqueness of the previous location and still do; however, the openness of the market now is great. You can go upstairs and get the lay of the land, there are places for the musicians that give a little more opportunity to gather around for a listen.I felt I could linger a little more to truly get a feel for what was there for the offering. It is still busy and space is still tight at times. Found some tasty salsa from the Naked Pickle, grass-feed ground beef, some veggies.Not to mention a great view of the harbour including George's Island.
<review# 1161,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/3/2011,7/1/2011,10,5,4,6,3>Paper Chase has MANY things to offer a cafe lover. The open and airy, art filled, two-level space offers a wide variety of seating options, which is something I really treasure in a cafe. You may sit at a retro two seater table with attached royal blue spinning chairs, a regular 4-seater table with traditional chairs, plush couches (yes, multiple!), mega plush and roomy chairs, as well as long high tables with stools and a view overlooking Argyle Street!  Oh, I almost forgot... there are computer chairs for the many internet capable computers that cost mere cents to use.If that doesn't bring you in, let me tell you that there are PLENTY of vegan food options here. Also, you needn't worry about the barista's ability to froth your hot soy based coffee beverage. Paper Chase soy cappuccinos and soy lattes are well frothed in wide mouthed mugs for all your brown sugar dusting (or clumping) pleasures.Shall we begin? Their bean salad is ah-mazing, as is the couscous salad. Both are vegan. I've been frequenting Paper Chase for oh, yanno... 7 years or more... so trust me when I tell you if you like them, you always will. They have never changed and I consider this a good thing! If it's not broken don't fix it, right?You can have the salads alone or with a veggie samosa or pakora! YAY PAKORAS! I love me some deep fried carbs and spices. The salads also come as a side with the wonderful curried veggie burger. The patty itself is moist, thick, and flavourful. Not a spicy hot curry, just a pleasant curry you can have at lunch and not worry about offending anyone afterwards. It's one of those Halifax vegan treats that I could never reproduce at home.. it's magical. 99% of the time I go to Paper Chase I get the curried veggie burger. That statement is so true that the majority of the staff know exactly what to punch in the till as soon as they see me walk up the stairs. For breakfast there are a wide variety of vegan smoothies! My favourite is the Roasted Oat Breakfast Smoothie! It has roasted oats, maple syrup, soy milk, and your choice of strawberries or blueberries. It is so thick and flavourful (oats and maple! dreeeeeamboat!) I consider it to be a full meal! It's so hard to choose between blueberries and strawberries though. And no, Paper Chase won't do a mix!Most of their soups are vegan and change daily! Don't hesitate to ask for a sample to make sure you'll enjoy your meal! (: The veggie chili is also vegan as is the cornbread.As you can see, you're going to love it here!If you want something vegetarian and cheesy, I hear their avocado melts are top-notch. So is their super affordable all day breakfast! The only reason I am not giving my beloved people-watching, newspaper reading, internetting cafe 5 stars is the owner. Way more than often she is in a sour mood accompanied with a poor attitude. The way she openly "treats" (read: disrespects) the staff is abrasive, abrupt, and uncomfortable to be around.  Once upon a time, years ago, she lied to me about her margarine being vegan. I pressed her for the truth and she was unnecessarily defensive and wouldn't budge even though I knew very well she was using Verve which contains Whey! Whatever though!Long live Paper Chase! I kinda need you in my life.
<review# 1162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2011,6/30/2011,74,22,5,7,6>Gateaux Rose makes the best cupcakes in Halifax. They're made with imagination and a lot of love. Try walking by their Brewery Market stall and turning down one their perfect, pretty desserts. It's near impossible.They made me a batch  of cupcakes that really stole the show at my family's Christmas dinner. Turkey? Great. Veggies? Tasty. But then I produced a tray of cupcakes FILLED WITH SALTED CARAMEL and topped with a citrus mousse. Holy Cats!Gateaux Rose is also different  because the ladies who make the goodies are NSCAD grads. Their cupcakes look as good as they taste, with intricate designs and wee marzipan accessories. Basically, I'm in love with these cupcakes and want to marry them and have a life-long, fulfilling relationship. We'd be so happy together!
<review# 1163,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2011,6/29/2011,29,249,,4,3>A quiet neighborhood restaurant tucked away in the South End. Vinnie's is the perfect spot for homey comfort food at a great price point. The eatery is small, and could use a bit more decoration, but the welcoming staff more than makes up for the lack of decor. The wine list is small, but the prices are reasonable, and they have a $10 corkage fee if you want something a little more special. The bread boule they bring out at the start of the meal is warm and delicious and served with room temperature butter, always a bonus. I just wish they have a better serrated knife, because cutting the warm bread can be difficult.If you opt for the pasta, you get the choice of either a soup or salad to go with it. I've sampled both, the salad is nice but the soups are delicious, the last time I went, I had cream of leek and potato, I could have eaten 6 bowls of it.The pastas are often simple but flavourful. The portions are reasonable without being overly large. I have found the pasta to be slightly overdone to my tastes, but I like my pasta just past crunchy, so it would be perfect for most people. With bread, soup and a bowl of pasta coming to 16.10 including taxes, Vinnie's is a great place to go when you feel like something warm and filling, but you don;t want to break the bank.

After living away for some time and always having to hear from my friends how much they love It's All Greek To Me, I knew it was a place I had to dine. My girlfriends and I now make it a regular place to meet up for a delicious meal. The atmosphere is charming; it's small, but no one minds that you're in close quarters with other diners. The staff are outstanding - every member of the team welcomes you in, and makes you feel at home. And, of course the food! The food is, in my opinion, the best greek food in town. I'm no expert of course, but if I'm going for greek, this is the only place I'll consider!
<review# 1165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2011,6/27/2011,19,100,,4,3>If you start anywhere else when shopping Halifax for gifts for your loved ones, I surely do not know why. This shop is an absolute gem, stuffed with handmade Canadian goodies from clothes to jewelry to toys to stationery to household goods. From the glasses featuring traditional Halifax street-scapes to the one of a kind felted purses, you're certain to find something to covet as soon as you step through the door. If you're shopping for kids, there are screen-printed onesies, handmade sock monkeys, bath products, stuffed animals, and so much more. And oh, the jewelery. So nice I have to mention it twice. The owner and staff are incredibly friendly, and if you're a regular visitor, they're likely to learn your name and your taste. They even offer a gift registry, if you think your loved ones could use a little help shopping for you...
<review# 1166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2011,6/26/2011,51,65,2,2,4>As a self-proclaimed geek, I am bound by law to visit at least one comic book shop every month. My monthly pilgrimage to Strange Adventures is always a treat. In terms of physical space, this shop is definitely on the small end. But compared to other larger shops, the selection feels much larger. There is very little space that is not being used to display comic books, action figures, board games, or other nerd paraphernalia.The staff here have always been very friendly and helpful. I may be a geek, but I'm not a particularly *good* geek and the majority of my comic purchases are issues of the monthly Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. The staff members have never once made me feel inferior for not having an intimate knowledge of every book published under Alan Moore's name. So yay to them! I've also seen them helpfully directing clueless parents to comics that their children would likely enjoy. Double yay!True comic fans should be happy to know that, although Strange Adventures closes at 6 pm on most nights, they do have extended hours (open until 8 pm) on Wednesday nights, when most new comics are released. Strange Adventures lives in the pantheon of local shopping legends and for good reason: it's about as close to geek heaven as you're likely to find in Halifax.

Liu's is normally closed on Sunday but we had a special arrangement. The menu was set and I had no idea what I was eating most of the time. It didn't matter: everything I had was amazing. Lots of items that were "pseudo meat;" so much so that I'd feel comfortable bringing omnivorous friends. It's also a good place to pick up a variety of Chinese-inspired items. And tea. Of course, who can forget the amazing selection of tea!I'd highly recommend. Probably why I gave it 5 stars.P.S. What was up with that Freudian slip at the beginning there?
<review# 1168,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/24/2011,6/24/2011,54,227,5,5,2>OK, let's be real: I wouldn't have eaten here if I'd been the one paying. But if you can afford it, this is a Must. The food was sublime. I don't usually get excited about salad, but with goat cheese, apple and walnuts, I could have eaten three servings of those greens. The crab cakes were the best I've ever had, and the bison was a shock - tender, moist and flavorful. Who knew? (Classy, rich people probably knew. I did not know.) Stories is definitely "fine dining", and you pay for it. But is it ever worth it. The service was outstanding and the decor is gorgeous, plus the ever-changing menu gives you lots of reasons to return.
<review# 1169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/13/2011,6/23/2011,39,33,,7,3>How have I not written a review of Caribbean Twist yet? Is this the BEST restaurant in Halifax? It seriously might be. It is spectacular. The only problem is that in the dozen+ times I have been there in the last few months I have not had anything except for the Jerk Chicken plate. I plan to try something else, but that is not possible until I have had my fill of Jerk Chicken (well, I did try the Jerk Pork once and it was just as good) and that my take years.Add on top of that the fact that this place seems to have the nicest and most caring staff/owners of any place in Halifax and it is a treat to go there. Just so good. Better than I have had anywhere. Go. Now. Yum!
<review# 1170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/19/2011,6/22/2011,10,118,4,3,3>I'm addicted to chocolate. I'd like to say something like 'not just any chocolate' because that would give my story more depth and intrigue but there you have it. I am particularly fond, however of Galaxy Ripples, a chocolate bar native to the UK. This is how I'm starting my review. Saddle up, I'm tried and this is going to get ramble-y.Upon entering we were greeted by 3 voices all welcoming us into the shop which I guess was nice but for me (retail) enthusiasm is generally unnecessary. I feel your pain cashiers. I was sort of surprised to see some children hanging out by the edible underwear, or even being at the store in general but that's due  mostly to my hatred towards children. The speakers were blaring classic rock (the kind Patrick Bateman would have playing when he hacked people apart in American Psycho)much to my husband's delight. I was impartial to the music but was happy to not have to hear top 40 music. Seriously Katy Perry, get off my lawn. I basically have a nose for Galaxy Ripples. If they're around I'm like a bloodhound chasing after an escaped convict. There's no hiding from  me. I could have went straight to the middle of the shop where I could see Curly Wurly's, Double Deckers and Yories, all UK chocolate bars of course. But no, I turned left towards the edible underwear and tins filled with inedible mints section. There, nestled in the corner far away from it's British Bretheren was a small box of Galaxy Ripples. DAY EQUALS MADE. Something takes control of me when I see Galaxy Ripples. Instead of grabbing a few and being content in knowing I'll be snacking on my fave candy bar for a few days I grab the whole frigging box. That's right. The whole box. And I wasn't finished. Due to the Kitchy-ness of the store I also picked up a cheap cigarette holder and some Shakespeare Insult gum for my husbands Professor. And some more British Chocolate. Shut up. Excellent store. I prefer the Bedford Location over the Downtown location simply because I'm taking the (Un-come on!)necessary flaw of children with the Bedford locale over the scenester/teenaged shit faces at the location down town. Reality: Both stores are super fun and come highly recommended by me. Your trusted too much information yelp reviewer.
<review# 1171,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2011,6/21/2011,44,118,,4,4>********Drumroll Please*********Here it is, Delicious Sushi In Halifax!!Yay!!Given my negative experiences in the past with other Halifax sushi joints, I was absolutely delighted to find this gem. These chefs could teach all other Halifax sushi chefs a thing or two about what they do best. We were greeted and seated promptly be our friendly waitress, right by the fish tank and sushi bar. Upon exploring the packed dining area on a quest for the washrooms, I decided that next time I would make reservations in the beautiful main section, with its stunning winding rooms and passageways and natural brick and mortar. Our first dish, agedashi tofu, came not extremely quickly, but as slow as might be expected as busy as it was. The tofu was worth the wait however, since it was possibly the best I've ever had. It was not too soft, not too hard, and clearly freshly made. I also had the vegetable roll and inari nigiri. I was very happy to see that the vegetable maki had neither carrots nor lettuce, but did have avocado. Then again that's just my personal taste. The Inari was very tasty, just right and not stuffed too the brim with rice. If you're thinking, "but what about the meat?!" then I have to tell you about boyfriend's dish. He ordered the chicken and veggie teriyaki, which he enjoyed very much. According to his taste buds, the chicken tasted char grilled, like it was done over a bbq, perfectly seasoned, with just the right ratio of meat to veggies. The only thing that surprised me negatively was the tea - not complimentary in a Japanese restaurant? Did I accidentally step into an alternate dimension where this is normal and giraffes rule the earth? Then again, maybe it's a Halifax thing.

Well, if they're smart, they go to Darrell's. The veggie peanut butter burger with Darrell fries is the greatest hangover lunch you can have if you're vegetarian. If you're not, then just get the regular peanut butter burger :)Delicious, fast, and reasonably priced. Just the perfect little spot.
<review# 1173,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2011,6/19/2011,24,40,4,2,6>I am in love with this bar.I was dying to go to the basement of The Henry House, pretty much since I moved here two years ago, but I had no idea that there was a little slice of heaven right here on Barrington.Some friends had been whispering in my ear over the past week about a mythical place above the Henry House with a dark wood bar, lime green chairs and an atmosphere of a time gone by. So, by the time last night rolled saying I was feverishly excited for the Drawing Room would have been an understatement...We entered from the side door, ascended a on old staircase, and entered the Drawing Room, where I was shocked.I couldn't really put a finger on where I was. Was I going to turn the corner and run into Oscar Wilde and Bosie Douglas drinking absinthe together, or Coco Chanel and Charlie Chaplin having martinis. Or was it just halloween with all the smoke and candles? Who can say, and who really cares?An absinthe fountain, dark wood, well dressed waiters, well dressed cocktails, and of course those pillars of my heart, the green velveteen chairs by the fireplace.It was already a great experience, even before the drinks were ordered.The first that I ordered was the whiskey sour (10$.) When it arrived, I couldn't help but exclaim that it looked exactly like those tumblers I had seen in my cocktail guides even with the artful swizzle suspended above the drink with a maraschino cherry.The second drink was a classic martini (10$), with vodka, and an olive. The olive was quite bland, but the drink was quite wonderful.These drinks were both flavourful and strong, so if you felt that you had not gotten your money's worth in the atmosphere (and if you didn't shame on you), you get your money's worth in the drink strength.Then comes the aromatic diffuser (2$ with cocktail)... Two sticks of fragrance suspended in a bowl that dry ice is poured over, to give off billowing scented "smoke" (ours was pomegranate.) Please, please, get this because it gives that little extra something.However, if this weren't enough, appetisers are also served. We ordered the hummus and french fries. I could not decide which was better, the crispy french fries in the tangy chili mayo or the lemony and full bodied hummus.So please come on down to The Drawing Room for a trip back in time, but be quiet about it, this is a secret almost too good to share...Shhhhhhh....

I've been to Burrito Jax probably 8 times, and only once before 2 a.m. I always said I'd do inappropriate things to obtain sushi after a late night show downtown (rather than stupid gross slices of pizza or Freeman's AGAIN), but I hadn't thought of how awesome it would be to get a burrito at 2.am! Oh how awesome it is! I always opt for the veggie burrito (with guac!) and there're a friggin' LOT of veggie toppings. Sweet potato?! Yes please! Lots of awesome sauces. Only once did I have a less than amazing experience-- the burrito wasn't heated long enough. I love that they're always blasting metal in the restaurant. It's not always good metal, but metal nonetheless. The dudes working are often preoccupied with partying later, but they're working late on the weekends serving our drunk asses, so who can blame 'em for wanting to get out of there? Great burritos. Never opt for the guac and chips. As you'll come to see, the guac isn't fresh (doesn't make such a big deal when it's in the burrito) and the chips are bland. 2 a.m? Screw the skanky slice! Head down the hill from Pizza Corner to Burrito Jax! You can still sit on the stone wall and eat your burrito.

We headed over on Saturday evening for the first time. We had to take a fairly early reservation - 5:30 - and the place was busy even so early in the evening. I ordered the arugula salad and the lasagna and both were fantastic. The lasagna looks tiny - don't be fooled. It's rich and truffley and decadent. I went from thinking "This needs to be about three times bigger" to "This needs to be about three times bigger, but if it were, I would definitely die." I didn't sneak bites from other people's meals at the table but everything looked delicious. One of our group is vegan, and our waitress was helpful in pointing out some vegan options to him. We all commented on the comfiness of the chairs and the coziness of the fireplace we happened to be seated next to. Service was good and quick, with our waitress making recommendations about wines and the aforementioned vegan dishes. Great views of the harbour and Bishop's Landing. It's not too-too pricey either. Awesome choice for a date night or a dinner or dessert out with friends! Ah yes...dessert. We saw the dessert cart making the rounds several times and everything looked incredible. I was so deep in my cheesy truffly fat coma I couldn't bear to eat another bite but I would definitely go back just for a cappuccino and a slice of this flourless chocolate cake I keep hearing about!

But let me say this: if you still haven't experienced Two if By Sea Cafe, then get your butt on over to Dartmouth. You won't regret it.I was here the very first day this place opened. I had been looking forward to it for months, and was not disappointed. Co-owners Zane and Tara know their way around coffee and baking, respectively. They also know how to use social media and grow word of mouth. But most importantly they understand the value of community. Dartmouth has been experiencing a bit of a slow renaissance over the past 3 or 4 years, but TIBS kicked this renaissance into high gear when they arrived on the scene in the fall of 2009. TIBS participates in many community events. They have just started up a monthly TIBS Family Dinner in conjunction with a local chef. I had the pleasure of attending a one-woman play here during Nocturne. It was a wonderful experience to sit with friends enjoying beverages and mini-croissants (usually only available at special events), while watching a performance unfold at the next table.Zane makes the best cappucino I've ever had. If he's not working, the cappucinos are still excellent, but missing a little something something. I also enjoy the cafe lattes. The pain au chocolate will send you into another world. The almond croissants are delicious, but be forewarned - they are very sugary. I can munch on one of their giant cookies for days. I've had some amazing croissants of the week specials. My favourite is made with apple, cheddar, bacon and green onion. Mmmm. I wish the specials were available on weekends. I used to drive from Burnside on my lunch hour sometimes to pick up one of these babies, but now that I work in Halifax I'm too far away.It is ALWAYS busy at TIBS, but it doesn't usually take long to find a table. However, if you have your heart set on a croissant, make sure you go early. They usually run out by afternoon.I've heard about varying levels of service, but I don't believe I've ever had anything but great service. Maybe a little rushed at times, at worst. In fact on my second visit, Zane remembered my drink order, and also recognized me from Twitter. He responded to a concern I had posted previously about opening on Sundays (they used to close on Sundays at the time).I'm a huge TIBS fan. And now I want a cappucino...

In fact, it's kind of cliché to rave about the warm, doughy, cinnamony goodness that is the Mary's cinnamon roll. They've probably won more 'best of' awards than they know what to do with. But you know what? I don't care. I love these cinnamon rolls. I will go out of my way to get one. I will get in long line ups to have at one. The worst part about moving out of the South End means I have to work harder to get one. They are best served warm, fresh, and with coffee. One thing I have noticed since the opening of the Seaport market: the insane line ups for cinnamon rolls are gone and you can even grab a place to sit and eat. The breads are pretty good too and so is the Christmas fruit cake, but the cinnamon roll is where it's at.

As an aside, it's really funny but this was my nephew and niece's favourite restaurant when they came to visit this summer. They were really reluctant to go and practically had to be dragged away from going to a burger place, but once they were inside they absolutely loved it. I think what made it for them was the personable and entertaining waiter, who made it his business to make sure they had a good, fun time.

Located in the basement of the 1801 Hollis office building, this glittering new space is a great addition to downtown food options.Pete's serves up made-to-order sandwiches, homemade soups and my favourite, custom salads. The display of fresh salad ingredients is enough to hypnotize me. For about $7, you can get a small custom made salad filled with veggies, cheese, chickpeas, bacon bits and other goodies.If you're in a hurry, there are premade sandwiches to grab. Plenty of drinks are on offer. A small selection of groceries like tea is also available. It's takeout as fresh as it gets downtown.

Doesn't feel at all like a chain - and I don't think it is.Large open room, lots of wood and brick showing. Great feel! And it plays blues music all the time - bonus!Loved that each and every table has a roll of paper towel hanging on one side and there is a glass full of toothpicks mixed in with the condiments - both essential for a rib place.It was a slow night and the guy at the counter welcomed me, got my name, walked me through the process and made a point of calling me by name several times through my stay - very nice touch to make one feel welcomed on a damp winter evening in Halifax.The food was good - loved the beans. Ribs a bit dry for my taste, but the hot sauce was perfect! Loved the two special brews on tap from Garrison!This is not a place to spend a couple of hours, but it is a great place to pop in for some quick hardy food and some chat. There are no TVs noising up the place!
