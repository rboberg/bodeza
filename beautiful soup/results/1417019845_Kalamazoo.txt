<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/24/2014,11/26/2014,8,21,1,2,2>My wife and I went there for a date night a few weeks back. We had been there once before a few years back but was long ago enough that we didn't really remember the food. First, the drinks. I had the Paloma (grapefruit juice, tequila, & Squirt) & the Chupa Cabre (tequila, lime juice, raw sugar, jalapeno, and ginger beer) and my wife had the Mojito with blackberry puree. Drinks were all delicious and perfectly made. On to the food. Obviously we started with the tableside guacamole because it's amazing. Everything was perfect. For our meal, we ordered the Tamales (delicious), Jerk Chicken (average), Pacifico Fish Tacos (amazing), and Street Tacos (perfect). All of the food was good. Only thing that was a little disappointing was the Jerk Chicken came out underdone and had to be sent back. I noticed we weren't the only table that had that issue with that particular dish. Our waitress was amazing and provided excellent service. Needless to say we will be going back.

It has this delicious herbed cheese with pears and Greens and a perfect vinaigrette. Our party of four were very happy with our entrées and the sides were not just afterthoughts. The pumpkin cheesecake was glorious.
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2014,11/24/2014,0,19,1,4,3>I've done mat work for years off and on, but have always wanted to use the reformer. Drove by this studio one day, and convinced a girlfriend to take a duet lesson. Amy is super nice and extremely knowledgeable. The lessons are about 50 minutes, with excellent one-on-one instruction, and though hard, super fun. I really enjoyed everything about it. The studio is clean and lovely; the instruction is perfect; though the price is a little steep, you're basically getting private fitness lessons for an hour. We immediately signed up for a 5-session package. And I'm definitely sore the day after, but in the best possible way :) It's also right next door to a tea and spice shop, so we went and got some iced teas and sat outside afterwards. It was a lovely outing!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/5/2014,11/23/2014,19,25,1,5,4>Came here for a nice quiet dinner on Friday night. This restaurant is an employee-owned  former Perkins and is quite remarkable. The food is very good, portion size is healthy and fair, and the prices are really in line for what you get. We were both very impressed with the food quality, the really friendly warm service and the fact that it's all local and employee-owned really means a lot. No rich and distant restauranteur drinking the profits and barking at staff. They are all in it together and it shows.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/23/2014,11/22/2014,6,62,1,3,4>We've visited this Burdick's a few times in the past and it's a favorite for the kids. Today's visit was another great experience. I had the Dragon's Milk pulled pork sandwich and was it ever delicious. The slaw was the perfect contradiction to them pork and the fresh butter bun topped it off perfectly.  My wife had the Salmon BLT and thought t was delicious.  Both of our dishes came with fries as a side and in the past we've upgraded to the truffle fries and been disappointed due to the light dusting that the fries normally receive. My wife gave them another shot and today was an exception. Apparently they are also quite delicious when an adequate amount is used. The service was very snappy, but then again there was only one other table at the time so it would have been pretty hard to screw up. The kids always love to go to this location (even the littlest) and watch people skating out the big windows. Today was no exception and it's amazing how long they can be fascinated by the skaters which makes dinner way kore enjoyable for mom and dad. My only complaint is with the prices. All three Burdick's share the same prices and while they might be acceptable for the downtown location, I think they're a bit high for this location.  Even though them prices are a bit high it's still worth a visit. One warning to you - Saturday evenings are open skate and you'll want to be prepared for children to be begging to go skating. It's $3 for open skate and $3 for skate rental. We didn't go today but the kids have really enjoyed it in the past.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2014,11/21/2014,9,30,1,4,2>I have long waited for a Peruvian restaurant to open in Michigan period, let alone in the Zoo. Hallelujah! The wait is over. I tried the papa rellena, which had a nice combination of textures, and the pollo la brasa. The chicken, rice and beans were all great, but for me, it's about the Aji sauce. This sauce is so spicy and flavorful that I had to buy a pint before leaving the best. Looking forward to coming back!!!
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,11/20/2014,2,3,1,3,3>The Kalamazoo Beer Exchange is by far one of the best places in Kalamazoo to enjoy a bite to eat, and a drink. The service is always great the menu always has something new to offer since they change their menu depending on the season. It's such a cool place to eat and hang with friends. I had the Piedmontese Burger with all the workings and it was easily one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. I also had a flight which is four 5 ounce samplings of beers of your choice, and for dessert I had a delicious Bread pudding. It was a great experience, good food, good beer, good service!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/15/2014,11/19/2014,0,7,2,3,3>While I've only been here enough times to count on two hands, I've never had a bad time. The Pub style benches and tables make it a great place to have gatherings of large groups. The pizza here is great and there is a wide selection of beers. They also host Karaoke and stand up comedy during the week which can be a great way to wind down after work. While the appearance of the place upstairs can be a little off putting at times, the general feel is fun. Their pool tables aren't in the best of shape but they're available.They also have the Shakespeare's Lower Level venue down stairs which has a respectable sound set up and a good atmosphere.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2014,11/18/2014,27,22,2,2,3>They have the best gluten free pasta I've had anywhere! Great wine list and homemade meals.  Four stars because I'm not that big of a fan of their homemade sweet sauce, prefer red sauce not as sweet... I mention this as I know there are people out there who do. If that's you, consider it a 5 star. Make reservations ahead. They do not validate parking garage tickets.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2014,11/17/2014,0,5,2,3,2>Pizza is fantastic and very close to authentic NY style!  Great crust, tasty sauce and good, traditional toppings.  When you call you're likely to get Stefano himself who is extremely enthusiastic and friendly as can be.  Delivery (even on weekends) is fast and surprisingly, in this current, bone-chilling weathers, still VERY hot.  We have ordered a handful of times from this place now and it never disappoints.  Highly recommend if you're looking for genuine, hand made pizza!
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2014,11/16/2014,2,2,1,5,4>i LOOOVE this coffee!!!!!  You can't go wrong when you buy this coffee...promise!  My personal favorite with the Maple Bacon, but just bought the pumpkin spice and I think will be a close contender.  If you are not able to visit the Black Owl cafe, do not worry!  You can find their delicious coffee at several local stores in Kalamazoo.  Sawall's always has a great selection!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/18/2014,11/15/2014,1,4,2,4,3>Well a Burger in a Pub is standard fare usually but a burger at O'Duffy's with Kobe meat is phenomenal. Tried as a Mushroom with Swiss, I can't remember a better burger served on an small bun which seemed better than most. The burger was perfectly cooked medium and the side of mashed potatoes was probably more calories than I could handle. Served with carrot sticks I felt the side was needed but whoa it definitely was not at all. The apple crisp for my companion was only so so but she felt it should've had vanilla ice cream (biased opinion).  I saw it as huge and  quite uniquely put together with pomegranate seeds and perfectly spiced. Service was  OK but she was more worried her sidework than us. Try the Guinness beer poured perfectly.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/24/2013,11/14/2014,31,115,2,6,3>This is a window-sized business in the hallway between The Union and Irving's Market. It is an extension of The Union, and managed by the same Millenium Restaurant Group.They change the menu daily and post it on Facebook early in the morning. There is always a featured panini ready to be put on the press, and a couple of extra styles. Two or three kinds of soup, and salad. It takes a full five minutes or so to get the panini ready, so don't expect fully fast-food levels of speed.I tried the Ahi tuna and spicy kimchee panini. It was good, but nothing really to write home about. A little smaller than I was hoping, and kind of messy to eat. But I will definitely keep an eye on their menu and eat there from time to time.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2013,11/13/2014,62,64,2,2,2>Great running store that is involved in running community! They sponsor free runs twice a week. Wednesday urban herd, and Sunday dirty herd trail run. Staff is knowledgable. I dissagree with another reviewer about never having sales. Student athletes get a discount and also people involved in local running clubs, kalamazoo area runners, tri cats, etc. they also have a great sidewalk sale. I've done runners yoga at the store, and started and ended many long runs at Gazelles through the beyond and summer safari training program. (gazelles is a sponsor of summer safari) gazelles employees have led classes on good form running and nutrition. This is easily the best running store in West Michigan.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2014,11/12/2014,23,34,6,14,9>Words fail to describe how much I love the food at Shawarma King. But maybe, actions might help convey my love: I moved to Kalamazoo about two weeks ago, and I've already eaten at Shawarma King THREE times! Why do I love SK ever so? First, because they've got authentic Middle Eastern fare! Having grown up in Dubai, I'm a little bit of an Arabic/Lebanese food snob (that's probably an understatement). Their hummus doesn't taste like it came out of a tin; the meat is perfectly flavoured and cooked to perfection and the falafels are perfection squared.Pros:+ Super authentic, delicious food! + Try the: falafels, hummus, chicken & beef shish kafta, and/or fattoush salad and OBVS the chicken shawarma+ AMAZING SERVICE+ Budget friendly+ They do a gluten-free selection which is amazing!+ Service is fastCons:- Their tahini is hit and miss. There are days where it's watered down and days where it's amazing.- Biryani wasn't as flavourful as I'd want it to be.- Babaganoush isn't super aubergine-y.At this point you may be thinking, if there are 2.5/3 cons, how can you still give this place 5 stars? And it's really because I'm slightly biased and I've never had Middle Eastern food this authentic anywhere across the US in the last six years (be it in Ann Arbor, New York or anywhere else).TRY IT. You won't regret it. The service is super friendly, the atmosphere is chill and the food is amazing.P.S. Don't forget to order the falafels! :)
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/26/2014,11/11/2014,13,29,,2,1>Stopped for breakfast after my hubby heard about it. Everything was good.  All the portions were large, omelets are 5 eggs.  Big is not always good.  I would have loved a 2 egg omelet.  You are paying for the large portions.  Will probably not be back.  $18 for breakfast for two, 1 egg bacon hash browns and toast and a chorizo scramble.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/5/2014,11/10/2014,14,11,1,3,4>Yum! Loved the macaroni and cheese, the bbq sauce and the beef brisket. I was not a fan of the buffalo chicken sandwich only because it had a spicy bite that even the bleu cheese dressing that came with it did not tame enough for me.  But overall, a great experience and we will definitely stop there for take-out again soon. Anxious to try the pulled pork.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2014,11/9/2014,0,2,2,3,3>Just had dinner at Comensoli's and want you to know the Chicken Piccata was great.  The sauce was perfect, the spaghetti side was perfect.  The Caesar salad was crisp, not necessarily the traditional salad but very flavorful.  No anchovies, but had not requested them.  They have daily specials which are a reason to go.  Today, Tuesday was 1/2 off on selected wines.  We had a chianti from the list which was very good.  All in all a  wonderful experience.  Comensoli's will be our  new go to Italian restaurant.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2014,11/8/2014,26,27,2,3,3>GO HERE. My husband and I went for breakfast yesterday and LOVED it. Fresh menu, wonderful service and atmosphere, and DELICIOUS food. Reminds me of First Watch, back home (Akron), but a fun local business instead of a chain. We are so sad to be moving in a month now that we have found our new favorite breakfast place. Jason said he would go here over Bob Evans any day, and if you know Jason, that speaks volumes about this place!  The only critique we had was that the biscuits were a little tough, and hard to cut with a fork, but they seem really receptive and willing to work on things like that to make their restaurant better!
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2014,11/7/2014,72,86,4,3,3>Admittedly, my first stop to this location was a pit stop for a bike ride...so bear with me. I for whatever reason didn't happen to notice whether there was any seating inside, but the important point to me was that there were a number of chairs and a couple tables outside so that the interested patron could enjoy MacKenzie's uber-bingeable butter cookies while sipping on an iced coffee on a warm weekend morning. In that respect, this was a great pit stop indeed!The gentleman helping us behind the counter was maybe having a bad day before we walked in, and he wasn't particularly thrilled to help us get an iced coffee when we asked him about whether they had any. However, thankfully, once we started to strike up a conversation he shook off the grumpiness and became quite friendly. I will definitely stopping back, and I hope to get a better sense of the service as well as the rest of the menu.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2014,11/6/2014,16,78,1,4,4>I feel like I come in here nearly weekly for something! HUGE selection of cards, and the staff seems to always be willing to help you navigate that. About a million birthday cards, and any other occasion- some really great romantic cards (hint hint, guys?) The cards do range in price, and some are not labeled. The fancy-schmancy cards seem like they can get up to $8-10; I'd ask whoever is working for a pointer in the direction of the lower-priced cards, to be honest! You can find ones in there generally around $1.75-$3, and there's usually a clearance rack outside (20 cents, I think).Other than the great cards, there's gifts and trinkets of all kinds- Kalamazoo/ Michigan related and other cute stuff. Definitely would be a great place to stop in for a hostess gift or any last minute gift. They also have wrapping paper and stationery. Very cool store, I have a hard time sticking to just getting a card when I go in.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2014,11/5/2014,0,5,1,3,3>The Air Zoo is a local gem that cannot be beat.  We are lucky to have such a unique place with a great location in a town of our size.  They also have a great restoration program that does outreach with local at-risk youth.  If you are part of a service organization (I am a part of Rotary) call and ask someone to come and speak to your club as they had a lot of great information for us.  I will always recommend this to someone out of town as a great local place.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2013,11/4/2014,0,25,1,3,3>Irving's is an amazing place to have lunch. The salad bar has a ton of choices and the soups are out of this world. The potato bar is delicious as is the mac and cheese. It is pricey, but you get what you pay for here. On the weekends, the selection is not as good but the food never disappoints. It can be difficult to find parking but it is worth trying if you are in the area.
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/4/2014,11/3/2014,0,3,1,2,3>Chocolatea is life. I've never been to such a friendly business. The atmosphere is off the chain and the drinks are liquid heaven!

<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2014,11/2/2014,4,12,1,3,3>I have been to the crows nest several times never tire of the menu.  Always love the banana bread French toast, and anything with the pulled pork is awesome. A few days ago when I went I ordered the breakfast burrito, loved it and the sauce it came with. Fun place to go, good food for foodies
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2013,11/1/2014,15,53,3,7,3>In a tiny building on King Highway, nestled between auto parts stores and junkyards, Papa's Italian Sausage is the very image of inconspicuousness. I drove by this business a hundred times before I even noticed that it was there. The kitchy, dated sign and unassuming storefront plead to the passerby "ignore me!"Once I DID notice this business, I was quickly hooked. Their menu's a little long, but you can skip most of it. I advise you to focus on the following:- Italian Sausage sandwich (your choice of their homemade hot or mild sausage - the hot is pretty mild) with onions and peppers- Meatball Sub (the best in town with Papa's homemade meatballs and homemade sauce, on a soft, chewy bun, topped with cheese)- Papa's Pizza Sub (chopped sausage, olives, mushrooms, onions, peppers, provolone, pizza sauce, and pepperoni)- Chili (homemade, not too spicy, rich and hearty on a winter afternoon)- Bella Supreme (homemade sausage, Italian beef, provolone, peppers, onions)The dining room is tiny; the biggest table seats four snugly. They're busy during lunch -- it seems like every garage and shop in the neighborhood sends a runner to Papa's for takeout -- but the line moves quickly. Order at the counter, have a seat, and stay hungry because you'll be eating within minutes.And the prices! Only three menu items cost more than $6, and you don't want those anyway.If you've missed the first quarter century of Papa's Italian Sausage, don't let another quarter century go by without getting to know this hidden gem.

I was VERY impressed at their procedure once back in the room. The piercer, Spanky, was very thorough, making sure that I watched him pull everything straight from new packages, explaining the process, making sure that I saw him throwing the needle in the hazardous waste bin, changing gloves, etc. When I mentioned that this was the third time I was having this done, he stopped and asked why, wanting to make sure that the previous piercings hadn't been rejected or anything like that (they'd been taken out). I also spoke with Dylan about doing some coverups of older tattoos and he was very knowledgeable and helpful. I would absolutely not hesitate to go back.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2013,10/30/2014,37,9,1,5,3>My friends and I always end up at The Gatsby! It's the best spot in downtown Kalamazoo to DJ-dance. The swanky, intimate atmosphere makes you feel like you've walked into a hoppin' prohibition-era speakeasy. Also, there are some great bartenders here, but the guy who goes by the name "Squirrel," is particularly awesome!
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2014,10/29/2014,0,3,1,2,2>This is long overdue. I first had a small leak begin at our skylight. Advantage Roofing were the only ones who would come out to repair it immediately. Others were working on large projects and wouldn't even spare one worker a couple hours to work on ours. Then, they gave us an estimate on replacing the old skylight and installing the new. There were no hidden extras that came up. The job was exactly as quoted and the work finished promptly. We highly recommend them!
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2014,10/28/2014,6,20,1,3,3>Really good barbecue!  I was pleasantly surprised!  My husband and I had the ribs and the chicken and they were both very tasty!  As for sides we had the potato salad and the smoked pork Mac and cheese and they were super delicious!The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is that the service was lacking a bit.  We met some friends there and when they joined our waiter never came over and after our first beer didn't come back for an hour...not what I call great service!  But the food makes up for it!
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/1/2014,10/27/2014,4,5,1,2,2>Wonderful food at a reasonable price. The shrimp and clams were great. The current 7 beers are all outstanding...I will return for another "Flight" of six. Can't wait for the coming chocolate stout! We will return as soon as possible.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,10/26/2014,0,1,2,3,3>Delicious, classic pizza. Their veggie pizza is my favorite which tastes great with the fresh garlic. My daughters love the classic cheese pizza and the tomato sauce tastes lovely. Above all, the owners are super friendly and make it easy to go back. I prefer buying this pizza over more well known brands and my friends have caught onto this restaurant as well.
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2013,10/25/2014,0,6,,3,1>I compare all pizza to this place.  Thin cracker crust that holds up to toppings, good ground sausage and the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is i think they need more cheese so extra cheese solves that problem.  Their menu is small, mostly pizza and if they have subs they are few.
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/17/2014,10/24/2014,124,217,1,3,3>A wonderful family owned establishment that has amazing and caring staff.  When I first moved to MI a friend recommended this boarding facility.  They're extremely accomodating and understanding of my work and vacation travel (and I do travel often).  Everytime I drop my dog off, she is so happy to see the staff.  It is comforting to know that when I'm traveling, she is well taken care of.
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2014,10/23/2014,196,453,3,2,2>One of only a couple vets in the Portage area, this one turned out to be the most convenient based on locale to the new homestead.  The team at SRAH truly care about animals and are very open to your family's needs (ie. meds, pick-up, etc.)  They offer lodging with flexible pick-up times on Sunday.  Basically, if someone's there and you missed your pick-up window, don't be afraid to knock, they will try and accommodate.  SRAH also sends out vaccination reminders.  If you're looking for a new vet or recently moved into the area, I'd have no problem recommending SRAH to anyone.I will mention that the place is a little hard to spot off of the main road so keep your eyes peeled.  Also, since I need to complain about something it seems in every review ;), I will say that their kennel rates are a little on the high side if you shop around.
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2014,10/22/2014,112,126,,4,3>This is a cute little place and has a homey and inviting atmosphere.The staff here is very friendly. I notice a general regard for every customer from all of the staff. Our waitress, Sarah, also took the time to speak to each of her customers on a personal level even when the restaurant was nearly filled to capacity. The menu has a standard list of breakfast and lunch items. There are a couple of popular unique items that appeal to meat lovers. I don't fault smaller local establishments for maintaining the staples rather than diversifying into items that simply don't sell to their target demographic.I had a veggie omelette. It was tasty and best of all not too oily. The hash browns were also cooked just the way I like them. My son had a ham and cheese omelette and really enjoyed it. If you're looking for a friendly little spot where you'll be greeted with a smile and a good plate of food then I definitely recommend stopping in at the Daily Grind.
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2013,10/21/2014,95,94,1,9,5>Five stars because of the pho.This is currently the ONLY PLACE in Kalamazoo to get pho. I was a little hesitant to try it. It is, after all, a Vietnamese rather than Thai dish, and the picture they have in the menu looks absolutely nothing like pho. The picture lies. It's totally pho. I thought it was pretty much on par with the standard pho shops that litter Northern California and was impressed.I come here often with coworkers, and the service is always friendly, the place is always clean, and everyone enjoys their food (even when they get something besides pho).
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2014,10/20/2014,8,16,3,3,3>First time ever being here. And I have to say I wish I would have came in a long time ago. Because I love it already. It's currently not that busy so I got my food in very short time: 6.17min (yes I timed it)I had 2 over easy eggs, has browns, bacon, and wheat toast. It I was some of the best breakfast that I've had in a long time. The atmosphere of the place is pretty good. Has a mom pop kinda vibe. Decor appears homemade. Which I personally like. Being that this place is right outside campus. And on my way to campus it appears I will be spending more breakfast/brunches here. The stag is quick and polite by far. Being that it's a small place may be a helpful factor in this, but non the less they are efficient at their jobs. I recommend the place to anybody wanting a place near campus to get some breakfast.

I remember skipping class, I mean going there during high school and the server suggested the potato omelette and insisted that I get the chocolate chip pancakes with whipped cream. That day and that meal will forever be engrained in my food palate. I crave it every now and then but my schedule just doesn't seem to match up with their hours. Whenever I drive by they seem pretty busy so they're definitely doing something right.

I highly recommend Medawar and will be shopping here for future jewelry.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/11/2014,10/17/2014,47,73,4,3,4>This is the newest restaurant in the East Egg breakfast/lunch franchise, situated in Kalamazoo's Milwood neighborhood. The restaurant, open for three days now, has received a warm welcome from the neighborhood, packing tables with the families that live nearby. This one is in a former Wendy's store, and unfortunately, it shows. It is not as cute as the other locations, though it has the adorable egg-tile floor, bright walls, and wall hangings (bonus: brightly upholstered chairs). However, the remnants of Wendy's that remain are everywhere: dirty windows, small tables, torn down menu signs, ugly tile near the kitchen.The food was pretty good; I had the breakfast hash, and it was out super quickly. However, the chef forgot to add the veggies, so he had to remake it (I attribute that to the newness of the place). The waitstaff was super friendly and attentive. The menu has lots of choices (and, sadly, lots of grammatical errors). This is a good addition to this neighborhood.

After checking their website to confirm gluten free options, we were on our way.We went at 3:30 pm on Saturday thinking it would be less crowded, but it seems everyone wanted pizza because the place was packed. It was also loud, so if you are noise sensitive, like me, be aware.When we walked in the door there was a line which gave us time to re-discuss our order, which was good because when it was our turn I felt pressured. There were about twenty employees behind the counter and five of them were asking me questions at the same time. It was incredibly overwhelming.After we had picked toppings for our two pizzas from their bar, we paid and Mr. MVP waited just two minutes while I went outside and found a dirty table. Our pizza, we quickly discovered was very hot, but not cut very well. The gluten free crust would not cut with the plastic cutlery provided, so we ended up tearing pieces off. Both pizzas were severely under topped to the point where at times we were eating plain crust with no cheese or vegetables. They both had been sprinkled with sea salt and oregano, so they were ridiculously salty.Blaze does have a good concept, but this specific location needs to calm down and focus on its individual customers and their orders. Their gluten free crust is actually pretty good and the selection of toppings is healthy.We might go back.

We split everything and still wound up taking quite a bit of food home. Turkish pizza, fattoush, and Lebanese lamb ... sooooooo good!I don't know how well these recipes conform to traditional expectations so I can't speak to that, but I can tell you, I've never had one dish here that I did not enjoy, and dinner on this night was particularly delicious.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2014,10/14/2014,12,2,1,3,3>Rupert's is a place for atmosphere and for beer. Between their 197lb Great Dane to their rustic atmosphere, it is the most communal bar in town.The building is in an interesting triangular shape, and it keeps people in front of the bar or at the tables in front of its stage. Speaking of which, they host a number of quality bands, but they're usually never too loud (and if they are, take your brew and your friends outside to enjoy the evening). They offer a number of original beers, but the "double hIghPA" is their most flavorful and most distinguished. Their "Peanut Butter Porter" is pretty polarizing: people either fall in love with it or scoff at the idea of a peanut butter beer.Take advantage of their deals: the bar is criticized by some in the community (mostly by, but not completely, my fellow poor college students) for its expensive beers, but on Thursdays each beer is $3.50!
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2013,10/13/2014,2,10,2,4,3>Whenever I have some extra cash I like going to Bold for dinner -always. The staff are so friendly and really touch hard on great customer service.  The food is always great and there are always extra employees around to grab your plate right when you are finished so it's not just sitting in front of you.  Great location and pretty views, this restaurant is one of the best in Kzoo!
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2014,10/12/2014,66,38,3,2,2>Homey, country atmosphere (without being trashy) mixed with good quality food and drinks.  I like this restaurant because they do what they do well without taking themselves too seriously.My wife and I went with another couple prior  to a party.  I love their pizza (one of the best thin crust pizzas in the area), but wheat has given me problems, so I ordered the 6oz steak.  The steak was adequate; not nearly as good as the pizza, but came without the stomach issues.  I wish they would have committed more to the spices - it was unevenly spiced, but still ok.The minestrone soup was blah.  The waitress, a vegetarian, warned of ham in the soup.  That part didn't bother me, but the bland taste did.  More of a split pea with ham than minestrone.  I was happy that I could get green beans (fresh) cooked without butter.My wife ordered the salmon, which was REALLY good.  It was moist without being greasy and cooked to perfection.  We will most likely come back (hopefully when there is not freezing rain on the surrounding country roads), and I will get the salmon.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2014,10/11/2014,34,16,1,2,2>So good! Italian Beef is the best!the BBQ half or quarter chicken is also the best around.Also known for many classic "Chicago" dogs, house made fries, sausage, burgers and many other options.I have been there many times, and it is mostly a take out style joint with just a couple tables and a stand up counter. The food is LEGIT!
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2014,10/10/2014,8,1,1,1,1>If you enjoy large productions, this is the place for you. Miller does it's best job to accommodate groups, and to bring the largest productions they can to Kalamazoo. Phantom, Wicked, Beauty and the Beast have all stopped by recently, and more are bound to come. The sound is nice (not perfect), the lighting is ideal, and it does not seem to matter where you are seated for getting a good view. For the annoying things....parking is nice, but could be better. I also am not a huge fan of some years having no major productions. While its true I may be judging what makes a production good, I am not a theater man, and do not know what defines a good production. However, if my friends are not familiar with it, I am counting it as "not famous."
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2014,10/9/2014,7,13,1,2,2>Broken iPhone screens are inevitable for a lot of people, myself included. Should you drop and break your iPhone screen, what are you to do? Drive to Grand Rapids to the Apple Store and hope you can get into the Genius Bar to get it looked at?Kalamazoo has needed an Apple Store for a long time but sadly, we don't have one. Luckily, we've just gained a Simply Mac store. Simply Mac is the closest thing to being in an Apple Store without actually being in an Apple Store. The decor looks strikingly familiar with the exception of the color theme. The employees are extraordinarily friendly and glad to assist you in all things Apple. They accept trade-ins as well as sell pre-owned iPhones, iPads, iPods, accessories, and of course, macs. The Simply Mac store also has their own version of an Apple Genius Bar, which is made up of Apple certified technicians to service any Apple device regardless of warranty status which means no more driving to Grand Rapids to get your iPhone, iPod, Mac, or any other apple device looked at and/or fixed. If you live in the Kalamazoo area and need your Apple Devices fixed, I would definitely recommend checking out the Simply Mac Store in Portage.

<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/23/2014,10/7/2014,91,14,1,3,3>Delicious and memorable experience. My wife surprised me with date night at Webster's and it is absolutely delicious. I don't think I've had better steak anywhere and I've been traveling the U.S. For more than five years. The ribeye was melt in your mouth delicious. Expect to pay a premium for the experience ($150-$200 for two) but know that you'll get fantastic service from the staff and a delicious meal.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/26/2013,10/6/2014,7,26,1,2,2>After reading several reviews about this place I decided I needed to check it out. The day after Christmas seemed like a great day to do so. They were not busy on this day which was nice because I was hungry! The menu was short but to the point so I decided to try the all meat omelet...plus jalapeños. My wife ordered the ham and Swiss omelet. The food came out quickly. We began to eat our omelets and realized they has put the wrong cheese and jalapeños on my omelet. This wasn't a huge deal but it took us eating each other's omelets for a moment to realize it.  Other than that mix up, the food was good as well as the service. I would go to Bucky's again but not before trying out some of the other local breakfast spots first.
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2014,10/5/2014,10,43,3,2,2>This store literally has everything you need to decorate your home and then some. AND they have everything in every shade, color, and variety you can imagine. Holiday decor? Yup, Halloween and Christmas out already....in early August. I always find something here :)Recommendation: I have two rolling suitcases from here and they are a great bargain, cheap, fun prints (easy to find in baggage claim), and they are light (super important when flying and only allowed a certain weight) highly recommend!

<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2014,10/2/2014,4,10,3,4,3>Exactly what you want from a record shop: knowledgeable (without being snobby) employees, and an excellent selection to dig through. One of the things that makes smaller-town record shopping great is that it's just not as picked through, like places in Chicago might be. Follow them on Facebook to get occasional updates of new-used arrivals and if you can't make it in right away to pick something up that you just plain must have, they'll hold it for you! The only downside is usually in regard to my bank account as I almost assuredly can't leave without buying something. Oh and the new location is absolutely fantastic!
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2014,10/1/2014,3,37,3,3,2>I have been to Tiffany's many times over the years.  Their selection is amazing in spirits, beer/cider and wine.  They also have a nice area for cheeses, olive oils and a deli.  I have never tried the deli but everything looks good.  They have a cigar humidor downstairs that I have been in a couple times as well.They have big wine sales a couple times a year.  They have a large selection ranging from $5 up to several hundreds of dollars per bottle.  Most of the staff is very knowledgable and friendly.  The always know where things are and offer great advise and suggestions.  The owner on the other hand, hasn't been the nicest when I interacted with him.  I've also seen him yelling at customers and employees.  I can't knock the business overall but just hope you don't have to deal with the owner.I would highly suggest Tiffany's for your adult beverage pleasure.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,9/30/2014,7,1,,2,3>We love riding our bikes down with the kids. The nearby intersection is a little dicey but riding past all the cars searching for a spot is worth it. My husband and I live the Pasty's at Grandpa's Pasty and we let the kids run around with a couple of dollars to find their own favorite vendor for breakfast. Our daughter loves the croissants at Victorian bakery - she is a regular there and if they are running low on her favorite they always put one aside for her. I always get a coffee at Simpatico - and for $1 it is a great deal! The biggest downside is the music - it can be a little loud and raucous. We love seeing friends and meeting new people at the farmers market. Overall the market has a wonderful positive environment and we go every Saturday.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,9/29/2014,12,2,,4,3>In terms of the ambiance at Black Owl I'd say this is one of the trendiest spots in Kalamazoo to get a cup of coffee. The decor is rustic and reminds me of a cozy cabin in Northern Michigan. Also, their bathroom is AWESOME. Sounds silly but seriously, check it out. Their menu is incredible and they offer a wide variety of coffees, teas, and sodas. Their pizza is delicious but I've heard their other food is just as great.The only thing this place is lacking is space and longer hours.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2014,9/28/2014,0,2,1,3,4>Los Amigos is a wonderful family restaurant. The building itself is well decorated, clean, and comfortable. However, it is only when one steps behind the veneer of the restaurant that the magic truly happens. And yes, the magic is the food and drink. This establishment has delicious entrees, chips and salsa that come with every meal, and a variety of drinks. The staff, too, is wonderful. All of the times I've been here, whether picking up my food or dining in, I have had a wonderful experience. Kind, courteous, and charming, I believe Los Amigos has some of the best servers in Kalamazoo. If you want to know what to get, I would highly suggest the chicken chimichanga dinner. It is prepared well and the rice it to die for. On top of it all, it only costs ten dollars!If you want good, affordable Mexican food in Kalamazoo, head on over to Los Amigos. You will not be disappointed.

<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2014,9/25/2014,26,30,1,4,5>Great service, great food, great atmosphere!! A manager of some sort, came over to check on our dinner experience. He informed us that they serve Michigan sourced ingredients! Sweet!!! They change menu every 6 months. I really like supporting local farms.  I had the French dip, a few different beers, and German chocolate cake. Holy shhh--crap! That was so good!! I mean, REALLY good! French dip was perfect, the dessert was even better. The chocolate was drizzling off the top. Very decadent! I'm obsessed with the fact that 1.00 of the proceeds goes to ALS foundation if you order the IPA Wanda. So, do yourself a favor and order one for the night. It's damn good too! The story behind that is very compelling. The brewers grandmother died of ALS so he came up with a beer in her honor and they the company decided to donate a dollar for every beer sold. I'm so happy I decided to come here tonight. It was a great experience. Great for kids too! I forgot to mention.
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/8/2014,9/24/2014,8,21,,3,3>This is, hands down, the BEST Asian restaurant in southwest Michigan, if not the entire state! Everything I have had on the menu has been amazing. The chicken satay and rangoons are my favorite appetizers. The Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef are must-haves. They always have specials that are out-of-this-world as well. I would live at this place if I could. Best food around! On a side note, if you want take-out, make sure you call well in advance as they take reservations for take-out.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2014,9/23/2014,14,12,1,4,4>This past week I had an energy healing. When I went in I felt exhausted and had just had a passing out spell at the store, before showing up. I have multiple health issues.  hitial hernia multiple gallstones, gerd and gateropieses that does not allow me to be a candidate for hernia surgery.  I also share a rare genetic disorder the same one my daughter has.  Healing ways connected with me and worked with me I as a health blogger thought this is very cool and offered to do a review for her. I knew right away that Healing ways in Kalamazoo Michigan would be a great match and I had no idea how talented and gifted a energy healer could be.  In-fact I knew very little about Reiki other then it's about releasing negative energy and I had a lot more of it then I thought I guess. The lady I seen is very easy to talk with and made you feel at ease. She very gifted here's why when I went into my session I was exhausted physically, emotionally and spiritually. My life at the moment has been a roller-coaster which is why I haven't had much time to blog lately.  I was ready to go to bed when I got home go to sleep and start my day over I was done for the day. I had explained all that to her before the session. She placed her healing hands on pressure parts on my body such as my head and shoulders heart and feet and arms.  I was laying on a table clothes with a blanket over my body for comfort to relax and as she did her healing I felt a I could feel the positive, healing energy moving around within me...and that it felt comforting and  peaceful. Which I wasn't expecting I also felt refreshed. When I was finished I felt like I had taken a power nap, wonderful lady who is very easy to talk with does spiritual counseling energy healing and massages. I think everyone should give energy healing a try at least once.  The location is off a path and is in a woodland type of setting located right here in Kalamazoo and it's just very calming environment a great way to get away from the stress of the world for a hour or two.  I wish her new business all positive energy that she's been able to pass on to me and hopefully Healing Ways will gain many more new clients.  If you're looking for things to do in Kalamazoo, Michigan to get away from the stress of life for a few hours this is the place to just BE! After all who wouldn't want to feel rested and peaceful? as a mom and women not feeling restful and peaceful is my number one complaint and if you don't live in Michigan no worries there is distant healing as well.

The table was set and candles lit for a man who was going to propose to a woman but she never showed. Bummer of a story, but I appreciated the ambient mood setting nonetheless. Food was excellent. I had the braised beef shortrib and she had the chicken tortelli. Well prepared, presented nicely, and tasted great.We finished with the chocolate sampler platter dessert. Again, very nicely presented and was so sweet and good. I was very happy they wrote happy birthday in chocolate on the plate. Nice touch and made my date very happy. I will definitely come back to try other dishes.

I have been a fan of Sarkozy since my son was just a pup (20 years ago). I still visit to get the breads but there is lunch. Although it's a limited menu it's all good. From house made personal size pizza's to sandwiches and soup.Today I had home made bean soup which was lovely! The flavor was out of this world good with fresh herbs, white beans, carrots, onions AND you get scrumptious rye crackers to enjoy (make sure to bring home a bag to enjoy with cheese). And best kept secret- come here to work! There is plenty of  bright light, free wifi , jazz music and lots of room to spread out!
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,9/20/2014,21,20,3,3,2>When I first drove by Mega-Bev, I was curious if the area really needed a liquor store that was that large. After shopping there I realize, yes it does.They have an excellent selection of beer, wine and the hard stuff along with mixers. But what I really appreciate is the insight of the employees. If you want to try a new bourbon, tell them your price range and they will find one you will love. Their staff are truly experts. They also do not mark up their liquor above state min like other specialty beer and wine stores do which is nice considering how high the MI alcohol tax is.No matter what you choose to wet your whistle, you will find it at the Mega Bev at a fair price.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2013,9/19/2014,24,9,,7,2>Rustica would be right at home in any big city dining scene. The food is fresh and seasonal. For dinner last week, I started with gazpacho, which had a great kick to it. I had a New York strip steak special (at least I'm 90% sure that's what cut it was). Cooked perfectly. Dinner was a corn tart. Creative but not my favorite dessert of all time. Best part was... My parents were in town and paying, so we ordered off the stash wine list. Also excellent is the lamb shank and the baked fish. Truthfully, I've never had a bad or even mediocre meal at Rustica. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Kalamazoo.

<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2012,9/17/2014,9,10,1,6,2>I love cheeseburgers and Lou Nisker's Char-grill probably serves the best burger in Kalamazoo.  The restaurant has a great local character.  There's a good chance that you'll come in to find Lou Nisker himself on duty.  The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating in the spirit of an independent business. They're always willing to deal with the unique requests of customers and quirks of how they like their food.As for the food itself, I confess that I only eat the burgers and fries.   Lou's marinade of his patty makes for some of the most juicy, flavorful burgers I've ever had.  They offer numerous fresh toppings and you can pick and choose as much as you want out of traditional burger toppers.  I always ask for a side of the homemade aioli sauce to dip my fries and it's great.  Everything is fresh and your food only hits the grill after you order it.  Despite that, they do a great balance of making fresh, made-to-order food and getting it out quickly.  As for other menu items, my wife enjoys their veggie burgers a great deal and they have options for trout, chicken, beef-a-lo, and numerous sides and soups.  As a final bonus, they stock Plainwell ice cream and that's always a treat for my son.You can tell this is one of my favorite local restaurants.  To show I'm not a total slappy, I'll offer three caveats.  One, this is delicious, fresh food and it's not bargain basement cheap.  A premium entrée, side, and drink will cost right around $10.  Second, as a local small business, they do their best to staff appropriately but if you catch them in an unexpected rush, you might have to wait a couple minutes to order. Last, the menu is extensive and a bit complicated.  If you're not a regular, it might take a minute to sort out.Overall, I love this place and hope it remains a Kalamazoo institution for a long time.

Friday Fish dinners, all you can eat dinners, and take out orders available.
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2013,9/15/2014,5,25,2,6,3>This is a hidden gem in Kalamazoo! The food is absolutely phenomenal. A group of us went on a Saturday and we decided to dine in. The place is really small and could probably fit about 20 people max, but don't quote me on that. I got the chicken and beef satay, which was absolutely delicious. The peanut sauce was absolutely to die for. We also got the roti kana and the beef rendang which were both outstanding. I would have given this place a 5 star, but the service was not very great.

Desserts were heavenly.Service was great. I do agree with another reviewer that the tables are a little close.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2014,9/13/2014,0,19,2,6,5>Good golly the pizza's good. Also a little pricey, in comparison to all the "$10 deals" going around at all the big chains. But those pizzas have nothing on Erbellis. Seriously. The erbbie bread is phenomenally good, I could eat the biggest one by myself. Their toppings are all delicious, they'll pretty much work with whatever you want, and they've got great service. We typically get carryout rather than dine-in or delivery, but a while ago we got delivery and it was totally the wrong pizza. We called back, hoping they'd at least make us a new pizza for no charge. Well, they did that, but also came back and delivered the new one. I was super impressed! Maybe that's standard for a delivery order, but I thought it was great.

<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/5/2014,9/11/2014,38,38,1,4,4>A legend returns!  When I was growing up in the Battle Creek area, Mr. Presidents is the place where all the "cool" folks went to get their party on!  I remember back in high school driving past that place on a Friday night, envious of how happy and care fee everyone looked as they waited in line to go in, listening to the sounds of the party inside...So I was excited when I heard someone had re-opened it!  My co-worker beat me down there by a day, and he convinced me to check it out.  SO the next day, he and I ventured forth.First impressions, the outside looks nearly exactly like it did in the 80s, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A brief moment of confusion as I figured out which door was the actual entrance.  Once inside, the first thing to hit me was the "feel".  It definitely has a laid back, lounge ambiance to it.  Lots of gorgeous wood, polished brass, and gleaming mirrors.  Old school class.  Smooth but upbeat jazz playing in the air.  The main bar sits just pass the entry.  The bartender was immediately attentive, professional, and friendly.  She was a joy to interact with.We sat at the bar.  It was relatively empty, as to be expected being so new.  There was a slightly rowdy table of 10-12 middle aged women celebrating a birthday in an adjoining room.  They were having a grand time and the martinis were flowing!   Their waiter seemed very attentive and even entertaining.The food was really good.  I had the rib tips and my friend had the brisket sandwich.  The tips were tender and very flavorful.  Nice sized portion for the price.  I was told the brisket was well worth the wait.  Which brings us to the only "ding" on the visit.  I know they are still working out the kinks so I don't hold this against them, but the food was really slow in coming.  Considering there was only one other table in the place (at the time of ordering) it shouldn't have taken that long.  But as I said it's a tiny complaint.  And in their defense, the owner came out to apologize for the delay and gave my friend the sandwich on the house.  we were both pleased.Overall I would recommend giving Mr. Presidents a look.  So far it looks like they are headed in the right direction!
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/26/2014,9/10/2014,19,25,1,3,4>Boatyard is a very laid-back and relaxed nano brewery. Their stock is constantly changing and often they'll sell cash out of their brewing tanks direct. The atmosphere is recovered factory/light industrial with brickwork and exposed beams. It may be a challenge in the deep wintertime, I suspect the building may have the R value of construction paper. The prices are higher than some other of the breweries, and remarkable for being priced this way on "the other side of the tracks" which continues to plague cities like Kalamazoo. The beer itself is quite good, lots of variety and their homemade root beer is absolutely fantastic. The staff are very friendly and kind and the pace here seems slower than many other breweries in town. You should know that the approach and parking lot has some significant erosion and pothole action going on. Drive slowly and carefully, and you'll be fine. Don't let the outside appearance dissuade you from trying this nano brewery. It's worth it.
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/8/2014,9/9/2014,0,5,,4,3>Visited this place for the first time last night and was amazed by the friendly service and fantastic food. Prices are a tad high for pasta but the ravioli (which changes daily) was homemade and very good. Partner had the manicotti with meatballs that had perhaps the best bolognese I've ever tasted. Highly recommend, especially for this one horse town.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,9/8/2014,0,7,,2,3>The Beer Exchange has a unique architecture and physical environment that fosters a relaxed, warm feel. The unique way of ordering beer makes drinking with friends a blast. There are pool tables available as well as a few pinball machines and a dart board for fun n' games with company. In addition to the wide range of beers, the exchange also offers a variety of bourbon and a bourbon flight that is at a great price. There is also a quality menu and the food is respectable. Try the nachos or the french onion soup with stuffing (you won't be disappointed).
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2013,9/7/2014,9,30,1,4,6>Went because it was voted the best burger in Kalamazoo. I would say it's the best burger in Michigan. Lots of non-traditional burger choices including vegan. I got the Watson -burger stuffed with chorizo, topped with pepper jack cheese and chipotle pesto- and added a fried egg. It was brilliantly cooked and served on a perfectly toasted bun - a detail a lot of places overlook. I can't wait to go back and try the peanut butter bacon burger. I simply must have one!
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,9/6/2014,0,17,3,3,4>This is a quick 10 minute brisk-walk from my office and I am so, so glad. These are grilled cheese on steroids, creatively decadent food that has me checking their website obsessively on Monday mornings waiting for the weekly menu to be posted (sorry, my employer). This past excessively miserable winter, their soups kept me coming back--in particular the Guiness beef stew, broccoli cheddar ale, and mint-pea. Watch their website for the pork belly supreme to appear, then plan an early lunch; they run out every day. I may have a Panini Express problem.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2014,9/5/2014,23,34,7,7,8>Something's Brewing is one of my favourite Kalamazoo coffee houses! And their tuxedo mocha might have just displaced Starbucks' White Chocolate Mocha from its top spot on my favourite mocha list. PLUS: You've got to try their Latte Smoothies (Or Smoothie Lattes) - it's two shots of espresso, lots of ice cream, any coffee flavourings your heart desires, topped with a dollop of whipped cream. DO IT.Pros:+ Amazing mochas! (their tuxedo mocha uses both white and dark chocolate) + They use coffee ice cubes in their iced coffees, so they don't water down into an undrinkable dish water equivalent as the ice melts. + Super friendly service :)Cons:- If you're expecting a fast, in-and-out, grab-and-go, this isn't your place because it'll take a good five minutes to get your drink. Advice:Be nice, take in the nice small coffee house feel as you wait for your coffee. Oh, and do check into their little rewards tablet because one sip of that sweet iced coffee nectar and you'll be hooked!
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/26/2013,9/4/2014,23,7,1,4,2>As a WMU alum and former Kalamazoo resident this place is my comfort food. I lived only a 5-minute walk away from here so this was a staple at my house. Whether it the  big sesame chicken lunch on a Saturday afternoon study session or some ho fun noodles at 3am after a night on the town, this place always took care of me. Whenever I visit Kalamazoo, Campus Kitchen is always factored into my budget.As mentioned, some of my favorites are the sesame chicken platter (with white rice and crab rangoon) as well as the ho fun noodles with beef. The ho fun noodles are not on their regular take-home menu but is on a big dry-erase board in the building. The overall menu has changed a lot so, if you haven't been there in a while, take the time to look over the menu with some great additions like the ho fun, curry noodles, and some weird but delicious and spicy jalapeno chicken dish. Give the place a try and you won't be disappointed. Btw: take a bite of the creamy rangoon with a bite of sesame or orange chicken and a bite of the white rice. Perfect bite!
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2014,9/3/2014,6,62,1,5,4>Today I purchased my fifth pair of running shoes from Gazelle. On my first visit I went in planning to just try in shoes and Cass spent over an hour with me, watched me run, had me try over a dozen pairs of shoes on and ran behind me as I ran up and down the street with different shoes on.   In addition he examined my existing (big box store) running shoes in order to get me into the right shoe. I bought them on the spot that day, and had a little buyers remorse that night feeling I had overpaid even though I had received amazing service.  Later that night after a lot of online shopping I learned that I paid the exact same price as I could find online. From that day forward I've only "cheated" on Gazelle three times and all three were when Gazelle could no longer get a new pair of a shoe I really liked and had originally bought from Gazelle. Today's visit was no exception in that both by wife and I spent over an hour of personal one on one assistance and ended up with what I'm convinced is the perfect shoe for me.  We did get the added bonus of watching a shoplifter attempting to steal from the store and then be run down by a staff member (Cass as luck would have it). Humorous side note - don't shoplift from a store a block from the police station that is staffed by runners. In response to the previous review - Gazelle is an awesome RUNNING store. They really specialize in running and are truly the leaders of one of the worlds largest running communities. The do ok with other sports, but running is their thing. They do have sales, although they aren't the most common.  Keep in mind that you're buying higher-end running shoes. From a price perspective they are going to be a bit higher than your used to, but you get what you're paying for in both a quality product and amazing service.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2014,9/2/2014,0,2,1,5,5>We order delivery frequently from this company.  The service is amazing and the owner has called us back a couple of times to make sure we were pleased with the service. We order from them about one to two times a week.The food is to die for!  The italian sandwiches and cheesesteak are wonderful and perfectly sate the pregnancy cravings for Chicago over here!
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2014,9/1/2014,72,86,7,4,3>This restaurant is a sight for sore eyes if you live in the area, particularly out in Texas Township. I know there are a couple other options for breakfast within a reasonable drive of here, but Breakfast at Tiffiny's feels refreshing and it feels like I can run out to breakfast without making a proper "trip" "into town". Does that make me weird? Maybe.They serve Water Street Coffee, which is cool. Full disclosure: I've only eaten one meal there, and I suppose I should kick the tires a bit more, but that being said I enjoyed my meal. I had the pancake wrap, which basically takes most of the things you would normally order for breakfast and wraps them in a pancake. You can (and should) top the beast with syrup(!) to offset a little dryness in addition to the general lack of syrup in the dish. It looks like they have some "scramble"-type dishes that look really good, too. Someone go try one of those and report back!Our server was kind, attentive, generous with coffee refills. No complaints! I would love to see this place stick around and continue to liven up this part of Centre St.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2014,8/31/2014,16,78,1,5,5>I went here for my very first EVER pedicure, after my man so graciously bought one for me out of the blue, leaving a credit in my name! I wasn't 100% sure to expect, since I had never had a pedicure and never get manicures- I just do it myself. It was a great experience overall. I went for the deluxe version, why not. With that, I got the more standard stuff like shaping the nails and fixing the cuticles, plus a foot scrub, cream, hot towel wrap, plus the gross but so effective callus removal. My pedicurist (is that the right term??), Zazlow, was great. She suggested from the beginning to choose a particular brand of polish that would last the longest, but wasn't gel so I could remove it with acetone. She was chatty but not in an annoying way, she seemed very perceptive. I left feeling very pampered and my god, my feet were perfect!The overall atmosphere to me seemed relaxed, not overly done-up or ritzy. It was fairly quiet, but I was there later in the day. This is definitely a good spot to treat someone to for a gift!I walk to work every day, so likely the pedicure's effects will soon wear off... I may need to return soon!
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2014,8/29/2014,3,13,,3,3>Good!Haven't been here for a couple years and really enjoyed the meal here.I had the Pizza Margherita and it was delicious. They use a tomato sauce on the Margherita and looked like thin, broad slices of fresh mozzarella which covered the whole pizza. Just right amount of fresh basil. Crust was thin and crisp. The only small thing was the slightly too salty taste. Not sure where that came from. The sauce, maybe.I recommend this Pizza Margherita, much better than the one I had last week (at a different place).I also had a coffee which I thought was surprisingly good. Espresso is not available.  Not very expensive but the silverware is some of the worst cafeteria utensils you would ever see. One of my pet peeves.A good place, should do it again.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2014,8/28/2014,13,64,,2,3>My girlfriend and I went to Sushiya for an absolutely stellar meal. The ambience is pleasant and the seating is ample. The restaurant is quiet and very welcoming. The sushi was top notch. We ordered a 2 piece salmon sushi to start. The salmon was incredibly fresh and delicate, draped over perfectly prepared sticky rice. We completed our order of with a classic California roll, a yellowtail roll, and one special roll: the Crunch roll. All three were to die for. So incredibly fresh. The flavors meld together so perfectly. Of course, the California roll is prepared rice side out and contains crab (real crab), avocado, and cucumber. The yellowtail rolled was prepare the classic style (seaweed side out) and contained fresh yellowtail sashimi and sliced green onion. Finally, our personal favorite, the Crunch roll contained: shrimp tempura, cucumber, kampyo, and fried onion. Beyond tasty. I highly recommened and can't wait to go back. Also, beautiful location right downtown.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/13/2012,8/27/2014,1,41,1,3,2>I love going to Erbelli's.  The lunch buffet has a wide area of pizzas.  I get to try many different foods in one trip.  They normally have soup and some pasta on the bar as well.  Sometimes they have chicken fingers as well, which can break up the rest of the food I'm eating.I really like their Chicago style pizza.  They cook it long and slow.  Sauce on the top, just the way that I like it.Their Erby bread is very good as well.  The finacee loves it!I've had their subs before and they are pretty good as well.  They are big and very filling. I've only ordered pasta once.  I probably won't get it again.  The ziti I got was a little spicy for my tastes.The big drawback is the price.  Yes, it's gourmet pizza.  We don't get it often, so I can bear the price every once in a while.  If it was a few bucks cheaper, It would be a place I would eat at least once a week.I can't remember a bad meal there.  This Erbelli's is much bigger than the original one on Portage Rd.  If you are going out for dinner, get their early or expect crowds and lines.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,8/26/2014,31,115,1,3,4>Finally had a chance to try this place at the Kalamazoo Farmers Market, and it was well worth the 15 minutes of standing in line.I had a savory Huevos Rancheros crepe, which was full of amazing vegetarian chorizo from the People's Food Co-Op. Tons of flavor.We saw them preparing a Banana & Nutella dessert crepe which looked fantastic, and will be trying that next time.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2013,8/25/2014,62,64,1,3,2>Awesome service. I work near by and get the Avo veg about once a month. One time the manager made a mistake on my order and he gave me a free cookie, and a punch card for a sandwich next time. I will continue to support a local coffee and bagel shop that has quality baked goods, and treats customers right.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,8/24/2014,37,9,2,2,4>Talk about FUN & UNIQUE! I tried the quote-along movie "Clue," and beyond putting up subtitles here and there to get everyone talking, they gave us super-fun props to interact with the film. Ex: a flashlight to shine on the screen when characters in the movie were looking in a dark room, a bell to ring when the doorbell rang in the movie, and a confetti popper to pull when somebody shot a gun. Everyone in the theater was laughing -- what a way to connect the audience together! We had an awesome experience.Not to mention, they created a custom cocktail: The Mrs. Peacocktail. Which brings me to my next point: They have a FULL BAR, including LOTS of Michigan craft beers that you can order from your seat. Plus, they serve a full menu with wraps, pizzas, hamburgers, veggie burgers and more!What makes this theater really stand out is they're fun! Beyond the regular box-office hits, they also offer sing-alongs, 80s dance parties (where they show old music videos), indie and foreign films, classic movies and you can even suggest your favorite movie to be played on the big screen. Plus, their custom previews will always get you laughing :) Try it! And try their made-to-order, melt-in-your-mouth COOKIES! You won't be disappointed.

Franco himself works the counter, the ovens, the pizzas, which I think is awesome. He's a great guy if you get past his gruff exterior. We love their subs and calzones.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/23/2014,8/22/2014,23,10,,4,4>Stopped in with a friend around 11:00 the other night after seeing a show at Miller.  We just wanted to stop in somewhere for a chat, but didn't feel like going out to a bar or restaurant.  Insomnia cookies was a perfect choice.  We were the only ones in there, so when we walked in the door the staff was immediately attentive and friendly.  They went over the wide selection of cookies with us and every one of them sounded delicious, so it was a tough a choice.  We ordered a S'mores cookie and one that involved peanut butter of some kind and split them.  Given the time of night and the fact that they didn't seem very busy, I thought that the cookies might have been sitting for awhile, but they were warm and soft and still tasted very fresh, which was wonderful.  So glad we stopped in!
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2012,8/21/2014,15,53,5,8,7>Short story: Bruno's offers friendly service, and my favorite pizza in Kalamazoo.Long story (I'm sorry, but I refuse to shorten it): About a decade ago I was a recent transplant to Kalamazoo from New York. Freshly out of college and feeling oh-so-grown-up, I reckoned that *somewhere* in this town I would find pizza comparable to the stuff I grew up with back East.I decided I would systematically try every local pizza place in the area. I started picking at random with some interesting results, and decided an alphabetical approach (remember, this was back in the days of phonebooks) would be more logical.A Pizza Yen: too oily. Bilbo's: too doughy. Bimbo's: too crunchy. Next was Bruno's.I'm a fan of letting restaurants tell me what I want. I like best sellers, house specials, that kind of thing. Bruno's was the first pizzeria on my search that told me they didn't have "specials;" that their specialty was pizza. That was promising. On to the next test: "Do you offer garlic as a topping?" "Yes." "Fresh tomatoes?" "Yes." "OK! Two pizzas: one plain cheese, one with tomatoes and garlic." "Twenty minutes."I hadn't seen the restaurant before, so when I got there I was impressed with the old-fashioned look of the place: a big, classic neon sign out front, as well as tile-work above the shop windows. As I got closer, I saw that the pizzas are made right inside the front window, just like pizzerias back home. Bruno's was racking up points very quickly.During the drive home the heady garlic aroma enticed me to have a quick peek while stopped at a traffic light. In the box I saw something confusing and strange, so I closed the box, and finished my drive free of distraction (safety first, kids).Back home, in better light, I opened the boxes and inspected the goods. My eyes hadn't deceived me earlier: this pizza was cut in the oddest way I'd ever seen. Not standard wedge-cut, not Sicilian-style rectangular cut, not St. Louis-style party-cut. I don't even have a name for this cut style, as I've never seen it elsewhere. One diametric cut divides the pizza in two halves, and then perpendicular to the first cut, several parallel cuts slice the pizza into strips. It's the same kind of slice pattern you see used most often for cheese bread at chain pizzerias. The resulting slices are long, mostly rectangular, and conveniently mouth-width in size.After I finished puzzling over the geometry of the pie, the moment of truth had arrived. I took a bite, and there it was ... everything a pizza should be. Soft, steamy crust, fresh-tasting sauce, with gooey, stretchy cheese. I moved on to a slice of the tomato-garlic pizza: bingo. All those little neuroreceptor things in my brain went "ding-ding-ding!" and I knew my pizza search in Kalamazoo had come to an end.I quickly became a regular there, which led to an interesting experience for me a couple years later. I ended up on a stupid diet, and wasn't eating pizza for a couple of years. After I came to my senses, I headed back to Bruno's. When I got there, the strangest thing happened: they *remembered* me. They wondered where I'd been, and what I'd been up to. That was my first experience with that personal type of small-town, small business charm that makes this part of the country so nice.So that's the story: not only did Bruno's give me a way to connect to the flavors I missed from New York, but it also helped to solidify my connection to this town. Thanks to that experience, I took that crucial emotional step from "Kalamazoo is where I live" to "Kalamazoo is my home."
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,8/20/2014,4,26,,3,4>Crow's Nest is definitely one of my favorite  restaurants in Kzoo. For breakfast, I love the Amaretto French Toast. For lunch, I have a few favorites. I love their fish and chips, port authority sandwich, sarol karol, and katimar. However, they did get rid of some of their sandwiches which I was really disappointed about. As for service, I have had a few waitresses who treated me with attitudes. However recently, we've had good luck with caring waitresses/waiters. I do hope that they get a bigger parking space.

Friendly service and a great ambiance with the music in the background. It's rare I let someone I just met to cut my hair without any instructions from me. Mark immediately made me comfortable. What the heck, he's the pro. My only instruction...surprise me. And yes he did. Great haircut and value. Ya really got to check this guy out!

<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/12/2013,8/17/2014,0,4,1,2,1>The Bistro is among the best restaurants in Kalamazoo for good food. The atmosphere is casual (though it needs an update) but the food includes original recipes, and it is all terrific. Was especially pleased with the savory gnocchi that came with the tenderloin. Beyond the food, the excellent craft beer selection and knowledgeable servers make this a worthy stop.

<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2014,8/14/2014,112,126,5,3,4>I always have a good time here but I'm sure the company of my son has a lot to do with that. There are two miniature golf courses and we don't bother to keep score because we'd just lie about it anyway. Mulligans (aka "do overs") are endless and any excuse is acceptable  - the sun was in my eyes, my club is too short, the ball is the wrong color. Transition to the batting cages where anything you hit beyond the pitching machine "would have been a home run  at a real field".Off to the bungy harness trampoline to see who can hold lunch down after the fourteenth flip. Dads - it has a 200 lb weight limit so they've made the excuse for most of us already. "Really, I would love to go but rules are rules". Top it off with the water balloon launcher which after the third unsuccessful target acquisition becomes a water  balloon throwing battle. If you do head inside the video machines are a bit yesteryear and 200 win tickets gets you a tootsie roll. The fact is this place is fun. Mission accomplished. Top that off with pizza and Sherman's ice cream.Is this place state of the art? Heck no, who cares?! When I leave here Im usually laughing and wet and in the end that's the reason I came.

<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2014,8/11/2014,0,8,1,3,1>One of my favorite restaurants in Kalamazoo. I've always had a good experience with anything that I've tried. My go to is the taco bar that they have on the weekends. You have choose corn or flour tortillas. Or if you're feeling like "Americanizing" your meal, they offer hard shells. With a spread of carne asada, chicken, chorizo, or ground beef you can't go wrong. They also have a variety of toppings but I stick to cilantro, onions, limes, and salsa. I read a comment about them not serving limes, you just have to ask. Within the past year lime prices skyrocketed so they've been a bit conservative with those like most Mexican joints feeling the effect of increased prices. If you can't make it to the taco bar, I'd suggest bistec con rajas, torta, gordita, and enchiladas. They often have horchata(rice water), hibiscus juice, and tamarind juice.  Oh yeah, they have taco Tuesdays. 99 cent tacos on Tuesdays. Enough said. My only knock would be the oft inconsistent servers. They have a couple that are solid but some new ones naturally need more training.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,8/10/2014,2,3,,2,2>One of my favorite places to eat breakfast, whether it be for actual breakfast, or lunch. The staff is always friendly food is delicious, it's like a home cooked meal! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They have the perfect potatoes, and the French toast is amazing!! Love this place.
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2014,8/9/2014,8,16,1,2,2>Though this place isn't for everyone. If you're needing something that can fill you. A Dub can probably do it. Some people not like the place, but if you like the feel of a place like a pub this might be a place for you. The place has quite a bit of seating. And the walls have posters all over them. NOT all appropriate for kids though so I don't recommend it. It mostly comes off as a place for college kids. And as some have said it seems kinda like a stoner place because all the names have references to that kind of stuff. Aside from that though. The food is always hot and greasy. As well as filling to most. As long as you don't have a problem with the atmosphere of the place it's worth going to at least once. Little side note is dubs seem pretty expensive for the physical size of one. But when you compare price to how full you can get off just one it weighs out.
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,8/8/2014,95,94,,4,2>Going into a shop and saying you seriously messed up your phone and it's 100% your own fault can be a pretty mortifying experience. But the people I spoke to at Rapid Repair were so polite and understanding and no one laughed at me at all. Five stars for not being laughed at.I can be pretty klutzy. I was cleaning my car, and I somehow got Windex on my phone. I freaked out and wiped it off right away, but it seeped under the screen. The colors started looking really off after half an hour. Then the touchscreen stopped working reliably in certain areas. I stuck it in a bag of rice hoping it was just the moisture (and not, you know, the ammonia corroding its insides), and somehow got a piece of rice stuck into the lightning cable port. Ugh. So off to Rapid Repair I went.I had 24 hours before I was supposed to go on a trip, and they had no problem accommodating the rush request. My phone was fixed in three hours--like magic.Tip: if you work at Stryker, lead with "I work at Stryker." The two companies partner.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/22/2014,8/7/2014,4,98,1,3,2>We recently went searching for this taco joint in Kalamazoo and could not find it anywhere. We were surprised however to find their mobile taco truck smack in the middle of the Kalamazoo Farmer's Market on Saturday morning. Without hesitation we each ordered two chicken tacos with corn tortillas. After our Taco Bob's taco debacle these tacos were absolute taco heaven. The chicken was all white meat chicken, the hot tortillas were simple, yet so incredibly tasty corn tortillas and the toppings were spot on. We each had lettuce, tomato, and cilantro. We opted out of onion and cheese. We both also had mild salsa. I do not like spicy and this salsa (sauce?) was perfect.Each taco was $3 and I probably would have been fine with just one because two carried me from breakfast straight through lunch and our bottle water was $1. This taco truck is going to be regular stop on our trips to the market.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2014,8/6/2014,47,73,3,2,3>"Where should we go to eat?" If my wallet could handle it, my answer would always be Food Dance!The decor alone makes me feel light and springy and happy and healthy: huge cornstalks, asparagus, and other veggies on the walls, a gorgeous bar, and fairies directing the way to the restrooms.Food Dance sources locally, which is awesome (hence the higher prices). They make a lot of things in house: dressings, ketchup, breads, and more.For breakfast, I love ALL THE CHOICES. The granola is the best I've ever had, and the mimosas are delicious. Lunch and dinner are where it can get super expensive, but if you're treating yourself, the entrees, salads, and soups are all worth it. My recommendations are the Cobb salad, the fried chickpeas, and the salmon.  Oh, and make sure to order a bread basket (comes with the soup if you order that) just to get a taste of their yummy herbed butter! Fancier folks recommend the cheese plates; I'm not a huge fan.The dessert menu is soooooooo good. They have their standard specialty items (definitely give the Cat's Meow a try) and they also feature new items every few weeks, all made in house (I think). You can stop at the store on your way in or out. They've really built it up recently, and if you're a foodie, you'll probably start salivating right then and there.

Perhaps.Being mostly gluten free and sugar free means I rarely eat cakes or cupcakes of any kind. These were moist and did not make me feel sick like store bought ones always do. This is a nice little shop with quality food/ingredients and a friendly staff.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2013,8/2/2014,1,9,1,3,1>There are better theaters in the area. However there are not any theaters that can beat m89's prices.We go to the movies a lot. M89 5 tickets 5 large drinks 2 large popcorns and 5 boxes of candy little under 50 bucks. Compare that to the bigger chains in the area it cost about the same for 2 tickets 2large drinks 1 large popcorns and 2 boxes of candy.  The service is pretty good too. One super plus if you get a hot dog the have all the fixens to do it up Chicago style.The 1 con to all the pro, no free refills on soda or popcorn, but refill are .75 cents.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/7/2012,8/1/2014,8,15,2,1,1>These donuts are amazing. We can't visit family without bringing at least a dozen with us. When people come visit us, we have to have a dozen waiting. There's a reason they're in demand. The donuts are delicious, almost like cake but not too heavy. They have creative flavors for every season, along with gigantic versions of apple fritters and long johns. They even have a cinnamon roll as big as my head.The drive-thru makes it really easy to grab a half-dozen on the weekend, and the interior is a nice place to sit and have coffee while studying for exams.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/4/2012,7/31/2014,47,68,,8,1>I've been to a lot of nail salons in a lot of different cities and I'm thankful that this one is at my home base.  Prices are comparable to others across the country and the service level they provide is much better than most.  When you arrive you are promptly escorted back to your chair and asked if you want anything to drink.  They provide water, soda or coffee, whichever you fancy.  I haven't EVER been to a nail salon, paying $35 for a mani/pedi and gotten a free bottle of water.  There is a fountain back by the pedicure chairs, which adds a calming effect and they always play a hit music station in the background.  I always go to Lisa, who does a great job and I would recommend but Steve is also good.5 stars would require an update to the pedicure chairs as I've sat in quite a few of them and they sound like motor is about to die for the massage.  I normally just get a regular mani/pedi and they are always trying to upgrade you to shellac, which gets annoying, but I can't blame them as I assume most times they are successful on the upsell.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2014,7/30/2014,11,6,1,4,2>Ok. So it is a little on the expensive side for the greater kalamazoo area but it is worth every penny. When they say small plates it is not Tapas sized plated, one serving larger. We had four small plates;Stuffed shrimp with andouillePork tacosBeef tenderloin hashGoat cheese bakeChef Havey is a true chef. The food was great, eclectic and fun. The service was better than most restaurants in Kalamazoo. Highly recommend. Great date night spot.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,7/29/2014,3,37,1,3,2>I have to be honest and say I never would have gone here but my girlfriend talked me into it.  I have been with her many times since and I will go again in the future.  The busy night is Saturday and it gets pretty crowded.  If you make it there before 11 they are usually still serving food.  The nachos are huge and reasonabley priced.  I have had some of the burgers and sandwiches and have always been very happy.  The drinks are really good and the long islands are strong.  Maybe I should clarify and again say, the long islands are STRONG and cheap.  In a good way but watch out.  They have drink specials on weekends and the staff is always friendly.  There is a pool table and a separate dance area.  The club 411 is attached and usually has live music and shows.  I have only been once or twice in that area and it usually has a cover charge.  I will say I miss the free popcorn they used to serve.

<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2012,7/27/2014,0,7,3,3,2>This is one of my favorite places!!! Everything is great, especially the atmosphere- Tuesdays are especially nice because they have half off bottles ... It's a better version of an adult Starbucks ;)
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/6/2013,7/26/2014,10,43,1,4,3>Great new pizza place! Small, only a few tables inside, but the have a big menu and very reasonable prices. We ordered a pizza for takeout and it was ready quick. The pizza was great, you can tell the dough is homemade and the homemade italian sausage topping was great as well. I love that the pizza wasn't at all greasy, my biggest pet peeve about national chains. I look forward to going back and trying some more things on the menu.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,7/25/2014,7,26,1,3,2>I really like this little known secret. The price is very reasonable and the service is great. I have an 11 lb Shih Tzu and Plush Puppy does a great job with her grooming. I usually get a summer cut when she does need a haircut. They take orders on the specifics of how I would like her hair groomed which is great. It usually takes about 3 hours or so for her to be completed. They only charge around $40 too. I highly recommend this place. I am just sad I had to move away from them.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/11/2013,7/24/2014,9,23,,5,2>We loved everything about this place!  We sat outside, since it was a great night for it.  Our servers (one was in training) were both wonderful!  They were knowledgable and attentive.  We started with chips and guacamole, and a couple of house-made margaritas.  Both were great!  Next, we had lobster and chorizo stuffed mushrooms - a very rich and flavorful dish.  We were surprised at how you could really taste the lobster, and the sauce didn't overpower it at all.  Next, we had the chicken relleno - this was the star of the meal!  The combination of spicy, from the habanero cream cheese, and sweet, from the cherry compote was delightful!  What a unique and wonderfully thought out dish!  Lastly we had the Pacifico Fish Tacos, which were flavorful and satisfying.  You could really taste the freshness of the ingredients used, and you can't say that about a lot of restaurants now-a-days.  We will definitely be back, probably for a special occasion, as it is a little on the pricey side.  But, it is definitely worth it for such amazing food!!!
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2012,7/23/2014,91,14,1,8,5>My wife and I had a horrible experience at two other places this week and found this place on accident. BOY ARE WE GLAD WE DID! We bought a few helmets and communicator systems for our bike and had no idea how to set them up. The parts guys here hooked up everything for us and synced them the next day too when we still couldn't figure stuff out. The owner invited us to come out for weekly rides with a local bunch and they were so friendly it was amazing. We found our local shop forever now and we'd recommend life cycle to anyone who is into motorcyclingf.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,7/22/2014,1,6,1,2,2>6070 S 12th St. Kalamazoo, MI 49009 - This address is their new location. They were previously at 4824 W. Milham Ave. Portage, MI 49024.My wife and I stopped in here for sandwiches last night. I ordered the Baked Italian, and my wife ordered the Baked Pizza. When our sandwiches were ready, Matt (the owner) erupted from the back with our orders while singing the praises of his made-from-scratch sandwiches.The meatballs, sausage, sauces, and breads are all made in house. When the bartender noticed my wife trying to figure out how to cut her large sandwich in half with a butter knife, he called on Matt who immediately came around with a more appropriate knife to slice our sandwiches in half for us. Matt then invited us to come back and make a pizza with him in the kitchen the next time we visit.This place has an incredibly friendly staff, and the food lived up to the owner's hype. We are totally going back to try the pizza. I wish that every restaurant owner were as a passionate about their product as Matt! Pros: I have to give it five stars because of the incredible owner and staff. We had a truly wonderful experience and some marvelous sandwiches to boot.Cons:They have to make a small space work. I always order meatballs when they are made in house, but they had run out of meatballs last night :( .
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2014,7/21/2014,26,30,2,4,2>Reading the reviews I expected really crappy service. Luckily, that wasn't the case! Our service was pretty great actually! The building is SWEET! I love the open feel. I don't feel so claustrophobic.  You actually go up and grab your food yourself, which was not a problem with us. There is seating inside and outside. Enough space for bigger parties! Sweet indoor decor!! Also very kid friendly. Good news for me since I have a small soccer team going on. :-) I also do believe you can kayak right off the river next to this building.Also, they have smoked food selection. I believe everything is local as well. They had some local duck from Mattawan when I was in. Anyways, everything I had was killer! I loved the ribs, pulled pork, & potato salad!! Absolutely excellent!! I gave a 4 star because there were so many fruit flies! It's really hard to enjoy with hundreds of bugs swarming you. That's kinda expected with an indoor/outdoor bar right off the water.Another (small) con, they were out of tops for the growlers. No biggie. The manager gave me a 5 dollar gift card to use on the spot! Very nice of him. I never even complained! Finally, I just want to add that I'm pretty much obsessed with the beer Big Finish Ale! So good!!! Really wanted to bring home that darn growler!
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/25/2014,7/20/2014,10,17,,4,1>I took my wife here for the first time and she was super impressed! I've been here 3 yikes so far and each time the food was exceptional. True real Mexican cooking, not a Tex-Mex interpretation found around Kalamazoo.We had the two fajitas meal with beans and rice. We chose the mixed chicken and steak. It was excellent, the meat was tender and flavorful. The two meals were priced very cheaply and we had plenty leftover for another full meal the next night!I'd recommend it any day over and other so called Mexican or Tex-Mex place in Kalamazoo!
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/27/2013,7/19/2014,1,3,,2,1>Wonderful food, went late for dinner and walked in to find two talented musicians playing jazz in the corner. We ordered the chicken sandwich and gyro which were delicious and the fries are a special treat marinated in garlic or truffle oil and spices, definitely worth trying! I only wish the kitchen didn't close so I could have tried the baklava... All for under twenty bucks for the two of us! We will be going back for sure!
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/21/2014,7/18/2014,70,96,4,6,2>Rain drops keep fallin on my head, that was the kind of day it was with my visit to fabrications!!  At first glance this is a very new building and a nice looking store, and when you walk in the front door it does not disappoint.  One of my earlier yarn quest stops this store had a huge selection of discounts to choose from, but the one that I partook in was the buy 3 discounted yarns get 1 free.  OH MY YES please!Walk into the store and directly to your right is a rainbow of yarn with very organized and a well placed selection.  Head to toe yarn oh my.  Big and Small and every kind of texture you may want.  Walk into the store and directly in front of you and to the left is fabric yes, fabric, fabrications, get it.  I knew you did, anyways it's a decent selection and if I was sewing right now I probably would have looked closer but right now my focus was on the yarn.There also was a large classroom to the left and also in the back of the store yay :)NOw the last room I visited was the discount room and they had so many yarns in there I thought my heart would explode with joy.  For me, these are the goldmines because I don't have a lot of money right now, almost none and this is how I can get the yarn I otherwise may not afford.  I got some beautiful cottons and a really neat salmon color tweed that was normally like $20 and and I got it for like $12 plus one of my other hanks for free. yay.  The staff was awesome, very helpful and showed me where everything was and how much it cost etc etc.  Loved it.  Wish it was closer, but I still plan on revisiting that was how much I liked it.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2014,7/17/2014,1,3,,2,1>Went here on a Friday night and place was only half full.   Service was pleasant and good.  I had the fried fish and it was just ok.  Fish was very plain and had some weird breading on it that was flaky.  Wife and friend both had burgers and they were happy with the meals.   Get the homemade chips, they are tons better than the unappetizing Irish Potatoes.  Place has a decent atmosphere but it is loud and noise seems to reverberate throughout.  I saw a lot of families and a bunch of kids which was very nice.  There were a lot of TVs on the wall but they were not large and could not read the score from where we were sitting.  There was some outdoor seating but it was do cold to go outside when I was there.  Overall is a nice place and will go back.

The staff is always friendly and there with the next pot of coffee and the hippie hash is the perfect breakfast/brunch option. Add some of their homemade toast, just do it.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/29/2013,7/15/2014,5,2,,3,2>A shop full of people that love bikes and bike culture, without being pretentious about it; seemingly a rare find these days.They intimately know (and ride) the bikes they sell and are more than happy to wax poetic about the nuances of each choice, or one can just mention what they are looking to accomplish; they will be sure to point you in the correct direction.Service is top notch, and the work stands are in an area open to the showroom, you just can't get more honest than that.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/28/2014,7/14/2014,8,7,,4,2>I may not be the pickiest eater but my wife and I love this place! For me, it is more than just the taste but the service and experience. I think this place has some of the best servers ever. They are always so quick, polite, and energetic (for people's birthdays at least).It is always a big plus when they give you free chips and salsa which their salsa is delicious especially when i add some hot sauce to it. I have only had a few of the items on the menu but i have not been disappointed with any of them. They are huge portions and such a reasonable price. My wife and i can eat there for $20 easily (no drinks included) and we always take some of it home with us.I was surprised when i saw some of the negative reviews this place had on here so that is why i ended up writing a review because i really do like this place. As i said in the beginning, i am pretty easy to please taste wise and not picky so i cant tell you if this is pure, real mexicana food but for my wife and i - its great!
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2014,7/13/2014,8,21,,3,3>I have been here numerous times and have yet to be disappointed. The beer selection changes with the seasons except for a few year-round staples. Every food item I have tried has been delicious, but I think my favorite is the smoked wings. They have a delicious flavor without being drenched in sauce. The burgers are all amazing and cooked to perfection. The entrees are a bit pricey, but well worth it because they are so tasty. The beer flight is a great because you can taste 6 different beers without having to buy a pint. I really love having a place like this nearby!
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/13/2014,7/12/2014,0,1,11,6,7>I blindly moved to a random apartment in Kalamazoo, and it first I was thrilled to find that Rice Kitchen was located (literally) right next door. Now, I am not so happy about living so close. They have great food, especially for the price. Everyday I'm standing in my kitchen, and what do I see out the window? Rice Kitchen. How am I supposed to force myself to cook dinner when I know that I can wait 10 minutes and feast on some delish Rice Kitchen for next to nothing?Even with their extremely reasonable prices, I'm going to go broke living so close. I hate you, Rice Kitchen. I love you, Rice Kitchen.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/6/2014,7/11/2014,9,10,,4,3>Nagle's is the sort of place you fear is going to disappear one day in the age of chains and shining, sterile standardization.Nagle's is a greasy spoon and I mean that in the best way possible.  I've never had lunch there but I think their breakfasts are the signature attraction.  It's a dog and shake shop so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about?  They offer the normal compliment of breakfast plates, egg burritos, etc., but the feature item is their breakwichs.  The breakwich is basically an egg, cheese, and meat breakfast sandwich on Texas toast.  It is customizable for size, content, and layers but always delicious in any combination.  It tastes like a heart attack and I, again, mean that in the best way possible.  The food has that great flat-top grill, made to order, hot-off-the-metal goodness.  It's rich in flavor but real, not just salt, flavor. The atmosphere is great too.  It's the sort of place you imagine old men meet to sip coffee and talk politics and fishing.  The restaurant is usually sparsely attended in actuality but they get plenty of morning carryout business of working people getting a filling meal in the AM.  There is a wood stove that they run in the chilly seasons to heat the dining room.  The walls are lined with used books that can be purchased for a buck or less.  There's a few tables but mostly it's old, diner-style hard booths.  It's not fancy or modern but the dining room matches the classic greatness of the food.Again, it's the sort of place you want to visit, support, and cherish if you want an old-fashioned, blue collar, greasy spoon.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2014,7/10/2014,0,2,,2,1>Absolutely LOVE the food here. My sister and I come in at least once a month. Very delicious chicken lasagna. The chicken salad sandwiches on croissants are sweet, crisp and fresh. The dining area is small but quaint; always makes us feel like we're home just sharing a meal. Everyone who works there are very polite and helpful. Overall, it's just home-style comfort food that even delivers. What more could you want than that?
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2014,7/9/2014,7,7,,4,3>The BEST froyo around!  The high quality, the delicious flavors and the amazing variety of toppings is amazing. The kids love fixing their own bowls just the way they like. The decor is clean, modern and very inviting. Love the outdoor seating in warmer months. Try the white chocolate with fresh raspberries on top...delish!
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2013,7/8/2014,6,10,1,2,1>Dear god do they make anything that is not amazing here? I love going with one of my good friends and we each order a different sandwich then trade half, best idea ever! Even their sides are amazing and have got me to try things I would not normally try and I now love. I have to stop and get stuff from their take out frequently! The chicken salad is so good, I love the California club, (even their bread is homemade and amazing, my favorite is the oatmeal bread) the broccoli salad is extra yummy, the cowboy caviar is addicting, anything chicken or turkey is so good it is better than homemade because I don't have to do the dishes after and tastes like it was made with the same love it is in my kitchen. All that and I have not mentioned dessert, believe me don't miss dessert here!!! Cream puffs with homemade chocolate sauce, fruit pies and cream pies that make you think of Sunday dinner at your grandmas house as they would certainly give her a run for her money... When blueberry season is here I have to go get a blueberry cream pie, they are so amazingly good, and surprise my parents as it is a favorite of theirs too. The Dutch know how to do it right they are a can't miss restaurant!!!!

<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2011,7/6/2014,5,2,,4,2>I absolutely love The Union. The atmosphere is fantastic--warm browns, reds, and the centerpiece of the room is a gorgeous hardwood stage with red theatre curtains and great lighting. My husband and I love live music, and this is a great place for catching many genres. Usually there is live tunes 4-6 nights a week. Bear in mind, it does get loud, but it's never been too much, and there is usually the option to sit in the back.Important to note--come before the music starts though if its on the weekend or you'll have trouble finding a seat in most cases!I usually stick to the sandwiches and burgers because they are in the $8-10 range, and overall I'd give them 3.5-4 stars.I've tried some of their more pricey dishes and they are quite amazing, definite 5 stars! I have noticed the menu has small changes fairly regularly, but I'm not sure of the rate of this.I also enjoy going on the "off" nights. My husband and I went there tonight, a Monday, at 8 and there were only about 5 other parties present. It was relaxing to have some focused time together in such a great environment.For the small city of Kalamazoo, The Union is a perfect place to get a taste of that Big City feel.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2012,7/5/2014,2,11,,3,2>I live down the street from here, it has only been open 19ish months, this has become my favorite bar in Kalamazoo. Laid back, modern/rustic/classy without being too uptight. Service, setup and food were all weak the first 6ish months but have all improved to speak to Dave W's comment. It is a seat yourself bar, which can be a problem on busy nights, but it's a popular place. Food is good, but you come here to push and get adventurous with your beer palate. From domestic, local brews Bells (In Kalamazoo and blocks away), to an assortment of international beers that can change monthly. This is the perfect place to start your evening.

Their food (especially the house-made pizza) is excellent. The people who work there are really great, and the atmosphere is far funkier than anything else in Kalamazoo. In the warm weather they now have a nice porch and some tables where you can sit in the shade and enjoy your coffee. All of their fantastic baked goods are from The Victorian Bakery, a Kalamazoo favorite.At the end if the day they are still a coffee shop, and they do it amazingly well. I have seldom had a more flavorful, less bitter espresso.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2012,7/2/2014,59,13,3,6,5>Scenario: Sweltering, 95-degree night. We're starving for a good dinner after a long day, but we gotta let the dog out first. So we take care of that and realize we both left our keys inside and we're locked out. So, we decide to walk to Martini's so the dog can hang on the sidewalk while we eat and drink away the frustration of our oversight.Within fives minutes of arriving, two separate Martinis employees came out with an unsolicited bowl of water for our panting dog. Then a customer inside saw us and asked our server (Dixie=AWESOME), to deliver his leftover roast beef sandwich (literal doggie bag) for him. I knew this place had the best pizza in town. I knew it had perfect ambiance and an impressive beer and wine list. But we're new to Kalamazoo and the people at Martinis treated us like family. We came in feeling hot, hungry and grouchy; and we left feeling so full, happy and grateful for delicious food and remarkably kind people.

We've done the Chef's Table a few times, have always supremely enjoyed it - the experience, the food, etc. Mostly we just go for dinner. They're always busy, but we've never had a wait. And we've NEVER had a bad meal... and we've probably eaten most of the menu :) The delmonico is delicious; the chicken is simple but outstanding; the scallops are perfect; the short ribs are ridiculous; the agnolotti ravioli is WHY WE COME. The desserts are delicious... we've been known to order one to split, and once finished, order a second! The burrata appetizers we've had are fantastic. And cannot even convey how much we love all the waitstaff who've served us. Just all around absolutely love this place.

My husband is always trying to find little gems in our lives that bring a bit of the flavors, sounds and taste of home for me to feel less home sick not that it helps or replaces the feelings of being away from my family but what it does is show how caring he can be.  I oddly miss those silly grilled hotdogs on the hotdog carts and when my husband founds this place I was sold. It's even better it reminds me of the foods I ate when I was in High school I lived in East York for a while then moved but finished high school by traveling and you know this place is really close to the type of foods that I grew up on.
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2013,6/25/2014,6,5,,4,2>This place is great! The stock market concept is fun, and the food is always great. My favorite item would have to be the nachos! I love going here because you can stop in during the week and have a nice meal and a beer, and on the weekends it's always packed. I've recommened this place to many out of towners and they've always been pleased.
<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2014,6/24/2014,4,2,,4,2>Just stopped here for breakfast on a slow Thursday morning with the boyfriend and we just loved the food. It was a little more pricey then I expected but the food was delicious. I ordered the pork nirvana omelette which was one of the better omelets I have had in Kalamazoo. Hannah our server took great cafe of us and we will defiantly be back.
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,6/23/2014,10,12,3,5,3>Another freakin' bar and grill?  NOPE.  Don't be fooled by the name, there is no sports bar like this in Kalamazoo anywhere!  From the design & decor to the amazingly delicious food, this place is THE sports bar to be at.  Omg....GOAL!!!  First 32 seconds of the game and USA is up 1!  Go World Cup!  Ok, back to the review.  Friendly staff, quick service and great WMU campus location close to downtown.  If you have a REALLY big appetite, BRING IT, AFB Bar & Grill has 2 food challenges!  A ridiculously huge burger or a 4 lb wing challenge.  Are you man or woman enough to get your name on the "Wall of Fame"?  To sum it up, if you love great food, cold drinks and amazing company, this is the sports bar for you!!!
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/15/2014,6/22/2014,16,78,,3,2>I have no major complaints for London Grill- everything was good and I'm looking forward to coming back to try other dishes.We went on a Friday night, spurred by having a Restaurant.com gift certificate. We waited just a moment for the host to seat another party. Decent beer offerings, plus some cocktails that sounded very interesting. My friend and I ended up choosing to share 3 appetizers rather than do entrees, since they all sounded so tasty! We started with the English style poutine. I wanted to love this more, but in my opinion the fries were not the best. They seemed like the frozen kind. But other than that, the gravy was very delicious. We then got the chicken satay, which was excellent. It came served over rice with peaches. It honestly could have been an entree. We also got the mussels, which were good but a tiny bit "fishy". The broth in the bottom was tasty and great to sop up with the grilled bread that was included.Service was great, our server was very friendly and using the restaurant.com certificate was no problem at all. Nice atmosphere, busy but not overwhelming. Good place to take visitors that is impressive but somewhat casual.I'd love to go back and try other offerings. They have a good mix of English and Indian foods, plus had a very full list of specials.
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2014,6/21/2014,72,86,,4,3>Wow, what an amazing setup. I mean I was probably biased by the weather, but couple that with the energy of the place, the live (and jammin') music, and food trucks?If you're experiencing a sunny Saturday morning in Kalamazoo, you best get yoself to the Farmers Market. I imagine its equally lively on a cloudy or rainy day, so I don't want to dissuade you in the probable event (this is Michigan, after all) of a crummy weekend.The parking lot appears to be allocated for market parking is nice, but woefully inadequate given the size of the crowds. I sense that things are still being optimized. Lots of great vendors including fresh produce/flowers, breakfast/lunch fare, some crafty type things.
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2013,6/20/2014,19,25,,5,2>I needed a brain-dead simple repair job done on my rather old Bridgestone ten-speed bicycle and the fellow who helped me, I think it was the owner, was very gracious and not only fixed my problem but also showed me how to do it in the future. Their prices are excellent, all the way from tuneups to flats. I live very close to this shop and I used to have to haul my bike across town, now I have a new shop in case I need anything. Very glad I stopped in and said hello. They are really friendly and very helpful.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/18/2013,6/19/2014,4,1,,3,2>My first time at Saffron & everything about my experience was amazing! Our server was beyond helpful considering it was my entire table's first time there! He was very patient and even went as far as to help each individual decide on an entree based on their personal preferences and experience eating Indian cuisine! Our wait wasn't bad for our food and our glasses were always full (a must for me). I ordered the Exquisite Chicken Shahjahani minus the nuts & raisins and ordered it at about medium to hot spice level (about a 7). Our table ordered a couple orders of the saffron rice & a few orders of the garlic & cheese naan to share. It was absolutely delicious! I'm beyond excited that we stumbled across this gem that is so close to my home!! One of my good friends is Indian and her mother used to cook for us all the time growing up. I had yet to come across a comparably delicious Indian restaurant that served food even close to the quality of her homemade naan and curry but I think I have found one after tonight! I will certainly be returning for the lunch buffet, as they said it has a good variety and would help with my decisions on menu options in the future.The prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get and of course for the complexity and flavor as well :) I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves Indian cuisine and even those who have never tried it but just want to try something new and delicious in a comfortable and inviting environment! Also, don't be intimidated by the menu or the spice level. Our server was very patient and helpful. As for spice, my friend can't handle any amount of spice whatsoever and she thoroughly enjoyed her meal, which was as mild as could be!
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2012,6/18/2014,5,5,,4,2>Amazing food, but not what you'd expect. Very small family restaurant, probably a few teenagers on computers or phones when you walk in. A total of 4 tables, with one big enough to seat around 4-5 people. However, the food is great. The fried rice is drizzled in a sweet soy sauce with an egg on top. The main common dishes are yummy with new flavors if you are experienced with mayalasian food, but not gross or weird, just a fun new flavor. The pulled te Tarik (tea) is some of the best chai I've ever seen. You might want to call ahead because they sometimes have weird hours (the ones on yelp seem accurate)
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2011,6/17/2014,8,14,,5,2>The bakery is a hidden jewel just south of downtown Kalamazoo.    My selections were served on quaint, unmatched plates, and my tea was served in a pot of my choosing (out of 20 or so on display).   My cheesecake bar was decadent, perfectly done.  The crust on the quiche was buttery and delicious and the filling was light, moist, and contained a good balance of  cheese and spinach.  This was a great place to meet up for a light lunch, albeit heavy on the sweet end of a meal spectrum.  Other savory options are available, including cheese scones, along with coffee and a selection of teas.The online menu is impressive - I plan to order a treat ahead of time to take full advantage of what the Victorian Bakery has to offer.  Parking may be an issue - the lot was full at Noon, which is not surprising considering how delicious.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2012,6/16/2014,40,10,2,3,2>We were so sad when we moved down to Portage from Kalamazoo, taking us farther away from our favorite store! Tiffany's is never a disappointment...they have always had everything we went in to get. The staff is awesome. From wine, to beer, to liquor, they are knowledgable, quick to help and always offer great suggestions. The selections of gourmet food and snacks is also amazing (try the blueberry yogurt pretzels!), they have a fantastic cheese and cracker selection, tons of olives, pastas, nuts, etc. Everything you would need for a fun dinner party to impress friends! We love Tiffanys.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/18/2014,6/15/2014,23,10,,4,2>Stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday morning recently and was very pleased with the service. The place was packed, but we were taken to a table right away and our server was so quick in waiting on us that we had to send her away for a few minutes while we perused their huge menu. They have a wonderful selection of just about any basic breakfast food you can think of--pancakes (obviously), omelettes, waffles, biscuits & gravy, etc. They serve it all with various toppings and in various flavors.  Our server came back lickity split and, once we'd ordered, our generous (and delicious) portions of food were delivered to us in a very reasonable amount of time. We did have to wait for awhile in a crowded line to pay our bill, but we were pleasantly distracted by a display case full of artistically arranged fruit that created pictures of beaches and monkey heads. All in all a good experience!
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2013,6/14/2014,31,33,2,4,2>Love Bilbo's. We come here for the salad and the stuffed pizza, both of which are awesome . We usually get decent service on Friday nights, which is saying something.Two complaints:1. The entire staff is comprised of hipsters who aren't really interested in being there, though they still give okay service. Not stellar, but our food is always right and our drinks are never empty. There are a couple of servers who are friendlier.2. This place is in serious need of a makeover. The wallpaper is peeling, the plaster is flaking, there's water damage on the ceiling, things are broken, the decor sucks, the patio is in need of some TLC, and the windows have never been cleaned. I'd be sad if the place closed for renovations, but they're sorely in need of them.I will say that the tables are always clean, dishes get cleared quickly. We get two or three stops by our table to make sure things are good and to see if we need anything (other than refills), which is perfect in my opinion. Nothing worse than a hovering server while you're trying to eat, or one you never see.Despite my complaints, we'll continue to come back here frequently, because the pizza is just that good.
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2014,6/13/2014,37,9,,4,2>I HIGHLY recommend the Banana Bread French Toast with cinnamon cream syrup & walnuts! It's life-changing. PLUS -- you can even add vegetarian sausage! I love that you can order breakfast anytime here, but they also offer a full menu featuring fantastic lunch and dinner items. Take note that Crows Nest is open 24-hours on weekends! I'm a vegetarian, but my vegan and meat-eater friends all love Crows Nest! In fact, it was voted the No. 2 Breakfast Spot in Michigan by MLive.I love bringing visitors to this hidden gem -- not only is the food amazing, but the second-floor, exposed-brick, tucked-away in the Vine Neighborhood atmosphere of Crow's Nest is enchanting.NOTE: On the weekends, get there early; otherwise you may encounter a line.
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,6/12/2014,3,5,,3,2>When people talk about supporting local business because of all of the benefits to the entire community, Confections with Convictions is the quintessential example. The product is top notch. I would challenge you to find better chocolate. I recently attended a Yelp event at Tempo Vino Winery and Confections with Convictions brought an fantastic variety of truffles to sample.  Their vegan truffle, made with coconut milk and infused with local blueberries, was a surprise hit with many people.  There would be many more vegans in the world if all vegan cuisine tasted this heavenly.  My other favorite truffle was infused with honey and was topped with bits of honeycomb. On a cold February night, it was a taste of summer. I stopped at two truffles, only because I was being polite, not because I couldn't have eaten the entire tray. I have never never been disappointed with a chocolate from Confections with Convictions.Beyond outstanding chocolate, Confections with Convictions employs kids who have had difficulties with the legal system and may not otherwise be able to get a job. The kids learn job skills, they learn they can do something else with their lives, and they learn that they can make something beautiful. All in all, this is an outstanding business, that is an asset to Kalamazoo.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2013,6/11/2014,62,64,,3,2>Bustling with excitement on Saturday mornings is the Texas Charter Township Farmers Market. The parking is a little tight if you don't get there early but there is a steady stream of people streaming through. A variety of vendors for fresh fruits and veggies, baked goods, cheese, meat, and smoked fish. Info from the website: 'The market is open for the 2013 season on Saturdays from May 11 to October 12, 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. and Tuesdays from June 18 to August 27, 4 to 7 p.m. to support local farmers and food businesses while getting the freshest, tastiest foods around - all grown and prepared locally!'A big shout out to Mattawan Artisan Creamery. Aside from having very yummy goat cheese they are trying to add goat yogurt to their repertoire and gave me a free sample to enjoy and provide them with feedback. I love the honesty and community of, I'm trying something new, taste it and let me know what you think. So cool.
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2014,6/10/2014,112,126,,6,2>Locals generally like this place and I have to concur with their opinion. The restaurant and bar are laid out into two separate areas. The bar area has a higher noise level and sometimes hosts live music. They keep a little more festive atmosphere there and it has a more upbeat feel. The restaurant menu is available in either area.The restaurant separates into a more muted and intimate feel if you're going there to enjoy dining and conversation. I have to admit it's a great concept depending upon what type of environment you're in the mood for. There's a nice beer selection and some nice menu options. There are a couple of fish selections (ahi and salmon) but this place is more a steak house.  Even that being said they have a large selection of salads including a nut and berry salad. Nice form. The salads I've tried have had fresh lettuce and crisp vegetables. The steaks are all under $20 which is pretty much unheard of in larger cities. They're prepared nicely and flavorful. The sandwiches and burgers are all under $10 so the price point for a restaurant of this caliber is impressive. Everything I've tried here has had a very good taste. The caliber of service I've had here has also been consistently good. This is a solid restaurant with all the way around. Great job here. 5 stars.
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/5/2012,6/8/2014,31,115,,2,1>I have been here twice, and both times were very positive experiences. Both times were to receive help with products not purchased here.The first time I wanted the band shortened on a watch I had purchased on eBay. I've been living downtown for years but never been in this jeweler because it is a block or two away from the central area, but they are one of the only jewelers downtown that is open on Monday. The store is beautiful inside and I was helped quickly and I had my watch back in about 10 minutes.The second time is because I decided to do the band replacement on my expensive Garmin running watch by myself. I managed to snap off a pin and leave part of it stuck inside the watch face, unreachable to me. I went to one other jewelry store first for help  (Spaman's, also open Monday), and he said he would help me but I would need to leave it for a few days because he was very backed up.I took it to Nord and the guy was able to remove the stuck piece in about 3 minutes, and didn't charge me. He also let me sit down and use a jewelers mat for a few minutes so I could finish the band replacement right away.Their service for things like that is as good as it gets, so I will definitely come here in the future if I am in the market for jewelry.
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/9/2008,6/7/2014,5,23,,3,6>I'v never had dinner here, but the breakfast is the absolute best in Kalamazoo. Fresh ingredients and the best bacon i've ever had. I don't know what it is but the bacon is amazing. I eat here routinly on the weekends, and it is always good.Sit on the patio if you can, it is great to have a nice breakfast outside overlooking the vine neighborhood. The best breakfast in Kalamazoo!
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/14/2012,6/6/2014,1,41,,7,4>This is great pizza. It's a bit more expensive than a Pizza Hut or Papa John's, but it's good.The crust is different.  It's similar to a Sicilian crust.  It's not crewy or tough, but it's not doughy.  The cheese they use is fantastic.  The sauce has lots of flavor.Their garlic cheese bread is truly amazing.  It's by far my favorite item on the menu.They have a lunch buffet that's very good as well.  Salad, pizza, bread/cheese sticks with lots of variety.  They even have Mello Yello on tap!Lots of room to sit, great for families.  They have a large delivery radius as well.I've been wanting to try the pasta and the subs, but I haven't had a chance to.We normally get the 20"pizza so we have plenty left over for the next day.
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2013,6/5/2014,196,453,2,3,2>It's no myth that men like their breakfast, not muffins and pop tarts either, just solid, meat - egg - potatoes kind.  I'm here to tell you that Bucky's meets the bill just about perfectly.  Let me start off by saying that the place is relatively busy every day of the week.  I know this because I pass it on my way to work.  So busy in fact, I wouldn't be sure if I could hop in before work and be out in time.  This alone has to tell you that Bucky's has it going on, and its not even the weekend -- explained below.So my last trip to Bucky's (last weekend) I decided go with the 6 oz. Ribeye and eggs special for $7.95.  This also came with Bucky's famous (WEEKEND ONLY) cheesy hash browns.  The steak was flat top cooked, as expected, and very lightly seasoned.  I added a little salt and pepper to taste which made the flavors pop.  I walked out wondering how they can get away with that price point as I'd pay that all day / every day.  Of course the eggs were cooked perfectly.Bucky's is a wide open restaurant with lots of seating.  The wait staff is attentive and great at what they do, meaning they take up each others slack and work as a team.  Coffee never empty, food came quick and spot on.  They do take CC. This HAS become my breakfast place of choice in Portage.  Be sure to check it out but lay off my cheesy potatoes!!For those wondering why not 5 stars?  I haven't explored ALL the breakfast options in Kzoo area for obvious reasons.  As for Bucky's, they seem a little hesitant to go overboard with anything such as ingredients, HUGE omelets, or something you may see from the food channel. Play it safe, go to Bucky's!
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2013,6/4/2014,1,20,2,4,2>Best in K-zoo in my opinion. If I'm wrong please shoot me a message because so I can try another place to see. I'm not in Kalamazoo all the time, but I do go every now and then.Anywho, Service: Excellent. Some of the servers aren't as aware of sushi terms or sushi in general as other servers but they will always go and check to make sure you can get what you want, how you want.Prices a bit more on the semi steep side, but I've had steeper.Also I live in Grand Rapids, and the prices range anywhere from cheap cheap sushi (which unfortunately is not very good - to more expensive (lounge style).Agedashi Tofu was pretty crisp and not amateur.Edamame, always good and a decent size.Seaweed Salad, they are not cutting costs with cheap below grade seaweed salad I can attest.Nigiri, I believe they use nishimoto trading co. and true worlds based out of Chicago. Anywho, they know how to properly store the fish because I realize that chicago is a bit of a drive from here for the delivery people, and they know how to cut in the right manner so there are never any pieces that is weird in texture.Rolls, pretty decent size :) I'm more of a nigiri eater but I do enjoy my yellowtail roll/salmon roll etc. Highly recommended.
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/10/2013,6/3/2014,2,8,,2,1>This is our go-to for lebanese food.  The beef schwarma is as it should be and tasty.  I LOVE their dolmas!!!  The lentil soup is phenomenal as well!  Even better are the hand crafted slushies!  My favorite is the mint lemonade.  WOW!  We never eat in but instead order to go.  The food is always out in a reasonable time and the servers are always pleasant!  Pop in to get your lebanese fix!!!

<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/15/2013,6/1/2014,15,53,,6,3>I had my first visit today to TnT A Touch of Soul's new location inside the Burdick Party Center. I'll definitely be back!TnT used to have an operation on North Westnedge but they've retooled their operation to a carryout-only format. They've got their grills out front, which is great advertising.The counter was bustling during lunch today. There was a short line of customers (I asked, and they were all repeat customers back for more) but the staff worked through the line quickly to get orders filled.The mother-and-daughter team at the counter both suggested I try their rib tips if it was my first visit there. Mother suggested fries as a side, daughter suggested baked beans. I took the diplomatic option and asked for both.The rib tips were good. Sweet, chewy, and filling. The fries were hot, crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The baked beans were sweet, rich, and hearty with a hint of cinnamon.They had a large variety of other dishes I'm eager to return to try: greens, potatoes, mac and cheese, pulled pork, and I think lasagna may have been today's special. They assured me everything was homemade fresh, and it all looked delicious. I'll try to update this review (or at least post more pictures) after a couple more visits.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2011,5/31/2014,40,60,,5,2>Comensoli's has replaced Pasta Pasta and appears to be under the same management. I am unsure of how to compare it to Pasta Pasta since I never went there before it became Comensoli's. Comensoli's is a cozy, comfortable Italian restaurant on the outskirts of downtown. They feature live music Thursday through Saturday. It is relatively small, with an indoor dining area and a covered patio area. The patio appears to either be new or newly renovated. I say that because when I was seated in the patio area, there was a pile of clutter that included a wooden box labeled "explosive projectile." The heaters also had some problems staying on, but thankfully it wasn't too cold at the time. Hopefully these little blips have been taken care of since then.Everything I have gotten here has been delicious. I have sampled the chicken piccata with polenta (I'm picky about chicken, but this was excellent!), the chicken parmesan (also tender and good, the melted mozzarella was so tasty), the feta bruschetta, gnocchi, portabella mushroom ravioli (I usually don't like mushrooms, but this was sooo good), and the wilted rose soup. The wilted rose soup is an intense garlic soup. Obviously, if you like garlic, you will probably love this. It burned the back of my throat so I can't really handle more than a few spoonfuls. Hands down, the food here has tasted very fresh and delicious. I didn't get that overly heavy, oily feeling that I sometimes get from eating Italian food. It was filling, but not too heavy.The service here has been quite good for me as well, although you can probably expect longer waits during their peak times. I think Comensoli's is currently my favorite Italian restaurant in Kalamazoo. It's smaller and a bit less overwhelming than a bigger place like Mangia Mangia and the food is great.
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/22/2014,5/30/2014,7,104,,5,2>Recently had a substantial upgrade in electrical service in my home and had Webster Electric recommended by a good friend. Contacted them and received an in depth inspection and estimate at my home by one of their project managers. He was very knowledgeable and was able to quickly and easily answer all of my questions. the estimate was a little higher than a couple other contractors, but upon doing my own research, i found that they were using some of the top rated electrical components on the market for both performance and safety. The crew tht came to my home to perform the work was very courteous and professional and completed a very clean installation in a relatively short amount of time. My experience with Webster was excellent and i would highly recommend them if you need any electrical work done.

I'm so sorry, Phantastic Nails! If I'd known then when I know now, I never would've given you two stars. Your manicures are really great.I went back, and they did such a good job again. They even had the Travel Channel on instead of SpongeBob.I just did shape and color (shellac), and it cost $20 instead of $30 for the full manicure.I will say, though, that their shellac color selection leaves something to be desired.

<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2012,5/27/2014,0,9,,4,2>I met the folks from Water Street Coffee at the Taste of the Chamber in Kalamazoo and was excited when my wife brought home a few things last week.  The chocolate cake was ...well, complicated.  The frosting was kind of dark and the middle was rich and a bit gooey.  I had it on its own but I could tell it would have been the perfect complement for coffee or a nice vanilla ice-cream.  The deep and complex combination of chocolate flavors would hold their own with the coffee we picked up; Mexico Chiapas.  It is FTO which is nice and all but for $14 a pound it had better beat the pants off of a cup of Starbucks house blend which it does.  I grind my own beans right before brewing.  This normally allows me to save money on beans as fresh ground cheap beans (assuming you pick out the quakers which, at least psychologically, helps) make for better coffee than great beans that were ground last month.  This is really good coffee.  I would agree with the chooserific description on the WSC site.  It is not exotic but has a nice depth of flavor.  We also had a lemon bar that had a flakey crust and a fantastic lemon body.   For details on their offering from the Taste, see our review at dinemichigan.com.

<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,5/25/2014,14,11,,6,4>We love the Studio Grill in beautiful downtown Kalamazoo!  Today we went for breakfast, and although our wait was longer than usual, it was well worth it. My teenage son had the Morning Madness with a pancake on the side and devoured every bit of it. My husband loved the corned beef hash omelette and had leftovers to bring home. My usual breakfast order is their blueberry pancakes, which are always light, fluffy and loaded with juicy berries. We frequently choose Studio Grill for breakfast because of the homestyle cooking and the extremely friendly owners. Every time we've eaten there, Craig and/or Daphney have personally greeted us and asked our opinions on our food choices.  We've had equally enjoyable experiences with their award-winning burgers for lunch and often recommend this place to friends and out-of-towners. It's a gem!
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/2/2012,5/24/2014,27,4,,5,3>If you want the best togo food you have ever had, this is the place! We order from here all of the time and rarely are we dissappointed with our dinners. My wife orders the salmon kabob usually and raves about it! She loves middle eastern food that is tasty and healthy and Zooroona hits the mark here for sure, other middle eastern restaraunts that I won't name here, have dishes that are too saucy and heavy for her taste. I love the shish tawook, and the garlic sauce they serve with their dishes is so addictive that I wish they would sell it by the gallon. The humus with pita bread is a must and so are the falafal(sp) and baclava(sp). The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because we have had a few times where the service has been off a bit. We have also ate at the restaraunt before and have only had bad service a few times, every time, the food keeps us coming back. I seriously think that once they button up some of the minor service issues at Zooroona, this place will shine like the gem that it already is!
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2014,5/23/2014,66,38,2,5,3>I have attended 10+ parties here over the last 6 years and have been thoroughly impressed by the job they do. The staff is friendly, the place is clean (a tough task with 4-10 year olds around regularly), and the inflatables are in good shape.The most amazing part of the party experience is how organized they can keep a group of preschoolers. To have 15 little kids open presents, eat cake, and play in an organized fashion is quite a feat. They even have one of their staff write down who gave each presents so you can send thank you cards to the right people.The only downside for parents is the noise level is high, and there only a couple places to sit near the inflatables. Combine the sound from fans and screaming kids and you have a recipe for a needed nap for adults. This is a function of the activity rather than facility, but more seating could help.
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2014,5/22/2014,13,64,2,5,3>The best donuts I have ever tasted in my life, hands down. They are perfectly rich with a slight bit of crispiness to them that validates their freshness. You just don't get that at Dunkin' Donuts, Tim Hortons, etc. And at just $0.85 a pop, man, you can go nuts here. They have all the classics, but offer a wide variety of unique creations as well. Some of my favorites are the "candy re-creations": Snickers donut, Milky Way donut, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup donut. These nationally renowned treats live up to every ounce of good word. The walk-up-style service is quick and efficient so you'll be on your way to sinking teeth into one of these delicious morsels in no time. This place is a Kalamazoo classic.
<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/12/2014,5/21/2014,47,73,2,5,3>Okay, so, let's use a metaphor: the Kalamazoo Y is the Walmart of gyms. Like when I go to Walmart, it has everything I need and at good prices, but I feel a little skeevy going there and some of the other customers are...interesting. Also, I can't always find what I need because it's not in the location that makes sense.This Y building is the most convoluted space I've ever seen. I think it may have been built by hobbits (though it lacks the cool rounded doorways). You have to go through closed off hallways to get anywhere, and even though I've been going there a few weeks now, I still worry  that each hallway may trap me or dump me out in a different location than I intended.The cardio equipment is pretty good, though I'm more of a weights-kettlebell-ropes-band-box jump type girl (wish they had more of that stuff). The weight room is far away from the cardio, making it hard to do some of the circuits I'd like to do. The price of membership is worth the discount on classes and camps alone. There is fabulous programming for kids and adults alike, with great instructors who are enthusiastic about their jobs. There is a great community feel to the Y, so that is a bonus. I've definitely witnessed people standing around and chatting for their entire "workout," which, hey, if that is boosting their mental and emotional health, then good for them!The Tot Spot is cheap ($1/visit/family), though it's pretty crowded and smells like vinegar.
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/31/2014,5/20/2014,4,98,,5,3>Mr. MVP was in a crash last Friday and we had our beloved VW taken to DeGroot Carstar on a whim when the insurance company recommended them the Monday after the accident for an inspection. We were under a time crunch and not only were the staff ultra kind about that, but they were seriously nice when it came to giving us the bad news that our favorite car was being totaled.If we ever, god forbid, we need car repairs in the future, we will be calling the team at DeGroot Carstar.
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2010,5/17/2014,12,28,1,5,2>This place has been around for over 35 years.  Best Olive Burger Deluxe on the planet... granted, this place has more memories for me than Michael Jackson's Thriller album.  Classic drive-in overlooking beautiful West Lake.  Best time to go is at night and watch the sunset across the lake.  And as for the food - best root beer within 100 miles, awesome onion rings, fantastic fries and the burgers are worth every penny!
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,5/16/2014,4,37,,4,3>Amazing service! Thanks to a tech who referred me to this place, I not only got a great deal with my body work on my car, the work was fantastic, plus Tony did extra and didn't charge me. Tony is the owner and seems to really only do it because he enjoys it and likes helping people out, it's not always about the money and I love that there are still people like Tony who has that belief.
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2014,5/15/2014,4,26,,5,5>I went there for the very first time a few days ago with a family member and when I walked in, I immediately noticed how nice the decor was. The waitress who helped us was very nice and attending. The manager also came out to greet every customer in the restaurant. We ordered the Korean BBQ Chicken and waffles, Country Fried Steak, and Raspberry Cream Cheese French Toast. Oh my! I would definitely order the Korean BBQ Chicken and Waffle again! The waffle was delicious and the korean bbq chicken was so flavorful. The country fried steak came with hash, eggs, and bread. That was nice and hearty. The raspberry cream cheese french toast was also good. It's pretty much french toast with raspberry cream cheese drizzled on it. It was okay. Definitely recommend this place to anyone!
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2014,5/14/2014,7,26,,4,4>Finally tried this place after driving by it several times per week. We ordered a small deep dish pizza and the submarine sandwich. Both were excellent. The pizza was definitely deep dish. Very thick and filling. The sauce and the toppings were good. The smallest pizza is certainly enough for 2 people. The submarine sandwich was also very good. The melted cheese was a good touch. We ordered the sandwich and it did not come with veggies or or anything so if you want that I would suggest explicitly saying so. You cannot beat the value though. Less than $5 for a decent size sandwich and the pizza was very filling for around $8. If you are looking to get away from the main stream pizza places this is a great option. I was going to give it 4 stars but I gave the full 5 because of the value for what you receive.
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,5/13/2014,1,3,,4,3>Staff was mostly young guys but were very friendly and knowledgable.  I needed a rim and they were able to special order it for me as well as change out the sprocket and put in a new tube.   I was able to drop off the damaged one and they called me to let me know they had made the repairs and could pick it up anytime.  Was not in the market for a new bike but I did look around and they have a wide selection of bikes on the cheep as well as high end bikes. They had a good selection of kids bikes as well as helmets.   There is also a section for used bikes.  I'll be back for my bike needs.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/22/2014,5/12/2014,70,96,,5,3>I visited this store as a part of my super cool yarn questing adventures across west Michigan and as I read all of these previous reviews I am perplexed as to how they are feeling.  I actually had a much different experience there and I feel bad for the others who didn't.  When I walked into the door they have a front room with discounted yarn and other items.  Nice selection but nothing I was particularly looking for.  When I walked into the main store I was instantly greeted by a couple of staff members, very friendly.  I stated that I had never been to the store so they proceeded to let me know where everything was located and that if I needed any help to just let them know.The other reviewers were correct in their statements about the variety of yarn, they had quite a bit to choose from, but mostly it was wool, wool blends, and acrylic encore etc.  If you were looking for a large variety of specialty yarns this probably isn't the best location, but they do have a very nice selection of yarn over all.  During my questing I tried to keep my purchases down, but sometimes it was hard to say no.  Here I chose a nice variegated hank that I fell in love with. My checkout was also very quick and efficient, they added me to their mailing list and offered me patterns and asked me to come back.  If I lived closer I'd love this store mainly because of it's location.  It's right in the strip of Hobby lobby, michaels, and joanns.  Seems heavenly to me whenever I'm looking for supplies.  I don't have that kind of luxury up here in Spring Lake so I'm jealous!go it's a good store
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/27/2014,5/11/2014,6,62,,5,4>Dinner last night was phenomenal. Amazing flavors in the food and the margaritas!  Wife had the fish tacos and thought they were delicious. I had one of the steak dishes and it melted in my mouth. The tequila selection has to be one of the best in the area and our server was incredibly knowledgable of the options.  Some of our party thought the dishes were a bit spicy, but that's just how I think they should be. Service wise our waitress and the table side guacamole guy were top notch. Great conversation quick to serve and incredibly helpful. The kitchen was a bit backed up and Gretta seemed to be right on top of it keeping us updated and getting dishes out as fast of she could. The disappointment of the night was when the hostess stopped by at 8:05 to inform us that there were reservations for our table at 8:00. Tact was clearly not her thing and we all realized she was in a pretty crappy position, but definitely not the best way to handle especially since our food hadn't all arrived yet.Other than the hostess oddness it made for a great evening and we'll be back!
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/5/2011,5/10/2014,3,2,,5,4>Amazing food, great ingredients, and a way better alternative to fast food. The chef knows and loves food, and that's clear from tasting any item on the menu. Plus, the monstro quesadilla is a great option for vegetarians.
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/1/2011,5/9/2014,10,119,,4,3>Always good food.  Always good service.  Today I had the Vegetarian wrap and it was very good.  It was a jalapano tortilla filled with spanish rice, peppers, and cheese.  I ordered mine without the black olives.  It came with a side of tex-mex sauce, and I chose a side of coleslaw.The food and service were good, and the restroom was clean.  I was surprised that there were not more customers during the lunch hour.They have a nice selection of American food including wraps, steaks, burgers, etc..., and a good vegetarian section on the menu.  There is also a full service bar with a nice martini menu.This is a very nice place with casual dress.  If you are in Portage, this is a place that you should try.
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2012,5/8/2014,0,9,2,6,3>Great, "family" run place to eat. Food is always cooked very well and never comes out cold.The "spice" range of the food is also amazing. From mild all the way to Thai Hot and beyond. I started with Hot and thought it was great and tried Thai Hot the next time around. BIG. MISTAKE. Sooooo hot. I'll have to give it another shot some time.Reasonable prices, great staff, great food, good atmosphere. What more could you ask for?
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/27/2013,5/7/2014,1,3,1,6,4>When you walk into the place the first thing you feel is how inviting the atmosphere is. The staff is extremely knowledgable about their craft and every service is performed with care and concern for each individuals needs. There are a variety of services to choose from facials to couple massages. I had a microdermabrasion facial with a full body deep tissue massage to follow and I feel ready to take on the rest of the holidays relaxed and rejuvenated. It was an incredibly pleasant way to spend an afternoon and I highly recommend it to anyone.
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/6/2013,5/6/2014,9,10,,4,3>Asiago's is another of my local favorites in the Kalamazoo area.  I've eaten there for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and been very pleased each time.Lunch is the best and they have one of the finest sandwich options around.  Their sandwiches are very large with fresh toppings and a generous stack of lunchmeat.  I wouldn't be shocked to hear that the average diner has trouble finishing one. The flavor is great and my favorite is The Sicilian.  All their sandwiches are accompanied by a bag of chips and a small side for an extra touch.  If I really want a good deli sandwich from a non-fast food chain, I travel down here. I haven't had the more traditional breakfast fare they recently started offering but their breakfast sandwiches are excellent also. Their flavor is very rich and satiating.  The pizzas are good (not great).  They have many options for toppings and can also do other styles beyond red sauce/cheese.  The crust is tastily crafted and the toppings are good but there's something that keeps the sum of the parts from knocking me out. Again, good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get the pizza like I would the sandwiches.I had dinner for the first time recently and my wife and I each got lasagna, she with veggie and I with traditional meat.  Mine was good and very meaty.  If you want something that hits you in the face with the flavorful force of spiced Italian meat, this is a great choice.  However, I actually enjoyed the bites of my wife's veggie lasagna more. I'm not predisposed to that style but the subtle complexity of the veggie option was very good.  I'd order that instead next time. Last food note - I often finish my meals with one of their cannolis.  They're not cheap at all for almost $4 an item but they are delicious.  I normally split one amongst my family for a small treat.  Overall the food's taste and quality is very good but I also enjoy the atmosphere and that's part of what brings me back.  They have about six nice comforting booths as well as traditional tables and some hightops.  The place is attractive with mellow lighting and a unique ambiance.  It balances a refined "fanciness" with a casual attractive deli.  If you live in Portage or near KVCC, Asiagos is an easy stop.  However, even if you reside in the heart of Kalamazoo, the deli is worth the drive especially for one of their excellent lunch plates.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2013,5/5/2014,3,13,,5,3>I'm a huge fan of Nisker's Char-Grill!The burgers are just fantastic. They're fresh and the buns are home-made in the restaurant. The fries are fresh too and they are wicked good.Last visit I had a 1/4 lb burger with the Hot Popper topping which includes blue cheese crumbles. I could eat this every day.Skip the chain stores, eat local!
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/18/2014,5/4/2014,10,17,,4,3>There is so so much to like about this place. The food is above average, great really! They hold special events for the family at Christmas and thorough out the year. Interesting stuff like breakfast at LegoLand!The staff is nice, friendly and courteous!
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2013,5/3/2014,0,1,,3,2>This is my favorite restaurant! The food is amazing and the service is great. It is never too crowded (Except for CInco de Mayo). I always get the Burrito Mexicano. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food go here. The menu is very large and even has "american" food for those who are not in the mood, although I have never tried that.
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/7/2011,5/2/2014,0,16,4,5,3>This is my go-to for Chinese in the KalamazooPortage area. It's taken three years and several disappointing meals at other venues to find Hunan.  Hunan Gardens demonstrates consistent quality, fresh ingredients, offers an interesting variety of house specialties, and the prices are quite reasonable. The dining room is fairly well appointed with subdued lighting and very soft music.  Full bar.  Usually competent - sometimes outstanding - service. Sometimes my guys and I will eat in to get the full impact of the sizzling-whatever table-side, but usually it's carry-out. I like that there is no language barrier when phoning in an order, that the egg rolls and other crunchy delights travel well, and that the chef has an adventurous spirit for entrees ordered "spicy".My friends tell me Chin Chin is the place to be, but funny, I can never get in when we go there and when I have tried to call in a take-out order, first their line was perpetually busy and the next time they said they couldn't handle any more business at the moment. I got that message.  Perhaps some day the stars will align and I will be able to actually sample Chin Chin, or maybe I just won't care anymore. Thank heavens for Hunan Gardens. In fact, being welcomed by a restaurant that is glad to have the business whets the appetite marvelous more than mere reputation.
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2014,5/1/2014,8,19,,3,2>I wanted to eat here once more before I dropped 5 stars on it. I've been here 3 times in the last month, all for lunch. Each time I sat in the bar side and it was roughly 30% full. The first time I had the tuna melt and while it was good, nothing wowed me about it. It was an average tuna salad sandwich. The second time I had the French dip and it was fantastic. The bread was soft, the meat was flavorful and the au jus was perfect. The third time I had the clam basket special and it was just as good if not better than the French dip. I've seen some of the reviews about the service being slow but I can tell you each time I've eaten here from the time I've say down to when I have my meal has never been longer than 15 minutes. Wait staff is please to and attentive. Another gem in what is looking like a serious food town. Keep up the good work!
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,4/30/2014,26,30,1,5,4>I love going to Chocolate tea, especially when I just need to step away from work/school. The tea selection is amazing! The staff is super knowledgable. They go above and beyond to get you what you need! I have made numerous recommendations to friends. Their chicken salad sandwich is THE BEST!  It's hard to leave the store without buying everything!! :-)
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2013,4/29/2014,0,12,1,6,5>Breakfast here is the best and most affordable in Kalamazoo. I come here at least twice a month. If you're a student, you can get a solid breakfast for around $3. For a traditional American breakfast, look no further. The service is also fast. Marlene, the owner and head server, is really friendly.
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/30/2009,4/28/2014,8,7,1,9,6>This is the best breakfast food in Kalamazoo. They do serve lunch too, but I have not had that. It is your typical "Ma and Pa hometown diner" to the fullest. The inside is nothing fancy, but I have come here three times for breakfast and love it more and more each time. It really does have the best food and for a very reasonable price (under $8 easily, and that's if you get extra items along with your main course). There specials are always amazing and pancakes to die for, never have I had better pancakes. They are soft and moist in the inside, yet a golden, crisp taste on the outside.Not only is the food amazing, but the service is fantastic. Your food never takes very long to come out and the waitressing/waitering is flawless. They are always so kind and a great sense of humor. They are very helpful if it is your first time and if you have come more than once like me, they are very quick to remember you. I felt like a regular, when it was just my third time coming there. Just remember, they do not take credit cards, so bring cash or they do take checks (i think, one of the few restaurants to still do that). Other than that, I HIGHLY suggest this restaurant. I promise you will not be disappointed. Come hungry! :)
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2012,4/27/2014,10,2,2,6,4>We live within 4 miles and somehow haven't tried this place until today. The family and I were in the mood for Mexican food for lunch, and normally, we'd go to Battle Creek for Nina's.  This time we decided to try a new place.We ordered chips, salsa, and guacamole as appetizers.  Both the salsa and the guacamole were clearly made with fresh ingredients and tasted great.A mistake was made when the entrees arrived, but was very quickly resolved by the wait staff (my daughter ordered cheese quesadilla and they sent chicken by mistake), who brought another one.The entrees were extremely generous in size.  I had the carne asada, my wife had a tostada, my other daughter opted for the taco bar.  The bill came to $31.20 with tax for the four of us, which is pretty reasonable.Everything was fantastic and better than Nina's in our opinion the (and so much closer). We've found our new "Go To" place for Mexican food.
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,4/26/2014,91,14,1,6,4>We have still been ordering food here and they continue their amazing service! We have 4 Chinese restaurants within driving distance of our home and one delivery place that's closer but the folks at Szechuan Inn are always fantastic to deal with. A+++ service and great food!
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/5/2013,4/25/2014,1,6,,4,2>Known for their live music and taxadermied critters, sometimes the food gets overlooked. Now I love a dusty, stuffed, glass-eyed moose head  and my ears ringing after a good set as much as the next guy, but I also like the pizza and beer-battered onion rings. However, I usually go to Louie's with one thing on my mind. Louie's Black & Bleu Burger is my go to burger when I can't make my own. A hand made patty is coated in Cajun spice, and grilled. Topped with crispy bacon and a mild, fantastic Bleu Cheese, it is my favorite burger in Kalamazoo. You won't need a lot of money to enjoy some tasty food at Louie's, but you may need a sense of humor and adventure. Do not bring your timid friends who love bar & grill restaurant chains and/or who are actively involved with PETA.Update 3/12/14:Uhggg! Black and Bleu is no longer on the menu :(
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2012,4/24/2014,59,13,,8,3>Super nice people who understand quality and take pride in what they serve. The casual neighborhood vibe feels welcoming and cozy. Solidly delicious menu and really interesting specials. Great beer on tap and the only authentic Guinness pour around. My favorite in Kzoo.
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/28/2013,4/23/2014,12,2,,4,3>This is probably favorite coffeeshop in downtown Kalamazoo. It's cozy with a warm and inviting atmosphere. The coffee is amazing (love their mochas), the wifi is fast, and their menu prices can't be beat. The staff is friendly and gives great recommendations if you're unsure what to get. I'd choose this place over Fourth Coast or Black Owl any day. Definitely a hidden gem.
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/6/2013,4/22/2014,10,43,,5,4>This is a great place to spend a afternoon with the kids! First of all it's FREE! You can't beat that! The only cost involved is if you want to see a planetarium show and even that is only $3 a person. The museum itself is three levels. The first two stay consistent and the top level changes with new exhibits rotating in and out a few times a year. My kids can easily occupy several hours here without getting board. Lots of hands on and roleplaying activities. I also like that they have a separate area for the 0-5 crew.
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/6/2012,4/21/2014,0,7,,5,3>The breakfast at Nina's Cafe is phenomenal. My Dad says they've got some of the best sausage gravy he's ever had, and he's an expert on the stuff. I got the breakfast wet burrito (a huge, delicious breakfast burrito smothered in gravy) and couldn't agree more. The potatoes are excellent, and the toast was made from fresh homemade bread. I look of Nina's is old school and a little sloppy, it's definitely easy to underestimate the food based on the Cafe's appearance. Unfortunately,  I've heard it gets a little crowded inside sometimes, but I guess I've happened to show up on days where seating was readily available. My only complaints are, yes, the place is a little dirty (as other Yelpers have mentioned) and for some reason every time I've got our waitress has been slow with getting us our coffee. If you go to Nina's and order a cup of joe, make sure and get it filled up quickly before your service gets too busy. The problem is that they usually will only have 1 or 2 servers working at a time, despite an obvious need for more. The cooks are quick in the kitchen, so be sure and let your waitress know you don't want to wait longer than you should for your meal.  Overall, delicious breakfast and great prices, but the place could use a few more employees to help clean up and take orders.
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/28/2010,4/20/2014,20,122,,5,2>In the Southwestern part of the State of Michigan, there really are few organic grocery stores that offer a variety such as Sawall's.  This place was a great find for me and my wife, as we try to favor an organic diet.  It has its own originality that differs from Trader Joe's, and it is not quite as large as Whole Foods.   They have a good produce section, health care products section and a unique selection of wines from suppliers that you don't find at other stores.  However it may differ from its competition, it has a very good selection and the prices are competitive.  So if you are looking for a good health food oriented grocery store in the area, you should check this one out.
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2013,4/19/2014,6,3,,9,4>I prefer this Froyo shop over YoGo Delites for several reasons. Its location is closer to where I am 90% of the time, plus I receive 10% off every time I show my student ID, which adds up over the times I go there. They have about 30 flavors that continuously change. My favorite is birthday cake and it just came back again. Their toppings range from Mochi rice, popping Boba, cookie dough, cheesecake bits, snickers bits, small Reese's cups, Fruity Pebbles cereal, Fruit Loops, fresh strawberries, fresh blueberries, fresh bananas, cherries, whip cream, hot syrup, fudge, the list goes on and on. I love sweet foods and this place suits every aspect of my likes. A cheap price (49 cents per ounce plus 10% off with my ID), quality dessert with lots of choices, a modern atmosphere with an appealing design and several beverages as well. This place is an excellent location for any party size or even if you want a small snack after work. Love it, and can't think of any improvements I could offer this business!
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2012,4/18/2014,10,19,,6,3>Yes, it's a great place to let your kids run around in their socks and burn off steam. (and, my #1 rainy/snowy day choice) I want to mention how CLEAN everything is, and the bathrooms are stellar, too. They also have WiFi & tables, so my kids can have fun- and I can: sort coupons, clean out my purse, and catch up on emails! Long sleeves and long pants/leggings are best for your kids, and socks are required. We have had several children's Birthday Parties there, which were GREAT. They run the whole show, and the Parent has very little to worry about. (Just take pictures and chat with other Parents) They name tag each child, they run trivia games, and call everyone to party room when it's time, they even write down each gift and WHO it was from. (A HUGE help when you need to write out thank you cards, later!) They pack up all the leftover cake & soda, for you to take home with the gifts. The sheet that has all your options is very clear, and easy to understand. It's really the BEST place for kids parties around here, they really know how to make things run smoothly!
<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,4/17/2014,5,5,,4,3>I had the chicken salad sandwich and blueberry applesauce. The sandwich was huge so I just ate the chicken salad with the salad greens. There was something different about the flavor of the chicken salad- some type of seasoning that I did't love but I guess that it didn't taste like my home made. I love the blueberry applesauce! So tasty! The best thing about this place is the people! The managers are so happy and personable. There was a group of older ladies that didn't get what they thought . The manager went out of her way to accommodate-- even getting them chicken for their salad and giving them two free pieces of pie .

They have enough space that we weren't holding up a table that could have otherwise been used. Great waitress, super great food. Good coffee, too! The pancakes smelled amazing, and the stuffed french toast looked really yummy, but my breakfast quesadilla was PHENOMENAL. And absolutely ginormous. Three humongous pieces, I brought one home and had it for breakfast the following day. Reheated in the toaster oven, almost as good as at the restaurant the previous day. Super good food, will definitely be back.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2013,4/15/2014,22,92,,3,2>This is a nice steakhouse that has options for everyone.  You can eat relatively cheaply if you want to, or you can have an excellent expensive steak if you want.  Getting the brie cheese starter is a must.  It was fantastic.  My wife and I enjoyed the steak frites and the pulled pork pizza.  Both were very good.  Oh...this restaurant smells amazing too!
<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/21/2011,4/14/2014,0,12,,4,2>Kalamazoo is lucky to have such a place like the Union.  You'll find a mix of college kids, couples, and business dinners here.  This place really adds to the charm of downtown Kalamazoo.  It's become an old standby where we can have a great lunch or a drink on the town with some great music.  We love the option that the Millennium group offers us.  Amazing meals are just down the road at the Epic Bistro too!
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2013,4/12/2014,9,23,,4,3>This is by far the best Chinese Food in the Kalamazoo area!  And, we are lucky enough to live right around the corner from their Texas Township location!  The Hot and Sour soup is spot on - the perfect combination of flavors and heat (which is surprisingly hard to find).  The Moo Shu Chicken or Pork is excellent, as is the Szechuan Chicken, Happy Family, and Subgum, or Singapore Style Rice Noodles!  I am excited to try more of their menu!  YUM!!!
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2011,4/11/2014,24,45,,7,2>Rasa Ria recieves four stars for being a small family owned food haven for foodies inspired to eat malaysian-indoneasian food. RAH(SAH) is foreign cuisine touched by a honest couple who enjoys introducing Kalamazoo to new flavors and great food at a super reasonable price. The place is small-  and in the off times .....seems more like your friends moms'  living room rather than a place you should trust to cook you safe spicy calamari and tip on top of it!  They are more nice than professional, and more cooks than they are great hostess and waiters. I'm new to the area, but it reminds me of the staple go to place, you feel proud the people know your name. You feel like your in the "in".  If there is more than 20 people interested in Rasa Ria at the same time, then... you are not in the in, your are outside...the place is small!    It's close to Tiffany's wine shop. I reccomend you order a few courses (TOGO) sample everything (why not)   and grab a bottle of wine from T's and enjoy a great evening of takeout!
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2013,4/10/2014,21,20,,5,2>Knowledgeable staff that provide old school service. They actually take the time to properly fit your feet and even lace up your shoes for you.Great selection for people with foot problems too. They will fit your with the right shoe for your specific feet which makes a world of difference in comfort and easing aches and pains.
<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/21/2013,4/9/2014,12,32,,3,2>I'm a huge fan of Olde Peninsula's beers.  I would recommend sampling a flight of their beers and taking a growler on the way home.  First and foremost though, try the zucchini fries, they never disappoint. The chicken littles are also always a good choice and the pub dip is amazing.  Very good bar food to match their great beers. Much of the food I've had at OP's has been delicious though I admit I've had their calzones and they weren't worth the time or price.  Staff is typically friendly but are inattentive when the restaurant is busy.
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2011,4/8/2014,8,41,,4,3>This has been a favorite of mine for years!  Their creme brulee is the best I have had (which says a lot, because that is my favorite dessert) - I especially like to order it with the berries on top.  The Bell's burger is a great lunch choice and I have also enjoyed the hanger steak - I have dined with friends that have enjoyed the asparagus melt and the salmon blt.  The service is always good and they have a nice bar to boot.
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,4/7/2014,1,11,6,8,5>I have been to Sistas twice now, and without a doubt I have found one of my new favorite restaurants!Being a white boy from a suburban white upbringing, I have never -- until now -- been exposed to the joy and bliss of Soul Food. Above the counter/register area when you walk into Sistas in the Kitchen, the wall says "Food that speaks to the Soul," and that is an accurate statement.So far, I have had the catfish, and the smothered pork chops, as well as several side dishes that accompany the meal (pick two sides with a dinner). EVERYTHING I have had to eat at Sistas has been so amazing, including the sides. It should also be mentioned that each item is so skillfully prepared and seasoned to perfection, that I have not had to add salt or pepper to anything that has come from their kitchen.As I wrestle over the right words to properly and accurately describe the Sistas experience, I am finding that there really is not a suitable manner in which I can sum it all up when I am limited to 26 letters of the alphabet, and the totality of the English language. This is something that must be experienced for oneself.A few random thoughts and notes:They have the very best cornbread I have EVER had (hot water fried) -- and usually I do not really even enjoy cornbread, as my mother only ever really made Bisquick and it was dry as dry can be!Until last week, I had never in my life even tried 'greens' -- didn't even know what 'greens' were, and I guess I still don't know exactly WHAT it is, other than it was sooooooo good! WOW!!!The fried corn is probably the best corn I have ever eaten! It has a little bit of a 'south of the border' feel to it, with some red peppers, and other flavors that 'pop!'Mama's Mac and Cheese is the creamiest, cheesiest, most delicious mac I have ever tasted!The Candied Yams are out of this world!!! Served in a caramelized brown sugar sauce, sliced thin, and flavored to perfection, these are a must try.Finally, I'd like to mention the peach cobbler and the coffee. After planning ahead, and only eating half of my meal, I saved room for dessert, and was so glad that I did. Pure bliss. Celestial wonderment. Just do it. Even their coffee is a unique experience, as it is a dark, rich, flavorful brew with a white creamy head on it (like what a fresh shot of espresso has when first poured), making it such a complimentary addition to any of their desserts.If you are looking for a new experience, and are looking for not just nourishment for your body, but for your soul, you must try Sistas in the Kitchen. If you are disappointed by what you find, I say with confidence that you would probably not enjoy heaven very much. ;-)
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/9/2014,4/6/2014,0,2,,5,3>This is my favorite restaurant in the Plainwell area and definitely one of my favorites in the Kalamazoo area. The specials and soups are always excellent. The owner is frequently on site and takes an active role in making us feel personally welcome. He features local Michigan beers and has now his own beer on tap as well. The environment here is awesome. The owner has done an amazing job converting the old grain mill to a unique dining experience. The food is great and at such a reasonable price you can go often!
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/10/2014,4/5/2014,23,10,,4,3>This is a wonderful place for wine aficionados and novices alike. I fall into the latter group, but have always enjoyed stopping in this shop during Kalamazoo's monthly Art Hops and other various events.  Last weekend my friend and I decided to stop in to pick up a bottle of wine for a party.  Tempo Vino has a great selection so this could've become a stressful, time consuming task for me. I never know exactly what I want or what the differences are between all the various bottles and so I'm occasionally overwhelmed by having too many good choices.  However, The staff was extremely patient and helpful. They allow you to do a tasting for a reasonable price and are chock full of wine knowledge so that they can help you figure out what you're looking for.  I asked a million questions, but they took the time to answer them all and helped me truly understand what I was tasting and suss out what I wanted. I walked out of Tempo Vino a happy customer with a bottle of Raspberry Merlot in my hand. I will return!
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/28/2013,4/4/2014,11,5,2,7,3>It really looks pretty bad from the outside, but that's kinda a misnomer and I've found the worst looking places sometimes have the best food, and this didn't disappoint.It's awesome. Char grilled tomatoes, green pepper, a full slice of grilled onion and kabob beef was absolutely awesome. It wasn't the cheapest I've had, but I really enjoyed it. I'll go back 100%
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/14/2014,4/3/2014,62,64,,6,4>Mark has cut my hair 5 times now, and he is my new go to barber. Quick professional service, I have never had to wait more than 15 min. Many times I can just walk in and get a quick cut, or trim. Best 10$ hair cut I have ever had. Think about it people a good haircut is part of what makes you you. It is a quality of life issue. A first impression, I care, or don't, I'm uptight, or down to business, a little funky, or just don't care. Wherever life has taken me the barber shop has reflected the culture and vibe of my area. I remember going to Merl's with my dad growing up in rural Michigan on Saturday morning and all the guys talking about hunting and fishing. For years I went to the local barber in Harlem, NY to get my uptown fade. This shop was loud and the epicenter of the neighborhood. In Chinatown after work I tried to no avail to get a quick cheap cut. The sign on the door beckoned me in with 5$ hair cut. This was the second worse haircut of my life. For about a year a Dominican woman would cut my hair in NYC, until one day she engaged in a yelling argument with another barber at the shop as to whether or not she was making me look Hispanic. "He likes the way I cut his hair" she yelled with scissors in her hand. I sat through the cut and never went back. Indy Hair in the Vine Neighborhood is fresh and classic at the same time. Mark wields a scissors with skill. The dark wood paneling is in sharp contrast to Spotify blasting daft punk through the speakers, and the Andy Warhol Marilyn Monroe pop art poster. Now in Kalamazoo I have found my place. I debated giving a mediocre rating just to keep the wait down and the secret to myself. Check them out in the Vine Neighborhood.
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/26/2011,4/2/2014,47,68,,5,3>This is one of my favorite spots in Kalamazoo but it is definitely off the beaten path.  The place is a little small and I would recommend sitting in the bar instead of the dining room because it is so loud in the completely open dining room.  The bar has couches and a couple high top tables that they don't reserve so try to get one of those tables as it is much more enjoyable than sitting in your neighbor's lap and participating in their conversation in the dining room.Now to the food.  They have a good selection of small plates and a few big plates on their menu.  We like the crab dip the best off the small plates.  I can't remember the others we ordered since it's been awhile since we have gone there but I do remember that one.  We ordered the scallops and shrimp big plate and they were cooked to perfection and spiced very nicely as they had some heat to them.  However, the risotto cake that they used to fill the shallow bowl they put the scallops and shrimp in left something to be desired for me.  I would have elected to have done without that and left it untouched in the bowl.  We also ordered the duck and it was only average.  We have definitely had better.The desserts here are also changing and I've had the bread pudding which was good and would recommend.It was nice to see the owner, Shane, circulating every time we have gone here.  He is very involved and appears to run a tight ship.  Service has been pretty great here.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/15/2012,4/1/2014,2,16,,9,3>Best restaurant in Southwest Michigan!Food is always fresh, creatively prepared, and visually appealing.  They have some fantastic chefs from CIA.  Some of my favorites are the grilled asparagus, grilled romaine salad, the fresh fish, and the bouillabaisse.  I have never been disappointed in anything I've ordered- you cannot go wrong!  Fantastic wine list (ask Saad for a suggestion).  French-press after dinner with dessert is always a treat.The restaurant is small but to me that adds to its charm.  Bill and Saad are always very welcoming.  Very friendly, attentive staff.  Most have been there for years. It can be quite busy so either call ahead (they do not take reservations) or plan on waiting at the bar.  We are very fortunate to have such a place in Kalamazoo!
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/29/2013,3/31/2014,3,9,2,3,2>I first ate at A Thai Café just days after they opened and then again a couple of months later. Both times I enjoyed the food enough to keep me interested. The first time I went I got the eggplant curry with fried tofu dish which was delicious and the second time I got the curry pad thai with fried tofu which was also delicious! I've had their Crab Rangoon appetizer and their mango sticky rice dessert. The crab Rangoon are fresh made at the restaurant, no pre made frozen rangoons here. I personally was not a fan of the mango sticky rice due to the mango's not tasting ripe. The prices are awesome for the amount of food you receive. Depending on how much you consume, I always leave with a second meal worth of leftovers. The second time I went I noticed how much they had updated the décor of the facility. They obviously are reinvesting their income into the restaurant for décor improvements! This place is delicious and the staff are super friendly. Also, the food comes pretty quick so it would make for a great lunch date spot.
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/15/2013,3/30/2014,14,124,,4,2>First off, this is the first place ive been given paper napkins and  styrophoam containers.  Needs cloth napkins and takeout boxes like you get from almost all other Asian restraunts. Good experience at the Hibachi grill.  Started out with an onion, chive and mushroom soup.  Had good flavor but the paper thin slices of mushroom needed to be thicker..Next was the salad.  It had little dressing on it and was gone about 1/4 the way through it but it was flavorful.I opted for the steak and shrimp.  Both were prepared to my liking and had great flavor.  The steak was kind of small but the 9 shrimp added to the plate helped fill me up.  Both were put on top of a nice portion of fried rice and some vegetables. During the cooking the chef had me open my mouth.  I didn't know what he was going to put in my mouth and he ended up using a squirt bottle to squeeze some type of alcohol in my mouth.  The alcohol had good flavor but little did he know I'm some what allergic to alcohol.  Good thing my face didn't turn to red from the allergic reaction.  The waitress always had my beverage full and was quick to remove unwanted items from the table.  The only thing needed here was everyone needs to speak up.  My hearing is excellent and I had to struggle to hear them talk to us.  To both the chef and waitress please talk louder..
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2012,3/29/2014,13,1,,7,6>WOW, Stellar! We found this on yelp while driving on the highway and were pleasantly surprised. All our meals were excellent. We got the artichoke dip appetizer, the fish tacos, Mediterranean salmon, a pot roast sandwich, and a greek turkey burger. Everyone was overly-pleased with their meals. I rarely get desserts, but their menu looked too good to pass up. The bread pudding was UNREAL. Ate it in literally less than 3 minutes.The restaurant itself was really nice, great ambience, clean bathrooms, a unique drinks menu with a wide variety, and even good water! You can also sit inside or outside and the service was great. I would have given this 4 stars, but the prices are very reasonable, so I think it deserved 5. Sandwiches/burgers are about $9 avg, and entrees are about $15 avg.ENJOY!
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2011,3/28/2014,60,34,4,8,7>If you want best hot dog bang for your buck, Dogs With Style is the place to go.  The average hot dog costs no more than $2.50 (the owner informed me that he hasn't raised prices in over 8 years).  The decor is a retro 1950's style.  It's simple, and isn't meant to knock your socks off.  The hot dogs are delicious and quite filling.The french fries are fried up right after you order them, and quite good.  These fries have managed to catch the eye of a food review column or two over the years.Their Chicago dog is a variant from the classic, with fresh diced cucumber in addition to the standard dill pickle.  It also has the expected chopped fresh tomato and fresh onion.  It lacks the traditional sweet pickle relish, and instead has finely chopped pickled jalapeño peppers.  It lacks ketchup (though you can add it yourself), and does have mustard.  It is topped off with a single sport pepper and a dash of celery salt.  It's a very tasty variant, and if you like a bit of kick on your dogs, you won't be disappointed.I will be returning in the near future to sample some of their other offerings, such as the coney dog and the chili cheese dog.  Vegetarians will be pleased to know that they also offer all of their hot dog styles in vegetarian form.  When I looked behind the counter I saw that they use 'Smart Dogs'.  Also, they are not limited to offerings of hot dogs.  They also have a Chicago-style Italian beef sandwich, a 'Walking Taco' (Fritos corn chips, coney meat, tomatoes, onions, jalapeños, nacho and cheddar cheese w/ sour cream), a soup of the day, and a garden salad.They make their own fresh brewed sun tea, in addition to standard fountain drinks (Coke products).Stop on by if you're having a craving for a good all-around hot dog.  You won't be disappointed.  If you go, though.  Bring cash or check.  They don't accept credit cards.  Oh, and they're only open for lunch!
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/9/2013,3/27/2014,14,15,1,5,3>Love this place!  For the GR set, this is every bit as good as SanChez, although the menu is not quite as extensive.  Plenty of amazing choices though and I've yet to try something I didn't like.  My husband and I had a date night / anniversary / birthday celebration here, and went all out stuffing ourselves silly with food and drink.  We went for the olives (enough to bring home and snack on for 3 days), the rice ball (yummy and very filling, maybe too filling), and the beef tenderloin in puff pastry (rich and hearty and mushroomy.)  Our favorites though were the lamb lollipops and the tuna cubes.  The lamb was cooked perfectly and had a great grill flavor.  The generous chunks of tuna were fresh and melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Add several glasses of wine and we had an all around great meal.  Service was efficient if not overly warm and friendly.  A great choice for special occasions or just a night out.
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2011,3/26/2014,8,14,1,13,5>If you are looking for local, vegan, seasonal, vegetarian, gluten-free, raw, fresh foods, check out the deli selections at the People's Food Co-Op.   The deli has an impressive selection of casseroles, hummus, raw desserts, and treats, and the salad bar is bubbling over with fresh ingredients.  The menu changes every day, and they post updates on facebook on what's cooking.Instead of getting take-out or fast food on my way home from work, I've stopped in, loaded up a box with items from the salad bar, and had an amazing salad at home: fresh greens, blueberries, home made and zingy dressings, perfectly cooked tofu.... all make for an awesome salad mix.  You can even bring in your own containers, and the staff will tare them for you (less waste to throw away or recycle).  Every day provides a new, delicious experience from the hot-foods and salad bar.  The staff is super-friendly.  The new store is gorgeous.  Double bonus occurs on Wednesdays in the summer, with the 100 mile market being outside of the PFCO.My only complaint is about the prices.  I'd like to know more about how the PFCO chooses to price out the deli items.  I know some of the ingredients are expensive (raw desserts often use nuts and expensive chocolate nibs), but for $5 for a tiny raw cheesecake, I'm hesitant to fork out that kind of cash, even if the item is great (which I'm sure it will be, since everything I've had from the deli has been awesome).  The hummus (regular chickpea, and curry cashew) is fantastic, but again, for $5 for a few mouthfuls, I can make these items at home for *a lot* less strain on my purse strings.  If pricey ingredients yield pricey foods, why is the chickpea hummus (chickpeas are cheap) equally as expensive as the cashew hummus (cashews are expensive)?
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/5/2013,3/25/2014,40,10,,4,3>One of the best (and my favorite) places to get lunch downtown. Their salad bar is always stocked, fresh and has a lot of options. The deli items are so good (try the Curry Mango Chicken salad in a wrap!) ...you can get sandwiches, paninis, and any deli salad made into a sandwich/wrap...There is a hot bar with a lot of hot foods, they have a weekly taco bar, potato bar, soups, tons of snacks, drinks and desserts. They have SO many veggie/vegan/gluten free/organic options. It is more expensive than fast food/chain lunch places, but not any more expensive than other places downtown, but it's local and the service is amazing so it's worth it.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/13/2012,3/24/2014,1,41,,5,3>This is my favorite Italian place yet.I have tried many things at Mangia Mangia, but my favorite is the chicken parm!  Two big chicken breasts cooked to perfection.  A side of noodles with lots of marinara sauce.  It also has cheese and mushrooms on the chicken.Their sauce is amazing!  Lots of flavor and is thick enough to stay on the noodles.Their bread is also very very good.My fiancee prefers the baked spaghetti, but she also gets the eggplant parm on occasion.I've yet to find a better chicken parm in my travels.$16.95 is a lot for the chicken.  However, it's more than filling.  It's rare that I finish my plate while I'm there.  Keep an eye out for their specials on Groupon.If I have people in town that love Italian food, this is where we go.To be fair, I'm not a fan of their pizza.  It's nothing special.  However, everything else, including desserts are fantastic.
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2011,3/23/2014,40,60,2,4,4>A very solid breakfast place. The interior looks like an Easter Basket explosion. And little fried eggs are plastered everywhere, so it's kind of cute. I like that the kitchen is open.The omelets are outstanding. I've tried their crepes and they used what appeared to be homemade strawberry preserves (YUM!!). I really like that they have many different kinds of eggs benedict, but I have to say the tomato and artichoke benedict isn't too great. The just dumped a whole bunch of canned artichokes all over which made the dish very salty and drab-looking. Despite that, all my food experiences here have been pleasant.They do what they can for the acoustics in here, but it can still get pretty loud if the restaurant is full. Service has always been friendly, no complaints there. The coffee is from Waterstreet, so that's a big plus. Oh, but they no longer serve pineapple toast even though it is still listed on their menu. I was really looking forward to trying it after reading some other review on here, but alas...
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2013,3/22/2014,31,33,2,6,3>Stopped here for lunch today. We aren't beer drinkers, but we enjoy good pub food, and we were definitely impressed. We did have a small wait (but really, it was a Saturday around lunch), but were seated in a nice booth and given reverse-osmosis filtered water in some unique glasses. If you've ever ordered tap water at a restaurant (especially in Portage/Kalamazoo), you know how gross it usually is, but their water is good. Weird, right? But good water leads to good other things--the Pepsi is fantastic because of it, and I assume their beer and teas are the same. The four of us each ordered something different--beer cheese soup, reuben, prime rib sandwich, classic cheeseburger, and a blue chip burger. Everything was phenomenal. The regular fries are great, as are the truffle fries (though I'm not sure if they're worth the extra $2). Our friend said that his reuben was amazing, husband and mother in law loved their burgers, and my prime rib sandwich was so, so good. Normally I find those types of sandwiches dry and/or salty, but this was moist and delicious--the smoked gouda is a great choice (and make sure to put the creamy horseradish sauce on it!). I've heard that the service isn't great, but we got fantastic service from the employees we encountered.
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2013,3/21/2014,0,25,2,4,3>I love this place for breakfast! The owner is always there and helps to get people seated quickly. The service is always friendly and the food comes fast. The portions are huge, which was awesome when I was pregnant. The food is consistantly delicious and priced reasonably. Definately worth checking out for breakfast.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/14/2014,3/20/2014,112,126,,5,3>This restaurant is kind of a downtown hole in the wall that has a true English pub feel. Seating can be a bit more compacted like I've seen in British and Irish pubs and it seems to work.  My favorite meal when It's avaiable here is the meat loaf. It's a generous portion and tastes like something mom used to make. I also like the naan and the fork and knife fish (I believe it's cod) or fish and chips as an alternative. The large wooden bar area stays true to form with some great beer flavors. I saw Strongbow, Fuller's , Guiness, and Smithwick's to name a few. Get your meat loaf with a Smithwick's beer and you'll feel like you're in the UK. The bartender appears to do her best to remember the more regular customers so it's nice to be greeted with a familiar smile. Sound level is usually conducive to a normal level of conversation unless there is a musician playing. The musicians I've head there play a Celtic style so you may need to prepare yourself for a different kind of music. All good though.
<review# 246,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2012,3/19/2014,196,453,2,5,3>Yeah...I'm not throwing the 5 stars out there because of any one specific time being here or is it because they gave me some kick ass deal, but more because it's one of the nicer places outside of Kalamazoo and in the area of Portage.  It seems as if Westnedge is littered with nothing but corporate eateries, severely limiting the local entrepreneur from any space of their own.  Fortunately, CCCo. found a nice little area near the mall to call home.I've frequented CCCo. on a number of occasions from Happy Hour after work to dinner with the wife, and each time is calm, comforting, with a hint of romantic.  Food is above par.  Steak was cooked perfectly, light on salt, but full of flavor.  Scalloped potatoes were spot on, and their salmon wrap really hit the spot.  I would say their one downfall is appetizers.   Crab cake was more filler than crab, flat breads are garlic overload, calamari is standard, but I will say their spinach dip is great.  Lots of spinach, not so much fat and cream as some places do.  At CCCo. I would like to see something like mussels or clams, an ahi app, or maybe just an update to their crab cake, a re-release party for the crab cake - WOO HOO!  No, seriously, I vote for some rope grown mussels in white wine butter sauce served with scallions, fennel, a little italian sausage or chorizo, maybe some fresh parm and crusty bread, now that would be delicious, perfect for the winter months.  I sure hope they are reading this...hint hint.So stop in sometime and check out some of their deals such as 1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesdays.  My strip steak was on special on Friday, $16.99, not bad at all.  The place has lots of seating, so I don't think reservations are needed, but servers may limit the amount of tables they take on, so a call ahead may be beneficial.  Enjoy!
<review# 247,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/27/2013,3/18/2014,13,64,,4,3>I am a major fan of El Gallo Blanco.  Mexican food is my absolute favorite among international cuisine.  El Gallo Blanco doesn't try to over do it with fancy bells and whistles...it simply delivers fast, tasty, and authentic Mexican cuisine.  I have been here several times and each time I try something new.  There are so many items to explore on the menu, ranging from typical enchilada or burrito dishes to carnitas to Alambre.  The menu is simple and across the board, the food is cheap.  The authentic cilantro seasoning has never been over done, however there is quite a bit in their house salsa.  I happen to love cilantro, but I know some are sensitive to its unique taste.  Overall, this place provides hot, tasty, authentic Mexican food.  The authentic beverages like their house Horchata are also very good.  I highly recommend El Gallo Blanco if you are looking for great food and a casual sit down atmosphere.
<review# 248,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2013,3/15/2014,7,104,,4,2>Recently contracted home inspection services from this company and was completely satisfied and thoroughly impressed. I was also able to arrange the necessary pest inspection through them which helped simplify one part of trying to purchase a home. The inspectors were very knowledgable and probed every detail of the home. They spent almost 3 hours on a basic home inspections & checked absolutely everything. They also explained things in plain english and helped me completely understand what the issues were. I also had a complet & thorough report e-mailed to me the very next day. the rates were also competative within the local area. I would definitely recommend contacting Home-Analysts for inspection needs.
<review# 249,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2013,3/14/2014,31,115,1,12,4>I've been hoping for years that a theater would open in Kalamazoo that would at least be a poor imitation of Alamo Drafthouse. I was shocked and very excited to find that there would be the genuine article opening up right downtown. They offer programming that you don't find at other theaters, with a great menu and local microbrew options. Special themed movie nights with paired food items. Sing-a-longs. A strict no-texting policy.It is the best theater for movie-lovers, bar none.UPDATE: After having been to three movies here (in 6 days, no less)Veggie burger - may be the best veggie burger in town, because you can get it with pesto and avocado on it. The fries are excellent.Pizza - Easily big enough for one person, priced at around $12 so very reasonable. Approximately 11" diameter.Popcorn - I love movie theater popcorn and this is the best in town, seriously. They offer real melted butter, and they bring you free refills. No more dashing to the concession stand to get another bucket and missing part of the movie.
<review# 250,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/16/2014,3/13/2014,24,9,3,5,4>I have been going to Willow Day Spa for a variety of different services ever since I moved to Kalamazoo.  I go regularly for mani/pedi and occasionally for other services.  It is the best spa that I've been to in Kalamazoo.  It's always clean, and they use high quality products.  Karen, the owner, has recommended skin care products to me that have worked wonderfully.  The service is spectacular, it's not outrageously priced, and I can get a lunchtime manicure.
<review# 251,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2014,3/12/2014,37,9,1,5,4>LOVE their homemade chai tea lattes! Order it with almond milk! Seriously. You can't go back to other chais after this.Beyond the great tea/coffee/food, you'll LOVE the ambiance -- it's a bit rustic/chic French!You can even join their spoon club, where you get a customized spoon that hangs in the cafe for everyone to see and for you to use with your coffee and tea! Plus, the owner Darren is awesome and has lots of great energy! :)
<review# 252,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/10/2013,3/11/2014,2,8,1,8,5>This is such a cool place to go for drinks, let alone a meal.  The Beer Exchange is based similarly off the stock market.  So, the prices for beer are continually updated based on current sales'/demand.  Every so often you'll get a "market crash" where the prices hit rock bottom.  They have 28 rotating taps full of local and not so local brews.The food is quite good as well.  They frequently offer a paired menu with courses that are paired with local beers.  The bread pudding is TO DIE FOR!!!The Beer Exchange has two levels with a bar on each level.  Downstairs has dart boards and pool tables while the upstairs features more tables, a back area that looks over toward the Arcadia Festival Grounds with an attached patio.Definitely a must check out place!
<review# 253,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2014,3/10/2014,4,98,2,5,4>So, we've always really loved Just Good Food for their amazingly fresh ingredients and wide lunch selection. Not only do they have great sandwiches which can be gently customized, but they have locally sourced ingredients chopped up into different salads, soups and sides. I adore that their turkey is real oven roasted turkey, straight from their ovens, which eliminates any chance that Team VP will get sick from hidden preservatives.Just Good Food also has a gluten free option for their sandwich, which makes our life easier. Any sandwich can instantly go GF with a gluten free wrap substitution. HUUZAH! Their beverages need a little work because most of them contain "natural flavors", so we stick with water, but they do have a gluten free cookie!
<review# 254,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2013,3/9/2014,15,53,3,9,6>Sandwiches! Sandwiches, sandwiches, sandwiches.I'm never as happy as I am when I'm eating a sandwich from Shawarma King. Especially if you need a vegetarian sandwich, you're in such good shape here.I've eaten a lot of sandwiches at Shawarma King. Have I mentioned the sandwiches? In addition to the middle eastern classics they do so well (falafel, shawarma) they've got a few custom numbers that are big hits with the locals. The Shawafal has chicken and beef shawarma, falafel, hummus, and taboulleh all wrapped in a pita. Vegetarian? Try the Lisa: tahina sauce, hommous, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, hot sauce, eggplant, and french fries. Yeah. For real.Also, don't be scared to try a soujouk sandwich -- this sausage is so rich and flavorful, and it's smothered in their amazing toum (garlic sauce).Veggies more your speed? I'm willing to wager that the best cauliflower sandwich you'll ever eat is waiting for you at Shawarma King. It's way better than a cauliflower sandwich has any business being.Thank you, Shawarma King, for doing what you do. Keep it up!
<review# 255,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/8/2013,3/8/2014,47,73,2,6,4>I am loyal to Chinese restaurants...so when they close down, as did Shanghai Imperial and then Panda Forest, I am grumpy about finding a new one to love.Rice Kitchen, though, had me at my first bite of egg roll. The food is tasty and fresh, and it is delivered quickly. My husband loves their hot and sour soup, and we both like everything we've tried on the menu.
<review# 256,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/15/2013,3/7/2014,95,94,4,6,5>There are days when I think I want to take it all back--the corporate job, graduate school, all of it--and exchange it to work at a bookstore. I would love to recommend books and discuss books and plan book events and write little notes about why I loved certain books. And I imagine myself doing all of that in a shop just like Bookbug.Bookbug is lovely.It's small but bright, well-organized, and the staff is so helpful. I love that they always know exactly where the book I'm looking for is and someone in the store has even read it. You don't see this in big chain bookstores. I can go in and say, "I'm looking for a book for a friend who needs something very character-driven and strong but not romantic." They can help me with that. I can say, "I don't know anything about kids: my friend's kids love the Lemony Snicket books, so are they at the right age for Gaiman's The Graveyard Book?" And they can answer that question. Bookbug carries both children's and adult books but also other fun book-related things. We got my friend's baby a Very Hungry Caterpillar onesie for her first birthday (along with a slew of books, of course). The displays are always thoughtfully arranged. Sure, the popular books are there, but they have some hard to find gems as well. It's a small store, but I could hang out in it for a long time.
<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/21/2013,3/6/2014,66,38,2,5,5>For baseball fans out there: did you ever watch Ken Griffey Jr. swing a baseball bat?  He had arguably the sweetest swing in all of baseball: mechanically perfect, fluid from beginning to end, and powerful when he made contact.  He was poetry in motion.Such is the pizza execution from Martini's.  Each pizza is a masterpiece of dough, cheese, sauce, and toppings that has few rivals.  When they get it right, it is a home run.Martini's has always been my favorite pizza.  I WISH I could give it a 5 star review.  If they only did take-out, I certainly would.This place has some of the worst service ever.  Granted, it has been about 3 years since I have gone here, so I am hopeful it has improved.  Both with kids and without kids, the service has been slow, the staff unfriendly and unhelpful, and the table service marginal at best.  They give you 8 ounce water glasses; come on - have you seen the sodium content in your pizza? And good luck getting drinks refilled and plates cleared when you need it - the staff has better things to do than help you.  I also think there was little training for servers, hosts/hostesses when the restaurant expanded their dining room.My advice: take a pizza home with you.  Try the pepperoni, mushroom, and onion pizza or the spinach, tomato, and feta pizza.  Both are grand slams.
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2014,3/5/2014,3,5,1,6,4>I met the Cheese Lady at a recent Yelp event at Tempo Vino downtown Kalamazoo. The Cheese Lady had outstanding pairings to go with the wines This was the first time I really understood the purpose of pairing wine and cheese correctly. She also gave us information that helped us understand why we liked what we were eating. I have some particular dietary restrictions, and there were cheeses available that fit within my needs and the women told me the types of cheeses they had at their store that would also be options for me. I'm looking forward to making a visit to the store soon.
<review# 259,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/2/2014,3/4/2014,14,6,,6,4>Kalamazoo's flagship brewery and premiere music venue. The eccentric cafe boasts an epic rotation of experimental beers you can only find there along with the outstanding regular lineup. They also host a variety of great musicians/bands and in addition fun events like Beer tastings/Parings, trivia nights, movie nights, etc. If you're only visiting Kalamazoo, this is THE destination to go to. Did I mention the food is great too?!?
