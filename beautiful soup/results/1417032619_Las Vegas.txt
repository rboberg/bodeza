<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2014,11/26/2014,443,380,4,9,11>This place has even here for over 30 years and It has to be one of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas. It's our new Sunday place with friends or families. Been here three times and it's amazing every time. Definitely an amazing place and the only reason why it's not 5 is because I've gone twice and they've been so busy they were once out of country fried steak, and the second out of beef barley soup. But we did get samples which made us want it even more. From what I've had it's completely homemade deliciousness. The biscuits and gravy are mouthwatering. Rich and creamy. The burgers are made with lots of spices and you can taste the meat. Idk how to explain it but it's the rarest occurrence that I had only experienced once before. I'm not a big drink type f person but I love their sweet tea. It reminds me of mcdonalds sweet tea ad my husband loved their lemonade. I hate lemonade and it tasted surprisingly similar to raisin canes lemonade.Best part?! They are linked to a bar. Yep, have dinner and head to the bar. The waitress even said we could leave our car and we are close enough to walk home. The restaurant is warm an cozy, grandma style and the bar side is the crazy whiskey side. They also have a punch card which on the second visit gets you 10% off, the 4th visit is a free dessert ad the 6th is a 2 for 1 entree.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/10/2014,11/25/2014,561,383,7,8,9>What makes Las Vegas Cyclery so awesome is the story of how it came about!! I have so much respect for the owners and their ability to make their dreams come alive. This store is large, in Summerlin, has easy access to Red Rock Canyon, and easy to find! Group rides take place on Wednesday mornings and if you don't have a bike and are swinging by the store for other reasons, the people here are really friendly. Something I've noticed is the number of employees they have! There is ALWAYS someone to help you out or answer any questions you may have. Superb service and my go to cycle store in Vegas!
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/22/2014,11/24/2014,74,180,6,10,11>My absolute new favorite place to go.  This is even better than Rachel's Kitchen (sorry - I still adore you).  Ingredients are clearly fresh and there is even a bit of love put into the sandwiches.Big thumbs up for the calorie counts and online ordering.I first thought this was a national chain as their branding and menu is spot on.  Wouldn't surprise me at all if Greens and Proteins takes over the world!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/9/2014,11/23/2014,99,98,7,13,9>After a little neighborhood buzz on Facebook, I made it in here after a home showing. It was about 6:40 PM and I really thought they would be closed. To my delight, BOOM--open till 7. Chose a fresh fruit tart and a slice of chocolate cake to get this sweet little party started. Being the pig I am, I decided to scarf down a couple of bites of cake in the parking lot. It was very good. This is a dense cake with a full chocolate flavor, complete with generous chocolate slivers clinging onto the icing. As I'm looking around the overload of signage at the street, I see a teeny weeny little folding hand written sign that said cakes $10. Woah! I marched my butt right back in there and picked up an entire chocolate cake. Sooooo...fruit tart and chocolate cake...it's what's for dinner. The fruit tart was topped with fresh blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, and orange or tangerine--all comfortably resting on a fresh made whipped cream layer held together with a flakey airy almost crispy croissant like crust.  Delicious. This is a modest place, clearly opened on a wing and a prayer with a dream of earning a sweet slice of the American dream. It's a fine addition to the hood and I hope they do well.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2014,11/22/2014,76,51,8,9,9>We were excited to find something new on our side of town that wasn't a chain or fast food. We happened upon it one night while visiting algobertos tacos. The place was unfinished but we found a note on the inside of the door of when it was scheduled to open. We went back the day it was supposed to open but no luck. I checked couple days later but still no luck. I had a funny feeling today and swung by after picking up the little one at school. AT LAST!  It was open! I ran in to grab a to-go menu but unfortunately they hadn't had any printed yet, so I grabbed a business card and said I'd bring the man of the house back later. Ty was delighted when we pulled up to Presto. (shhh don't tell him, it was a secret) He had been dying to try it. He originally thought it would be a build your own type but the Calzones are pre-made. You have the option to eat it there or take and bake. We grabbed two hot ones to eat there ( Italian sausage combo and the pepperoni combo) and she was also gracious enough to offer a take and bake since the flavor I wanted was sold out( the pepperoni and mozzarella) . I couldn't resist trying all three desserts -  spicy zucchini bread, pumpkin cake with cream cheese icing and Apple crumble. She plans on doing desserts based on the season which is A-OK with me. The pepperoni combo was delish. Ingredients include pepperoni, cheese, mushroom, onion, bell pepper and a bit of sauce. The Calzone bread was soft and just the right amount of bread to toppings ratio. All three desserts were to die for. Tasted just like my mom or grandma would have made them. I even had Ty get me two zucchini loafs to go. :0She loves what she does and has many ideas for what she wants to do to keep it unique and delicious. I am looking forward to what the future has in store for Presto Calzone Bakery!

<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/30/2014,11/19/2014,264,390,8,17,12>Eis is a welcome addition to the foodie growth areas in the Eastern and Silverado Ranch area! a. Family business - I really enjoy small family businesses and this one is no exception. The family from Northern California has started a fun and exciting little Ice Cream Shop selling all their favorite ice creams and other sugary delights.b.  Cronuts - I did not think I would enjoy what is a cross between a donut and a croissant, however, it was tasty and I would eat these over Krispy Kreme which is in the same strip mall.c.  The Ice Cream - Not sure what or who the manufacturer is, but they do drive the ice cream down from Northern California or have relatives / friends bring it to them.  So this is a real "import".  The ice cream was pretty good and I would come back for it. Nothing particularly mind blowing, but very good, creamy and I really love those flavors loaded with all the extra fixins and bits.d.  The Ambiance - Very eclectic.  Nicely decorated in a homey amateur way.  A few tables to sit, but oddly set up and not enough space.  If / when they get busy, there will not be enough tables for sure.e.  Get over there - Get on over to this place and try it out. It is fun, it is family, it is a good experience.  A very solid 3.75 stars rounded up to four for this review.GK says, check it out!
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/4/2014,11/18/2014,201,75,11,14,12>The atmosphere reminds of Firefy- dimly lit, loud music, and close seating. It was hard to have a conversation in such close quarters, but the live band kept us entertained and we shortly got our entrees after.Drunken noodles: pick your choice of meat and spice. We got chicken in medium spice. There were plenty of bell peppers, chicken, and tomatoes...but where's the noodles? I was a little disappointed for not having enough noodles. But it was flavorful and had a perfect amount of spice and plenty of leftover meat and veggies after the noodles were gone! Thai chicken: when the server brought it out, he poured some liquid over it to make it sizzzzle! Talk about dinner and show! And it came with two dipping sauces, one was a sweet chili sauce and the other had a spicy/fish sauce/lime taste to it. The chicken was juicy and tasty by itself! But the sauces did elevate the flavors and give it that Thai twist! Spring rolls: I didn't realize they weren't the fresh kind. It was the fried egg rolls filled with noodles and vegetables. It also came with a delicious dipping sauce that was different from the sweet chili sauce given to us with the chicken. It was my favorite of the three sauces we got! They also cut the spring rolls in half, but they're as big as normal sized eggs rolls. I love how they're open late and not too far from the strip. Great place to grab food after work. And I did see a beer tower advertised for $18 all day! A lot of people ordered pad thai and fried rice when I went, so I'm gonna go back and give that a try!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2014,11/17/2014,2581,216,6,13,16>The long awaited DT Summerlin is finally here! Some of my all time favorite shops include Sephora, BCBG Max Azria, Sur La Table, Lush, Lululemon and Ethan Allen! The decor is absolutely stunning, has a very California-like atmosphere. There are a few beautiful scenic areas as well that have waterfalls, Painted Wings for photo opps, and beautiful hand laid brick. The restaurant row is nothing short of breath taking as well. Some of the resteraunts include Wolf Gang Puck Bar and Grill (opening at the end of October) Crave, California Pizza Kitchen, Andiron Steak and Sea (Same owners as Honey Salt and Made LV) Grape Street, and Earl of Sandwich. Downtown Summerlin is truly the new Summerlin hotspot. I really believe this has brought so much to our community and will continue to grow. I havent been to the movie theaters yet but ive heard they're amazing, Luxury type of theaters!
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2014,11/16/2014,265,381,11,18,10>I quite like this place - unexpectedly. A few people I know weren't really fans but after a couple visits, I think I'm a fan. Here's why:- Their drink specialty seems to be brewed tea, combined with some form of milk and other subtle flavors. So far nothing I've tried has been over-the-top. Always subtle. The oolong, for example, gives a great aftertaste of oolong tea even though you might taste a sort of milk tea initially.- Sweetness options are upfront and preset - meaning no percentage guesswork. You just say a term and they know what it means already.- Customer service exists... and it's good! I was checked on a couple times each visit to make sure my drink was to my liking.. or they'd remake it for free until I did. This is unheard of for boba in Chinatown.- Their boba has been perfect. Smooth on the outside, chewy to an exact consistency that I like. It's also honey-sweetened.- I think nearly all their options are dairy-free, meaning no lactose! I like this.- It's clean, and looks nice inside.The only thing I didn't like was the taro drink. It wasn't the flavor I expected. I think most, including myself, are used to that artificial and intense sweet taro flavor and that's not what they serve.Anyway, I think this is my favorite spot for tea-based drinks. They key here is subtle flavors and I really appreciate that. I'm going to keep trying something new every visit and keep this review updated!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/13/2014,11/15/2014,266,85,10,13,13>For those not in the know, I'm a bit of a taco lover, so of course taco taco is a place I found myself attracted to. The setup is pretty straightforward, there's the taco lines, depending in what meat you want, and then there's the side where you order grande tacos, burritos and quesadillas. Ive never been tempted to try the burritos here, but I have gone thru the entire meat spectrum  their strong points are suadero and al pastor, and I felt their cabeza was a bit lacking. Their carnitas was a very welcome surprise due to the fact that there are a lot of places that don't do it right.   The dining room is pretty spacious if you're choosing to eat in, they have a TV. It's nothing special but it's great if you have a nice group of friends and you guys are just hanging out. Overall it's a nice taco shop with good food and atmosphere
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2014,11/14/2014,239,125,19,20,19>Mama Gump had the right idea when she said, "Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." What would've been more helpful advice though, is what to do when your Fido EATS the box of chocolates. YES. I came home one night to find my dog curled up in bed after having YOLO'ed way too hard over an entire box. As in, more than one piece. So what's a concerned pet owner to do? 1. Panic. 2. Google "Fatality rates for dogs after eating chocolate." 3. Call a friend. When he says this has never happened to his dog, panic more.4. Consult Yelp for a 24-hour vet.5. Drive like a maniac. I called ahead to see if I could get a ballpark on the service, but without seeing my canine, it was pretty up in the air. The vet was quick to explain the what they had done - induce vomiting, give him painkillers, etc., then walk me through what to expect during recovery, leaving me much more at ease. More than $100+ later, I learned my lesson that my pet sure loves instant gratification. I'm pretty sure he learned his too - THE MORNING AFTER SUCKS LIKE A MOFO.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,11/13/2014,1742,366,15,22,18>I am spoiled now and will probably only view future movies at a Galaxy Theater. I don't live close to either one however I find the trek is worth it. The standard ticket cost $11 which is about the same as anywhere else. I usually go to see movies at The Palms which is $10.50 so no big deal. Unless you go to The Palms on a Monday when it is $5, anyhow lol. I love the assigned seating, I love the big spacious comfy lazyboy like reclining seats. I mean I was literally like laying down watching the movie! They have big trays where you can put your stuff as well.The staff is cool, the Theatre is very clean and the sound is Amazing as well.It was a fun experience and I will be back for sure!
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,11/12/2014,282,125,7,18,15>First off - LOVE Lily!!She is super sweet, very helpful and an awesome tattoo artist!I like the staff here. Mainly because they all seem to get along and joke around a lot. That always makes me feel comfortable. You're uncomfortable enough as it is when you're having your body needled up. This place is clean and the decor is pretty sweet. I called to make an appointment with Lily after seeing her portfolio on Instagram. I emailed her what I wanted and she was ready when I got there. I've had a hard time with people wanting to do my tattoo in all red. Some artists just don't like it because it doesn't always turn out as well - this is what I've been told. Lily said "no problem" and completed the job better than I even anticipated. They have very reasonable pricing and they're fairly easy to get into. I would recommend really knowing what you want before you go in and schedule an appt. They seem to get a lot of walk ins due to being so close to the strip. I'm glad I finally found a good tattoo parlor in town. It's hard to find good artists that are friendly. I got an all red lotus - representing my recent spiritual journey. I am more than pleased with the final product!
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2014,11/11/2014,693,1125,8,14,13>Most people know about Jojos from Farmers Markets or events. Same goes for me as I discovered them during a Yelp Christmas event. Recently they opened up a storefront in the Container Park (which has a separate listing) that is gaining them new fans. This location in Chinatown is their main office hub where the jerky is made, but they do sell their products here as well. It was right by work, so we decided to swing by once we found out it existed. The one downside is there isn't samples to try of the jerky before buying at this location. I assume they don't get that many people at this location and mainly is just their office. We decided to get wasabi flavor jerky, peppered strips, carloca carne asada jerky, and their jerk spice dry rub. The Carne asada and dry rub we threw into a gift for someone so I can't comment on that, but the other two were for us. The wasabi flavor was nice, but it was a tad salty for me. Their jerky isn't the thin sheet style, but more like chunks or nuggets which is tender and a bit more moist.The strips is pounded out meat that's formed into shape which is normally not my thing as most of them just taste fake and low quality, but I like their quality. I think I may like it better than the chunk jerky even.Support your locals! This is definitely better than average product and it really doesn't cost more than store brand jerky that is levels below in quality.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2014,11/10/2014,238,101,13,17,16>My husband and I have been here several times already and like this place. We have always been greeted promptly at the door & seated quickly. We have had Kaitlin several times as our server and has always been on top of things. The food has been pretty good too! This last time we ordered and shared a house salad, the blackened chicken quesadilla and the venison chili burger. The favorites for me were the fresh & crisp house salad and the quesadilla. The venison burger was good but I wasn't a fan of the chili on top of it. In the past we've had the meaty wings, the Philly cheesesteak, Poblano Chicken as entrees. We've also had a large group here where we passed appetizers. The fried pickles, pork sliders & mozzarella sticks were all a big hit.  One of these times I'm going to get Mom's Pot Roast. The smell alone makes your mouth water. As far as beverages, you can go wrong with a frozen mug of beer. My personal favorite is the Knotty Brunette. A great amber beer which you can get lady or man size. Being this location has had the hardest time keeping occupants I'm glad to see something here that will stay for quite some time.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,11/9/2014,1421,143,11,21,22>My whole family comes to Dr. Tran and I recently had the pleasure of seeing her myself. The location is perfectly convenient and seeing all the 5 star reviews from reputable Yelpers is a plus!Dr. Tran's office certainly earns a 5 star review. They are open late until 7pm some nights which is great for people with regular work schedules. They have a large selection of frames and their contact lense pricing is better than Costco. The staff is friendly and very accomodating. I had the pleasure of chatting with Tom, who was a delight and offered me the best deal on my contacts.Dr. Tran is very knowledgeable and thorough in her exam. She was helpful in answering my questions and concerns;  she even gave me good info on a future laser correction procedure that I'm still getting up the nerve to do (being awake and coherent while looking into a laser beam is not the easiest concept for me to embrace yet). What's great about Dr. Tran is that she also looks ahead to offer you the best solution that takes into consideration factors like your age, your habits and lifestyle. For example, she recommended I under correct one eye so that it doesn't impede on my close up vision possibly reducing future dependancy on reading glasses. I will continue to see Dr. Tran and entrust her to be my co-doctor once I'm ready for Lasik.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2014,11/8/2014,396,129,7,8,10>I was craving tamales and found this place on a Yelp notification highlighting local Mexican restaurants with a great tamales selection.  Something in the highlight made this restaurant stand out.Viva is located in a strip mall, which I will warn is towards the back corner.  We came in the wrong side of the complex and had to drive around to find it.  From the outside it looks like a fast food place, and I was quick to become reserved about my choice.  The owner greeted us when we walked in.  He actually took the menus from the hostess and seated us himself, which I thought set an excellent tone for our dining experience.  We were immediately asked for a drink selection and the margaritas (@ $7.95 a piece) were recommended.  We chose the strawberry and regular margaritas.  The strawberry was good, the regular margarita was not...don't recommend anyone try it.  :/The inside of the restaurant doesn't match the outside at all...so don't be judgmental!  The decor is beautiful.  There is a running water feature and traditional Mexican music in the background.The menu is extensive.  If you are craving it, they probably have it.  There is a whole page of drink options, appetizers and multiple pages of entrees.  I was disappointed in their tamales selection...there was only one and it was on their "make your own combo".  They offer a brunch menu on the weekends only.  It had a nice variety and included a small mimosa or margarita.  The back page of their menu book listed all their homemade salsas.  They offer a sampling of each for a small amount, I think it was like $2.95.  They bring chips, bean dip and salsa when you are seated.  The chips were standard quality, but fresh and crispy.  The salsa had small pieces of onion, cilantro and pepper in it.  Again not the best I've had, but it was flavorful.  The best part was the plate of grilled jalapeño peppers and onions.  They were AWESOME!  Their Fideo soup was good, but not the most flavorful I have had.  The carne asada quesadilla was very flavorful and large enough for 2 people.  It didn't come with any sides, just a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.   In summary, not a bad place at all.  I would have preferred to give 3.5 stars.  The service was good, the food was good and the atmosphere very nice.  The prices were pretty high.  Most entrees were $15.95 and up.  For the size of the margaritas I thought $7.95 was a bit much.  So just a heads up that this is a more pricer place to eat.  I heard the owner previously had the Viva location on Rainbow, which closed, so I hope this reincarnated location is more successful.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/22/2014,11/7/2014,141,253,7,15,9>Even though the serve yourself bar tap system no longer works, The Bacon Bar was still an awesome experience.The fiancé loved her Bloody Mary drink but didnt like that her piece of bacon got soggy (pull it out and eat it first I guess) and since the self serve system wasn't working I stuck with Guinness. On two occasions I had an empty mug for 10 to 15 minutes before I gave up and asked for a water and then the tab.That was the bad. So let me tell you about the 60/40 bacon burger. Its ambrosia. Plain and simple its the best damn burger I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned meat. The caramelized onion mix was divine and whatever the sauce was could be sold like crack on the corner. If this was on my side of town I'd eat here once a week.We also split a house salad. It was mostly ham and cheese but the lettuce and other vegetables were fresh and flavorful. Our friends joined us late. One works at a bar and couldn't get over the sheer magnitude of the bar. Its HUGE. If you have a large party they will be able to accommodate it. Don't know about the service since my beer sat empty twice but for another taste of that 60/40 burger I'd put up with an empty beer mug for a little while.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2014,11/6/2014,286,188,9,12,11>Ever since my discovery of this place, it has helped me to enjoy being in Vegas more. It's so refreshing to know that a place like this exists in the desert. To me, it's almost the equivalence of man's modern and miraculous achievement! As a non profit orchard, Gilcrease has seasonable vegetable crops as well as various types of fruit trees. All throughout this summer, I've enjoyed eating, picking and purchasing apples, peaches, nectarines, baby kale leaves, zucchinis, squash, Armenian cucumbers and a few other bonus trees around the orchards that you don't really have to pay for. I am somewhat ashamed to tell you that I've eaten so many of those figs off  of the two fig trees at a corner of the orchard, so much that my boyfriend had to offer the cashier extra dollars for my excessive fruit eating directly off the trees. Oh and I am not even going to mention the berries on that boysenberry tree near the entrance. Those are my little Gilcrease Orchard secrets but I'm nice so I'm sharing this to you guys.Aside from the fruit, my boyfriend and I love to take strolls among rows and rows of fruit trees and vegetable patches. It's wonderful to walk around this place, with the breath-taking mountain backdrop and the vast and beautiful blue sky.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/10/2014,11/5/2014,482,363,11,15,14>The restaurant is gorgeous: red brick, floor-to-ceiling windows, mason jar chandeliers, wooden barrels, and local artist paintings. It's elegant and modern, yet casual. You can have a nice dinner or a casual lunch. I also love sitting at the bar with the very friendly bartenders! Oh, and the food is delicious!Kansas City Style Burnt Ends ($10.95): Beef brisket point, maple bark, 'cue #1, Pullman loaf, Nevada Brining Company pickles. Apparently I'm late to the delicious game that is burnt ends, but now that I've had them, I'm not letting them out of my sight! I've had this dish twice and oh my gosh, it is GOOOOD. I mean, REALLY GOOD. Highly recommended!Crispy Fried Chicken Wings ($9.95): The wings have a great batter that is truly crispy and very flavorful and the chicken was moist. They're served with celery and carrot ribbons and spicy ranch. All very yummy. I really didn't expect to like this dish so much, but it's one of the better wings I've had.Devil'd Eggs ($5.95): Gherkins, Dijon mustard, topped with chicken skin cracklings. I love deviled eggs and these are great. I love the flavor of their yolk mixture and the crispy cracklings lend a nice texture against the creaminess. Another fantastic choice for shared bites or bar food.Fried Green Tomato Salad ($12.95): Red onion, country ham, goat cheese, lemon caper and olive oil dressing. The green tomatoes had a nice texture (it wasn't mushy, which would've been disastrous). The batter was fantastic and held up with the dressing. All the ingredients worked really well together - the crunchy and aromatic onion, a little saltiness from the ham (thinly sliced like prosciutto), and the tart goat cheese.Dry Rubbed Spareribs: Slow-smoked with a dry rub; finished on the grill. Delicious. I absolutely love the smoky sweet flavor of the meat. Serious yum.Mopped Baby Back Ribs: Slow-smoked pork baby back ribs; mopped with 'cue #2. I usually go for spareribs, but the barbecue sauce on this one made me a fan. Oh, and it was tender. I still like dry rubs on meat better, but this sauced rib is just as delicious.Louisiana Hot Links: Nice snap and unique flavor. It's also not too spicy. Overall, good sausage.Chili of All Chilis ($13.95): Ground beef, smoked pork, smoked beef brisket, red beans; served on corn cake. I'm pretty picky about chili and I can't even tell you anywhere I actually enjoy it...until now! The smoked meats really add to this dish and I love that the chili isn't too sweet (that drives me crazy). Also, the corn cake is so, so good!Fries with Alabama White Sauce ($4.95): I know, they're "just fries," but I truly LOVE these fries. They're delicious and that sauce is addicting! I wouldn't mind hanging out at the bar and munching on these all day.Sides: Macaroni and Cheese, Hoppin John, and Collard Greens in Pot Liquor are all solid choices and really delicious. I don't normally endorse "mac n' cheese," but I like theirs; it's not too heavy and it has a nice balance of flavors. The Hoppin John is their version of a dirty rice or rice and beans and I really enjoyed it. Another dish that I could just keep eating. To round it off, collard greens - just yum. I love that it wasn't just a pile of green goo; it was distinguishable pieces of collard greens that still had bite, but deliciously soaked in pot liquor.At their grand opening event, I tried the Boiled Peanut Hummus (fantastic and so fresh; tasted just like hummus I make at home!), Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich (yummy; tender meat), Southern Style Chicken Sandwich (SO good! I'm definitely ordering this during lunch!), Fried Pumpkin Pie (light, flaky pastry with creamy pumpkin filling - yum! It was also not too sweet!), and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cluster (creamy PB center of chocolate with nuts; good stuff). Their cocktails are fantastic! My favorites: Apple Mint Julep (J.P. Wiser's Rye Whiskey, mint, mint simple syrup, apple juice) and Cucumber Corpse (Prairie Cucumber Vodka, Grande Absente Absinthe, St. Germain Elderflower, cucumber, lemonade).
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2014,11/4/2014,235,106,20,21,21>How does one start their Centennial revue? Which venue does one choose to mark the occasion? How many other factors can possible come together to make this the hardest revue of my Yelp career?...and will I ever be able to regain my sanity?I am told that a great work of art is never truly finished, that the work never ends. After just one visit to Soho Japanese Restaurant, I now understand what that means.Clearly the great Yelpers of Las Vegas have collectively cried out the praises of this understated little gem in the southwest valley. Not only does it rank top among sushi restaurants in Las Vegas, it ranks tops among ALL restaurants in Las Vegas. That little tidbit has to be making some of this town's "legendary" chefs red in the face. Someone should tell those people at Michelin they are dinosaurs - no wait, never-mind, let them figure it out.You see when it comes down to it, it's quite simple - if you do something great, people will notice. And it's clear, Soho does great better than anyone in Vegas.The first thing you notice when you walk into Soho is that no world renowned restaurant decor consultancy group was brought in to "class the place up", like they do in most 5 star restaurants. Soho is a simple, friendly, comfortable and welcoming environment - a 5 star restaurant that won't make you feel like you're not good enough to be there (what a concept.)The staff are regular people, just like you and me. But management is obviously treating these people with a little respect because it's quite clear they all love working there - it shows in absolutely everything they do. Imagine great service at a 5 star restaurant from friendly people who don't look down their nose at you (are you guys starting to see a trend here?)But you really don't appreciate how good you have it until the food arrives. It's easy to get so comfortable here that you can forget you are about to partake in one amazing meal. All that changes once you take the first bite. For us it was the Uni Trio - just Wow! (Thank you sir, may I please have another.)I know what you're thinking, what does a boy who grew up in Fargo, North Dakota know about sushi? Wouldn't he be dead last on the list of people you should trust on the subject? (Hey Buddy, you forgot to cook this!) Fair enough.The truth is, you're just going to have to decide for yourself. No amount of banter from me is going to change your mind,so I'll leave that up to the marvelous people at Soho, they are better suited to the task. Whew! One hundred down, and ready for round two. Go Yelp!
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2014,11/3/2014,156,125,9,9,8>Oh Tacos El Gordo. Really sucks that you're located on Las Vegas Blvd where every tourist and their mom wants to try your delicious tacos. And it also sucks that you have bad air circulation, barely any AC, and barely any place to park. However, your tacos are the boooommbbb diggity and this is why you deserve all the stars. Nothing about the food needs to be changed... the adobada, lengua, and tripa tacos are all seasoned perfectly and melt-in-you-mouth and I would recommend them to anyone. What you do need to change is the ordering process. Long lines with bad air circulation and sweaty people do not make for happy customers such as myself. Thus, because of this I will not be coming back.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/3/2014,11/2/2014,326,294,7,11,12>This is my go-to Date location in Las Vegas. I think its the perfect first-date spot on the strip because of thr Tapas style dining. What could a better ice breaker be than talking about which food items you would like to share?Def order:Bacon Wrapped datesSangria Sliders FiletRequest:A table on the Patio. The view is simply amazing! The only downside is that it is slightly pricey. I haven't had a bill less than $150 after drinks/apps. The drinks in particular are super what adds up quickly. They are so tasty that you want to order them again and agian!
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/6/2014,11/1/2014,178,143,10,20,13>I found this place on Yelp when my husband and I were in the area for his job. I'm a total sucker for anything vintage so this place seemed right up my alley.As for the staff and the service I would give a total 5 stars for that. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She showed us the specials and never let our drinks get empty. I also would give the decor a 5 star. It's filled with old record albums from the 60's and posters from that era as well. If you visit the restroom don't let Elvis scare you! They also have a ton of board and card games you can play while you wait. How could you not like that?Now the food. I ordered a turkey and avocado sandwich that came on a buttery croissant. On the side I had their fresh made potato chips and coleslaw. I really liked the coleslaw! I'm very picky when it comes to this dish, but their version was yummy! (And was made with mayo! Yay!) I just wish I got a slightly bigger serving then a little tiny to go cup. The chips were huge, crisp and very tasty. The sandwich was good to, but just average. My husband ordered the "Rambo" Burger. It had a combo of chesses, bbq pulled pork and an onion ring. Which sounded delicious, but lacked flavor. I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but I'm going to have to go with a 4. The staff, service and decor are amazing, but I just was not that impressed with the food. I'm totally willing to go back and try it again. Hopefully I can update this review and give them the 5 stars I really hoped I could give them. Keep on going Rambo's Kitchen!
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/27/2014,10/31/2014,201,124,6,12,10>Check if it's open first because the hours vary. Unless the weather is good be ready to eat in the car or take home. I'm a big fan so I've been several times. I probably would have tried more if I didn't keep getting the ruben. Here's what I've had:Ruben- This is the best sandwich here. I prefer rye bread. Expect savory corned beef with swiss and kraut oozing inbetween. You should feel guilty eating this. And don't eat this with another sandwich. Get two rubens if you have to.PB&J- I don't think they have this anymore, but it's a simple sandwich I think about a lot. It had spicy jelly, peanut butter, and bacon. So good.Chicken- Good sandwich, but don't eat it side by side with the ruben. It will make you think it's not that good even though it's messy and yummy. I mean it has chicken skin in it.BLT&G- thick bacon and grits patty. Also good if you don't eat it side by side with the ruben. Fried Egg- I was disappointed with this one, kinda dry. To make it better get other stuff in it.Cold Brew Coffee- Wasn't that strong, in fact it was watery and only bitter notes came through.I suggest calling in your order or coming when the weather is nice. Make sure you have plenty of napkins. I'm usually full from one sandwich, no side. Also the men that run this shack are easy to talk to.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/28/2014,10/30/2014,106,129,9,14,9>Review is a little more towards 4.5 stars for me~Items sampled were 30 Hour Sous Vide Berkshire Pork Belly, Black Bean Sauce Noodle, Beef Tataki, Chicken Pottage, and Spicy Chicken Thigh, in that order.Moko is the newest take on Modern Asian Fusion, though in this case it is a twist on Korean food. I haven't sampled much fusion Korean, but this first foray had some excellent flavors and the execution of each dish was spot on.My personal favorite was the Pork Belly - it was tender, but the fat from the pork belly was not too powerful like in some variations. While the portion is quite small for a 13 dollar price point, the tastes are top notch. In my How Korean Is It scale (HKII), I'd say it was a 5/10. Bonus points for the little roasted veggies and the underlying mung bean crepe. This could be served at any high-end restaurant, as far as I'm concerned.The Black Bean Noodle was another excellent tasting dish, though this one was more in line with its roots. I'd say it's like an HKII 8/10. I was slurping up all the sauce afterwards too. This one is a little heartier than some of the meat-only dishes.Next followed the Beef Tataki which had some very tender and moist slices of high quality meat. This one wasn't particularly memorable to me for some reason, but everything about it tasted great and the presentation was good too. HKII 6/10.The Chicken Thigh was probably where I had the most to be picky about - Don't get me wrong, it's an excellent piece of chicken thigh, cooked to be moist and tender and the sauce is quite tasty. It just lacked some substance - maybe a breading or if it was served with a tiny bit of starch or veggies even. The sauce puts this at HKII 4/10.I enjoyed the Chicken Pottage quite a bit - it was the heartiest and most filling dish of the evening and had some very good flavor to it. Even for a porridge, it looked impressive to me visually. I don't remember the last time I had Samgyetang so I can't really judge on How Korean It Is... But my guess would have been like a 6/10. I would definitely tell a person going here not to expect traditional Korean food but a modern take on fusion. I'm looking forward to trying out some more of the flavors here as a lot of them were nuanced and complex, compared to your typical Korean dishes.While I felt my meal was very satisfying to my taste buds, I did feel like I wanted more - now given I was sharing with two other people we could have certainly tried some more but we decided to save it for the next trip. If there was one thing I could suggest for the menu, I'd like some more heartier options (almost like a filler!) Moko is a Tapas bar, and Tapas often means you always have the option of paella and such, so having like a shared bowl of "modern" bibimbap or something might be a fun twist on that idea.Price adds up here, but not so much more than a typical tapas place with a very high quality. I felt the effort put into each dish, and the plating pictures on the Yelp are not dolled up at all. Big props to the chef for that and I hope the quality remains!
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2014,10/29/2014,145,143,11,13,9>My friend and I decided on a night of lusty looks and gnawing on meat as we took in Echo & Rig for dinner before heading over to the Suncoast to see the new Scarlett Johansson feature "Under the Skin"   While waiting for my friend I took a seat at the bar where I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offered the full menu.   Since we were on a limited amount of time (heaven forbid I miss any minutes of ScarJo action) I decided our best bet was to just eat there, and it also allowed us to partake in the final moments of happy hour.   Unfortunately and probably due to a mixture of too much Jack Daniels and just the right amount of ScarJo intake during the evening I don't recall our bartender's name. But he was friendly, engaging, and got our refills and food orders put in with perfect timing.   I heard him make some recommendations on food items to some other patrons, but I didn't need those as I'm a Yelper who does his research and generally knows what he wants to order before ever sitting down at a restaurant.Here's what we went with (everything was shared)1.  Fried Spinach Salad:   This reminded me so much of one of my favorite eats ever, Toro with Crispy Spinach from Izakaya by Katsuya in Los Angeles.  The spinach is melt in your mouth with a great flavor.   A must order2.  Salt and Pepper Fries:  I would have normally gone with the Yelp favorite Portobello fries, but I thought my dining companion would enjoy these more based on her tastes.  Perfectly cooked, but perhaps not enough pepper to really stand out as anything other than a batch of decent salted french fries you can get all over town3.  Brussel Sprouts:  The Yonaka effect.  Ever since Yonaka's version anytime I see these on any menu I want to try them.   These were tasty.   Perfectly grilled with lemon and pistachios.   4.  Then came the star of the show, the Filet Mignon which is billed as "Double R Ranch Sustainable Beef".   It came with a Green Peppercorn sauce on the side which we chose, but honestly it might as well not have come with that at all.   We both took a bite of the meat with the sauce and enjoyed it, but then ate the rest of it without ever putting anymore sauce on it.   I tend to think beef stands on it's own and only needs the slightest of seasoning to make it perfect, and this was a shining example of that.   All in all our bill came out to roughly $80 and was worth every penny.   Now I anxiously await a new Mila Kunis or Natalie Portman feature to be exclusively playing at the Suncoast so I can do it all over again.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,10/28/2014,390,337,10,16,15>Look, I'm Texan.  I've grown up around barbecue.  And I've found that the West Coast didn't have much in the way of barbecue when I was living in SoCal (correct me if I'm wrong, I take suggestions).  And while I like Lucille's here, that's more Cajun than the stuff I grew up with.On a whim, we found this place.  It's in the middle of nowhere, in an area you probably wouldn't venture to, in a tiny shopping center that you wouldn't notice.  But you'll notice that smell when you step out of the car.  And I mean BAM!Once that scent hit my nose, I had to know more.  Also, not Texas based, I will graciously concede that Arkansas knows their stuff, and this place knows their stuff.The staff is nice, and one look at them told me these people weren't anything but legit.  I liked the cook immediately.  We ordered a rib combo plate, and let the dining begin.It was so good.  Nice and spicy, meat falling off the bone, a big squirt bottle of sauce on the table, I ate and ate and ate, and then I got kind of woozy, and asked for a "to go".  I moaned all the way home.  Partly because I was full, yes, but partly because this place hit the sweet spot of barbecue goodness.  I went for my leftovers, and shredded bones like a barbarian.I regret nothing.Will I go back?  Absolutely.  Small, subtle, out of the way, but so worth it when it came to dining options, friendly people, fast service, and quality of food.They have something called a "BBQ Sundae".  That sounds intriguing, and I wish to know more.

My colleague and I dropped in here on a not-so-busy lunch day and shared orders of the MTO Breakfast and Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes.MTO Breakfast: This three eggs prepped any style, mashbrowns, and your choice of meats and breads. When we saw Spam as an option, we requested they just make our order all spam with a side of scrambled eggs and sourdough bread. Personally, this would've tasted bomb with rice (can't help it, I'm Asian), but it was still tasty. Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes: Three pancakes with blueberry-ginger compote, which it could've used more of; however, that's a minor complaint. Overall, these flapjacks were perfectly fluffy and delish!Service: Accommodating, attentive, and upbeat. Overall: MTO's the spot to have breakfast for lunch on this side of town.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/13/2014,10/26/2014,62,360,10,16,13>***** Locals Discount: 2 tickets for $99 *****This was a really fun show! Dubbed "The Sensual Side of Cirque", this show seems ideal for couples to enjoy together. As many others have stated, the show  is not for the easily offended. We, however, had a great time! There was comedy, outstanding acrobatic stunts, and an abundance of (hilarious) crowd interaction!There was so much to take in and enjoy. So, without giving away too much, here are some of the things I took away from the show...- You will see a good amount of nudity. - The language and joking is a bit raunchy....but fun. lol Actually I thought "Absinthe" was much raunchier content wise. So, if you can handle that, this should be a cake walk- there is a buff midget in the show that tripped me the hell out-if seeing 2 dudes lip lock bothers you, don't go - you will see some barely dressed big girls- the girls in the fishbowl were great!- the contortionist was freaky and the crowd got kind of quiet for that lol- also got pretty quiet when the two guys kept lip locking- the orgy scene at the end was hilarious!A few of the scenes seemed to drag a bit, such as the girl/recorded orgasm bit and the bondage scenes didn't do much for me either. Maybe that's all so much personal taste though.I thought the drag queen emcee was outstanding! She kept the show going, had the crowd engaged, and kept the jokes and innuendo coming! This is definitely worth checking out! You won't see as many breath taking acrobatic moments than you would at, say, Ka or Mystere...but it is a fun show to enjoy with your significant other.4 solid stars!
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/15/2014,10/25/2014,329,268,4,9,8>Love antiquing!! Especially when every vendor takes pride in their booth.  I come here several times a year and always enjoyed myself, but on this particular time I noticed a difference.  All the booths seemed to be extra clean.  Maybe they had just dusted but I hope this is the new norm around here as I found myself wanting to really take my time browsing.  Thank goodness my husband likes antiquing as much as I do!  Normally you will find some of the owners around which is great since this is also a great way to get briefed on some history. On this trip I got caught browsing through a book dedicated to the world of burlesque by none other than a lady who was featured in the book performing in one of the first burlesque venues in Los Angeles, CA. WOW! She joked with me saying that I must now think she is not such a sweet innocent old lady after all! I especially like collecting vintage hats and vintage memorabilia but am not limited to just enjoy transporting back 50-100+ years with all their timeworn spice containers, furniture, clothing, phones, record players, porcelain, jewelry, toys and so much more.  I even found a 1950's Gucci purse for $30. Its always something here as there is so much history to stumble upon!   It's always a unique experience and that's what keeps me coming back here time after time.

If you haven't tried it, you aren't missing much. That's a lie, you'll be missing the focal point of this whole review! Don't read any more till you've tried it. Wait. Finish reading, then head over there. You need to know what to have before dessert.What have we tried? A little bit of everything...Salad RollsChicken SatayCrab Rangoons (fresh crab)Moo Ping w/ Sticky RiceTom Yum soupPapaya SaladCatfish DynamiteLemongrass ChickenPad ThaiEvil Jungle NoodlesThai Fried RiceYellow CurryBasil Stir-FryPra RamAnd of course... Mango & Sticky Rice for dessert. Yes, you say you've had it at many Thai restaurants. Naga does an AMAZING job, as they do with all their dishes. We've never sent anything back, their food presentation is gorgeous, and so tasty. A special note about their peanut sauce, try it. You won't regret it...Located in a strip mall off W Horizon Ridge Pkwy & W Horizon Dr close to the 95, there's lots of eateries close by. They offer lunch specials Tuesday-Saturday from $7.75, served with house salad and soup. You ever thought corn soup made at a Thai place would be delicious? It is, and I'm not even a soup person!We've eaten there numerous times (as you can tell by my long list of food I've tried) and called in phone orders to-go. The staff is VERY friendly! At one lunch w/ Terri R, they were willing to place an order to arrive promptly as she sat down, so we didn't have to waste her short lunch hour ordering and waiting.I have noticed is at times, the food does take a bit long to come out. Usually, I'd deduct a star for this, as I'm one to get very grouchy waiting for food when I'm hungry. However, the quality of food I taste and the good service otherwise makes me forgive the wait. Let's just say it's a 4.5 rounded up to 5 stars. I still always look forward to my next visit.P.S. Their spice level is 1-4, interestingly. I don't know why, and I always forget to ask. They're also very vegetarian-friendly!
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2014,10/23/2014,342,580,11,12,10>I hadn't been to Carnegie Deli in a decade.  But after attending the awesome Yelp Night @ Terry Fator and seeing the Terry Fator Show, dining here seemed a great idea.  So Diane and I headed over, and I braced myself for Matzoh Ball Soup and a gigantic corned beef or pastrami sandwich.  To my surprise, by ordering a Woody Allen I could have both.  The name of the sandwich almost deterred me from ordering it, because I am definitely not a fan of Woody Allen.  But in the end I relented and ordered it along with a bowl of Chicken Broth with Matzoh Balls.  After I had devoured all four juicy complimentary pickles, and getting more, the soup arrived.  Two very large Matzoh Balls arrived in a large bowl along with chicken broth contained in a shiny silver metal container.  After I poured out the broth and filled the bowl, there was still broth left over.  So the portion was quite generous.  Diane ordered noodles to go with one Matzoh Ball, which I sampled, and they were thin and went well with the lightly seasoned chicken broth and really good, light and fluffy Matzoh Balls.  We also shared an order of French Fries, which arrived quite hot and filled an entire platter.But the piece de resistance was my sandwich.  It is actually larger than the standard sandwiches on the menu, which already are enormous, and cost just under $20.00.  It was g-normous (whatever is larger than enormous), and after taking one look at it, I knew I would be taking a full half of the sandwich home.  And that is exactly what occurred.  It is definitely one of the best sandwiches I have consumed: half corned beef intermixed with pastrami, all moist and warm, likely hefting at least 1 lb. of meat per half, on supple Jewish Rye (see pics).  And, it was just excellent!  After removing the toothpicks holding everything together, I managed to eat some bites normal sandwich style before resorting to knife and fork.  And, I really had to push myself to finish a complete half.  But at length I did.Service was very good and efficient.  I quickly received Heinz mild yellow mustard and additional pickles on request.  The place was comfortable with a deli feel to it.  And, I polished off the second half of that sandwich split into lunch and dinner the next day.  But even before that I tipped my home scale 4-3/4 pounds heavier than the day before.  Believe me, the appetizers from Stack at Revolution before the Terry Fator Show did not cause that gain.  Half of a Woody Allen did!I will eat at Carnegie more often, but to keep my weight under some reasonable control I think I will only order the Woody Allen again on at best an annual basis.

<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/21/2014,10/21/2014,161,172,11,17,12>Shoutout to Candace C. for her review.  Without her testimony of the Jidori lunch special, i wouldn't have gave this place a second thought.  Before that I tried the skewers thing once, but my conscious became really uncomfortable after i was like 10-20sticks deep.  It was just a bit too much.Now that I know about Jidori Lunch Special (before 3pm) I feel like i'm getting more than a bargain at $9.50. Comes with two healthy serving of Deep Fried Chicken Cutlet.  The batter they used is amazing and nicely coarse as stated before. Also included in that lunch special are Shredded Cabbage w/ a refreshing Sweet Vinaigrette Soy Dressing, a scoop of Creamy Potato Salad, bowl of fresh Rice, and alas a bowl of Tonjiru.Tonjiru is a Pork and Vegetable Miso Soup. This particular one contains mushroom, carrots, sliced pork belly, green onions, gobo roots, and nagaimo (yam/potato).  It's an earthy broth and simply hearty.  After a meal like that it's comforting knowing that i can surrender into this bowl of hope and find peace in itself.*tip* Prior to your meal they drop off a bowl of Sesame Seeds for you to grind before adding to your Tonkatsu sauce to go along with your Chicken Katsu.  Before you start muddling take out half of it or more. You don't need all that sesame and it's easier to focus on grinding at small base of the bowl than trying to handle all of it at the same time.  You'll progress much more quickly to get that consistency rather spending your time chasing it all.If you're not into Kushi-Age or any thing deep fried, they offer wide variety of Japanese Tapas, salad, rice dishes, and noodle soup bowls.  Small plates such as sashimi, egg omelet, and Prime Short Ribs Steak.Maybe not the best ikazaya in town, but they're holding their own just fine. 3.75/5Don't skip desserts!
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2014,10/20/2014,101,180,14,16,12>No roll of hundred dollar bills required! The restaurant may share a building with Sapphire but that's where the connection ends, from a dining guest stand-point at least. Sunday dinner? No need to worry about your Gammie being offended here; once inside you will never know what was going on next door. What you will find upon walking in is a very pleasant hostess, nice modern decor mixed with the classic cantina accoutrements, best in class Mexican fare and matching service quality from all involved. Reasons for 4 stars: Kai the waiter and the table side guacamole artist Chris. The head chef named Paco; this guy creates some interesting menu items and some twists on old classics. He stopped by the table twice to check in...Gordon Ramsay isn't going to do that, because he doesn't give a fuck if you ever come back; Paco does. Casadores tequila Cadillac margarita, 11 bucks; 5-9 dollars cheaper than most other places and it came in a full sized margarita glass, not some pansy low ball that others try to pass off on you. The table-side prepared guacamole...all fresh, made exactly to your liking, plentiful amount for 2-3 people. The pineapple shrimp platter; you will think you just landed in Hawaii...or wherever else fresh pineapple can be sourced from. This entree is worth coming back for; see my picture for the details. The vanilla flan; Paco's grandmothers recipe evidently. I'm not a flan fan, it's been too tapioca pudding-like in texture the few times I've had it. Not the case here as this one is more the consistency of cheesecake and was fantastic. I'm a believer, in Paco and his grandmother at least. Docked one star: It would really be 1/2 star off but I'm not afforded that luxury. The moment you've all been waiting for. The big reveal! The initial bowl of chips were stale, a bit chewy. The second bowl was fresh. The dessert arrived without any utensils and the original ones had been cleared. That's all folks nothing to see here keep it moving. All seriousness...five stars are reserved for repeat visits if they continue to impress. Worth a repeat visit? You bet your sombrero it is.

Just yesterday my mom was quoted $900 for a radiation problem at Midas (she only went there because she's super weird about going even 1 mile over on the mileage for oil changes and forgot to make an appointment here Lol). But she went to Midas for an oil change and they  let her know about the radiation issue. So she scheduled an appointment here and that supposed $900 fix was only $19. They are extremely honest! Even to replace all my brake pads were only around $300 here.There was even a time where my dad went to Walmart for a quick oil change before work and they told him something was leaking and the replacement would be $2000. Soo again he took it here and they showed him that it looked like someone poked a perfect hole where it was leaking and patched it up for under $100.Highly recommend this place!

Not bad for the new kid on the block.It was actually quite crowded for the late (12:30) hour. Only one space seemed to be open aside from the giant communal table in the middle of the room. The host asked us if we'd been there before and, as we hadn't, thoroughly explained the menu. Then we got into the menu think tank.I saw Philip T's recommendation of the takoyaki and decided to give it a whirl. It's pretty good. Nice crispy outer layer, lots of tako (octopus) inside, lots of bonito flakes, and two sauces, similar to the one "authentic" takoyaki that I'd had before from a tent inside a Mitsuwa Marketplace. The inhabitants of that tent are apparently well-known for takoyaki back in Japan, and I certainly enjoyed their version of it. The one thing I didn't enjoy too much on Jinya's takoyaki was the chewy texture on this one compared to the remarkably tender tako on the other.I had the tonkotsu assari per a friend's recommendation. It was pretty solid. The broth was very different from other pork broths that I've had, almost as if there wasn't actually enough pork. I actually used the ramen seasoning provided at the table on the broth later on and ended up with a flavor more reminiscent of other broths that I've had, but I typically never have to add any additional condiments. Anyway, noodles seemed to be a bit over al dente but wasn't terrible. The egg was one of the softer eggs (although not runny) that I've had in a ramen, and I also enjoyed the generous fungus, green onion, and bean sprouts. I do wish that there had been more than the one piece of chashu.Overall, service was solid (lots of getting checked up on in addition to the menu walkthrough), and I did enjoy the ramen even though it seemed lacking in some ways. Given the surprising abundance of ramen options in Las Vegas, I wouldn't necessarily go back here unless I was looking for ramen in the wee hours of the AM. Last call is at 2:45am, which is pretty nice if you're meeting up with a friend who's just arrived in town. Or something else. I have no clue what else people could be doing in Vegas at such a late hour...

<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2014,10/16/2014,400,1236,10,18,16>We came in during the first few days after they opened, so the staff was still working out some of the kinks. I won't fault them for that. They were all extremely friendly and helpful and there is always a bit of a learning curve for a new spot.Despite the fact that the entire staff was still in the training stages, the food came out tasting great. Chef Marc was there helping the staff out and giving them pointers as they prepared our food and chatted us up while we waited. You really see how passionate he is for his business, which was important. Everyone in our party ordered the one topping pizza, salad and drink combo. My fella and I decided to share since we wanted to try out the dessert pizza. We opted for the spicy sauce and supprassota on top. It had a nice spicy kick and the crust was perfection. Even better than the one I had at their other location on Eastern. The salad was great as well. We opted for the Caesar and it had a nice subtle flavor and wasn't overly sauced, which I enjoyed. We ordered everything together and they offered to make our dessert pizza a little later so we could enjoy it when we were ready, so it was as fresh and warm as possible. The flavors were great and I really enjoyed this little treat. Not overly sweet and had a nice savory aspect that helped even out the powdered sugar and fruit topping. As much as I liked it, I would probably stick to their savory items next time since they offer Art of Flavors gelato as well and it's very hard to me to resist that when it's available.I'm very excited by the newest addition to this complex and I see myself coming pretty often to indulge my pizza and gelato cravings.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2014,10/15/2014,303,269,7,22,9>Hoi..1st to Review!Give Manila's Best - A Taste of Home some lovin'!  It's a brand spankin' new place for some delicious Filipino eats!  Just opened about a week and a half ago.  Please check it out!I'm a new fan because:1) The owner is a cool dude!2) The restaurant is clean!  The bathrooms are clean!3) The food is good!I cannot tell you how much a clean restaurant does for its reputation.  Being brand new you would expect cleanliness and Manila's Best has it in spades.  Let's hope they can keep it up this way, I feel much better eating in a place that pays attention to proper hygiene.Like Filipino food from the Homeland? Manila's Best is the newest, tastiest place to go!  Seriously, the food here is down-home country, not pretentious, and tasty.  Yes, Filipino food tends to be heavy, but the folks here at Manila's Best keep the greasiness to a minimum.  Nothing on the line was sitting for too long or drowning in its own grease.Here's some of the tender vittles on their menu:-Rice (lots and lots of white rice)-Bistek-Pork Adobo-Chicken Adobo-Beef Afritada-Grilled Pork Belly (damn delicious)-Pancit-Pork Sinigang (mmmm....sour)-Chicken Tinola-Fried Tilapia-Fried Chicken SkinI ate all of it...and loved it!  For me, I'm an Americanized Filipino and I noticed their food is lighter on the bagoong/patis side of the palette.  Which is a plus for me because DAMN sometimes my Nanay & Tatay are a bit heavy-handed on the fermented fish stuff!  But for you old skool' Filipinos I'm sure Manila's Best has some bagoong or patis on the side they can give you in case you're looking for that fishy feeling.Manila's Best is really the best of both worlds, you can either enjoy a 2 or 3 item combo which includes rice and soup for under $7.  Or you can be a lechon like me and go all out for their special BUFFET....all-you-can-eat gloriousness for only $7.99 total!  Soft drink and tax already included!  Plus they give real plates, bowls, and silverware so you can feel like you're having a meal at home.  Things like that really add up to a great experience here.I really enjoyed Manila's Best, and they are looking for customers!  It was lunch rush today (on a Payday Friday) and the place was near empty.  So sad, poor thing!  These folks need a push from some social media.  And I am here to help with my outstanding review!So you like-a-da Filipino food, please visit Manila's Best!  Your belly and your wallet won't be sorry!  Best price of $7.99 for their lunch and dinner buffet!  You go now!I think I will be going there again tonight.MASARAP!
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,10/14/2014,146,85,11,16,16>I've only been here a couple of times so far but I'm a big fan. It's on my way home from work so it's a cool place to stop for a drink and try and win some money. The vibe of the place is cool and they're still pretty new so they're working out the kinks. It's kind of an old Vegas lounge with a modern feel. The only crappy thing is that they're hidden from view so it isn't easy to find. Just look for Wienerschnitzel, they're behind them tucked away in the corner. They're doing a $50 match play promo right now if you feel like trying your luck.  Don't expect to watch any baseball here. They don't have the MLB package, much to my dismay. Luckily, I work at a Yankees bar and also have the MLB.TV subscription. Both times I've been here so far, I've been helped by the bartender, Jessica, and she's great. Attentive, fun to talk to and she surprises you with some fun shots here and there. Update that Sky is also pretty cool and friendly. I also met Bruce, the gentleman that runs the kitchen. He's great and you can tell he cares about his product. Everything is prepared fresh and made with care. Apparently he was the executive chef at Braddah's before they screwed him over. So he set up this kitchen and he's killing it. I tried a stuffed burger with baked potato fries and it was phenomenal. For $12, you get a gigantic 2/3 pound burger freshly made and stuffed how you want it on a really good roll with these incredible fries on the side. Worth it! I wish they were open a little earlier so I could grab some food on the way home but they're still new and getting set up so I understand. They open around 10/11, if I remember correctly. They also do a happy meal at a certain time which is like a beer, a burger and fries for $5.99 I believe. Something like 1-3pm. I'll double check and edit this.  Anyway, as a local bartender, I find this place to be a great local bar to support. Screw PT's and Dottie's, support the local independent bars or you'll be left with cold, cookie cutter corporate bars that don't know how to treat their customers.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/27/2014,10/13/2014,380,160,12,22,25>I can never go wrong at this buffet. Only $9.99 with players card of course. Ive been coming to this buffet for decades now and the quality is still worth the price. Asian, Italian, and American food is served, but my favorite would be the newly added section where you choose your Italian Pasta ingredients which is then cooked to order! (I know theres a name for this Lol) For the kids, another station besides the regular deserts was added with approximately 10 flavors of real ice cream and not that fake custard crap! XPService has never failed. Just make sure you call and ask about the pricing for kids since ive been hearing different numbers through the grapevine.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2014,10/12/2014,1362,984,11,17,17>How have I not written a review for this yet?!This monthly food and fundraising event has been a nice treat in the Southwest area of town. In the past couple of years, it has really gotten busy though!Once a month, usually the last Saturday, Chaiya Mediation Monastery holds this food gathering where you can grab homemade treats for $5 or less. It starts around 9 am and lasts until 12 pm or so. But these days, they run out of the popular food items way before noon. So come early if you want your pick!You can trade your cash for tokens but it's really unnecessary now since all the vendors take cash directly.Among my absolute favorites are:* Burmese Tea Salad - I love Burmese Tea Salad and I have not found one restaurant in Las Vegas that makes it. (If you know otherwise, please let me know!) The only thing is that it's not a regular item there. It's only been available a few times unfortunately. (Which makes me want it even more!)* Mango Sticky Rice - Okay, who doesn't love this Thai dessert? Sweet rice with ripe mangoes, what's not to love? However, it's a seasonal thing and they run out fast! You need to be there early to score an order.* Pad Thai - Made to order and a bargain for the amount you get!* Pork Satay - Made to order and $1/stick. Put your order in and come back to get it later on. Some months it's super tender, other months it's only okay.Other food items found:* Hainanese Chicken and Rice* Papaya Salad (spicy!)* Curry Puffs (You need to order these a month in advance!)* Soups* Chive Pancakes* Sweet Roti Pancakes* DessertsI was spoiled in the beginning because the Husband would head out and pick up the food while I slept in. It was a nice treat finding all these goodies waiting for me in the kitchen. But now it's a much longer wait to get your food because it's so crowded. Nonetheless, I'm glad the monastery is getting so much business and visitors. They could probably extend the amount of food vendors each month to accommodate the demand.Side note: Cash only. There are tables and chairs in a shaded area, but it's hard to get a spot these days.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2014,10/11/2014,433,1034,10,16,16>Oh baby! Vegas has another Japanese restaurant that will surely make waves in the scene. It is not near Chinatown. It is not in one of the casinos. Instead it is located in the middle of Silverado Ranch. The staff is friendly and warm. Genuine service is rare. Yes, they do stumble in certain aspects, but the amount of attentiveness is inspiring. I didn't go long without refilled glasses, finished plates were removed, and a quick overview of each dish was offered upon presentation.The food is solid. I need to go back again to see if the consistency is there. If so, it would definitely be elevated to a five star review. Reasonably priced and generous are two ways to describe Yuzu. Between four of us, we ordered a bevy of items and had a feast presented to us. They course out well. Yes, we were the only ones left at the end of the night, so I wonder how that will play off at full capacity.Generally, my favorite items were all soy based. The Zaru Tofu is some of the best I've had. The use of yuzu kosho, grated ginger, chives, and their special sauce made for a well balanced dish. The Yuba Sashimi comes from the skimmed off top from the tofu making process. I might have finished off most of the plate while my party wasn't looking. I am not a huge fan of salmon, but their collar had me picking at both orders on the table. It is very generous. Picking is not a good description, because there was very little work in finding meat. The halibut carpaccio in a sauce similar to chimichurri was spectacular. Tender slices of white fish in a garlicy green sauce was almost perfect. It just needed a little more acid. The green tea buckwheat noodles are cooked perfectly. The sauce is light. Nothing overbearing. The black pig cutlet was good, just not the best. Same goes with the karaage. I would order them again, but with so many other choices, I could stick to the non meat items and fish. I am not sure if I should be happy that they are so close. I can see myself stopping by after work and eating my feelings on a regular basis.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/19/2014,10/10/2014,173,140,11,17,14>My review is long overdue ...I've been to Cafe Darak several times with friends. Sometimes I ordered something, sometimes I didn't. Cafe Darak has a very unique atmosphere that's different from any other place that I've gone to. It's also bright, which I like. They have vintage decorations that match the meaning to their name. "Darak" means attic so it's quite fitting that everything in there is vintage and old -- just like the stuff you would put in an attic. As far as the menu goes, they have a coffee menu, a juice/blended menu, a tea menu, and some pastry/cake items. I haven't had a chance to try any of their coffee stuff mostly because I'm not a coffee person and also whenever we go, it's late at night. I've got to try some of their other items which includes:Pink Lychee AdeBerryberry AdeYuzu AdeStrawberry FrapJasmine TeaGreen TeaHoney bread toastTo be quite frank, I wasn't too crazy over their ades. The pink lychee ade was refreshing but it had a slight bitter after taste, which was probably due to the pink grapefruit. I'm not sure if it mixes well with lychee. I think I would prefer a strawberry lychee ade. Their yuzu ade was a lot of syrup and I think I know where they get the syrup from. I actually have a jar of that yuzu syrup at home myself. So, I guess, to me, it isn't anything special. I could have it at home whenever I want. The berryberry ade was .. just not tasty to me. The syrup they used kind of reminded me of cough syrup at some points. Their strawberry frap was good except it wasn't blended. It was liquid with ice. So after some time, it was just diluted in flavor. I was expecting it to be like the green tea frap, which was a blended ice beverage. So it's just a little weird for them to have that difference ... The jasmine tea and green tea are pretty self explanatory. And the best part is that there is free refills on the hot water so you could refill your glass kettle about 3 times before it loses flavor. As for the honey bread toast, I really enjoyed it. The bread was a bit crispy on the ends with a soft and warm center. And the ice cream really helps out the overall sweetness. It was really yummy! They also have a cute stamp card program. You get to pick a cute card, put your name on it, and they will stamp it each time you buy something. When you get 7 stamps, you get 1 free drink. So with that, I picked a card that represents me!! :D Overall, it's a very cute place. It's great to hang out with friends, and the prices aren't bad as well. The owner is very nice. Also depending on how many customers vs how many people working, it can get slow but not too bad. Will definitely go back and try more things. From what I know, they come out with new items every so often as I follow their instagram. (:
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2014,10/9/2014,642,1715,14,20,17>Lychee lemonade and fried chicken- island style!I've been stalking this place since their signage went up in the Trader Joe's plaza months ago- they finally opened to the public today! Mochiko chicken is a Japanese-Hawaiian fried chicken that is marinated for 24 hours and breaded in sweet rice flour prior to frying. (According to Wikipedia)Menu offers a few plates, bowls, and salads-  basic menu with different dipping sauces and a la carte chicken options. Ordered The Cali plate: two pieces of chicken, fries and coleslaw, with a Hawaiian roll and a drink. Interior is minimalist and modern with neutral colors, save for a beach painting on one wall.The fried chicken here tastes more baked than fried, and has a slight sweetness with good crunch and a very fine breading. Dipping sauce was light yet flavorful. Fries are lightly seasoned, similar to a Cajun style. Coleslaw is not mayo-based which automatically made me like it over other varieties, and roll was soft and sweet.But what really makes them stand out are the service and the lychee lemonade- Sandra was super friendly and upbeat, running the counter and telling me about the company. They are also getting word out about their opening with jelly bracelets supporting breast cancer research, as she is a survivor. The lychee lemonade is alongside the other fountain drink options in a tea dispenser, and it will. blow. your. mind! The sweetness of lychee with the slight tartness of lemon, I would probably bathe myself in this delicious drink. Be sure to get it when you go!
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2014,10/8/2014,682,135,17,21,20>As the name suggests, this is not a place that screams nice sit down meal to impress a date located in a run down strip mall on Desert Inn Road, but your aforementioned date would be indubitably impressed if you brought their food over to her place and curled up to watch a nice romantic movie such as Thai-tanic or any within the Thai-light Saga if she happens to be a fan of Thai-lor Larb-ner (my apologies for the pad thai puns, alas it couldn't be helped).While Archie's and Pin Kao are familiar Thai lunch staples to the Vegas locals, this hidden gem on the east side of town excels in value and authenticity.   To start off, you automatically knock off a few bucks simply by checking in on Yelp and receiving a complementary Thai iced tea, an always refreshingly cool, creamy, and sweet beverage to neutralize even the spiciest of meals.  One then has the options for the $5.95 lunch specials which include choice of main entree, soup of the day, steamed or fried rice, and veggie egg roll or chicken pot sticker.   The standout option is the green curry.  They are not shy on spice, so my advice would be to order at about 5-6 if you like spicy, and titrate upward with the dry chili flakes at your table since that is essentially what they add to increase the spice level.  My experience with 7 or higher is that the spice overpowers the other flavors and it is not a pleasant experience, especially if you are ordering noodles or fried rice since you can at least extinguish some heat from the curries with steamed rice.  Whereas Pin Kao is heavy handed with the coconut milk and Archie's can be a tad on the oily side, the curries here are remarkably balanced and packed with vibrant and distinct flavors from the herbs and spices.  All the meats and vegetables components are fresh and well-cooked with toothsome textures.   A few items I've tried off the beaten path include the spicy crab noodle (think vinegary pad thai with bits of spicy crab), thai bbq chicken served with a side of papaya salad and sticky rice (aptly named "the three buddies", there's probably a food porn joke somewhere in here involving the words threesome and sticky, but I will keep this review PG), and the crispy fried pork (good flavors but way too salty).  The noodle soups are unmemorable and the one dish to avoid at all costs is the mee krob.  I've been wanting to try a solid rendition of mee krob (roughly translates to "crispy noodles") which is akin to hong kong style pan-fried noodles topped with a meat/vegetable starchy gravy but having a sweet acidic component and using rice noodles instead of egg noodles, yet the rendition here uses cheap chow mein noodles and drowned with a msg-laden sauce that reminds me of a premium bowl of cup-o-ramen.  I'm going to pretend this dish never happened.  Based on other yelper's photos, the whole fried tilapia topped with a spicy mango relish and the mango sticky rice look pretty legit so they are on the agenda for future visits.  All in all, a solid local mom/pop Thai joint that is easy on the wallet, loaded with authentic flavors,  and hits the spot if you are looking for a quick bite or as a solid take out option on the east side of town.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/7/2014,10/7/2014,410,224,8,15,11>Most sports bars offer chicken wings and sliders, bar top gaming, and the ubiquitous Golden Tee machine.  But how many of them offer braised pork belly served on top of house made polenta, or a braised beef short rib Philly sandwich?  Sporting Life Bar has taken a sort of casual gastropub approach, where both the food and beer selection is of much higher quality than your typical neighborhood bar, but the pricing sits far below your typical menu at self proclaimed gastropubs.I was admittedly hesitant to eat here based on some previous reviews, but either I have wildly different taste in food, or maybe the kitchen has gone through some recent changes for the better.  Deviled Eggs were basic, but at only $0.50 per egg, it makes for a cheap snack that comes out fast.  The Braised Pork Belly with Polenta was a winner, nice and tender with a sweet glaze that had me wondering if I should get another order.  I also tried a daily special, Korean style short ribs served with house made kimchi.  The ribs had a good kalbi flavor, and they were quite tender.  Trying to take one bite meant having all of the meat fall of the bone effortlessly.Beer selection here is good, with Brooklyn Lager, Ballast Point, Ommegang and Green flash being offered on draft.  Drafts I've had ranged from $4-$6; not too bad.  Bottle selection is decent too, including Deschutes, Kona, Dogfish Head, Duvel and Stone.  You can also get a flight of three beers for $10.  How many sports bars do that?Outside of food and drink, they also have a Tuesday night pub quiz that starts at 7:00pm.  On Wednesday nights they have two rounds of darts tournaments, at 7:30pm and 12:30am.  I haven't been to either event, but the main reason I first came here was to play darts, and they are serious about it.  An entire wall lined with cork holds four steel tip dart boards, and the throwing line is built into the floor; it's not just a strip of tape on the ground.  House darts are of better quality than at other bars, but it seems that most people who come here to play bring their own dart sets; again, people are serious about it here, and it's a cool spot that caters to it.While not located in my neighborhood, the combination of good food, good beer, and good darts has easily made this a locals bar that is worth driving to.  Not only is this a sports bar that the southwest deserves, it's one that it needs.  Proof that a bar does not need to be a generic, cookie cutter chain that starts with a P and end with a T.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2014,10/6/2014,299,177,11,19,14>Pre-fixe single menu + 12 seats. I'm not uber head over heals in love but Omae serves some pretty good stuff. Plus, it's so affordable it's worth at least 1 visit, maybe 2, or 3--really it depends on the menu. Speaking of menus... Omae, please. I generally don't carry a magnifying glass with me. USE NON-SCRIPT FONT LARGER THAN 4pt. My personal suggestion, Helvetica. A classic.I've been here twice on two different menus. Each had a chilled soup, a vegetable course + an entree. The chilled soups here are phenomenal. If you've never had a soup cold, this would be an excellent place to start and acclimate yourself. They're vegetable based, creamy, and amazing. One had an egg custard on the bottom which was phenomenal.The 2nd course always leaves something to be desired. Not bad just not special. Visit #1 consisted of a deconstructed shrimp salad. It was a miniature vegetable plate with a prawn for substance. Visit #2 was a half of a carmelized onion w/ miso paste. Tasty but just eh. Here's where your meal is either worth it, or not. If you're ordering Omurice as your entree, you just got ripped off--badly. If you order something more substantial, i.e. Ramen. It's 100% worth it to eat here. Omurice = Fried rice wrapped in egg. I've had many a fried rice(s) and Omae does not make the best. If you need fried rice in your life, holla and I'll steer you in the right direction. There was also a Wagyu burger on the menu which, while tasty, was not all that special. Personally, I''ve found that the ramen is a guaranteed delicious time as well as the only way to get your money's worth. I've had chicken and pork based ramen here and they were both excellent. Don't let a chicken-based broth frighten you. It's much richer than it sounds. They also have thicker, chewier noodles. woo.Call and make a rez.

Had mini pops of Pumpkin Pie, Strawberries and Cream and my favorite, Salted Peanut Caramel. Sooo good. Fast forward to this week, picture it, Sicily, 1929-kidding. Outlet shopping on two consecutive scorcher days with my pal. She lives here, but works in another state :( So, I'm her food Sherpa. $4 for a popsicle she exclaims? All natural I say. F that was the reply. So, I bought a strawberry for her and a coconut for me...and she was hooked enough to get another today. Not too sweet, organic ingredients with vegan options available and friendly people helping you. No brainer.If you take your receipt to their Container Park location, you get 10% off your purchase at Chill Spot where they have snow, Halo Halo and ice cream made with nitrogen and more. Deion gave us all the 411 and I'm stoked to check it out. So, when my friend is away, I have several places to score a non GMO/HFCS containing cool treat. Fans for sure!

Pros: -It's just $10 a month and serves its purposes. $20 if you desire massage and tanning machine privileges and other things that $10 more gets you.-No commitment. You pay monthly and cancel anytime.-Lots of cardio machines which include treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, stairs, etc. I'm guessing at least 40 machines for cardio so you're not really waiting to go running or walking.-Clean and well maintained equipment. PF is still pretty new but I'm always seeing gym users and employees wiping down equipment and cleaning. If something ain't working its usually fixed asap.-Almost everything is in pairs. If someone is using the 10 lbs dumbbells there's another set of 10 lbs dumbbells. If someone is using the leg extension machine there's another one. -Equipment are organized and spaced out. Arm equipment are grouped with other arm equipment, back equipment, chest, legs, abs, etc.-Lots of TVs at least 20.-Showers always a plus.-The staffs friendly.-Temperature and environment is set right.-Gym is open 24/7 and the staff is there 24/7.-The Lunk alarm keeping lunks in check.-Ive never seen it too busy.-Free pizza and donuts once a month!!!Cons (not really cons its more like limits or what they're not offering):-If you want to bench your options are smiths machine or max out with 75 lbs dumbbells.-Free weight barbells limited to 65 lbs.-You bring your own towels, soap, shampoo, etc. Its not a motel.-You can't drop weights, they'll scold you or you'll set off the lunk alarm. -No sauna, swimming pools, basketball courts, scales to weigh yourselves.-Cardio machines don't have USB connections so can't charge ur phones while running a long time. Sorry Android users with bad batteries.-No free weight Olympic bars.-3 showers.-No classes like LVAC, 24hr fitness, or Gold's Gym.
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2014,10/3/2014,536,126,11,16,15>My fellow Yelpers didn't steer me wrong again, as Ramen Sora was very good.  I am relatively new to ramen and finally decided to just give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised to see such a large menu as (again) I haven't had much experience with ramen other than a few times over the years. I will admit I was one of those point at the picture and ask questions guys, but the server was great explaining each one with the experience of having answer the questions a million times, but with the attitude it was the 1st time which put me at ease.  I honestly couldn't tell you what everyone ordered, but from the sampling of everything, it was all GOOD!  The building is a little small and the wait was normal, but well worth it.  I don't have it marked on my calendar yet, but I do plan on going back again soon.  This time I will point to a new picture with more confidence that no matter what I pick, it will be delicious.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2014,10/2/2014,519,1603,16,26,21>Seven adult Yelpers and two young ones got together yesterday to give the new restaurant a go.  Opened just a week, the place has a winning combination of choices and flavors.The Radar O'Reilly of our group (that's meant in the kindest way) had emailed the restaurant and arranged our tasting session picking from the most common dishes selected by the group.  It was a great idea in theory and execution.  Just as Radar procured things the 4077th needed, our Radar arranged our brunch perfectly.We ordered:  bacon cheddar biscuits with honey salt butter; country house pâté with pickles, fruit mostarda, and grilled bread; Cheesy garlic toast made with four cheeses; pimento cheese with Saltines, pretzel chips,and  breakfast radishes; smokey bleu cheese fondue with salt and pepper chips; black mission figs with goat cheese, pistachios, pomegranate seeds, and arugula; baked artichoke with Freekeh stuffing; dirty mac and cheese with burnt pork ends, four cheeses and Ritz cracker crust; butcher style chicken wings the menu describes as hot smoked, flash fried, salt & vinegar, sriracha. Buffalo or BBQ; bacon and eggs with thick bacon, deviled eggs, red onion jam and multi grain toast; breakfast poutine with two poached eggs on top of fries with turkey gravy and cheese curds; doughnut holes with dusted with cinnamon and served with a berry dip; load S'mores nachos made with graham crackers, torched marshmallows, toasted walnuts, Oreo cookie crumbs, chocolate sauce, and fluff cream; and last, banana pudding with Nilla wafers, salted caramel, and whipped cream.The foods were all good.  My favorites would be the bleu cheese fondue, the pâté, the bacon and eggs, breakfast poutine, and the cheddar bacon biscuits.  I'd go back alone and have just the bleu cheese fondue and the poutine.  If the skillet with the leftover bleu cheese had fit in my pocket without spilling, it would be sitting in my kitchen, empty and clean.  I thought if I walked through Tivoli Village just holding it upright, people might think I was panhandling--literally and figuratively.  The poutine was excellent and now I know why might Canadian friends rave!  The desserts were excellent, too, but of the three, get the S'mores nachos.Service was superb throughout!  Chef Canteenwalla came to our table and spent a good amount of time with us explaining the restaurant and the concepts behind it.  We had a group photo taken with him and he was very outgoing!This is a wonderful new restaurant on the West side and they have their good game on even though they've been open for just a week.  I can't wait to go back.  Fondue, you're mine!
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,10/1/2014,162,212,16,18,16>For my 200th review it thought that it should only be fitting that is is a 5 star joint. Here's the story:We were headed to the bank and the auto mall to run some errands. Lo and behold, we see this shiny old school diner building to the left. So we jump to you yelp app and see that it's a sushi restaurant. As most of my followers know I am skeptic when it comes to Japanese food outside of the motherland it something told me that we need to check this place out. (Well the previous reviews helped a little). there was only a few people at the bar when we arrived. I am not one for the sushi bar so we opted for a booth. Service was fast and friendly; as you would come to expect in a Japanese establishment. I glanced at the special board and they had:O-ToroChu-TotoI knew that we were in for a real Japanese treat!Here is what we ordered by round:Round 1Agaedashi tofu:Firm toru with a nice fried skin, topped with negi (green onion) just like you would find in the Motherland. Negitoro TemakiFreshly made negitoro, the fish was bright pink and garnished with fresh wasabi.Round 2Sirloin steak: Served on a hot plate garnished with a grip of onions. Nothing to write home about. I didn't come here for the steak; I came for sushi. Negitoro Gyunkan (my fave item):It's not on the menu but they were happy to make it! Same quality as the temaki roll  Chu-toroProbably my favorite grade. Right in the middle of the grades. Quick Japanese lesson: The Chu prefix means mid; so in this case mid grade toro. It's not too delicate like O-Toro but not solid like akami (normal grade). O-toro:I am not a big O-Toro fan but figured if it's on they have it, I'm going to eat it. The fish was just as expected nice a buttery. Round 3:Gyoza:Fresh and handmade! What more can you ask for?Japanese Lasagna Roll:I didn't order it; the GF did. I am not a fan of suped up sushi with cream cheese so this was a miss for me. BUT the GF liked it....  More Negitoro gyunkanUni:You have to be a fan of uni to want to eat it. The uni here was ok.. Sorry I am spoiled from living in Northern Japan where they are known for their sweet fresh uni. It was the sweetest that I've had in the valley so far. Akami: As mentioned previously; its the bright red tuna that everyone is accustomed to. Bright red, soft and fresh! So refreshing after eating so much mediocre frozen Vegas buffet sushi. Be sure that you don't com hungry as the aforementioned food will run you easily around $100. BUT TRUST ME, ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY! Some of the freshest fish and most authentic sushi that I've had next to Miko's Izakaya (which I still love too!)I hope that this review helps legitimize the sushi and experience of Tokyo Boys as well as educate the novice on grades of tuna. I put my seal of approval on this place! Eat with confidence.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2014,9/29/2014,541,27,9,14,14>This is by far the best day club in Vegas! Always crowded but they never let in too many people to the point where you get agitated and want to leave. Tons of fun, huge pool, amazing private table at cabanas and Lilly pads in the pool. Several bars with great service, only about 10bucks to check in ur items or purse/bags right by the front entrance with actual people who take care of it and give u a wrist band so u cannot lose it! I love it here, feels like ur partying with friends no matter who you are with! Avicii plays here often which is great for me because he is my favorite DJ! Always a good time here, arrive early around 11am though because they sell out often and the line gets long after 11:45am. Love this place!!! Staff is professional and fantastic as well!
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/11/2014,9/28/2014,456,203,12,9,12>Wooooooweee.. Pho Kim Long has quickly become one of my most frequently visited places during a Vegas trip.Why is that?Convenience? CheckAsian food? CheckGood Asian food? Check24-hour good Asian food? DING WE HAVE A WINNER!That's right folks. 24 hours of Vietnamese goodness. What better way to ease that hang over or cure that headache with a hearty bowl of food and a side of crispy spring rolls. I usually order my Pho Tai (rare beef Pho) or the beef or pork vermicelli/rice plates.Reasonable prices paired with good and quick service, you've had me at Pho!Lots of parking in the plaza lot, just make sure you drive into the correct one. Everything starts blending together if you are still feeling the night before.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/15/2014,9/27/2014,186,246,7,10,10>This tiny sushi bar and sit down is a great place to have a bite when you're in the mood for AYCE. It's $22 for lunch and $25 for dinner starting at 4pm. It's open tip 3AM, which is a huge, huge plus for me as a hungry college-goer! We need our after party snacks ;) Ambiance: 3 - Small, but homey. Almost too small for my taste. Sitting at the bar is more roomy than chillin at the tiny table my party of 2 was seated! Fun, American music playlist though aha! I heard everything from 90's to alternative to punk rock. Service: 4 - One thing about a small place, it means pretty quick service. I've deff been to slower sushi places! It only took about 10-15 minutes for all my orders to come out, and most everything was correct. They were also super attentive and really friendly and kind!! Food: 4 - Food was yum! But nothing to write home about. Yet, I'd still go back! I did especially love the ahi tostadas, and fresh nigiri (all of it)--which I'm a huge fan of! Not the freshest fish I've had, but still pretty dang tasty. For specialty rolls, I'm addicted to soft shell crab, so my favorite rolls always include those. (Bank & Spider are my go-to's) For dessert, you can only have one! Sadly, they were out of green tea mochi :( But I made do with coffee. Definitely interested in coming back to taste more nigiri during lunch--gotta save those bucks! Go try their 'small dishes'; it will definitely make you fall in love with fresh fish!
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2014,9/26/2014,112,130,10,17,15>It's no joke when I say that I have literally been waiting years for this place to open! After having been to LA location a handful of times and completely falling in love with the food, there was no question that I was going to be here opening weekend! I mean, I was just there this morning, and I already want to go back...To start off, this location is much bigger than the original one on Sunset. There's seating for nearly triple what the original location accommodates and it's much more open too. If you have ever been to the one in LA, you know how small it is and how tight everything is. And while I'm sure there will be plenty of days with long waits here at the SLS, the breakfast Gods have spoken and given us a location that's open 24 hours...yes 24 HOURS! Ahhhhhhhhh!Moving on to the menu, I'm glad to see that things really haven't changed. There have been some slight changes, but I think that's more just to fit in to the theme of being in a casino. There's still a riduclous amount of the things to choose from, including their famous giant pancakes and a bunch of savory items for breakfast, lunch, dinner or even a late night snack. Most importantly though, you won't be paying more to eat the same food just because you're in a Las Vegas casino. Now, as I said...The Griddle Café is pretty famous for their giantly portioned pancakes. Normally stacked 3 high, and so large that the plate they are served on, can't even be seen underneath 'em. In all honesty, the portions are absolutely ridiculous and I don't think I know anyone personally who can finish the whole plate of 3. Thankfully, I just learned that any pancakes can be ordered in a single portion. Really, all that means for me is that I can order more than just one flavor every time I come here! ;) So, here's what we had today...Eyes Wide Open - My favorite of the day. This one takes their pancake batter up a notch by adding in a shot of espresso and semi-sweet chocolate chips. The amount of espresso was perfect and just like the pancake themselves, they weren't stingy with the chocolate chips. Even after being stuffed to the rafters, I just couldn't stop eating this one.Mouthful of Yum - This one is just bursting with flavor, and texture too. There's Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, brown sugar and banana in the batter, then it's topped with their fresh whipped cream and sprinkles of crushed Butterfinger. It's definitely a sweeter option on the menu, but it's good one.Barry Yellow - Fruity, tart, fresh and delicious. This ones got raspberry and lemon mixed into the batter. Both flavors were present without hiding the other, and a great option for berry lovers who don't want something too sweet.Tis' The Season - Even though this was my least favorite of the day, that means nothing bad whatsoever. These are easily some of the best pumpkin pancakes you're going to find in town. The pumpkin flavor isn't overpowering and they aren't mushy like a lot of them tend to be. Solid choice for anyone who likes pumpkin.Between the visits to LA and these at the SLS location, I've probably tried close to 10 of their pancake choices. These are by far my favorite pancakes from any restaurant! They're always the perfect light, fluffy texture and I never even have to think about putting syrup on my plate. The pancakes really are just that good!Adding to the pancakes, this was the first time I've tried like a "regular" breakfast item from The Griddle Café. I got to taste the Sunset People which was ordered by someone at our table, and it just made me love the place even more! Basically an egg scramble with sausage, bacon, jalapeno, potato, onion and cheese throw in. Tons of flavor, not too spicy, everything was cooked perfectly and it's served with a side of amazing chile-cheese toast. It ain't just about pancakes anymore for me!Lastly, the service. I was really bummed to hear that some fellow Yelpers had terrible service the morning before. That's always a bad thing to hear and it' sucks that they had to deal with so many issues. Since our service was completely the opposite, I hope that was just some sort of opening weekend fluke. Our waitress was great, our drinks were never empty and anytime we asked for something (plates, napkins, etc), we had it in seconds. If anything, it was better then the LA location since I didn't get the rushed feeling like I have gotten there before.The Griddle Café really does bring a new, and unique breakfast to Las Vegas that is more than worth checking out. Even if you aren't in the area, braving strip traffic and the drive from any part of town is a small price to pay for an amazing breakfast...if you ask me. I absolutely love the place and will be a very frequent regular!
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2014,9/25/2014,465,217,11,24,21>I'm giving this place 5 stars. The Boyfriend & I decided to randomly try a new place (his idea) and I know he loves Brazilian steakhouses... So I steered us toward this place. At first we weren't sure what to think.. The place looks empty when you walk in, but actually almost every table had people. It took a little bit to get a table, but obviously they were busy. She sat us at a booth, which was perfect for us. The salad bar is significantly smaller than other Brazilian steakhouses but the Stroganoff is out of this world. Best I've ever had! The Boyfriend really liked the grape leaf wrapped something or other. I didn't try them so I have no idea. They started bringing out the meat & one of the guys really stood out.  So much personality. Later we realized he was the owner. The Boyfriend really liked one of the chicken skewers, but obviously the red meats were the standouts. No one gave us tongs, so it was a little weird getting the meat from the server, but they worked it out. The meat selection is similar to other Brazilian steakhouses, but I do think they could do with some sharper knives. Meat quality is good, not great but definitely good. This place is definitely a family owned restaurant with the good & bad qualities that go into that. For me personally, eating out is about the experience just as much as food quality and this place goes out of their way to give good experience. Towards the end of the night the owner was singing karaoke and encouraging everyone to get up and sing. Normally that's not really my thing, but something about all the positive energy really made it a lot of fun. When we left everyone was having fun drinking and dancing around. It was a lot of fun.
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/28/2014,9/24/2014,127,112,10,14,12>I frequent this place when I'm in the mood for thai. It's on my way home from work so I call it in as im leaving and it's always ready for pickup when I get there. The last visit I ordered the panang curry level 5, chicken pad thai and cream cheese rangoons. The rangoons are my favorite they were crispy with lots of delicious filling (just cream cheese and scallion) and they come with a sweet dipping sauce. I ate those puppies in the car omw home lol. Anyways total for everything came to about $35. It was a bit pricey for just one person but I figured I would make at least 2/3 meals out of everything so when u break it down its not bad at all.I was disappointed with the pad thai it didn't have very much flavor. The panang curry was good and the spice level was just right. You can get it spiced from 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest. I don't know how some people get a 10! I have also had the yellow curry chicken from there and I really enjoyed that. It comes with chunks of potatoes and carrots and I think bamboo but maybe u have to request that I can't remember. I have never dined in but the restaurant looks clean. The cashier who does the to-go could probably use a smile but that won't keep me from coming back.
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/8/2014,9/23/2014,425,246,12,20,16>Raw Fitness is not the cheapest place around by any means.  If however, you're looking for intense Cross-Fit / TRX / Boot-Camp kick your ass into shape and then quite a bit beyond just for good measure, then stop by and see what RF has to offer.The spacious facility is one of the larger and cleaner facilities I have come across in Vegas.  The staff is incredibly friendly and motivating.  A whole-self approach is taken at RF that is more about lifestyle living than it is about an exercise program.  RF is a serious place for dedicated individuals (or those desiring to be dedicated to something) to work hard and push themselves.  The facility is about the training and void of a studio feel with pleasant showers and amenities...this is where you come to train, period!  Additionally, some cool incentives are offered to individuals that reach their goals!  Goals are tough, but rewards are high.  Finally, they have a great heart for the community.  I first came into contact with RF by way of a yoga benefit that they were hosting, and applaud them for their genuineness and desire to help those in those around them.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,9/22/2014,426,67,12,20,21>I was glad to finally check this one off my bookmark list. I'm not sure what took me so long to try this place. It's right down the street and the pictures always looked so yummy. If it's your first time here, ordering can be a bit overwhelming. So many choices, options, do I sit down first? No. Stand in line and order at the counter. Pretty cool you get to watch them prepare your pie right as you order it. There's an array off toppings to choose from. Don't go crazy. I think they recommend no more than 3 toppings to ensure even cooking in their wood fired brick oven. They pop it in and 90 seconds later, Voilà it's done. This is the type of pizza my inner fat kid would eat everyday. But I'll try to be good and limit myself. This won't be easy. :)
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/28/2014,9/21/2014,572,333,13,15,16>A very nice and well organized display of very interesting objects.  We went on Science fair week so it was free and there were professionals at tables educating the kids on what their career path was like.  Even the author off Deputy Dorkface was there.   There is a fish tank made by the TV show TANKED.  Beautiful displays of african animals, king tut's tomb, the sea world, geology and nevaa native animals are coupled with many interactive exhibits.  I'm used to bigger museums but this one packs a lot of punch for such a small space.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/14/2014,9/20/2014,309,180,14,12,14>My little one asks me to come to this park daily. She calls it the dinosaur playground....she is actually bugging me about going to the dinosaur playground now which prompt me to write a quick review. The place is cute, clean, nice tall slides and a sand pit so kids can let out their inner archeologist and find the hidden dinosaur bones.  If you don't have a little nugget and want to just enjoy the big grassy fields, pond and waterfalls just be careful and mindful birds poop wherever they please outside of the playground area. Lol, I see many of people yelling how they stepped in something, those geese are big and so is their....you can connect the dots I hope.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/11/2013,9/19/2014,227,338,9,25,17>The ramen scene continues to grow. Yes Monta Chaya, Monta's sister restaurant is the latest joint to open up. I've never tried their restaurant in Chinatown but I know it's very popular with both locals and tourists. So I was excited that they opened here in Henderson.   From the parking lot you won't be able to spot it but It's located between Japan Creek and Golds Gym in the strip mall on the corner of Eastern/Serene.  The sign for their storefront will be up soon according to one of the servers I spoke to. As with the other noodle houses, this place has sit table service. Your hostess will seat you at a table or counter. I chose their counter on this visit. Their furnishings reminded me of West Elm type stuff. The dark woods used makes the place look more stylish and gives it a more upscale feel. The seating arrangement didn't feel too crowded.  My server said they were so busy right before I came and that the lunch crowd had just left.Server gave me 2 menus one with noodle  dishes and entrees and another that Monta Chaya serves exclusively. So you know I just had to try something off the Chaya Dishes menu.  I chose Chashu Bans (bahns). This one was glazed pork belly slice in a steamed bun. They come as 2 appetizer sized portions.The Tonkatsu Ramen I ordered is just broth and noodles. I chose to customize with add ons they had. So there is an additional charge for them.  So keep in mind your order can add up. There was little wait from the time my order was taken to when I was served. When my order for the Tonkotsu Ramen came up, oh boy, I wasn't expecting such a huge bowl packed with noodles. My extras that I added were soft boiled egg and corn so my bowl was pretty full. The noodle soup was really good. The pork had just enough fat, the broth was savory. I personally thought it was just a tad salty and not as rich in flavor as the Tonkotsu broth over at the noodle house on Tropicana.  Still I enjoyed my bowl of ramen.  I asked if there is a smaller portion since this was way too much noodles for me.  My server said I can just request 1/2 noodles more broth next time. They still charge you the same price.Service here was spot on. Everyone was friendly and polite.  Unlike the other Asian restaurant that recently opened up at the casino, the employees here are prepared and ready for the rush hour crowd. I'm lovin the ramen craze and welcome another one here on this side of town!
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,9/18/2014,425,88,13,24,22>The food here is a solid 3 stars, but the consistently amazing service is enough to bump it up to 4.This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant, it caters to the middle aged American palate. That being said, they do a great job with that. All of the usual suspects like combo plates with burritos, tacos, tostadas, tamales etc.. But also some dishes with nopales (cactus) and calabaza (pumpkin) to make some feel like maybe they're eating adventurously.What stands out the most here is that they are all about the freebies, and I think that's really what draws the crowd here. Heaping baskets of chips with endless bean dip and salsa. Fideo soup to start every meal (they even asked me if I wanted more) and they gave me a side of vegetables with my dinner for free. They also have free grilled onions and jalapeños. They ALSO honored some happy hour prices for some patrons at the table next to me even though happy hour was over to which those people exclaimed "now that's service!" No.. It's not.. You're just jerks, and they're just really nice. A server who couldn't honor happy hour prices when it's been over for an hour isn't a bad server.The fajitas are their claim to fame here, and while they are impressive upon delivery, I found them to be quite bland. The tall flame is a gimmick, but I think it's fun anyway. All of the food is solid.. But the check backs, friendly chatter, anticipation of your needs and presence of the servers without being overbearing is really impressive. Just don't come expecting something that your abuela used to make for you.
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,9/17/2014,428,198,34,27,22>Monica LewinskyOk, so now that I have your attention, let's talk about Cafe Teaze. It's a cross between a boba shop and a Vietnamese coffee shop, to some extent. What the knockout for me is their plain milk tea, it is extraordinary. The tea flavor is unmistakably noticeable without being overwhelming. Cafe Teaze unquestionably makes some of the best boba in town. Soft on the outside with a slight chew on the inside, it is carried out to magnificence!Truthfully, The boba babes in their bikini's and lingerie's are another reason to pop in this budding enterprise. Not only do they look terrific, but they are welcoming and attentive. But please everyone, don't be a male copulatory organ and just come here just to look at the girls, order something like a drink or some food, it's still a business!!!So in conclusion:Knock! Knock!Who's There?Teaze.Teaze who?Teaze me!

Enticing menu of unique spiked milkshakes.  I grabbed a quick Angry Orchard. I noticed the different flavored ketchup... Siracha, balsamic.... Hence the name!  Very cool. JENNIFER was bar-tending and she is AWESOME!  She put up with the drunk goofballs pretty well.  Very nice and she made us some delicious fruit loop shots!  Loopy Three Olives Vodka and ice cream.

My friend and I were thinking of a new food place to try. This one suddenly popped in my head (not knowing where it was even located), I called to see if they were still open, turned on GPS, and then realized how far we were supposed to travel (we were coming from the Southwest side of town)... We ended up getting there around 840pm.. I pretty much felt bad bec I saw they were closing and 9pm... Yes, I was that customer... lolWhen we entered, there was a Korean lady who greeted us (I think she was one of the owners). I appologized about coming in and ordering super late. She said it was just fine, with a smile! =) We then looked through the menu, and I wanted everything!! She helped us choose and we ended up getting...-The Fusion burrito: which consisted of spicy pork & kimchi wrapped in a burrito. Sooooo good-Pork belly musubi: which was the special going on at the moment. Sooooo good!!We were then greeted happily & we went on our merry ways... I love that place! I need to go back ASAP. Like NOW!!
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2013,9/14/2014,361,158,12,11,11>Believe it or not, Joshua B. introduced me to BOX. Haha on his behalf, let me just clarify he has not been here himself, just found it on Yelp and thought he would recommend :X It was definitely a good recommendation! I had a little trouble finding it at first. It's actually located upstairs of the market place in Tivoli Village. It was so fun exploring this area since I've never been here before. There's a bunch or art spaces, a small wine and cheese restaurant, a candy shop, and nestled in the corner you'll find BOX. If you're looking at the pictures provided on Yelp and looking out for this old antique vintage shop, you might have to look harder. Most of the images provided are of the waiting area deep inside of the shop rather than in the store front. Still having trouble finding it? Just locate B Sweet Candy Boutique and it should be just a few steps away.The receptionist warmly welcomes you with chips and some water after you've checked in and wait for your appointment. Something important to keep in mind is if you cancel 24hrs before the appointment they will still charge you for the service because they'll have your cc on file when you initially made the appointment.  If you ever been waxed, their services are very similar to The European Wax Center, and relatively same prices. What sets them apart however, is they offer male services. I KID YOU NOT! I've never seen a place that offered to ze... um how do I put this gently... uh.. whatever, i'm just going to come out and say it - ZE BALLS & SAC waxed. Cray cray!! I wonder if there's any men gutsy enough to reenact a 40 Year Old Virgin waxing scene, but down below?? Any takers? I'll treat you out just for having.. [waxed] balls! Lol!  Anyway I really enjoyed my services, my esthetician was very gentle with me and kept a good conversation from making it less awkward than the situation already presents itself as. And the decor just makes the experience even better. It's hard not to admire all their little unique vintage treasures!
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2012,9/13/2014,337,189,11,15,15>Decided to have dinner here and catch up with a girlfriend of mine. Since it was conveniently located on Eastern between Silverado Ranch and Serene we both decided to eat here.Location is pretty good easy to spot it's in the same shopping center as Bjs restaurant.As we entered we were greeted with a happy smile with the staff in their authentic native thai clothing. The entire restaurant gave that Thai feel and the ambiance was amazing too as well. Not to loud and you can easily hold a conversation at your table without screaming.We ordered the Chinese broccoli with chicken which was delicious. Been loving the greens lately since i'm on a special diet.Next we also ordered the pineapple fried rice mixed with cashews, raisins , and pineapple literally served on a pineapple. Really awesome!.For another entree we ordered the Sea Bass which was to die for, it was incredible delicious, it better be it was pricey and from BangkokFor noddles we decided to have the Silver Noodle Salad, a bit too spicy for me but still really good.We were both kind of disappointed since the mango salad was not available. They only have it during mango season time,For drinks we had a lycee martini which was really good it did not even taste like alcohol and also Thai coffee.. bomb digidy also!For dessert we decided to have the fried banana with coconut ice cream! I really loved it! Specially the coconut ice cream, it tasted the same in Thailand.As far as authenticity of the food it tastes exactly the same in Thailand.I would love to go back to this place and suggest it to everyone. I also heard there is live entertainment on the weekends so I might go back and check it out.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/4/2014,9/12/2014,454,392,9,15,11>We stopped in to try them for lunch. I am glad we did!  We were greeted immediately by the very friendly lady behind the counter.  She was over to get our drink order as we looked over the menu.   Everything she did, she did with a smile.  Our drinks were brought out quickly as was our lunch order.  They have great lunch specials that come with soup, rice and a crab rangoon.  Yum.  I had ordered the shrimp and broccoli with the brown rice. The shrimp were large and the broccoli was steamed to perfection.  Delicious.  The wonton soup that accompanied my meal was also fabulous.  Great flavor in everything I ate.  There is plenty of parking all around and their quaint little restaurant was very clean.  I was happy to finally try them! Thanks NY Chinese!
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/31/2014,9/11/2014,250,147,9,14,13>Great place... excellent selection of Tea, Spices, Oils, and other goodies.  Its been tough to find a good basalmic place in town and they allow you to sample their products.  I tried a few others and I haven't found flavors that were close to what I was looking for.  Tea selection is great.  Its like wine though... hard to know what you will like.  They have 3 teas to sample and they are very helpful.  Its nice that you can buy a small package and try a few to see if it fits your taste.  I'm a huge fan of tea and although I liked the almond Oolong, I'm not completely sold on it yet.  I'm still on a mission for a great tea of theirs. (Btw, True Foods and the coconut Oolong form Rishi are my favorites)I only wish that they were Organic... esp for the Oils.  I didn't have much time, but if you love cooking they have small packages of spices.  Its great that you can buy a little and see if you like it first.Great store... definitely worth your time.
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/1/2014,9/10/2014,188,132,8,13,12>Oh Happy Day! I walked around sprouts this morning like a kid in a candy store. The new location is clean, well stocked and has a great floor plan. It's a beautiful thing. The employees were helpful and even cheerful. The staff at the seafood counter was quick and courteous, packaging my fish selections while telling me about the current specials/deals. I really like that. I want to know what is fresh, what just arrived and what has been previously frozen. The produce section is vast and takes up the better part of the store. There are lots of options including a variety of organic selections. The prices are very reasonable. I haven't set foot in a Whole Foods since I discovered Sprouts (Sunflower Market) years ago. This is my go-to spot for veggies, fruit and bulk items. I love the bins of seeds and nuts. I prefer the raw options but they also offer roasted and salted selections too. Great store! I'm hooked and will definitely be a regular at this location.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/22/2014,9/9/2014,319,231,11,13,14>Great and unique place for brunch on a late-Sunday morning! Came here as a suggestion from my friend who wanted the brunch atmosphere with the bluegrass music spin. Parking was a bit rough in the area and we ended up parking in a loading zone, but other people were parked there and it was a Sunday. Luckily our car was still there later :DI had the french toast - it was served with the syrup already poured on and not too sweet. I liked how the bread pieces weren't too thick and it was the perfect balance of fluffy and crispy. We also ordered the house fries that come with tasty takes on mayo and ketchup (slightly spicy). The fries were crisp and perfectly seasoned. My husband had the quiche which he claims to be the best quiche he's ever had (topping Bouchon's even - but not sure if I'd personally go that far). The rest of our party really enjoyed their entree choices and a few of us got the bottomless mimosas and bloody marys for $12. They even let one of our friends change between both drinks. They are very generous with their mimosa pours and even when I told them I was good after 2 cups, one of our servers encouraged me to just have a little more! They did run out of champagne and switched to bottomless white wine sangria, which I unfortunately didn't have room for. One of the proprietors came to talk to us and was super sweet and wanted to make sure we were happy with everything. I'll definitely be back for the sangria and all the entrees that got me hooked!
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,9/8/2014,51,40,9,47,9>Protip: BUY the groupon!! 1 admission for $12; 2-people admission for $21; and 4-people admission for $42 as of 2/24/2014. Yes, it gets cheaper if you buy more. There is almost always a groupon going on for this place! Always check!! Beats paying $20 per person there. *ALSO* if you buy a groupon for 4 people, but you just want to go by yourself/just with one other person, they will write a coupon card with the remainder! This way you can use your remaining groupon visits each time you come in with the card! So go with a friend or by yourself, they're accommodating for whichever groupon you purchase!This is a korean spa tucked away on Sahara and Maryland. Not visible from the major streets. Ample parking.I absolutely adore this place! You walk in, pay, and you're free to enjoy the saunas or pay extra for their facials/other spa services they offer. If you've never been to an asian sauna, (I know I was confused) here's some helpful step-by-step tips:FIRST: After paying, they hand you a waterproof wristlet key for your locker; towels; baggy T-shirt + pants to change into for sauna. There's also disposable razor blades. Feel free to ask for extra towels and slippers! Some of the room floors are HOT. Trust. Go to your gender segregated room; take off your street shoes please!! Look for your real locker after the tiny shoe lockers. Deposit your stuff and bring any bath stuffs. Undress completely. Yes, it's one of those spas. You're nude. Get used to seeing other nude people as well. Haha.If you're body-shy, wrap yourself with your itty-bitty towel. Head to the shower place room past the lounge area with the sinks/mirrors. There's rows of showerheads/mirrors along with generic shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser in case you didn't bring your own tote. Pull up a stool and have fun manipulating the temperature. To get a hotter water temperature, just know there is a red button to push in as you slide it toward you. It's a safety measure. Can you say unlimited hot shower?!After, you can enjoy their 2 hot bath pools or their cool temp pool. Please don't go in without scrubbing/washing yourself proper! You're meant to go in nude for sanitation purposes. There's a dry sauna in this room as well.Head back to your locker and change to your baggy T-shirt and pants. As you're barefoot, marvel at how clean everything is or just wear the slippers you asked for at the front desk. Head upstairs for the co-ed saunas now! There's a café, lounge area with korean TV playing, and the sauna rooms. ROOMS: The clay ball room has giant tubs filled with tiny clay balls that are HOT as you get in. It is a bit noisy as you get in and out. Careful not to slip when you get out! The jade room is a room with large mats. Lie down with a friend, plug in your headphones, relax to the herbal-infused air here.There's a water dispenser where the food bar is. Be sure to drink plenty of cold water!! Plenty of fluids are lost when you're sweating this much.The red clay room is one of faves as well. Be warned, the floors are searingly hot as you step in. Clean house sandals/flip-flops are the way to go! The red domes each have a mat and a light control switch in there. It doesn't get too bright though. My friends and I play card games crammed in one dome haha. Easily the hottest room, sure to sweat your heart out. *Look for the wi-fi password listed outside this room!*FOOD: The café does have pricey food. I believe it comes with banchan (multiple korean side dishes like kimchi) with whatever meal you order. We normally get the hard-boiled eggs ($1 each) and the delicious sweet rice drink. Super refreshing. Hand them your key # and you pay when you return your key at the front desk.One of my favorite rooms is the frozen room. Small. Feels like sitting in a mcdonald's freezer, only without the gross frozen McRibs and the self-loathing. Very nice change of pace from sweating.After all that sweat, it's a good idea to head back downstairs, strip again (throw your sauna clothes in one of the large chutes), and take another shower. They also have standing showers at one end if you want a lighter shower. AMBIANCE: it's never super crowded whenever I go, especially during the weekdays. Very soothing. Quiet normally. Have a hangover? Stressed out? Come here. It's fun to go with friends. It's slightly awkward being naked around each other at first, but it's also a great place to bond, hang out, and have a girls' day. You know it's love when a friend scrubs your back! Also a fun date idea. My skin always feels amazing when I leave. Super affordable, fun, and a great experience! Absolutely my favorite place to detox and relax.

You go! No one in our crowd was a fan of Krave and my bff suggested Share since it's his favorite one in town. Our group: A straight couple, my gay bff, two straight guys, and myself... WE ALL ENDED UP HAVING A BLAST!I lucked out and was able to get a parking spot behind the club; everyone else was parked on the streets. The bouncers at the door were friendly and told all of us to have a wonderful time with a genuine smile. The club is very clean since they handle spills immediately and there are staff walking around to pick up any cans/cups on the ground. The crowd is also very friendly with people actually apologizing when they bump into you. We got our drinks from the bar (about $10 each) and ended up in the middle of dance floor. I love this club purely for the fact that everyone is there to legitimately dance and I'm not talking about giving someone your ass, but DANCING! I dance battled a couple of gay boys and let me tell you, they had some moves! I sang along to all of the songs and danced the night away.To the man in the Obey hat and white tank top there on 05/24/14: I'm sorry that I kept blocking you when you tried to dance up on one of my boys, but trust me, he wasn't interested.Downstairs, there are a few poles for the beautiful male and female go-go dancers to do their thing and bottle-service tables are right next to them. There are even a few performances on the stage throughout the night so it gets switched up.Upstairs, this is where the private lap dances are held. However, we went up here to cool down and get drinks from the bar since it was so hot downstairs from all of the dancing.TURN DOWN FOR WHAT?!
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/19/2014,9/6/2014,135,529,8,25,11>Taking up residence where Ivan Kane's Forty Deuce used to be is the newest Speakeasy to hit the strip. There's something fun and exciting about entering through a secret door and needing a password to get in. I wasn't sure of the stats on the place, so I had called Mandalay Bay box office and the woman had no info to give me, I wasn't sure if we needed tickets prior, or if we purchase there, I then searched the actual 1923 website and didn't get any info there as well. I ended up speaking with concierge and she was the most helpful, this is the info I can pass along to others:*No cover charge for locals*$20 cover for non-locals *If you're interested in getting a table, you can email info@1923lv.com and they should get back to you within 24 hours.If you show up around 10p and get yourself a seat at the bar, you'll have a perfect view for the stage, the entire place only holds 150 people, and the place got packed really quick, there were no seats or anywhere to stand by 11. Holly Madison performs 3 times nightly, and the shows run from 11p-2a. Jazz band plays intermittently throughout the night as well as a house DJ. They have a small specialty cocktail menu, Pisco Sour included. Our bartender, Marvin, was able to create a cocktail off menu by us telling him what our likes are. They have a cigar room in the back and they also sell them at the bar. They do allow smoking in the lounge, and it did get pretty smokey between the cigarettes and cigars, so be warned. I loved the burlesque dancers, the 1920's inspired outfits of the cocktails waitresses and bartenders were classy, and the prohibition style cocktails were good. I'd for sure come back.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,9/5/2014,533,627,11,22,21>I enjoy museums. Unlike many of the monotonous college lectures that I sat through where I wished I was anyplace else, well-done museums are successful at making the exact subject entertaining and keeping my attention. A well-done museum tells a story. The Boulder City-Hoover Dam Museum tells a story of a hostile desert that through the hard work of Six Companies employees created an engineering marvel, lake, and commendable city. A couple of Saturdays previous (closed on Sundays) after having breakfast downstairs at the Restaurant in the historic Boulder Dam Hotel, I was up for this story.  This is a tiny museum large on substance. It sits in level two of the Boulder Dam Hotel. When you enter the Boulder Dam Hotel through the main entrance off Arizona Street, head for the staircase that is directly ahead and to the right of registration. But stop for a second. If you are hungry, to the left is the Restaurant. They serve a decent breakfast in a historical setting. After stopping for a second, you want to climb up the staircase to level two. At the end of the hall is the museum. When you walk down the hall, keep in mind that admission is $2 for adults. The Boulder City-Hoover Dam Museum is a square layout divided into separate rooms that correspond to the nine exhibits. These nine exhibits are the chapters of the story. It is a story told through signs with white letters on a gray background, maps, memorabilia, antiques, pictures, displays, the sound of hammering, and interpretive exhibits. The pictures that myself and fellow Yelpers posted showcase the exhibits. Walking into the museum counter clockwise, the story starts off as a desert region that is inhospitable to living in the era of the Great Depression. Walking deeper into the museum counter clockwise,  the story develops into the idea of turning the desert into a hospitable region.The seeds of the Hoover Dam is born. Suffering and perseverance are the themes. Exhibits display the suffering that newcomers experienced. The suffering exacerbated with the conditions of the Seven Companies employees when they labored to build the dam. The exhibits show in detail the suffering. Another theme of the story is a celebration of building the Hoover Dam. I learned amazing facts such as, "Engineers had calculated that if the dam were built in one piece, the heat produced by the setting concrete would take 125 years to cool." When I progressed through the museum, I was progressing through an education in Hoover Dam. The vintage exhibit is Lives on the Line. This is a room size diorama of Six Companies Workers constructing Hoover Dam. From here the museum focuses on the development of Boulder City. An interesting fact is that it was a company town that was supposed to be temporary. The exhibits continue the story with a map of the original Boulder City grid overlapped with today's Boulder City. The exhibits talk about the naming of Boulder City and the first City Manager. Additional exhibits help tell the story. As the museum concludes, the story has a surprising ending:" Today power from Hoover Dam plays just a small role in lighting up Las Vegas. The real benefit comes from Lake Mead, which supplies most of the water that has helped make the Las Vegas Valley one of the busiest, fastest growing areas in the country."  Regardless that this museum trails in size to the Clark County Museum and Nevada State Museum, color me impressed. It held my attention for the half hour that I spent there. I left with an education on the construction and history of the Hoover Dam and development of Boulder City. I recommend visiting this museum with a Boulder City or Lake Mead attraction. Or even part of a tour of the Boulder City Historic District. And if you visit it, I also recommend combining it with a breakfast downstairs in the Restaurant. I guarantee that when you leave the Boulder City-Hoover Dam Museum that you will gain more knowledge on Hoover Dam and Boulder City. And, knowledge is power!
