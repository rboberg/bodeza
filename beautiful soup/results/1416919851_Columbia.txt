<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/29/2014,11/25/2014,24,140,3,5,5>West Columbia royalty!  I can remember going here just out of diapers for a chocolate covered nut roll cone with my Aunt Vivian.   If I had a sore throat growing up, Mom got me a shake from Zesto.   There wasn't a church cover-dish with out a bucket of cold Zesto's Fried Chicken.  So as you can see this place is Tri-City and a huge part of West Columbia where I grew up.My favorites now are the Zesto Burger Basket or the Wing Dinner.  I never know which to get.  Sometimes I'm a total fat a$$ and get  a Zesto Burger with a side of two wings.  The slaw is unique and good.  The only coleslaw my sister and wife will eat.  The hot dogs are great too.  I have pescitarian (vegetarians who eat fish) friends that come here for the fish sandwich when they are in town.   Everyone I know that has grown up in West Columbia and moved away, Zesto is the one place they have to go before going home.
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2014,11/23/2014,20,32,2,6,4>I'm a big fan of Ethiopian food. I cook it at home frequently and when I travel to Washington, DC I always make a point to eat it and I've tried some of the best spots in that city. If this restaurant was in DC, it would a solid 4 stars. But, I'm engaging in some grade inflation for Columbia because it is one of the only games in town and it is DELICOUS.The menu isn't huge and unless you have allergies or find some particular ingredient problematic, I suggest getting the vegetarian sampler and 1 meat dish to share for 2 people. This is how my very hungry husband and I order and we were happily stuffed.The injera was legit as was the shiro. The doro wot was tasty as well. The misr wot wasn't my favorite I'd ever tried but I'm sort of a narcissist and like my own recipe best. Everything was fresh and delicious. I'd love to have a a few things be a little spicier but know that doesn't always play well for the crowd.The service was lovely and attentive. We went in for an early dinner and were the only customers so were taken care of beautifully. Please eat here, Columbia, it would be a small tragedy to lose this place.
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/4/2014,11/22/2014,38,63,4,5,4>A few years ago I'd heard about Brazilian steakhouses in Charlotte from a few people and they only had good things to say.  I've passed this restaurant numerous times since its joined in the efforts to revitalize main st., and I've always thought the aesthetics from the outside were nice.Recently I've had the pleasure of meeting a few employees of Cowboy (they attend a gym I worked at), they all have been so polite and personable which really encouraged me to stop in and check the place out!Despite the fact that I recently stopped eating meat, I still thought it would be worth a try for a few reasons (I love the staff I've met, my bf is a carnivore andddddd they've got a 30 item salad bar - even though buffets usually gross me out!!!).We went in on Friday night around 7:30pm, without reservations and were sat immediately (the hostess did ask if we had reservations).Our server came, introduced herself, and went over what to expect.  We ordered our drinks and helped ourselves to the salad bar/hot bar.  She also brought a small plate of 3 items (no clue at all what they were - maybe baked cheese, French fry looking things and deep fried bananas).I got caesar salad, asparagus, apple salad, broccoli salad, potato salad, tabouli, gouda (most favorite cheese ever), tomatoes & fresh mozzarella, cucumber salad, and a dinner roll, my bf got a few items as well to go along with the meat the gauchos were bringing around.He ended up trying every cut of meat (except the sausage) they brought out and let me have the warm cinnamon pineapple :) which was delicious.  We made 2 trips to the salad bar (gotta get your bang for the buck).My bf had no complaints about the meats (his favorites were the Parmesan crusted pork, and maybe some flank steak (not sure the cut).His meal was $34 for meat/salad bar and mine was $20 for just the salad bar.All in all it was a good experience and I recommend anyone who hasn't been to a Brazilian steakhouse to at least give it a try!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/28/2014,11/21/2014,204,446,5,7,6>Thanks to Yelp I have found a new lunch spot that serves quality Lamb Pita and Moroccan stew. The stew is well balanced and the all flavors come together, pour the stew the over basmati rice and you are in flavor town. Moving on to the Hummus, well all I can say is I want more and more It has a clean fresh taste that goes well with pita bread. The Lamb Pitas are really great too, not to dry and the vegetables were fresh. The perfect amount of food for a lunch date. My meal was so good I got a regular Gyro to go to eat later. I found by talking to the nice lady that took are order and served are food that the chef is from Iran and specializes in this type of cuisine. Olive Grill hopes to one day be at the Soda City Market doing Gyros and I hope they bring their Hummus cups. I told them I would personally like to see them on Saturdays coming to represent the different types of cuisine that is ever growing on Main St. and Columbia's food scene in general. So I hope everyone will enjoy eating here as much as I have today!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2014,11/19/2014,4,4,1,3,4>This coffee shop has great sandwiches, soups and salads!  They roast the coffee there and everything tastes homemade.  I eat here at least once a week and would especially recommend whatever happens to be the special of the day.  Some Wednesdays they have Bahn Mi sandwiches and they are amazing. The Greek salad (add smoked turkey) is a staple of mine.  The pasta salad side is beloved by everyone who is a regular and the Senegalese peanut soup is outstanding. The atmosphere is cozy - some of the seating is made up of old church pews. The line can be slow, but food comes out of the kitchen at a good rate. I can always get in and out during my lunch hour. One of my all time lunch favs!
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/3/2007,11/18/2014,40,261,7,5,6>I got the Andy's Special today and it's like I found a piece of my soul that I'd never realized had been missing for so long.  Man, what a sandwich!  To look at it on paper nothing stands out.  It's just roast beef, turkey, cheese and bacon bits.  That first bite tells a completely different story.  The warm bread was most certainly an outstanding compliment to the right combination of such simple components.My wife has a thing for ice and said this is now her favorite ice ever.  I agree, the way it's shaved seems to sort of compress between your teeth for a neat texture and experience.The tea was just a bit weak but I can't think of anything else to complain about.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2013,11/17/2014,12,29,2,4,3>I've loved Beezers since 2011 when I started at USC. They have great food at great prices and a perfect location. That said, in the past their sitting area was crapped and the music was far too loud, but that has changed. Over the summer they expanded the seating area and added a general store. So now you can sit in the back and study or in the front and hang out with friends. Its the same Beezers as before, just better.

<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2014,11/15/2014,10,11,2,4,3>Blue cactus cafe is a little deli in 5 points that serves Tex-Mex and Korean food.  Its a super casual ambience, not what I was expecting.  Its like a hole in the wall place, you walk in take a menu and seat yourself. I ordered the Kim Bop for appetizers, Its hand rolled, rice, spinach, carrot and pickled radish rolled in seaweed paper.  It was nothing special but the ingredients were fresh just tasted a little plain for my liking.  For my main dish I ordered the Bee Bim Bop with beef and the optional egg.  It was a bowl served on a bed of rice with pickles and vegetables with a side of kimchi.  The beef was excellent, nice and tender and had a semi-sweet taste to it as you'd expect from Korean cuisine.  The portion of beef was very small but everything else was plentiful.  The kimchi that was on served on the side was some of the best kimchi I've had.  One type was spicy and the other one was a bit more mild, I really enjoyed both of them especially with the rice. The service was very quick, the server wasn't very talkative but got the job done and brought the food out very quickly.  The cafe isn't the best looking place you can eat at but you don't go to a place like this for the ambience.  Prices are very good, good korean food for under ten dollars.  Have not tried the Tex-Mex so I can't speak of that, and I've heard the ice cream is very good.  Both things I will try next time I  come by.  There is a lack of good Korean restaurants in columbia but this is definitely one of them.
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2014,11/14/2014,78,23,2,4,3>Columbia is lacking quality sushi,  however Inakaya bridges that gap. They do an amazing job with the classic staples but also have a remarkably broad and creative array of their own original sushi creations.The prices are far better than Tsunami or SakiTumi and the service is excellent.This is your spot for sushi in Columbia. I just wish it was closer to downtown.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2014,11/13/2014,8,110,3,7,4>This is one of Cola's best kept secrets! A group of colleagues and I went to the ladies cooking class tonight. What a fabulous time!Process- we did ladies night which is a demonstration style class. Chef John goes over the recipes and prepares them. It's informal and questions about ingredients and technique are welcomed. Atmosphere- the studio is cozy, elegant and modern. There's a long bar that gives a front row seat to the cooking. There are other tables and everyone can see what is going on at the cooking area due to a video projection on a tv above the chef's area.Price- $35 per person.Food- Fantastic! Chef John is a wonderful cook and the menu was great and seasonal.Tips- bring a bottle of wine. Chef John has a ton of classes, including couples cooking classes.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2014,11/12/2014,3,3,5,4,5>Before going to Frank's, I had never experienced the simple yet exquisite pleasure of a straight razor shave, or the prepping and pampering that went into the process. The reasonable price and the promise of two complimentary drinks, however, were enough to get me in the door. My stylist was attractive, professional and courteous. And the experience of having her drag the edge of a sharp piece of literally ancient technology over my whiskers was oddly relaxing. To cap it off, I had a chance to adjust to and luxuriate in the new feeling in the oak paneled man cave while knocking back my second drink. More fun than being shaved should be allowed to be.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/3/2014,11/11/2014,9,169,1,3,2>The building is pretty beat up and old, but clean so don't be scared when you first walk in. The food is well worth the iffy atmosphere. They offer a plethora of banchan to go with their very authentic Korean food (source: I'm Korean). We ordered the fried mandu for an appetizer and were very pleased with how delicious they were. They came to us super fresh and super hot so don't rush into taking a bite or you'll burn yourself like I almost did. I ordered the Daegi Bulgogi and it came out on a screaming hot cast iron pan. It tasted amazing. Much like my mom used to make. My husband ordered a spicy korean noodle dish made with chewy buckwheat noodles and a hot pepper sauce. I'm not sure what it was called on the menu but we usually call it bibim nang myun because you mix the sauce and the kimchi into it. That was also very good. Their portions were quite large and their prices reasonable. I would definitely come back here.
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2014,11/10/2014,6,17,3,4,4>Good food for a good price! The sub and drink deal for $5.50 is a great offer. Love the fried Oreos and the comic book hero theme. Some of the staff seem a bit confused on the menu (which is quite large), but they are all friendly and want to help. A fun restaurant with good food - will be back again!
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/6/2014,11/9/2014,2,25,2,2,2>This is a great place to meet after work for drinks and appetizers or come for dinner.  The outside seating is perfect on a nice night.  Thursday is 2 for 1 margaritas!  Chips and salsa never disappoints.  Try the habanero sauce in the salsa.  You can add as much as you want.
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2014,11/8/2014,34,8,1,2,2>My wife and I go here often for lunch and they have never missed a beat!  The staff is very friendly and the service is fast. Usually I get the chicken souvlaki sandwich (pita) and it's always fresh and tasty. The only negative I can say is they are only open for lunch during the week.  That just makes it all the more special when we eat there!
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2014,11/7/2014,0,11,2,2,2>Stopped by for an early supper. As another reviewer stated, it gets crowded at 5:00. Had 1-1/2 dozen house oysters. They were good Gulf oysters with about 1/2 being select. Was very pleased with the taste and size. My wife had the crab dip and she was pleased with that. Is did see several plates of very large boiled shrimp and was impressed with the size of the shrimp. Will have to do the shrimp next time. Also had an oyster shooter. Yep. Put that on your need to try one of those list. All in all was a good dining experience. Will visit again. Wish they were open for dinner. That's the 12:00 meal.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2014,11/6/2014,30,31,3,3,3>Getting a Brazilian wax can be an uncomfortable experience. However, the staff here makes you feel comfortable and they are nice. I recently moved from New Orleans and was in need of a wax. So I found this place online and then checked out their Yelp to read the reviews. It's about. 25 minute drive from my house but I will be back due to their professionalism. The facility is very clean and private.
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/18/2014,11/5/2014,9,24,1,3,3>Small underground bar but has good food. I had the Gouda Mac and cheese and steamed vegetables. My friend also ordered a pesto feta pita dip which was good as all. Has good crafted beers and good bartenders.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/19/2013,11/4/2014,9,12,3,4,3>It's hard to give this place a truly thorough review since I've only ever had the spicy ramen. A dozen times or so. From the first time I went and tried it, I've hesitated to deviate since it's what I am craving as my car is tugged helplessly towards this place. It's filling, delicious, and very reasonably priced. Other than that, I have always been greeted warmly and received very fast and friendly service. No complaints here.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2014,11/3/2014,8,39,4,4,3>I am reviewing this as a Vegetarian.    Sun Ming is one of the few places that actually has a Chinese menu with more traditional flavors than what you find in American Chinese food.   The vegetarian sections of the menu are a little light because many of the dishes are meant to be served family style as a side, not an entree.   This is easily remedied however by asking for a tofu substitution on many of their other menu items - just me smart about it.   The last time I was there, I had their fermented cabbage with pork made into fermented cabbage with tofu.  Sour, salty, fermented ... divine.   Warning, fermented cabbage is not a starter dish - you may interpret some of the flavors as spoiled instead of simply fermented.If they ever decide to serve DimSum I will upgrade them to Six Stars.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/24/2014,11/2/2014,17,5,1,4,3>It was delicious! Perfectly cooked omelet with very fresh veggies.  The coffee is awesome and I  stopped at 3 cups, but could've easily had 1 more.  The staff was super friendly and are happy!

<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2014,11/1/2014,0,3,3,4,4>Being raised as a South Carolina True Southener, there are a couple of things that you must choose as a 'Favorite'-one being your College Football Allegiance and another-your choice in styles of BBQ!! It doesn't get any better than the Palmetto Pig, for sure!  The Bar-B-Que Is lean and flavorful, the 'Red' Hash has a very tasty smooth texture and the Macaroni and Cheese is second to none!  I am generally not a fan of Buffets at all due to cleanlines, freshness, etc. but the staff always ensures that the food is fresh, hot and the area is cleaned constantly through service.  Also, the newest manager, Jamie, is just a Ray of Sunshine!!! He is so friendly, welcoming to the customers, walks around every time that we are there to assure customers are happy, so helpful and makes you appreciate the fact that the Importance of Customer Service still exist in 2014!

We had the Crab cakes, Fried Green tomatoes, Blackened Salmon Charleston, Shrimp n Grits, and the Fried Shrimp. We shared our meals because everything was soo good. For the best service, ask for Kurt.  Bonus:  All foods are fresh, sauces and desserts are made in house. This is now my favorite local restaurant.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,10/29/2014,2,3,1,3,2>I passed this place when I moved to SC and had a feeling something delicious was being served inside. I was right! From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall BBQ joint but don't let that fool you. The sauces are fantastic. I had the Hawaiian BBQ sandwich. So good! Can't wait to try more!
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2014,10/28/2014,22,20,2,3,3>Awesome local brewery!  Defiantly the best in the area as far as looks and beer!  Great bar area and outside area with several TV's outside and inside!  My favorite spot to go to before SC games for sure and is right at a mile walk to the Stadium.  Usually will have live music on Friday or Saturday night with KC hot dogs and a few other food trucks always outside to feed you after a few brews!  KC hot dogs defiantly recommended! (Seattle DOG OFF THE CHARTS!!) As far as the beer goes My favorite would have to be Moncks Corner!  But don't think they will have it til next year! . Double IPA it is then!
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2014,10/27/2014,1,3,2,4,3>Great beer selection, incredibly nice proprietors, and homey atmosphere (it is in an old model home, after all). It is far out if you are coming from the eastern parts of Lexington, West Columbia, or Columbia, but it is also a really cool to have a craft beer bar close to residential areas in Lexington, SC.The place is still a work in progress, but I understand there will be a full kitchen after construction and 100 taps. Right now there are over twenty taps (maybe 24?) of quality craft beer and some snacks, which often include Billy's homemade pimento cheese, hummus, smoked meats, cheese plates, and chips and salsa. It can get quite crowded some nights, but the room set-up plus outdoor seating also presents their customers with options if they are or are not in the mood to share a beer with many strangers. The main bar is a lot like sitting around the island in someone's kitchen, which has turned out to be really cool as I have had some really interesting conversations with strangers who feel like old friends by the time you leave. They also have a wine selection if beer isn't your bag, and they offer free soft drinks to designated drivers, which all bars should do but do not.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/20/2014,10/26/2014,7,40,3,5,3>We live in Leesville so were excited to hear about a new pizza place about half the distance to where we normally have to go for a decent pizza (Nicky's, 5 Points). But I had grave concerns since it was near the high school. Last time I had pizza near the high school it was clearly designed to appeal to the Domino's crowd. So we were relieved to discover this was actually pretty good pizza. The menu was very interesting, lots of unique specialty pizzas. And for those not as adventurous, you have the option to create your own. They did offer a gluten-free option although this was not a concern of ours. Best of all, they had a great beer selection including some interesting craft beers on tap. The atmosphere was very casual, almost fast food. You walk up and order, then they bring it out to you when it's done. They also have flat screen TVs for you sports fans. Price is comparable any sit-down restaurant (think Mellow Mushroom or Uno's as opposed to a delivery place like Domino's or Little Caesar's). We enjoyed the Mediterranean pizza, substituting red sauce for the white that it came with. The crust was thin like we like it, but could have been more crisp IMO - we like it crispy! But the ingredients were fresh and tasty. We ordered a large which was a 14" I believe and it was just the right size for two hungry adults. No leftovers this time. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Service was fast on a Friday night, probably b/c the local high school had an away game thank god. Notwithstanding the crust crispiness factor, this is probably the best pizza around without me having to travel to downtown Cola or fight the traffic on 378. We like Angelo's pizza also but Knead has a little more modern vibe. We will definitely be back.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/20/2014,10/25/2014,72,52,3,4,4>This place is one of the most fun places ever. My sister and I took my mom there for her birthday. I didn't have any desire to go since I'm not a big tea drinker. Once I got there, I was the first one to pick out a hat. Then we all posed to get our picture taken with the Queen Elizabeth cardboard cutout. We had a blast just trying on all the hats. Next we had to pick out a cup and saucer. That was hard.... So many beautiful ones to choose from. The service was excellent and the food was amazing!!! I enjoyed all the teas they served. I actually loved 2 of them (a black tea and a green tea). I ended up buying them and a lot of other tea items in their gift shop downstairs. I even bought some Christmas gifts also. This place is a one of a kind unique place... (Experience). I enjoyed it very much. It was a nice relaxing afternoon. We will definitely take my mom again next year. I might sneak and go there again before her birthday. I don't know any other place that offers the unique experience that this place does. It's worth the drive there.
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2014,10/24/2014,49,28,4,6,4>This is my new go - to for lunchtime.   It's got great fresh salads and lighter fare so I don't pass out at my desk and feel like a slug.  And it's pretty inside.  Get the deli case combo.  They're open later than a lot of downtown restaurants and are a solid addition to main street.   They also have a meeting room big enough to host nice sized meetings and events.

They took us to 6 restaurants and by the end we were stuffed from all the sampling. Best things about this tour:1) they took us places I would never have thought to try - (Bourbon) thought I didn't like whiskey but it turns out I liked theirs.  Try the Whiskey Smash - it was really good - just plan to walk off the buzz!2) they took us to places I'd not easily have found (Villa Tronco) - pizza was good and the cheesecake awesome!3) the Midlands restaurant in the newly renovated Marriott hotel. Yes, you read that right. A hotel restaurant worth bragging about. You've gotta try the Chicken & Waffles and they're homemade ice cream. 4) the Sheraton hotel rooftop bar - spectacular views and the foods pretty good too!5) the owners,  managers and chefs all came out to greet us and tell us about their history, foods, etcWe learned a lot, stuffed our face, got a bit tipsy, walked it off and discovered 6 great new places to eat & drink in downtown Columbia. Thanks for starting this great business - I'll be taking the tour again when you add more restaurants.

Chad mixed a delicious Ruby Red Greyhound cocktail fir me, and Raul mixed a super delicious Mai Tai for me and my friends to share.

I like the steaks best and Shawn, the owner chef comes up with superb specials, really good with sauces/reductions/gravies. Shrimp and grits or beef tips and grits are favorites of our friends that visit. My wife loves the club wrap. The firecracker shrimp appetizer is superb. I wish they still had crab legs. Good beer selection for the area and excellent drinks. True some times things can be too salty, but I love the fries!

The Salon had good reviews and was close by so I gave it a try. All the stylists were nice, patient, and accommodating when I needed to relax for a bit because of a medical issue. Almost two months later, and my braids are still in good condition and I get compliments on how beautiful they are almost every day. So I definitely recommend The Salon!

<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,10/16/2014,21,44,2,7,3>There are quite a few Japanese Steakhouse players in Columbia. Miyabi, however, is the one to beat. They have a cool ambiance, and are always crowded, even on a random Tuesday night. To me, that's a true sign of a great place. The portions are awesomely large and the food is tasty. They're very good about working around any allergy or vegetarian requests, so don't hesitate to ask!I always order the teriyaki chicken dish, which is always delicious. You are first served with a cinder block sized serving of fried rice (don't forget to ask for a to go box) and they are quite liberal with the white sauce. I personally get all three of my sauce dishes filled with white sauce, because it's my favorite. It's funny because if you drive past Yamato, which is just blocks away, they are almost never crowded, but Miyabi always has a good crowd. If you are trying to come on a Friday or Saturday, be prepared to wait without reservations, because this is birthday central.EXPERT TIP: Come before 6:00pm to take advantage of "early bird" menu pricing. A lot of the entrees are priced $5 less than normal menu pricing before 6.

I order it EVERY time I come in ( which is weekly)The Singapore Chow Mei Fun is AMAZINGTheir new Spicy Shrimp soup is also good with plenty of LARGE shrimp in it, not those dinky salad shrimp.They now serve Japanese hibachi ( it's cooked in the back though) and my new favorite..,. The BENTO box.  This is a traditional lunch in Japan. At Chens you get your choice of one piece of two types of dumplings as an appetizer, entree ( there are about 5-6 choices which include both Japanese hibachi and Chinese food options, some fried rice, and your choice of miso soup ( which is also pretty yummy) or a house salad.  A very well rounded meal ... The price? About $8The staff is always super nice , and if dining in they bring your food to the table on real dishes not styrofoam .So, next time your in town stop by Chens. It's in the bi-lo shopping center next to Murray's .

<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2014,10/13/2014,4,36,4,3,3>Ok folks, we've lived here in NE Cola for 11 years now.  Hit many of the restaurants and I'd not heard of this one until last week when our neighbors mentioned it.  Who would have thought that you'd find this jewel of a restaurant attached to a gas station!The menu is extensive. They have about anything you'd want: Pizza, Seafood, Steaks, Sandwiches, Wraps, Desserts, Greek food, appetizers, beer/wine and sodas.  The amount of food you get for the price is truly amazing. I've not seen anything like it in Columbia yet.There were four of us and we each ordered something different.  Hamburger Steak with with mashed potatoes and gravy, Salmon with rice and vegetables, Pizza and I had the special Catfish and fries.  Three of us ordered the Greek salad. Our neighbor loved the hamburger steak with gravy and mashed potatoes. His wife said the salmon was also very good.  My wife and I are from Chicago area so we are sort of biased on our pizza. The waitress recommended the pizza and said it was the best.  We thought it was sort of bland and lacked a little salt.  We prefer Marcos/Danos/Uno's over what we had last night.  I ordered the fried catfish and fries.  This is the most catfish that I've seen down here in Cola. Three large pieces ( and I mean large), that were done perfectly ($8.95).  I had to have a doggy bag to take half of it home. The Greek salad was very good but the greek salad dressing was a little too tart for me.  Next time I'd order it but ask if they had some type of a creamy greek dressing.  Their dressing is the original greek style dressing, but I've gotten more used to the creamy greek style that Pontiac Pizza or Bobby's House of Pizza (closed) served.We had to try the desserts.  They have a number of cakes in the display at the entrance. Our neighbor ordered some type of chocolate cake with a liquor in it and a large strawberry on top. She loved it.  We tried the Pina Colada Coconut cake and it was very light and very good.They had a Prime Rib special for $16.95 that looked really good.  We got there at about 6:40 and had about a 10 miinute wait.  I hear it gets crowded and I can see why.  If you venture out to Blythewood area you need to stop in and try this place out.  We'll be going back for sure.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2014,10/12/2014,27,187,1,4,5>This was recommended by a friend who works there. It was delicious! The server was helpful and friendly. The food was all fresh and great, as well as the Bramble cocktail I ordered. The crab cakes were some of the best I have ever had and the asiago broccoli was really good too.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2014,10/11/2014,21,151,1,3,2>As a New York native, their pizza is the truth! Was happy to hear the owner is from Yonkers and they gave my wife and I a Military discount! Good people and their Stromboli, pie, and calzones are the best you will find in Columbia. Go and grab a slice, they don't disappoint.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/28/2014,10/10/2014,3,2,1,3,1>Paradise ice is exactly what it says, paradise.  The service was very friendly and helpful. You could literally sample everything if you wanted to.  They have sorbet and custards. For those who aren't in the 'know', sorbet I'd like Italian ice and custard is basically like ice cream. Chocolate coffee custard is the one I got on their homemade waffle cone. Amazing!
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2014,10/9/2014,10,33,,3,3>Needed our dryer fixed asap, called around, Walters was the cheapest to come out $60, he needed to get the part so we still had to wait but usually that happens anyway, so he came back Monday evening, just like he said he would he promised to have it fixed, he stayed til just after 9pm, that is dedication to his customers, and now out dryer works!I highly recommend this company for repairs!!  The man was very nice and kept in contact to let us know what was going on.  That is very important in good business practice.If you need something fixed - call these guys!
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/30/2014,10/8/2014,33,39,1,3,2>This was a accidental find but I'm so glad. I'm not big on buffets but this one was actually very good. The quality of the selection, to include sushi and rolls, is better than what you'd usually find in buffets. Great selection of tempura and sushi. I sampled just about everything there and enjoyed everything. Although the restaurant has a hibachi, I was too full to try so that will be my excuse to return. Overall, I was very pleased.  The waitress Alina, is very kind as she is beautiful. Highly recommend if you're craving variety of real food.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/30/2014,10/7/2014,23,6,2,5,4>Great restaurant! The staff and food are both equally amazing. The new owners have kept the traditional favorites of this Columbia establishment and have added a breath of fresh air at the same time. The only thing I can say is that its even better than it was before. My personal favorites are the Charcuterie Plate, Lobster Caprese, and Pappardelle Bolognese, and I've never been disappointed by one of their specials.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,10/6/2014,47,99,4,8,8>Columbia does Thai ...Columbia does Thai reeeeeaaalll good! My boyfriend loves two things more than me... Thai and Indian ... Food not women (better not be women). So what better way to celebrate his birthday in our new city than by checking out Mai Thai! I had the masaman curry and he had the two friends panang and both were outstanding but the masaman was the winner. We also had the Thai rolls and the golden angels both were banging! I would do without the coconut ice cream and would not do without a Chang (Thai beer). I am so so so happy we found this place...it is very indicative of Columbia's culinary diversity!
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,10/5/2014,45,174,1,5,5>This pizza place is great! I had dinner here last night with my aunt and one of her friends, based on my aunt's hairdressers recommendation.  We arrived and the lobby is more or the less the "kitchen" of the restaurant.  The owner asked us if any of us have ever eaten at Noah's (approriately named after his son), and none of us ever have.  He explained to us the flour and sauce he uses, which were off to the side.  Then went into explanation that all pizzas are 12 inches, baked for 90 seconds in a 900 degree brick oven.  He also did indicated that the crust is crispy, while the center does not seem as cooked as the crust, but still edible. The cheapest pizza is $10.  Also, from what I was reading on one of the articles posted about the owner, do not come in expecting to order your typical pepporoni or sausauge pizza.  Every pizza is unique.  Unless multiple people are having same pizza, be prepared to take some home.I noticed on another article abbout the place that Noah's is not known for the ambiance or autmosphere, but being a Sunday night, we were the only diners dining and the owner had come over to us several times during our meal to see how things were.  There is a dining room, but not good for a big group.After we were leaving, I was telling my aunt my only complaint was that lack of water / soft drinks  (as I was thirsty last night).  They do have bottled water and cans for soda, but wish there were free refills.  My aunt did mention customers might order take out more than they eat in (hence the lack of refills or water).  My aunt swore even though they do not serve alcohol, she read somewhere if you do dine in, you are able to bring beer with you (but do not take my word on that).
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2014,10/4/2014,3,12,3,5,5>This is on my list of 'usual suspects' when I go out to eat. It doesn't hurt that it's about a mile and a half from my house! Sometimes it does get pretty busy when the happy hour crowd is there, but the wait typically isn't that bad unless they have large parties. The tres hombres is great for sharing since it has salsa, guac, and queso. I typically get the tacos. My favorites are the chicken pesto, BBQ brisket, and the smoked pork. I've heard the Peruvian shrimp is good too and I would try it if I wouldn't go into anaphylactic shock. I'm not much of a margarita person, but they do have two for one margarita Wednesdays, so I don't mind breaking the rule every now and then. Parking can be a pain since their parking lot is tiny, but parking along the streets isn't too difficult to find. Given the a la carte nature if the menu, you can pretty much order as little or as much as you want. I think it's relatively inexpensive given that I typically get a couple of tacos and split a dip.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/4/2014,10/3/2014,32,42,1,5,7>I wish there were more places like this in Columbia and I'm glad to see more of these pop up. You can order from the bar or build your own 6 pack. They have local beers like river rat and the staff seems pretty knowledgeable. The store itself has got a laid back cool look to it too. I think this will be on one of my weekend routes to visit when I'm in the area.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/25/2014,10/1/2014,462,196,4,8,6>If you're coming here i'm going to recommend that you try any of the fajitas. It's literally enough to feed two grown people...especially if you initially stuff your face with chips prior to getting you meal. LOL. Although the size of the fajita was large its safe to say that it was so good I don't mind the extra few calories. I'll just work harder at the gym right?!? haha. I didn't get any drinks when i came but the other two that I was with did. They got this huge serving of margaritas and pretty much demolished it. From what they told me, it's worth the buck! Overall the customer service here was good. The waitress was very friendly and the food came out without much of a wait.
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2014,9/30/2014,4,6,1,4,4>You don't have to be vegan to love this food. The tempeh Reuben is always one of my favorites along with the goddess mac. And the lady who works at the counter is always so kind and friendly. They offer other smoothies and juices along with lunch specials. Definitely try it out.

<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2014,9/28/2014,4,7,1,3,5>We checked out Mama J's based in a Instagram photo Friday. We are so glad we did, the food was delicious.The menu was explained to us this way. You have quite a few choices of meats - jerk chicken, curry goat, escovitch fish, etc....  The you chose the type of rice you want - white or rice and peas.  You get plantains and cabbage with each meal. The price point is very fair and varies with the meat choice.I got the jerk chicken and white rice.  Everything was delicious!!! I don't eat plantains so I fed them to my 10 month old. She ate that, rice and cabbage. I love cabbage and this was right on point! The rice was so good, I just kept eating it and eating it and eating it. I got a thigh and breast. Next time I will request all dark meat, I'm not a fan of chicken breast.I will tell all of my friends and coworkers about this place.  Go today!!
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,9/26/2014,33,18,5,6,5>I have past by the Wired Goat a few time on my infrequent trips to Chapin thinking to myself, "Hmmm a coffee shop?  Did Chapin really step up its sophistication game?"  The answer is yes.   Yes, they did! Usually I try to keep my visits to Chapin brief,  1) because I graduated from Chapin High and I usually try to keep a safe distance and 2) let's be honest,  there's really not much to Chapin.   Luckily for me, I found myself stuck here with some time to kill and I thought it would be the perfect time to check out that little cheeky coffee shop so conveniently close to the HS.   And let me tell you, this place is perfect!   It is exactly what Chapin needed and it is puzzling that this place didn't come around earlier (or at least when I was still in school).  They set up shop in a small, unassuming house with plenty of parking and an air of quaint indifference,  as per indie coffee shop standards.   The interior is as you would imagine: cozy with wood floors and eclectic (enough) seating and light background music so conversations won't be an impossible task.   The coffee... the coffee!  EXCELLENT!   Way to go Chapin!   You are a little old hometown and that is exactly how this coffee tastes!  It tastes like home.  They have an extensive menu and will make it anyway you like it! I'm a sucker for salted caramel anything,  so I got that mocha (to die for) but I was very intrigued by the Canadian Bacon coffee and the Cheesecake Delight.  I will have to try these on my next trip!   That's right!   I'll be making another trip!   You hear that,  Chapin?   You better do everything in your power to keep this place alive!  It's a bringer of the people! I also have to mention the heavenly Pecan Sticky Bun that I devoured in one sitting!   They have many appealing baked goods on their pastry rack,  but this one stole the show for me.   Just look at the picture I provided.   How could you not look at it and say "get in my belly!"  All-in-all a perfect choice for this small town!  Congrats!   Don't you ever let go,  Chapin!   Ps.  They started serving lunch too.  I haven't had a chance to try that yet,  but I gave their menu a one over and it looks delish!
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2014,9/25/2014,112,197,3,5,4>Even though I've only been in Columbia since January, new places are opening all the time.  Fortunately, the new places that keep opening are also very good!  Scoopy Doo is no exception.I heard about this place from a fellow Yelper this weekend during a Yelp event.  My girlfriend really wanted to try it after brunch, so we did. Pretty awesome! You can tell they're still getting things together, as there isn't a ton of indoor seating but this place is really, really good. She had chocolate and pistachio gelato, and I decided on the blueberry sorbetto. Both were very tasty and as good news for those who might be wondering, gelatos are all gluten free and sorbettos are all vegan.Hopefully this place is a great start in a hopeful trend to "clean up" Five Points a bit and make it a fun place for young adults and others to hang out instead of having a reputation as the "college bar strip."Check it out!
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2014,9/24/2014,67,157,4,2,2>First I'll start off with what we ate at the place.  My family eats so much its not funny anymore, its just shameful.  I blame my mom.  Anyways, we tried the chopped pork, pork chop, white meat chicken, ribs and the pigs feet.  We tried both of the sauces and my parents had "hash" for the first times in their lives.  The hash where I'm from isn't even close to what they serve down here and I'm still not sure what I think of lumpy, non-descript gravy over rice yet.  But my parents liked it.  EVerything was either really good or great.  The pigs feet and ribs were amazing.  Really tender and smoky.  The awesome counter worker (her dad was the owner) was so surprised when yes we would like one order of pigs feet please.  I don't think she realized that this was a family that used to eat chicken hearts as an after school snack and gnaw on chicken feet for a good time.  Anyways, it was drowned in sauce and delicious.  The only downside is the chicken and the pork chop were a little tough.  They had a great flavor but were a little dry.The best part of this place though is the customer service.  It seems like we met everyone and everyone was incredibly nice, friendly and welcoming.  It is a no frills type of place but here that makes it even more charming.  Definitely worth a drive.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2014,9/23/2014,102,139,4,5,5>Disclaimer: This review might be very much affected by nostalgia - my family has eaten at Yamato for YEARS, and it holds a very special place in my heart.First piece of advice - ONLY come here if you're hungry. Anything less would be just a shame. Servings are gigantic + delicious,which is a dangerous combination. In fact, you might want to fast for a couple of days prior. And wear pants with an elastic waistband. All lunch/dinner hibachi entrees come with your standard rice, vegetables, miso soup, and salad. And sherbet! - such a nice touch. My favorite entrees are the filet mignon and scallops. I've tried just about everything over the years though, and I've never met a meal at Yamato that I didn't like.Always ask for extra ginger and shrimp sauce, and don't forget to ask for some to-go sauce containers to include in your to-go box. (You will need a to-go box, and if not, I'd like to meet you and shake your hand.)Sunday afternoons are very busy, so expect a wait. Dinner on weekdays seems to be your best bet. Prices vary from ~$15-24. Chefs are hilarious and I often hear new jokes when I go - a feat in itself since I've been hundreds of times.Come on in and give Yamato the chance to become your family tradition. My personal tip? Grab a handful of those delicious breath mints on your way out.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/11/2014,9/22/2014,8,10,,2,3>My first experience with Grapes and Gallery was for their first venture into hosting Dr. Sketchy's Columbia chapter. Dr. Sketchy's is a monthly artistic meetup where artists can sketch models while a DJ spins music, it's a lot of fun. But I digress. Grapes and Gallery is the PERFECT location for such an event. The upstairs area is typically used for painting classes fueled by a lovely wine and diverse craft beer selection from their bar. The space itself is open and inviting. We were situated downstairs where there is also another bar setup, and great ambiance with mood lighting and attentive bartenders. I can't wait for my next opportunity to hang out at Grapes and Gallery.
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/12/2014,9/21/2014,0,3,4,2,2>Hudson's BBQ is the first southern BBQ place that I take my out of town relatives to. Their barbecue is sumptuous ( and all you can eat!), and I love all of the sauces. But the main reason I put Hudson's #1 on my Columbia  area BBQ list is the sides. I could eat the Mac & Cheese all day. My sister from NY was blown away by the hash and rice too (she'd never had it before).My only complaints are that the bar is a small room attached to the kitchen and it gets really hot (one of my family members had trouble breathing in there because it was so hot). Additionally, my brother ordered a chicken sandwich off of the menu and it took at least 20 minutes .
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/14/2014,9/20/2014,0,4,1,4,4>I have lived in South Carolina for 3 weeks. This is the only place I have been to more than once. I had the special the first time and it was amazing. Today I had braised pork and it was the best thing I have ever tasted. I love going there for food or for drinks. The mimosas are delicious,  and the pomegranate mimosa was a nice variation on one of my favorites. The bacon bloody Mary was amazing too! Best people, best food, best drinks, best atmosphere.

<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2014,9/18/2014,66,259,5,5,6>Updating my review as today was my second visit and had lunch instead of dinner which changed my life...no joke.  It has been two years since I was last and there were so many unique and tasty looking options on the menu it almost made it hard to choose. I say almost because they had a Vietnamese pork sandwich listed, which to my fellow foodies is known as a banh mi...and I know of nowhere else in town to get one...not even Pho Viet!This had become my obsession...the one item I had been unable to find in Columbia which resulted in serious withdrawals and frequent trips to Viet places in Charleston to feed my addiction.  Finding my love in this restaurant was so unexpected but so joyous.  Don't know what I'll do having it a mere 5 minutes from my office now...binges may occur.  The pork was a huge portion and dripping with flavor and semi spicy sauce mixed with fresh cucumbers and cilantro in a toasted baguette.  It was everything I'd been hoping for.  I'll be back in a few weeks to continue my love affair.  If you can, reserve the wine room for your meal.  It's intimate and very fun dining!
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2014,9/17/2014,24,140,2,3,3>This was our fourth time coming to Colas.  It has always been good, but this experience was great!   Our service tonight was 7 out of 5 stars!  The first time we dined at Colas we had happy hour'd else where so we ordered the pulled pork egg rolls served with yellow mustard bbq sauce and slaw.  This was the best example of southern meets chic.  Hit the nail on the head.  The bbq sauce was on point, the slaw was like your mom's, and the egg roll paper just somehow completes it.  My wife and I shared the Wagyu Burger that night and it was great.  The second and third time we visited Colas I had the trout entree (and more pork egg rolls).  The trout was so good I got it the next time we came.  Tonight my wife and I started with the bloody mary oysters (1/2 dozen) - amazing-,  and the night's special of local Certified SC Grown fried okra with goat cheese?  Yes goat cheese and it was spectacular.  (Almost got more pork egg rolls... Probably would have if the okra didn't sound so good).  For entrees I got the nights special of Wild Caught (never frozen) Sockeye Salmon with a "Summer Succotash."  Was unbelievable!  Wife got the bone-in pork chop with a brussel sprout hash... yes, AMAZING!  We split a bottle of Louis Latour Pinot Nior, for a perfect date night.  Again service tonight was STELLAR.  Great meal.  Great experience.  Cola is lucky to have Colas.!

The place can fill up quick on the weekends so we usually go after the breakfast rush on a weekday.We're always greeted by the hostess upon entering unless she's seating customers (she always quickly returns so there's never an uncomfortable wait - again, we never come when it's crazy busy).My must haves are the Dutch Baby, Apple Pancake (very similar to the Dutch Baby - sugar overload), and Bird Of Paradise (when I was eating meat), Veggie Egg White Omelet (so huge, good for a post workout protein fix) and Buckwheat Pancakes.My bf likes the Eggs Benedict and my son loves the Strawberry Pancakes - with their house made strawberry syrup!!!!!I never knew how big of a chain OPH was until just now - it's that good, I thought it was local - try it!

<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,9/12/2014,4,25,1,4,4>This place is amazing. I was hesitant to visit last week since the departure of Chef Tim Peters but the new chef has proven himself. I had seared berkshire pork belly with a roasted corn salsa and green tomato compote, delicious. This place is known for its daily changing hand written menu which always features that days freshest local ingredients. The ambiance of the place is amazing. True southern fare with a glare. Chefs stick to their roots with the dishes the prepare and each one is worth drooling over. One of Columbia's best and certainly an establishment to be proud of.  -Ryan C.
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2013,9/11/2014,35,32,1,6,6>As someone who has to walk a half mile to and from my parking spot to my office every day, I am investing more in good shoes to keep my feet happy. I stopped by Good for the Sole to get some new black flats and even though their selection was sparse (only 2 that fit my criteria- I think they are transitioning into boot season now), they helped me find some perfect Sperrys, which I would have never looked at otherwise. The prices are a little higher than I normally had been paying for shoes, but again, these are investment pieces. They sell comfortable, well made shoes, and put the time into helping you find what you need. The owner has his cute dogs in the store, which brings home the reality that it's a small business owned by a real person! I'll definitely return here in the future for more awesome shoes. If you go on your lunch break in the day, there's usually always parking nearby.
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/15/2014,9/10/2014,204,446,2,4,4>Is this food authentic Mexican I don't know I'm not an expert, but in can tell you it's the best Mexican food I have had in quite some time. To start off it's all on what you order, we had people in our group that wanted tacos and rice the safe option of course. I asked for something the waitress would eat here, she recommended the chipotle grand quesadilla with a green tortilla so I said what the hell give it to me. The entree the waitress recommended was about 8.99 and worth every penny. I enjoyed the chips and salsa and all the food I sampled here. Service could be a bit quicker here but I'm glad the food was good. We had a great time here and will return even though two dudes were discussing their feelings and how they plan to win their women back rather loudly. Very weird but I guess when your eating on Bush River you will run into weirdos !
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/4/2014,9/9/2014,8,110,4,5,5>I went to dinner here last night with my mom.Atmosphere- it's more upscale than most Thai restaurants. It reminds me of some of the Thai restaurants I've visited in DC or Atlanta. It's sleek and modern, and my only complaint is that the tables are kind of close together. I could easily overhear what the table behind us was talking about throughout the meal.Service- Our server was aloof. She dropped the food off and then didn't come back. Fortunately, another server refilled our drinks and took our dishes away to pack up the leftovers. Price- For two entrees it was close to $40.Food- I ordered the green curry with chicken. It was really good with delightful chunks of eggplant mixed in and the seasoning was great with just enough heat that didn't overpower the flavors of the curry. My mom ordered the sweet and sour chicken dish and really enjoyed it as well.Cleanliness- I don't usually include this in reviews, but this place was extremely clean. I ran to the bathrooms and was impressed that it was spotless and everything (even the garbage can) is hands-free.  Extra star just for the above-average cleanliness.
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2014,9/8/2014,40,11,1,4,4>I went here for my 30th Birthday a few weeks back. Who wouldn't want a a 5 hour spa visit for your birthday right? Everything was exceptional. I've been before for various individual services but never for a "spa day." The spa is beautifully decorated and very clean. Everyone was very friendly and accommodating. Karla did an amazing job on my facial, and lash tinting. Elizabeth gave me a really good deep tissue massage and was very thorough. MoniQue did a great job on my mani-pedi and was full of useful information, haha! To round out my day I figured why not get a spray tan huh? Jocelyn was very patient and thorough with the application and answered all my annoying questions. I would definitely recommend this spa to anyone living in or visiting Columbia.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/1/2014,9/7/2014,2,38,1,3,4>Small place but clean, with FREE wifi, plenty of parking, open early enough, change machine, clean machines and dryers that work. Play room for the kids and TVs..... Im in and out no problem, no fuss..there are clean bathrooms that remained locked and someone always on site to help. Most importantly this is close to home.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/1/2014,9/6/2014,3,7,3,4,5>My. Dentist. Rocks.  There... I said it....  Let that soak in and marinate within your soul...  Never in a million years could I imagine that I would actually ENJOY a dentist visit!  From the great customer service to the quality dental work, everything surpassed my expectations. I visited the Chrysostom Family Dentistry because of a toothache. Just like most people I used to hate the dentist.  Any dentist.  I  always viewed the dentist as a necessary evil that you go to a few times a year.  Or when you have a throbbing toothache.. Whichever comes first... Anywho... I walked into the establishment, and I was greeted in the most warmest manner!  I was so taken aback that I thought I walked into the wrong place.  You have to know my past experiences with dentists to understand my initial confusion.  Usually, the dentists I visited always felt like dark tombs full of zombies that only wanted your money and your teeth.  And not in that order.  But at the Chrysostom Family Dentistry it was different!  They got fancy televisions, bright colors and pretty receptionist ladies who are happy to see you!And... they gave me a welcome packet that included a cute Chrysostom Family Dentistry bag and a Chrysostom Family cup all for just walking in!  Brownie points for the Chrysostom Family Dentistry!  The dental hygienist was considerate and helpful.  I think her name is Megan.  Shout out to Megan! Dental hygienists like you make the world go 'round! :) And then, I met.... The Man!  The man that the place is named after. That's right, my beautiful people!  Dr. Chrysostom (a.k.a. Dr. C).He is the most hippest, most funkiest dentist I have met.  He plays cool music from the fifties and sixties (e.g., James Brown and The Beach Boys) when he is working on your teeth, and he has the most quirkiest sense of humor.  I dig this dude.  He's my kinda dentist: authentic and fun.  And sometimes, he wears these funky Hawaiian shirts.  I dig that. Real men wear Hawaiian shirts.  Remember that and write that down...  ;)Overall, I definitely recommend the Chrysostom Family Dentistry. They provide great customer service and awesome dental quality! Oh, and they give cute little gifts before and after your teeth are done.  For example, remember that little welcome packet I got when I walked in?  That wasn't the only thing they gave me.  I also left with a rose and a cookie!  A freakin' rose and a cookie!  *Insert unconstrained excitement right here*I give the Chrysostom Family Dentistry an A++  Go get your teeth fixed by Dr. C.  He's the best!
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2014,9/5/2014,16,47,1,4,5>After trying four tanning salons in Lexington, I found the perfect location in West Columbia!This salon is clean! I'm actually not terrified to slip my shoes off. They are cleaning every time I go in this place!The prices are by far the cheapest in the area! Dramatically cheaper! I am paying the same for two months as one month at Tiki Tan. Plus the bulbs are constantly changed out and they will tell you where the strong bulbs are.The best part... Karen is the owner/operator and works nearly everyday. She is a huge help if you are new to tanning, or have questions... This is the first salon I have went to that someone has recommended bulb strength, time as well as lotions.There's at least 9 beds PLUS a stand up bed, a turbo bed and the wider open beds for people that get claustrophobic.If you tan, when your next package runs out, take the drive, it's worth it!
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,9/2/2014,19,18,1,3,4>We love this place. I rarely ever order off of the regular menu because the specials menu is so dang tempting!  It can get a little loud when it's packed but as long as you're not a giant party it's not really a bother. When the weather is good I love sitting outside. Their pizzas are the perfect thin crispy crust that is so hard to find and they are all cooked in a wood burning oven which really takes the flavor up a notch.  Burrata caprese and the insalata de casa are always so fresh and seasonal. I had the best semifreddo here once, but I haven't seen it on the menu in a while. The Wine list is great and servers are always knowledgable. Two thumbs up from us!
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2014,9/1/2014,4,6,2,3,3>Best fried chicken in town! I normally get the chicken wings because I love chicken wings. But you can get any piece of chicken and it's going to be amazing. Also try a pineapple milkshake or an ice cream cone. You wouldn't be disappointed.

<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2014,8/30/2014,3,16,1,4,4>We went looking for a small couch for our den and the sales associate was very helpful and helped us look through all the options they had available in store and online. When we picked out the one we wanted, they had it in stock and delivered it 2 days later. They were prompt and on time for delivery and called to make sure that we were home and told us that they were on the way. The delivery men wee very nice and polite. They even complemented on how nice the color of the couch was. I would recommend Haverty's furniture to everyone. There furniture lasts forever. We have always preferred them.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2014,8/29/2014,8,6,1,8,6>Delicious! I had Shrimp and Grits two of the three times I visited. I love the atmosphere.. They even had Purple Haze, which is one of my very favorite beers! The first time I had an early dinner, and sat at the bar.. The bartender was friendly and funny. Great conversation. I have recommended Private Property to several friends and was eager to brag about it after my first visit. It's one of those hidden places, you want to tell everyone about.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/21/2014,8/28/2014,3,4,3,2,2>Now that is what I call indian! Not as clever as my usual intro lines, but its pretty dang honest.Intro: Walking in you get that indian vibe right away. It is slightly more modest then some of the Indian restaurants I have been to in terms of decor, but still sets the mood nicely. When we (my girlfriend and I) arrived we were seated promptly with kind service. It should be noted here that the reason this place did not get 5 stars is even though the service was friendly, it was fairly slow. We were not asked for our orders until about 20 minutes in. That is not a huge deal, but still sets this restaurant apart from a 5 star rating. The food: The savior from the long service. We got the chicken and lamb curry. Both were mouth-watering and delicious. The aroma coming from the food reminded me of walking around Queens, NY and experiencing the culture first hand. The chicken was moist with a creamy curry sauce. My girlfriend went on record saying that it was "The best curry I have ever tasted." The Lamb was also very good, and the signature curry smell was just perfect on it. The heat was fantastic on the lamb, but if you are not into heat than go for the chicken curry as the spice is turned down a bit. Top this all off with an order of Naan bread and some fantastic rice and you have yourself some good old fashioned indian food!Conclusion: Great food and ok service in a small intimate place. Expect to spend about 12.50 or so a person (on the modest side). If you are craving Indian food this is one of the best places in Columbia, SC hands down.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/22/2014,8/27/2014,5,9,,2,2>Love, love, love Midlands Motorworks.  Chrys and Bryan are great to work with.  They take the time to explain the problems/fixes.  The work is completed on time and the estimates are always accurate.  They have made my '06 MINI run like a brand new car with new clutch, struts, shocks and tires. They are accommodating with drop offs and pick ups.  Would not take my MINI anywhere else.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/24/2014,8/26/2014,0,29,1,3,2>We decided to try this out for Brunch. We made the right decision by heading there early. We arrived around 10:30am or so, and got one of the last tables available. By the time we had our food, the waiting area was swarmed. This is a popular brunch spot.The food was really good. I ordered an omelette with egg whites and chose sausage and casserole as the sides. My wife got the Eggs Benedict with casserole. For a light meal, mine was very tasteful. The casserole was the best part, and I enjoyed mixing it up with the omelette. The sausage was also very good, far better than the average breakfast spot. My wife loved her Eggs Benny.It isn't the most ambient place, but that's not the goal. I like that it's casual and relaxed, and prefer that over more formal brunch places. The prices were reasonably compared to other brunch restaurants. We will go here again.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/13/2014,8/23/2014,9,6,3,2,2>Great little coffee house by the SC. Coffee is excellent, both espresso drinks and brewed cups. Multiple brews every day. Staff was friendly and efficient, especially during the morning rush. Free wireless with an amusing password. Enough space so that seats were always available. Clientele ranged from dad's with strollers to suits. Great place!
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2014,8/22/2014,0,3,,1,2>I love this place! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it's just really good at being what it is, and that still means it's just affordable hibachi.  They are always friendly, make no issues about special requests, and ask questions to make sure they are getting everything just right for each customer.  The prices are very reasonable and the food is a higher quality than I would expect.  The steak is always tender and non-fatty (I cannot say this about other locations), the shrimp is not tiny, and the veggies I like (mushrooms and broccoli) are well seasoned and grilled.  I see that some folks question the chicken (that sounds like code), but there are plenty of delicious options.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/15/2014,8/21/2014,5,2,,2,3>I had Brock, the owner of Platinum, come and treat the interior and exterior of my home for pest prevention.  He was on time, professional, clean, and kind to my kids and pets.  He was very thorough and encouraged me to call with any issues at all between now and my next treatment.  He was honest and knowledgeable, and I will definitely have this company back.

<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2014,8/19/2014,4,4,1,3,2>I like this laundry place. You pay using a card which you get out of a machine in the wall. You load the laundry card with cash or with a credit/debit card. Using the machine you can easily check the balance on your laundry card and reload it. It also makes putting money in the washing/drying machines really easy. The place is clean. It has free wifi. There is always an attendant on duty.

<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,8/16/2014,1,4,,3,3>I love Trader Joes! Another person wrote that they only sell their name brand. I watched a documentary about the company, and the reason for this is to lower competition, which actually lowers price (it's a simple economics principle). They have a lot of quality goods at reasonable prices. I'm a college student on the paleo diet, which can be pricey. I love coming here because they sell the grass fed meats and basically anything you need for paleo/clean eating without breaking the bank.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/18/2014,8/15/2014,11,12,2,4,4>This was my first professional massage, and I'm very pleased with my experience. I've been dealing with a great deal of pain and tension for the past few months after a neck injury and surgery that has left me unable to move my neck on most days, and I left feeling more relaxed than have in a long time. It was definitely better than all the rolling around on a tennis ball and foam roller I've been doing lately :) I will definitely be returning soon!
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2014,8/14/2014,0,7,2,8,5>If you want real, authentic Chinese food that is the closest thing Columbia has to a big-city Chinatown eatery, this is it.  The place has a huge menu, including many traditional Chinese items that would be unfamiliar to those who have only eaten Americanized Chinese food.  There is a board at the entrance listing specials, including real Chinese vegetables.  The restaurant is very clean and pleasant, with excellent service.  It has some big, round tables with lazy susans for large parties.  The big tables are most frequently populated with big Chinese families.  It's a good sign.All of that said, I would advise that if you are not adventurous and would insist on ordering Americanized items like General Tso's chicken, you are missing out on what makes this place the best.  I'm sure they do a fine job on egg rolls, egg drop soup, and sweet-and-sour pork, beef and broccoli, egg foo yung, and fried rice, but that stuff is the same everywhere.  Go outside your comfort zone and order something different that you can't get at every fast-food Chinese joint in town.  Tell the server what flavors you like and ask for help choosing something from the authentic Chinese menu.  You'll be glad you did.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2014,8/13/2014,28,7,2,4,5>Great place for a breakfast or lunch.  The portions are large and the food is tasty. One of my Favorites is the Island Reuben.  It's a Fish sandwich made with Talapia with a Reuben twist!  The meat and three is always a good choice too.  Last week there was a Saturday Cook-out with some of the best Ribs I have had in a while...it was a hefty portion with corn on the cob, slaw and rolls all for $8!  You can not beat that!!
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2014,8/12/2014,8,47,1,5,4>Yoghut is my favorite yogurt place ever.  They always have the best flavors.  There has only ever been one visit where I haven't found at least one flavor I really wanted.  I love the Irish Mint they have around St. Patrick's Day, and the Oatmeal Cookie is so good!  I also love the Apple Pie, White Chocolate Mousse, and the Angel Food Cake.  They also have a great topping selection.  If you check in on Foursquare, you can get a discount.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2014,8/11/2014,13,8,1,2,1>I just moved to Columbia and was worried about being able to find a colorist and stylist who could get my style just as I like it. After poring over some Yelp reviews, I settled on The Color Amber Salon, and had a most wonderful experience.I called to schedule on a Monday mid-day, and they were able to get me in with my preferred stylist by Wednesday. Lydia did my color and cut--she started with a useful consultation wherein I showed her my hellacious roots and told her what I wanted. She brought out little tassels of hair and listened to me explain in great detail what I usually have done. She suggested a highlight and lowlight, explained to me all of my different options and then made some recommendations. The color she did came out AMAZING, as did the cut. She angled the front and layered the back, stopping at various points to show me, let me run my hands through it and then ask me if I wanted to keep going with more layers. She also touched up my eyebrows and did an excellent job at that, too.While she worked, she proved very fun and enjoyable to talk to. In addition, the salon's all-glass front provided a great shaded view of Senate St., enjoyable from several of the chairs. I will absolutely recommend this salon to my friends and colleagues, and I will no doubt be coming back for more of Lydia's wonderful stylings!
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2014,8/10/2014,1,6,1,4,3>Wow, we had a fantastic experience here! The restaurant is a great place for couples or groups of friends. The tapas were delicious and our server was extremely knowledgable and attentive. My favorite items were the cheese plate (with wine of course!), the filet, and the Brussels sprouts. The filet was cooked to perfection and a great value for the tapas portion size. We will go back again soon!
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2014,8/9/2014,4,13,3,7,5>I've lived in South Carolina for the past several years and had no idea this Ruth's Chris served breakfast. I was a little skeptical at first, but I'm glad I gave it a try. My friend and I decided to go for the all you can eat buffet rather than the specialty menu items. It was a good selection of standard breakfast items (eggs, sausage links and patties, bacon, biscuits, gravy, grits, etc.). I was told they make their own waffle batter fresh, but there were already so many choices--so I skipped out on it this time. There was also cereal, yogurt, toast, muffins, and fresh fruit. And probably a few other things that I can't recall at this second. Erin was our server for the morning and she was great. More importantly, I was impressed with how the manager (blue shirt and black tie) made rounds and asked if we were enjoying everything. He came back a second time to check up on us, too. The friendliness and professionalism of this staff is what will definitely bring me back (probably for lunch and/or dinner though, because I really want a hearty steak and crab cakes)!So in short, the breakfast was good. The service was excellent and attentive. Having dinner here will probably be more memorable, but it's nice to know this RC is available for breakfast and lunch. I'm jealous at this convenience for those staying at the Hilton!
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2014,8/8/2014,21,44,4,4,3>What a great local business! The owners Charlotte and Mike are super friendly and knowledgeable about their products. They don't just sell olive oils and balsamic vinaigrettes, but they also have many other local and/or family-owned product lines for sale in their store.They are very passionate about their products and it shows from the moment you walk in the door. They are happy to explain all of the benefits of the different oils and let you sample them (and show you the right way to sample them). This is more than a business. To me this place is a sign of Columbia, SC on the rise.If you haven't been here, please make time to check it out. Don't forget to ask about trying balsamic vinaigrettes with ICE CREAM. Sounds weird, but it's delicious. You're welcome!

<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/3/2013,8/4/2014,38,61,5,5,3>This place never ceases to amaze. In a good way. We first discovered this gem while wandering from bar to bar in the vista. When we walked in, we were confused. If you love the dive bar-iness of Uncle Louie's (I sure do!) but want to combine that with a mixture of nursing home residents and amateur / pro dance teams (I can only believe), this is your place.If you want a bar inside of an art school (?) that offers an initially confusing path to the bathroom, you my friend, have found it.If you love people watching, especially when those people 'get weird with it' in a bar decorated along the lines of 'strip club'...well, look no further. In one night we saw three AMAZING dance offs. I'm talking Michael Jackson choreographed style work. As far as dancing, this place reminds me of a wedding reception. The DJ, an old Columbia radio jockey, is pretty hilarious and plays current music, oldies, and wedding favorites. They also host Salsa Classes on Wednesday nights, not sure if there is a fee.Drinks are relatively cheap, and service is fast and friendly. I would give this place a try when you are looking for something unusual. Who knows, you might become a converted regular...

Two of my younger sisters LOVE cupcakes and are their biggest critics. CDS did the trick because they each bought two and ate them both tonight!

<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,7/31/2014,45,174,2,4,4>Other supermarkerts need to take a lead from Publix.  Any Publix store I have been to is always clean, bright, inviting making me want to shop here.  Yes, prices are higher than others and they do not offer a discount card, but nothing compares to their service.  A nice addition is that the baggers always ask (depending on the size of your purchase) if you need assistance to your car and have a pin on their aprons "Tips are not accepted" or something along those lines.  This location is not in your typical supermarket type of building - ir looks like it was another type of business in its former life.The thing about Publix is that they go above and beyond to help out their customers, as was the case last night at this location.  Even though I was not the customer directly being helped, I thought I would give a plug for this location.  I was at a birthday party for someone I know and she had ordered a cake from a personal baker that had done cakes for her before.  Party was downtown and starting at 5:30.  3:00 comes and she still does not have a cake. (On a side note she had not paid the baker yet - only after she got the cake).  When it was looking that she was not going to get her cake, she went to this Publix and spoke to one of the bakery employees (Donna) who was able to make a cake (not a really big cake) on the spot - pretty close to the way the other cake was supposed to be decorated (granted the cake itself was already baked - but not decorated).  Cake was done in enough time for our hostess to get to party by the time the party started.  This is not the first time Publix had help out local customers.  I know of another location (not sure which one in Columbia) that donated some food to s family that just had a funeral for one of their family members.
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2014,7/30/2014,3,3,1,2,2>I have been going to see Mabel at the Body Sugaring and Wellness Spa for nearly a year. When I moved to Columbia, I was looking for someone who could take care of my bikini waxing needs. I really liked my former esthetician, but moving over 1,000 miles away, I needed someone new. Getting a bikini wax is not a comfortable or pain-free procedure to begin with, so its very helpful to have someone who you feel comfortable with performing the service. After much research, I decided to try sugaring, as it is more natural and reputed to be less irritating than waxing. Body Sugaring and Wellness Spa came highly recommended. I was not disappointed with Mable or the sugaring service, in fact I was pleasantly surprised. The sugaring is much more gentle than waxing and my skin was not nearly as irritated afterward. Mable is very nice and easy to talk to; she makes you feel at ease during your service. Since my initial visit, I have gone to see her every 4 to 6 weeks for touch ups and have even used her to sugar my eyebrows, which aren't nearly as pink after sugaring as they are after waxing or threading. I would highly recommend the Body Sugaring and Wellness Spa to anyone. The location is easy to find and there is plenty of parking nearby on the street. The atmosphere is comfortable and calming and  I honestly believe the value I get for the price I pay is amazing.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2014,7/29/2014,32,42,1,3,3>I have always loved mellow mushroom. I came here for lunch with my mom. I like to sit at the bar upstairs, the downstairs "bar" area doesn't have all of the beers on tap. I got the stuffed mushrooms for the 1st time and I wasn't disappointed. any of the appetizers that have their balsamic glaze is probably a good bet. The restaurant is always clean, the staff is always friendly and the food (while not always the quickest) has always come out correctly and fresh.
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/22/2014,7/28/2014,78,23,1,3,2>Great, no frills (no covered tees/automatic ball loaders), well cared for driving range with great prices, a nice little pro shop, and also serves as the Gamecock golf practice facility. Only complaint is the ball markers aren't as well marked (100, 150, 200, etc) as others but definitely the best range for anyone on the downtown Columbia/forest acres/cayce/west Columbia vicinity aka (15 miles of city center)Also, after reading reviews, they take cards and they have a very nice (from the looks of it) putt-putt course complete with water features.
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2014,7/27/2014,4,3,1,4,3>I am a huge, huge fan of Egg Roll Station, going back to my college days.  I'm trying to branch out on the menu lately and tonight I got the Dragon's Triplet which includes shrimp, chicken and pork along with veggies and fried rice.  I also picked up an order of Egg Drop Soup and a couple of egg rolls.  The portions are plentiful so I can easily make at least two meals out of this and the cost was under $11.  It's a great deal for the amount of food you get.  Everything was delicious and I'll be making another trip again I know.  The service is always friendly and I highly recommend giving them a try.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2014,7/26/2014,462,196,3,9,5>I'm big on pho, pho-sure! My regular order: Spring roll and or summer roll, chicken pho with tendon and tripe, a side of fatty broth and scallion, avocado bubble tea, and extra vegetables. Not many places have the fatty broth and if you can get your hands on it (and not watching your weight) then you should ask for it. There shouldn't be a charge for it. What it does is enhances the flavor and leaves a nice chapstick feeling on your lips. :)  The goi cuon/summer rolls here comes with a peanut sauce that i particularly love. Not everyone likes the peanut sauce (ahem, my hubby) so i would suggest asking them for the fish sauce if that's the case. The spring rolls are  the size that i'm used to. They're smaller and have less things in it in comparison to the way my mom makes these. they're still good and flavorful although i do know what a 10 tastes like. I would rate these as 4 from what i'm used to.. however, beggars cannot be choosers right? So i'll take them! Now the good stuff, the pho broth here to me seems more flavorful than the other pho viet on decker (err, and it's also 2 mins closer to me). I don't feel very lethargic when when i'm done eating. At some pho places, the MSG additive makes me feel extremely tired and thirsty. Lastly, if you've never tries an avocado shake, please do me and yourself a favor, GET IT! I promise you'll like it. If you're feeling brave, get it with the bubbles at the bottom. Its really not scary to try, it's comparable to a chewy gummy that's flour-based that's honey sweet. The one con about this location in comparison to the decker one is that they have metered parking up until 6pm. Boo :(. Make sure you have some coins with you or come after 6pm. Bon appetite!
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/16/2014,7/25/2014,3,25,1,6,3>I came 8pm on a Tuesday . Not too crowded , convenient parking . LIVE music! I ordered a bottle of wine $26 which I was allowed to cork and take the rest home. Ordered the daily special which was shrimp and andouille sausage over cheddar grits. Awesome and rich. Took half of it home. Also tried the cheese plate which tonight consisted of a balsamic soaked parmigian, a smoke bleau, and an apricot Stilton cheeses served with orange slices, strawberries and almonds. Total bill $53 with tax but worth it!
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2014,7/23/2014,0,11,2,3,2>I love fabric and sewing and this store is like a toy store for kids.  For me it is my greatest guilty pleasure and I can't say enough about how helpful they have been.  I have spent time just wandering around, seen demonstrations and had questions answered without hesitation each time I have visited.  Phone service has been very good as well and I cannot say enough about their selection of fabrics, notions, patterns and machines along with anything else you might need or dream of needing for sewing and quilting.  If you need inspiration or real help this is the place to go.  They also have a newsletter and classes as well.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/20/2014,7/22/2014,112,197,4,4,3>When I left Columbia on a work trip back in February, I didn't know what PDQ was. It was some plywood, some brick, and looked like it had a drive thru window but there was nothing that told me it would be what it is. Flash forward (or backward?) to the beginning of May, and I'm back. I drive by it on my way to work and I'm like...what is that? PDQ? Chicken tenders!? YES. I finally made time to get away from the desk and get here today for lunch, and I was very happy with what I got. Similar to Raising Canes, they serve a lot of chicken tender based platters, to include the namesake itself, a regular old chicken tender platter. And they are right - these people are dedicated to quality. The chicken tenders are crisp and flavorful all white meat, and don't even need one of their signature sauces. But the sauces are good too. I tried chipotle BBQ and everyone's favorite, honey mustard. Good, good stuff. And the fries are similar to Five Guys fries. Very tasty. Overall, this place is pretty good. When I need my chicken tender fix I know where to go, but hopefully that craving won't come along too often!
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2014,7/21/2014,33,18,,5,3>This is the place to run in Columbia! They even have distance markers for those who don't like to run with their phones.  The course is paved and relatively flat with a great view of the river on both sides and shade provide by trees growing along the bank.  I always feel so serene and safe when I am here.  Even when there are a lot of people, everyone is courteous and generally keep to themselves.  Everyone knows that this is a place for peaceful escape.  They have clean bathroom facilities, a water fountain for you and your dog, plenty of parking and enough lights to light up the course when it starts to get dark.  And if you're not a runner, this is still a perfect place to just walk and think...or ride you bike...or rollerblade.  I've seen it all.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/22/2014,7/20/2014,102,139,3,5,6>We came here recently for a little Yelp event and I must say, I was impressed. The customer service was what really stood out. The two folks working there were EXTREMELY attentive, and even gave my boyfriend and me a sample of all the different bubble things so we could pick favorites. I'm big into the banana-chocolate combination, and he was sold on the "Clemson Tiger", in part because he graduated from there (please don't hold that against him, though I certainly do as a Gamecock fan).I'm moving offices soon and Bubble Tea Cafe will be just a skip, hop, and a jump away. I'll definitely go there for a little mid-day pick-me-up!
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2014,7/19/2014,67,157,1,7,3>Words really can't describe the experience we had here.  It was freakin awesome from start to finish.  My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday to see the Evil Dead Musical.  First, the musical was incredible.  The actors, the set, the whole production was really well-done.  The musical was hilarious.  The theater only seats a little over a 100 people so there's not a bad seat in the place.  There's free popcorn placed about every two seats and there's friendly volunteers and workers that fill it up for free.  We had at least 3 people ask if we were doing alright or if we needed anything else.The manager, Larry, came up and introduced himself to us and chatted for a while.  Really personable and just a great guy.  The whole vibe was like you were hanging out with your closest friends and family watching a play.  Everyone we met was welcoming and friendly.  They sell alcohol.  Good alcohol thats reasonably priced.I mean imagine it...sitting in a reclining seat with a bowl of popcorn and a bucket of coronas ($16 bucks for five beers...a great price!) while watching a fantastic play.  It really doesn't get better.  I loved loved loved my experience and cannot wait to come back for the next play.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,7/18/2014,209,314,8,16,14>Our 3 year old grandson paid us a visit recently (think of a bull in a china shop) so I had to get him out of the house for a while.Monkey Joe's was the perfect place to take him and let him burn off all that energy for a few hours.The prices were very reasonable,I believe it was less than $10 for several hours.Adult entry is free and there were many comfortable chairs to sit and watch the little ones having fun.As previous reviewer stated,the staff were all smiles and helpful.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2014,7/16/2014,4,5,,4,2>Just tried this place last night!  It was a fun place to eat, the staff were friendly and welcoming, and the food was delicious and unique.  We got the vegetable platter and the beef cooked spicy.  Both were delicious, and someone came by our table offering more veggies whenever she saw we were running low.  The only complaint I had was that we had to ask for napkins, which is something quite necessary when you are eating everything with your hands!  Other than that it was a great experience and I definitely plan on going back.
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2014,7/15/2014,17,3,2,2,2>There is absolutely no better popcorn in the world! I have decided that instead of buying those dorky tin cans of popcorn at Christmas time,  I'm going for a gigantic, yellow bag of Cromer's popcorn! So put that in your kettle and pop it rin - tin cans!
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/9/2014,7/14/2014,49,28,1,6,3>I had a pecan pie tart, and the bltc.  C for goat cheese.  The bacon was thin and crisp, and served on a baguette that was perfect--not too crunchy and not too soft.  It was served with a mixed green salad that was cool and fresh.  Their house dressing is a vinegrette with lemon juice that was the perfect amount of acidity. They also have a good selection of vegetarian options if that suits your needs. Parking isn't a problem even though it's downtown because it is right beside the new city garage, and only two blocks from the old city garage on Sumter.   Catch it at the right time and there is a fair amount of street parking available,  too.The interior is clean, bright, and the family that runs it is friendly, and quick.  This is a great lunch spot with comfortable booths and a welcoming energy that makes you want to sit a spell and retreat from the usual downtown bustle.
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/29/2014,7/13/2014,66,259,1,4,3>Think this is just another hot dog stand?  Think again.  If you like customizing your dog, you'll be in heaven here.  The topping choices are endless and you can choose from beef or sausage options.  Personally I like the really spicy choices and the sauerkraut.  The pineapple relish is amazing as well and the prices are very reasonable.  Check this out if you need catering for your work event or party.  So good!
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,7/12/2014,24,140,2,3,2>If you're thinking this is anything like your dorm room delite, you are way off!  These delicious noodles are served in a delicious rich miso broth.   The meat is not the star of the dish.  I like the veggie ramen in the spicy pork miso.  Limited menu, but you really don't need anymore!  Best on a cold day or when you have a cold!  LOVE this place!
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,7/11/2014,12,75,,5,3>I always enjoy eating here. It gets a little crowded at lunch but I understand why, it's good!I enjoyed the portobello mushroom sandwich and house made tomato basil soup. Both delicious.I like seeing a little more of a granola crowd. A few tats, a few bearded dudes, a few college faces and the LOCALS.  It's just feels comfy to me.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2014,7/10/2014,38,63,4,8,6>My bf made a reservation on Saturday afternoon for 8:30 that night (I'd originally wanted to go at 6:30 but 8:30 was the earliest available).We parked across the street down in the grassy area (free, and the weather was decent so it was a nice short stroll up the hill).  We were immediately greeted by the hostess who confirmed the reservation and asked if we were ready to sit now because a table was available (we got in around 8:20).Our booth was nice, cozy AND CLEAN so I felt very comfortable!It did seem to take a bit for our server to come get our drink orders but it wasn't too much of an annoyance because we were enjoying each other's company and the atmosphere of the place.Note: he and I were stressing out with figuring out what to wear... Yelp has the attire listed as dressy... we're mainly a jeans, tank tops, polos, and flip flops kinda couple... once we started to look around there were indeed many people dressed in suits, but there were just as many or more dressed in the typical southern "dressy casual" attire (sun dresses, capris, sperrys, JEANS and polos).Anyway - our server finally arrived, filled our glasses with refreshing ice water and took our drink order (we split a pellegrino).When she returned with the sparkling water we placed our app order (butcher's plate and lamb mac).The butcher's plate was interesting I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't order it again.The lamb mac & cheese was good, the meat tasted like a smoky pulled pork.For our entree we split the duck confit pizza and haricots vert.The pizza was good, I liked the combination of sweet and salty (duck & port soaked cherries) on the crispy thin crust.  The haricots vert tasted like plain ol' sautéed green beans to me (I guess that's just what they are).All in all it was a pleasant experience and I had a good time...Especially running back down the steep hill to get back to the car.
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/11/2014,7/9/2014,8,12,,4,2>We recently had some friends tell us about the Pizza Joint so we decided to try it out and it is now at the top of our list for pizza places! The atmosphere is laid back but family friendly. A full beer selection and we were pleasantly surprised when our waitress told us they had $5 pitchers of some domestics! We made our own pizza and it was delicious. Not super filling to the point where we were miserably full. The crust was garlicky but not overwhelming. We had two pitchers and a 14" pizza and it was only $29. Great find and highly recommended!
<review# 127,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/13/2014,7/8/2014,14,53,3,10,3>This water park is a very affordable place to relax and/or work on your tan. Inside, you can buy burgers, pizza, pretzels, nachos, and ice cream. They have hot dogs advertised, but have not been able to buy any whenever I go. The park itself is nice, but small. Of course, for the price you really can't complain. [5 star potential]There are showers, lockers, and changing areas by the entrance. (Bring your own lock) The changing area itself is small as it's between the bathroom and shower stalls. Toward the back end of the water park, they have a dry play area over rubber ground (not dirt or grass), which is shaded alongside with a shady lounge area if you just want to read a book in-between water sessions. [-1 star] The only downside is the food shack...it is SLOOOOOOW. The food workers seem to not have any experience working at a burger joint as they take forever to get anything out to you. I stood in line to order a drink for 54 minutes while they attended to 6 people ahead of me through a single window. (Yes, I timed it) The problem is very consistent. Each time I've gone to the window, regardless of others waiting in line, they seem lost when coordinating who is handling nachos or burgers, among other things. You can't take outside food into this park, so they should at least improve their service speed if we're relying on them alone for food and beverages.The schedule for 2014 is found at this link:fortjacksonmwr.com/water
<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2014,7/7/2014,204,446,,8,5>When a bar keep introduces himself and shakes your hand upon arrival you know you probably got some great service coming your way. I had the best they had to offer which is Pluff Mudd Porter from Holy City w raw fries w malt vinegar, nice place to have a few beers before heading home. I will definitely return here just because of the service, I like bartenders with people skills like these folks at  Publick House.
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2014,7/4/2014,8,3,1,4,1>Harper's wait staff are well schooled on the entire menu and can answer questions about any dish. I am especially pleased how accommodating the restaurant is to altering menu items to suit preferences. For example,  I request certain greens on my salads, no croutons or bacon but adding extra cucumber. Every time my meal is delivered fresh and just as I wanted.

<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/29/2014,7/2/2014,6,5,,4,2>My wife and I decided to try this spot out after our first choice for Sunday brunch was too busy. We walked in and there were enough open tables that we didn't have to wait. The place was busy but a server came to our table quickly. The server was nice and friendly. I ordered the monte cristo while the wife tried the French toast. Both were good. The mimosas were nicely priced at $2.50 each. Our total bill with tip was $30. A bit steep but not unexpected. All in all I would eat here again but probably wouldn't seek it out as a first choice for brunch.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/23/2014,7/1/2014,5,24,,3,1>My friend and I dined at Pearlz late on a Friday night. I had the mussels and the oysters Rockefeller. Both very very tasty... The mussels definitely deserve 5 stars. I could have finished off the broth left in the bowl with a spoon! The only part of my dining experience I did not fully enjoy was the noise. Very loud... But I should expect that for somewhere in the Vista on a Friday night. Maybe dining earlier next time will be better. The restaurant was also out of the crab fondue my friend ordered...not really a big deal though. I will definite be returning.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,6/30/2014,1,4,,5,2>Very excellent bbq!  I had heard about this place a few weeks ago,  but hadn't had time to try it.   Today I was in the area at lunch so I decided to stop by.   Took my son and went in to get sandwiches to go.   First of all, the bartender was very friendly and helpful with our order.   Secondly the owner was there in and out stocking the bar.  Friendly guy.  Wanted to apologize about the wait to get my food.   But I told him not to worry. Because I know that good food is well worth the wait.   And oh boy.   Was it worth it!   My son and I got home and dug in to some awesome bbq!  He Liked it as well.   Will be back. ...a lot!
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,6/29/2014,84,2,,6,2>Not your "run of the mill" cafe and sandwich shop.  The sandwiches all have a little twist and there are vegetarian options, as well.  I've tried most all of them and have not been disappointed yet.  My favorite is the fisherman's wharf which has smoked salmon and pepper jack cheese.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/8/2014,6/28/2014,69,7,2,6,2>Best Thai restaurant in Columbia, hands down. My friends and I carry out, but dine in just as often. They also serve lunch! The servers are so sweet and attentive. Their tom yum soup is warming, delicious, and good for the soul. I love the cashew nut--stir fry blend of veggies and a meat. And of course the classic favorite, Pad Thai, never disappoints. I've had the Rainbow Duck a few times too--not bad. That's just to name a few of my favorite dishes. I've never had a meal that disappoints here. OH, can't forget dessert! Mango and sticky rice. Trust me, you won't regret it.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2014,6/27/2014,15,86,1,6,4>Delicious, romantic and great experience!! We dined here for the first time for my birthday on a Friday night. We were sat immediately and greeted within a minute or so. The waitress greeted me with a "happy birthday" which was so sweet. We ordered a nice bottle of wine and the OMG Nueske's Bacon. This is hands down one of the BEST things I have ever eaten in my life. It's a thickly cut piece of bacon with the most amazing flavor. If I had to guess I'd say they smoke it then bake it. It has the perfect combination of salt, sweet and heat, drizzled with some maple syrup. We cannot wait to bring our out of town guests here for the bacon, because BACON! Ok, sorry, it's just THAT good. We also received our bread/butter with the bacon. This was not really to our liking as the butter is very salty, overpowering in a way that we didn't enjoy.I ordered the Ribeye with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes and my husband ordered the Hanger Steak. My steak was outstanding. It was cooked perfectly medium and the mashed potatoes are heavenly. They are very cheesy and smooth, I'd guess a blend of 3-4 different kinds.  My only gripe is that my Ribeye had a 2-3 inch tendon in it that made part of it difficult to cut/eat. However the portion is so large I didn't find myself trying to cut around it. My husband loved his hanger steak. It was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth. I wasn't able to finish my steak and we got a doggy bag. The dessert menu didn't have anything that jumped out at us, we usually go for the crème brulee, but we were so full it didn't matter, maybe something they can expand on in the future. For the two entrée's, bacon appetizer and wine our meal was $140 and well worth it.Overall it was a wonderful experience; our server was attentive, fast and so nice. We will definitely be back for the bacon and some drinks.  The low lighting makes for a great atmosphere. I think the poor service reviews were rarities. I witnessed both managers helping to clear tables, deliver food and refill drinks. That's pretty darn good service if you ask me. Don't show up in jorts to eat a $40 steak, that's just common sense people. The crowd is a great mix, young college kids, mid-twenties professionals and 40+ year old trendy crowd.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/2/2013,6/26/2014,1,12,,5,3>This is my favourite place in Columbia. The food is delicious and the service is normally very good.  This is a microbrew so be sure to check the chalk boards for the draught selections. I am a big fan of their ESB when their seasonal is tapped out. Reasonable wine selection by the glass ( again check the chalk board).For food the menu is awesome. The gyro is delicious, the Mac and cheese is spot on, the pizzas are good, and the pierogies are awesome. The appearizers are always spot on and i often will split the ESB pimento cheese or the muscles ( in a perfect white wine sauce) with the table. The Greek salad is topped with a light homemade vinegarette that is simply perfect and never too much.Always check the chalk board for new inventions from the kitchen, especially when they offer appetizers ( including local cheese boards) and desserts ( like their pineapple upside down cake).This place is always fresh and the atmosphere is always nice.Jazz nights on Thursdays and sometimes local artists will have concerts on the weekend. Great vibe, great food; a good place to be.

They do try and squeeze everyone in as they can. But the food is the best. Fresh, prepped to perfection. Service is above standard. The sushi chefs will go above and beyond what is on the menu to make you happy. 10 out of 10!

<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2010,6/21/2014,7,17,,7,2>I have to admit that I order the same entree every time I visit Garibaldi's. The overall presentation, flavor, and texture of the crispy flounder is the amazing. As I have stated in previous reviews, I prefer simple, fresh flavors with my fish. The crispy flounder is exactly what I look for when ordering fish at a restaurant.My mother ordered the veal scaloppine marsala which I tried. It was so good that I might consider ordering it next time-maybe-if I can turn down the flounder. The veal was so tender, and the flavors in the mushroom marsala wine sauce were well balanced.In my haste to describe my unconditional love for the crispy flounder, I forgot to mention the appetizers and salad we had. The scallops were fresh with a simple sauce. The crab cake had plenty of crabmeat and was quite tasty. The poached pear salad will definitely become another staple of mine when visiting. It was DELICIOUS! For dessert, we had their signature dessert and creme brulee. Both were executed perfectly. I will continue to return to this gem of a restaurant!

When we got there they gave us a full ,golf cart, tour of the place. It wasn't busy this day so we really enjoyed ourselves. Everything is well maintained here and the staff is very laid back.

<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/10/2014,6/16/2014,5,14,,3,2>Good vegetarian choice. Although meat is cooked on the same grill, but hey! It's good and I joined their "Loyalty Club" and got a discount. The trick is the sauces. Mix & match. I like the garlic, soy sauce, sunflower seed and peanuts. Pretty pleased with the place over all. It is a bit pricey.  Give it a try if you like stir fry.

<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2014,6/14/2014,10,11,,4,2>Many Indian restaurants have come and gone in Columbia, and I can say with some degree of confidence that this is the best Indian restaurant that has been here.  If this was in a bigger city I would probably give it 3 stars, but for Columbia I'd say that this is a 4 star restaurant.  They have a few options as far as ordering goes, there a weekday lunch buffet and a weekend buffet, and you can order from the menu.  The Lunch buffet is pretty good, they have a pretty wide variety of dishes with plenty of veg and non-veg options.  The buffet has a lot of appetizers including samosas, pakoras and and  uttapum.  The pakoras are pretty good, they are what you would expect from an Indian buffet.  The pakoras aren't very good, they can be a bit too soggy and the same goes with the uttapum.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Tikka Masala as well as the Chicken Manchurian.  The tandoori chicken is also very good at the buffet.  The goat curry is okay, it's a little bit too saucy and the goat isn't as tender as it could be.  For the Veg I like the Paneer Makhni, which has a nice flavor to it and the paneer has a nice texture. Also, you can order dosa's as part of the buffet.  They have really improved on their dosas here, it's not as good as the one you order but for a lunch buffet they are pretty good.  Their naan is very good and they replenish it very often, and there is a choice of white rice or a vegetable pulao.  The desserts change every time I go, they usually have a rotation of Rasmalai, Jalebi, Gulab Jamun and a custard.  They can be wildly inconsistent, sometimes the dessert is very good and tastes very fresh, other times they can taste stale and soggy.  Overall, I'd say the lunch buffet is very good, I am a fan of their chicken dishes with the naan, not a huge fan of the appetizers or the goat curry.Their weekend buffet is very similar to the lunch buffet, with the additions of some more goat items and a biryani.  The biryani is pretty good, as far as buffet biryani goes it's one of the better ones I've had.  The goat is a little better than their lunch buffet but I'm still not a huge fan of it.  The desserts are always better during the weekend buffet, they are not as inconsistent, the jalebi is usually very sweet and crispy and the custard is very creamy filled with mangoes.  Ordering off the menu will get you the best food at any restaurant, and bombay grill is no different.  Their appetizers are much better, as they are freshly fried when you order it.  The samosa's are a bit more crispy as well as the pakoras.  I am a fan of their Vada's, they are nice and crisp on the outside and soft on the inside like they should be, and the chutney's they give you are pretty good.  The Utttapam is much better when you order it.  It's a bigger portion and  the flavor and crispiness is much better.  Their Biryani is the best in Columbia, but I'd say overall its pretty average biryani.  I know a lot of people who are huge fans of it, and if you haven't had biryani before you would definitely love it.  Their Chicken tikka masala is very good, it's nice and creamy with tender chicken that's never dry.  I was a big fan of the Lamb Roganjosh, the lamb was very tender and the masala they use is very flavorful and it's not too spicy.  The Dosais at Bombay Grill are probably the best in Columbia.  They give you a fairly large portion that's filled with potatoes and chutney depending on which one you get.  The Sambar and coconut chutney they give are very good and the flavors mix together reallly well.  I'd say the Dosais are my favorite dish at Bombay Grill.  Overall, Bombay Grill is very deserving of its 4 stars.  The Buffets are very good save for a few items, and the food you order is definitely the best indian food i've had in columbia.  It's very good for large groups, there's a room in the back that you can use.  The service is pretty good and they are usually very accomodating.

My husband is a huge fan of their white pizza, and I love all of their Greek options. The Greek salad is amazing! Really awesome desserts that are always handmade and fresh. We've ate it and placed to go orders and everything has always been great.
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/7/2014,6/12/2014,17,5,,3,2>I go to our farmers market on the regular an found Noah's Pizza that way. They had a table there, making the pizza and even a portable fire oven. They cooked the pizza on site & was selling by the slice or whole pies. I tried a slice and fell in love. We're been looking for a good pizzeria with some good pizza in out area so we're excited about it and can't wait to try the restaurant!
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/17/2013,6/11/2014,35,32,,5,3>Immac is one of the few hole in the wall type coffee shops left in Columbia. They are usually crowded with students, USC faculty and staff, lawmakers, and other state workers who are within walking distance. They have pretty good prices on lunch, which has a creative selection of soups, salads and sandwiches. For a more secluded lunch, though noisy from the creaking floor, head downstairs to the basement. Good vegetarian options, and I can't comment in the coffee since I haven't had any from there in a while.
<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/11/2013,6/10/2014,16,47,,4,2>Love, love, love this location. We liked the idea of one closer, however, they have closed the buffet there, so to the other side of town we go.Normally, the service is average, but Friday, we had a GREAT server. She was very attentive, kept our drinks full, and kept the clean plates coming. They've changed their catfish breading, but it's still tasty. The food is tasty, I just wish they could offer more items for the price on the buffet.Also, we prefer to sit out on the patio, because the wood floor in the dinning room will make you feel like you're on a boat every time someone walks by, lol.I hear they are serving breakfast or brunch on the weekends soon!
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/30/2014,6/9/2014,14,17,,5,3>Food is incredible today-  chicken-green bean stir fry- awesome.  The place is packed- nice to see.  Service is excellent- great atmosphere.
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/31/2014,6/8/2014,4,16,,4,3>Their fish and chips are legit. Best British pub food in town, with a great local feel. They keep local breweries on tap and their apple pie martini is heavenly.

When I am out of town or on vacation he loves going there and always comes back super happy. Laura, the owner, knows how much Max means to me and even sends me pictures of him playing during the day. Max and I both love Wescott and would recommend it to anyone!
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2013,6/6/2014,25,14,,3,2>I took my mom, husband, and kid here for lunch after touring the State House. Four meals and no complaints. That's unheard of in my experience. My mom always has something to bitch about and my kid is really picky. My husband was excited about all the beers. I had the grilled chicken salad and that chicken breast was grilled PERFECTLY. My mom had the grilled chicken sandwich and she actually exclaimed "This is GOOD!" and ate the whole thing. She never does that. Daughter had the chicken strips and was happy. Husband ate the bratwursts and loved them. The service was a little slow especially considering the place was nearly empty (we try to eat at off times), but the food was good enough to offset the service.The music playing while we ate was awesome. So: great food, great music, extensive beer selection, mediocre service. I'd go back.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2014,6/5/2014,0,124,,3,2>Wonderful!  Absolutely wonderful.  Started with the lobster spring rolls.  Steamed beef with sesame and broccoli  and vegetable fried rice for a main dish.  Portion was enough for two.  Mango sorbet, oh so good, for dessert.  Drink selection was tempting and after spending most of the day in the rain, it was the peach cosmopolitan.  Waitress was prompt and polite.  Did not rush is and allowed us enjoy the food and have great conversations and catch up.  Establishment is ultra clean and tres chic.  Parking is ample and located behind restaurant.  Some of the healthiest food served in the area.  Private dining room for large parties.  Bar was busy all night
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/16/2014,6/4/2014,50,119,2,5,5>Just happened to stumble across this place while in Five Points.   Unlike other second hand stores, this place has good quality merchandise with name brand labels.  The owners are really nice people who like to joke around while you shop.  And the dog, such a nice dog.  The clothing selection it huge and you could spend hours looking and find several things.  If you need help, ask and they will find something for you.  Huge selection of Ralph Lauren Polo stuff at great prices.  Lots of new stuff as well.  Give it a shoot and take a look around.
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2014,6/3/2014,19,29,,3,2>Awesome neighborhood deli. They have good pasta salad, and tuna salad. My husband said the chicken salad was good too. If the soup of the day is chicken bog, it's delicious! Best coconut macaroons you will find!
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,6/2/2014,2,4,,5,2>I've been going here since I was a kid. I love that they have classic video games there! And I never have time to go and watch the new movies when they come out and I usually miss them too. So this theater is like a second chance to watch what I want for a cheap price!
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,6/1/2014,21,44,1,6,3>Came here for the first time yesterday and it was absolutely delicious. I drove about 25 minutes from Irmo to try this place and I couldn't have been more impressed.  I ordered the chicken finger sandwich on coco bread with their signature calypso sauce. It was AMAZING. The portions are huge, prices reasonable, and the food is delicious.  The sandwiches come with house made chips which are well seasoned.We also tried the zucchini chips and potato salad - both were the best I've ever tasted anywhere.You absolutely must eat here, and eat here often.

The owner, Cheryl, happened to be working that day and was very friendly and helpful. The store is loaded with cool jewelry, clothing, purses, shoes, and lots and lots of hats. Adjacent space has gently used home furnishings, which is where I scored a great rattan and glass top table for my sun room. Will definitely drop in every time I am due for a haircut.

Everyone is very professional as we are always greeted with a smile and feel so comfortable leaving our dog here. They have gotten to know our sweet Hobbs and personalize his visit to best suit his personality. He is an older dog and they are so gentle with him when bathing and grooming. Twice a month for almost five years our dog has come home well groomed with his fancy bandana and dreams about his fun day at Groomingdales!

<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2014,5/26/2014,3,12,,3,1>I've been here on a couple of occasions and really love this place. They make their own mozzarella and their thin crust pizzas take me back to when I had visited Italy a couple years ago. The portion size is just right (although some would consider 'small' when compared to supersized American portions).The owners and staff are super friendly and attentive. I'm so glad that this little gem is a stone's throw from my house!
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/3/2014,5/25/2014,31,4,,8,3>The food and restaurant concept are great. Plus, the customer service is wonderful.

This is a must go to!

<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/10/2014,5/22/2014,3,7,,5,2>I always assign a tagline to any business establishment where I have utilized its services.  I can't help it.  It's instinctive for me. The tagline serves as an intellectual organizer for me.   Spa 131's tagline? "Comfort starts here."As soon as I walked in I immediately felt comfortable. Peaceful music, sensual smells and a warm owner (Marci) combined together created an inviting atmosphere. I utilized the Sugar waxing services for my underarms, and I finally experienced what a real sugar waxing session should feel like.  If you read my last review, then you are aware that I had a terrible experience at another waxing establishment that I will not name here out of respect for Spa 131. But the memory of that horrible sugar waxing experience was quickly banished with Marci's grace and expertise.  She greeted me with a hug and thoroughly explained the process. Additionally, she is humorous, personable and a great conversationalist! Too bad she doesn't do Brazilians. But she recommended another establishment that I will be using soon!I would highly recommend Spa 131! I didn't feel rushed or mistreated! A+++

<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2014,5/20/2014,112,197,,5,3>Stopped here to get a set of cupcakes for my mom's birthday since she was going to be in town with my dad and brother.  Being from the DC area, I probably reached cupcake fatigue years ago, but they are definitely perfect for a small family birthday instead of going with a big cake that nobody will likely finish.These cupcakes are actually really good.  The shop is open and you can see the ladies working on mixing, etc. right there before your eyes.  They are incredibly nice here as well, and the value is very good.  My only complaint is that the icing is "piled high" but I fully understand I'm probably an outlier that doesn't like a ton of icing on my treats, because otherwise most bakeries would make them that way, haha.If you live near downtown or even if you don't, I would say it's worth the trip to try them out.  They have some creative flavors and they're all very good, especially the chocolate-peanut butter cupcake.Good stuff!
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2014,5/19/2014,2,5,,4,4>The store credit system rocks, and because it's all based on list price, the credit adds up quickly. Definitely feeds my book buying addiction. The people working here are great, and the selection is pretty good for your average reader. Some of the more high-brow sort of stuff required in literature classes is a bit hit or miss sometimes, and you do (as is the case with all used book stores) need to be careful if you're particularly particular about the condition of your used fiction comes in. But overall, a great place.
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/21/2014,5/18/2014,45,174,,8,4>I am officially a wrap fan!  I have had Roly Poly Wraps on a few occasions before (catered meals) and thought that now that I am working in the downtown area again, I would swing by here and grab a wrap.  NOTE: They only do wraps, salads, and soups.There is quite a variety of wraps to choose from ranging from turkey, chicken, roast beef, and veggies.  Most wraps are already predetermined, but are made to order so if there is a wrap that you want, minus an ingredient, you can request to have that ingredient to not be put on wrap.  You can also create you own wrap if there is nothing that suits your fancy.  Regardless of what kind of wrap you get, a 6" wrap is $3.95 and a 12" wrap is $6.50.  I went for the 12" wrap thinking the 6" would not be filling enough.  I added on chips and a drink, and order came under $10, so could get a little pricey.They have moved locations (had not been in previous location).  From the looks of it, there is not much indoor seating, but there is outdoor seating, which may not always be a good option, as with my last visit it was raining.  But given location, Roly Poly probably caters more to the people that work in the area and more than likely take their lunch back to the office.  Also note, Roly Poly is only open M-F 7:30-5 and closed on major holidays.If you do not work in the immediate area (like I do), parking can be tricky.  There are a few red (ie 30 minute) meters right outside the restaurant, more than likely for those that drive to restaurant thinking they might not eat in.  They do cater and you can also call ahead to pick up your order (as I might do for future visits - my past visit was not overly crowded as it was Good Friday - a regular had mentioned that it was taking longer than normal - as I was thinking it sure was taking a while for not being superly busy with people more than likely off from work).Maybe down the road someone would open another store outside the downtown area!

Good selection of other Japanese favorites: different kinds of teriyaki meat, katsu, and tempura. Hands down best SUKIYAKI to be had in Columbia!!! We go here at least once a month with my whole family and the waitstaff is always eager to please. Clean restaurant and brightly lit with food appearing quickly.
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/5/2014,5/16/2014,3,25,,6,3>The buffet has a nice assortment of items both vegetarian and with meat.  They told me the heat scale is 1-5 and that the buffet was a 3.  I found the buffet to be a bit mild, but then I like spicy food. Don't let yourself get distracted by the buffet though. I ordered the LAMB Biryani and asked for it be a 4 on the spicy scale and it was AWESOME! A healthy portion I ate on for 2 days. The only thing I would say is that they ran out of Naan on the buffet and it took them a while to replenish it.
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,5/15/2014,67,157,1,8,2>What a great place.  By far my favorite place I've gone to in Columbia.  I got a phone call one Tuesday night asking if I wanted  $0.75 tacos.  Yep.  So I plugged in the address drove to Main Street, parked and walked to the building.  Only to find a closed bank.  Um where is it?  I looked around. "Are you looking for the Whig?"  I turned around to see a man dressed in dark leaning against a post.  "You're looking in the wrong place.  Go around the corner and look down."  I walked around the corner and looked down to a dimly lit staircase and some wall leaners smoking.  I felt immediately like I was home.  The bar is dark, underground and worn.  It was perfect.  There's three variety of tacos.  Bean, beef or combo.  People were ordering then picking up their own plates from the kitchen.  It was crowded with the most diverse crowd I've come across in Columbia yet.  PBR and craft beers available.  Everyone was talking to each other.  My only disappointment is it took me six months to know about this place.

This Saturday farmers market has basically everything you're looking for. Are you young and hipster-y? Or old and adventurous? Or just a plain Jane/Joe that needs some spice in your Saturday morning life? Here's the solution.I'd personally recommend the goat cheese stand and the beef jerky vendor. Also the hometown brews, of course. This is a family-friendly affair, so bring your wife and kids and in-laws and second cousins. And your dog - he can make lots of new friends!

<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/2/2013,5/10/2014,3,15,,4,3>Mojitos Tropical Cafe is a unique little restaurant nestled in a small building on main street. I was told by a few friends to visit here for a great sandwich and some unique food options, so I thought I would give it a shot. I did not leave dissapointed.True to its name, Mojitos has a tropical feel to its decor and also have a few patio seats outside for those looking to enjoy main street while dining. The atmosphere both times we visited was nice, not too crowded, somewhat quiet, and the crowds seemed to be tame.After exploring the menu options we did come to find out that Mojitos really does offer some unique food options, like empandillas and tostones for appetizers which we ordered along with a cuban sandwich and a chicken burrito dinner. When the food arrived we were suprised to see the portion sizes were smaller than what most restaurants offer in the area for a much less price. However, we found the amount to be ideal for a meal and the food to be very enjoyable. Everything tasted homemade and fresh, which is something you seldom see out of a restaurant these days, and especially in this area. Overall, our visits to Mojitos will continue occasionaly, and especially the day that either of us crave a good sandwich. However, the prices are a bit steep (around $30 for two without drinks), and the drink menu looks appealing...but far to expesivein comparisson to surrounding restaurants.4 out of 5 stars.
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2014,5/9/2014,66,259,,6,2>I am thrilled that they have opened a location on Main St.  Their west Columbia location is nice too but far from where I live.  I am not vegan but find their food delicious.  I'd particularly recommend the kale salad, tacos and spring rolls.  Oh and the eggplant bacon wrap is yummy too!  They have a variety of fresh juices but those are a little pricy.  Overall a welcome addition to Main st for those who aren't afraid to expand their palates with some colorfully healthy entrees.

Started off with the cheese plate - nice small start to go with our wine.  The waitress was also very patient with letting us try a few wines before we bought a bottle. The SO got the wreck fish over a creamy rice and I got the duck confit duo. We cleaned our plates. Many of the dishes are using local ingredients which makes it even better for me. We took some of their house made jerky with us. The price was a little steep ($9 per bag) but the famously hot kind was delicious!
<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2014,5/7/2014,1,6,,4,3>If you like spicy thai food come here! The guy who owns the restaurant is kind of a dick but it seems he's not there too often (only 1/3 visits) the women that work there are amazing though. They are friendly, fast, and never stopped smiling... I ordered the beef larb and asked for it thai spicy. It was the perfect amount of spice, my mouth was on fire (in a good way of course ;) )  The ingredients were super fresh and the dish was topped with mint, basil, and scallions, soooo good! Looking forward to trying more menu items and I hope this restaurant stays longer than the last 2 at this location ;P
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/26/2013,5/6/2014,14,9,,6,4>Arabesque is probably my favorite restaurant in Columbia. Order the Damascus bread, Baba Ganoush, or anything else for that matter. I have never ordered anything which I did not thoroughly enjoy! They also make some of the best pizza to be found in town. The wait staff is quite helpful if you are unsure of what to order, and it is a pleasure to be treated so warmly in a restaurant. I am not sure where the commenter Katie D. ate, but I can assure you that I have eaten at Arabesque over a dozen times and never had a bad experience. Yes, there are times when they are busy, but a meal is to be enjoyed, not rushed through at all costs to hurry back to work. I also question why if she were in a such a hurry to get back to work after lunch, she chose to enjoy the narhile (hookah). If you want real Mediterranean food (not the typical cookie cutter/chain food), this is the restaurant you should try.
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2014,5/5/2014,204,446,,6,6>Love going here to see a Wes Anderson film or something that's not in theaters. The staff are wonderful people with smiles on their faces always talking about up coming events. Popcorn and a small soda is only five bucks, I noticed several Westbrook and River Rat beers on tap and wine available. The candy selection is also a win win too at half the price of what you would pay buying old stale stuff at the old run of the mill boring movie theatre. This is how all movie theaters should operate my friends. 5 stars all the way !!!
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/29/2014,5/4/2014,20,32,,3,2>Several months ago a friend gifted me with an empty bottle that could be filled at this lovely business. I've had bad luck with remembering the bottle when running out of the house or stopping by when they were closed so I finally got to redeem my gift today. This place is awesome! The service was excellent and I got to try any of the products I wanted to. In fact, I found several things I wanted and ended up buying a few extra bottles on top of the free one that I was redeeming from my gift. I ended up selecting mushroom and sage olive oil, lemon white balsamic vinegar, and lavender red balsamic vinegar. A visit here is such a fun experience because it is so much fun to try everything out.This made me love the gift I received even more because not only did I get a delicious oil but I got the fun of picking out my favorite. I even think this place would be fun to check out on a date.If you were in a grocery store, oils and vinegars in the 11-12 dollar range for 200 mL might make you balk a bit. But, in this environment and with this quality, they seem well worth it as a small indulgence.
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/30/2014,5/3/2014,22,73,,5,3>Have been here a couple of times and have really enjoyed the calzones.  Tuesdays are 2/$10 and other times the 60 or so calzones are $7. The side sauce is great and each time the bread has been cooked perfect.  Wings were good as well but a bit pricey at $8.
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/21/2013,4/26/2014,15,81,1,6,3>Awesome duck tacos and great atmosphere inside. Good prices and quality food/drinks. By the looks of the outside I always thought it was a dive bar--boy was I wrong. This place is a full up restuarant with a great atmosphere!  Not to be missed!
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2014,4/25/2014,1,28,4,7,5>This place is SO good!  You cannot beat the price, either.  While it's all good and very easy to hurt yourself with the massive portions, I'd recommend chowing down on the hot, fresh chips with queso and guac, then order the regular beef tacos, soft tortilla, with the fresh cilantro.   Just do it, you'll love it, you'll eat like 20 and have a happy tummy.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/23/2013,4/24/2014,50,45,4,7,4>Great little bar, definitely a locals place. It's conveniently located across the street from where I live so they get the prejudicial brownie points from me. Also, I've noticed it's more of a cool guys crowd that comes here. (e.g. guys smoking cigars, guys with pink pants, etc.) They have a pool table and all the obligatory bar arcade games.. Drinks are not watered down, but that could have been the bartender that night. Comfortable leather couches, outside seating... Parking in the rear.. What's not to like. I'm taking a star off for the lack luster decor ..and the mafia vibe entrance.. But that quite possibly could go both ways by adding to that aforementioned "cool guy" factor I spoke of...
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2013,4/23/2014,4,3,2,8,6>I had an A*MAZ*ING experience at this salon! The owner, Leslie, made me feel very welcomed and my stylist, Yolanda, was very knowledgable and experienced. I LOVE my hair (Senegalese twist) and I will definitely be returning and recommending this salon to others!
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/8/2014,4/22/2014,38,63,1,6,4>Quaint little library nestled in Forest Acres - they've got a nice selection of children's books (wouldn't say more or less than the other smaller branches of RCPLs), and a decent amount of computers for web browsing.I've never had to ask the staff for any help but it appears there's always someone available to assist with finding books or putting books on hold (you can also reserve, and request transfers between locations online at richlandlibrary.com & set up a date to have your selections waiting for you).Call me old fashioned but I'd prefer to wander the aisles and find things on my own.To sum it up, I think this location is convenient, usually not crowded, and always has what I'm searching for.I choose it over the smaller locations scattered throughout Columbia!
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/10/2014,4/21/2014,6,5,,4,3>Great little unassuming coffee shop right on Millwood. It wasn't crowded for a Saturday brunch, and both coffee & food were great. The sausage patties were almost burger sized, which is fine with me! The interior is bright and cheerful with plenty of tables, and a patio out back.
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/11/2014,4/20/2014,1,12,1,5,3>Really great local bar. not a lot of taps but they choose really nice beers to keep on tap. The prices are good and who doesn't like free pool? The real surprise for me was the food. The tacos are top notch and the Philly is nothing to sneeze at.  Want a snack with a beer? try the tots. Monday nights they have open comedy night, which seems to be slowly gaining a cult following. Overall, the bar is pretty clean, the employees are nice and the atmosphere is cozy. Did I mention they have several pin-ball machines? My only complaint, Not much of a back porch or outdoor area. I guess that pretty hard to pull off when you are on the second floor. RDT has become my new Monday night hangout.
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2014,4/19/2014,12,75,1,6,4>This establishment has only been open 3 months and today I heard my clients rave about it. I walked in and was greeted with the best smells! I ordered one sugar cookie and it was the best cookie I've ever had. I also ordered two blue berry mini muffins that were so fresh & yummy. I'll be back!
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2014,4/18/2014,11,8,,5,4>Delicious!  My husband got the Paris Crepe and u got the  Croque-monsieur.  His crepe was phenomenal, we would definitely get it again. The Croque-Monsieur was good too, but I think I prefer the crepes!  I originally thought it was a sit down type cafe, but it's an order as you come in and have a seat, which is totally fine.  The only thing is be prepared to wait they only have a couple of crepe irons so it does take time. We did get a crepe for dessert as well it was the Honey Moon!  Really good!  It had bananas and honey, yum!
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,4/15/2014,59,6,,3,2>This restaurant gets my Korean mother's seal of approval, and if you knew my mom, you'd know how important that is. Good kimchi, be bim bop, sun du boo, and gal bi.
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/13/2014,4/14/2014,2,43,1,5,4>I LOVE this place and keep coming back. They have the best burgers I've tasted in Columbia so far, amazing fries, a great bar, and great service! The atmosphere is great and welcoming, and makes you want to stay! Great place to watch a game. They have plenty of menu items to choose from,and all reasonably priced. You MUST give this place a try! You will fall in love.
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/28/2012,4/13/2014,0,7,,5,2>I love Blue Cactus. My favorite neighborhood hole in the wall. You want mild veggie stir-fry?  Fine.  Quesadillas?  Check!  Be Bim Bap?  Check!  Spicy Korean soups with seafood, beef, or tofu?  Check!  My son loves the fried mandu dumplings and the chop chae noodles.  It's the most interesting, original place in Five Points.  Great food, large portions, good variety, cheap prices!  Lloyd, Mary, and Julie are super hosts and fantastic cooks and servers.
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/23/2014,4/12/2014,9,5,,5,3>Cowboys restaurant is a great experience. We visited on a Sunday night. The salad bar was excellent & the Gauchos came around at regular intervals to continually offer great cuts of meat. Everyone was friendly, including the owner who stopped by our table to ask if we were enjoying our dinner.  Dessert was delicious!
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/14/2014,4/11/2014,8,3,,6,4>My wife and I went here for Valentines lunch. I had the eggplant rollatini with spinach ($11; a special dish that is similar to eggplant parmigiana) that was perfectly seasoned and lightly sauced with marinara the way I like it. Wife enjoyed her chicken piccata ($9). Our server was attentive and did a good job. Salad was tasty and balanced well with a house dressing. It had both green leaf and red leaf lettuce, no iceberg lettuce here!Portions are perfect for enjoying a salad, bread and entree. We normally like to grab dessert on a date but passed as we were full.Ambience is nice and perfect for a nice date but not so stuffy you can't take a bunch of friends out for a casual meal.Overall a great value.
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2013,4/10/2014,27,39,,12,6>Terra is a gem of a restaurant for the greater Columbia area.  I really have to compliment the entire staff from chef to host to manager to waiter who helped make our experience top notch.  My mom and sister came to visit from San Francisco, a foodie town if there ever was one.  I was so nervous about where to take them to dinner because I wanted them to be impressed about my new home.  I called Mike to make a reservation and explain that I was really trying to put Columbia's best foot forward.  He said he would think about what he could do to help in my endeavor.When we arrived at 9 pm on Friday, the place wasn't completely full but had enough people to give it a nice buzz.  Our hostess switched out light napkins for dark for the two in our party who were in dark attire, which my sister noted immediately was such great attention to detail.  We sat down and were greeted by our server who was just phenomenal.  I am kicking myself for not remembering your name!  He is originally from Charleston and his wife works at the Columbia airport.  But he was just great!  He gave us so many details about each dish, the history of Southern Cooking, great suggestions and alterations.  I especially applaud him for how he handled my questions about gluten free dishes.  He told me what dishes he could make gluten free, and then once he put in our orders he came back to tell me exactly how they were preparing mine to make it gluten free.  I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.We ordered the Shrimp Remoulade over Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer.  My sister ordered a glass of wine (I believe it was a Malbec from Mendoza) and I ordered a hard cider.  Our appetizer was delicious and my sister was enthralled by the Fried Green Tomatoes which she said she had tried for the first time at a restaurant in SF which executed them awfully, and she enjoyed this crispy version!While we were enjoying the appetizer, Mike, the manager, came by to introduce himself and extend his welcome to my guests from out of town.  Our waiter, brought us a whole slew of complimentary cocktail samplers from the bar, and the combination of the hospitality, surprise, and personal attention just completely  won my family over.  Thank you Mike and Terra for making my job so much easier!Our food was phenomenal as well.  We ordered two of the lamb with cous cous,  one flounder with rice (which they made gluten free for me), and one duck and cherry pizza.  All of them received rave reviews.  My sister claimed the lamb was so tender.  My mom extolled the port soaked cherries that peppered her pizza, and I enjoyed every part of my entree down to the perfect broccolini. We finished off with a few desserts, the highlight of which was the Bourbon ice cream!  Even though I don't love bourbon, I wish we had ordered several more scoops!Terra is focused on an organic, farm to table philosophy that Chef Mike executes elegantly.  The fact that so many items were made completely by hand, in house (including the Bourbon ice cream!) is beyond impressive.I don't just rave over any restaurant, and I had incredibly high standards for Terra--which they not only met, but exceeded.  If you have not tried Terra yet, you absolutely must!
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2012,4/9/2014,32,80,2,8,3>Holy crow this place was a find. Thank you Yelp! Started with the caprese salad: nice slabs of delicious tomatoes and mozzarella in a tasty balsamic. (One quibble: more basil.) I had the chopped salad, very good. Kid had the fettuccine which was extremely rich and good. Husband was tempted by the pork ribeye, but in the end craved the baked ziti. Tender pasta, awesome with meatballs. And terrific service despite a full restaurant when we left as well as my Clemson Tshirt in rival country.
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/4/2014,4/8/2014,9,10,,7,4>Love the Greek salad. The regular salad with chicken is great too.  There salad dressing is perfect,  especially there Greek dressing.  Greek salad dressing either makes or breaks the salad and there's is right on!  They deliver without charging a delivery fee too!  I think im trying the wings next time!
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2014,4/7/2014,1,5,,5,3>I have purchased flowers from this business for the last 10 years and love them.  They are very friendly, which makes a buying experience more pleasurable in my opinion.  The flowers are always beautiful and arranged to perfection.  I would certainly recommend this Florist shop to family and friends!
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2014,4/6/2014,0,2,1,8,5>Away from home on business I always struggle to find safe, secure, and aesthetically-pleasing parks to go running or walking. This one is great! There were several government-employed park rangers supervising the park- they were quite friendly and  helped me find where to go. There are also plenty of people here on a nice day so it feels safe and fun. I saw lots of people with dogs and bike riders, all enjoying the day and the park.  Walking by the water is calming and peaceful. I got a good 6 mile walk in and still didn't see all of the park!
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/4/2013,4/5/2014,19,11,2,8,5>Stumbled upon this hidden gem while visiting my chiropractor! Such a lucky find and I've been for lunch 2 days in a row! The ladies are super nice, the tea is perfect and the food is as excellent as anything you might find down in the vista or 5 points!I've had the Big Behr on both of my visits and have not been disappointed! All sandwiches come with a side (get the potato salad!) and tea or lemonade for about 8 bucks! If you're looking for a quick inexpensive lunch check this place out! They also have blue plate specials that change each day and they look and sound delicious! I can't wait to try everything on the menu!
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,4/3/2014,49,28,,5,4>Their ham and cheese makes me feel like I am home.  Their chicken salad is heaven, and everything is good.  Plus it's in the arcade, so sit and soak in the old charm.  It's a perfect midday refuge from the bustle of the offices downtown.  They are so friendly and helpful.  Try the Bob's special!
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/29/2013,4/2/2014,8,39,,4,3>Glad to see someone doing brewing high quality beers here in Columbia.  Their variety is outstanding for a small operation- often having eight of their beers ready.  Even their simpler styles like the brown ale have plenty of flavor and depth.  As others have mentioned, their tasting room is small.  It would be difficult to come with a large party.  Instead, pick up a few growlers and take the party home,
<review# 213,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/4/2013,4/1/2014,1,4,,8,3>This is my favorite restaurant in Columbia. Great service, ambiance and food. The fish has always been done perfectly and delic. The filet and lamb shank have been wonderful. The fried green tomato app is to die for. This is our go to restaurant.  Love it.
<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2014,3/31/2014,4,36,,4,3>Went to Cola's on 1/3 and was really impressed.  I'd hesitated going for some time due to the prices and some other reviews, but we decided to try it.  The atmosphere is very nice and the service was great.  Our whole experience was good, from making the reservation to the final meal. There were four of us and we ordered the Grilled swordfish wiith andouille grits, two small Maine lobster tails with risotto cake, trout, and scallops.Everyone was satisfied with their entrees.  I'd ordered the Grilled swordfish with grits.  I'm not a huge fan of grits unless they have andouille or tasso with them...these said andouille. So I asked for some tasso cream gravy and the waitress suggested I get it on the side so it didn't interfere with the dish the way they prepped it. She was totally right.  When it was served it had the andouille and a nice sauce around the plate.  I immediately knew I didn't neet the tasso cream gravy.  It seems like everyone else was dunking their meals into the tasso cream gravy (scallops,  bread,) and really enjoying it. Next time we said we'd try the shrimp and grits with the tasso cream gravy!  Can't wait to go back and try it.The only thing that was below average was the Lobster tails.  I guess we're used to Lobster with drawn butter.  These were served without any butter and my wife said they were too dry....should've asked for something on the side I guess.  They also were very small, but I guess this should be expected for 2 Lobster tails for $30.Wine selection was good, water was constantly refilled, waitress was knowledgeable and at one point the manager came by our table and asked if everything was okay.  She said she had heard a comment or something that made her think we were dissatisfied with our meal.  Not sure where she got that from but we were more than satisfied with everything.  But it's good to see that the management at least acknowledges concerns at tables.One of us ordered the cinnamon bread pudding for dessert.  I'm a big bread pudding fan but wasn't that impressed with this one.  Our neighbors did like it and had half of it boxed up to take home.Highly recommend Cola's and am looking forward to going back soon.  It won't be every other week due to the prices, but we have put it on our list of one of our favorites in Columbia.
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/22/2014,3/30/2014,9,15,1,8,4>Butter Chicken is the Best in Town.    This Indian scrumptiousness will make you want to become the adopted child of the family that own the restaurant, even if that means you will have to run the register part time. Despite the weird paranoia of all the cameras mounted to the ceiling and walls this family is very pleasant. If they are not real familiar with you they may "linger" around the buffet while you make your plate but I believe it is out of helpfulness in case a newbie comes in and does not know what the dishes are.    They do have a concern of the typical American that will over fill and waste a plate without respect, and the general rule is if you leave a plate of food uneaten you will have to pay extra. This ain't no Golden Corral folks! However with that said if you appreciate food and the ones that put their hearts into it than there will not be any food left on your plate. This family truly seems to want to share with you a little piece of their culture and home so that you can find peace in the butter chicken and joy in the samosas.     In case you didn't get the clue, the food is amazing! They bring you fresh hot naan to your table which is a special treat if you are having a buffet. Our usual plan of action is to get a bite or two of everything, taste and then try to decide what to fill up on. Our second trip to the buffet is to get a plate full of our favorites, our third trip is to get just a few more bites of the one thing we will be thinking about for the rest of the week, and then our fourth trip is for the mango semolina dessert. This beautifully orange colored stuff is a yummy finale to a fantastic dinner, buttery, sweet and fruitful you may want two bowls. My words of wisdom is open your mind and try it all you may find a surprise in the roasted cauliflower or a wow in the weird -what is that?- corn mixture. And be nice to the family and they may very well take you in.
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2012,3/29/2014,7,29,6,13,5>OMG, Edna's has THE burger.  I don't care what anyone says about 5 guys, or whatever.  The bacon burger is the end-all.  Of course, BLTs are also amazing. The cheeseburger is amazing.  It's all good, but they really have my favorite BLT (now that I think about it).  Get everything all the way. Edna's doesn't skimp on toppings, and tomato slices are lovely, all thick and juicy.  Get onion rings too.I'm going to chalk the great flavor up to a grill well seasoned over at least 40 years.  Everybody old-school Columbia will drop by Edna's.Yes, the area looks sketchy, but it's fine.  Yes, you will need to bring cash.

<review# 218,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,3/27/2014,2,9,,6,4>This pub that serves awesome food is on a regular rotation with my family.  Husband always gets the fish and chips, I really like the chicken and leek pasty, the evening entertainment is usually quite good, and the service is excellent.  We dont have many places where you can get an excellent beer menu (and even Windy Hill cider) and feel comfortable bringing kids.
<review# 219,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/1/2013,3/26/2014,8,50,,6,5>Arirang is amazing. We avoided coming for a while because we weren't sure if it would be kid friendly, but I am so glad that we've finally given it a shot. (There are plenty of high chairs, and they do offer forks and spoons instead of chop sticks for those wondering)Korean food makes my heart sing. My mom is Korean and the food here is just as good (maybe even better) as the food my mom makes. The banchan (little side dishes) are plentiful and delicious. The kimchi jigae is boiling hot and spiced just right. Bulgogi, spicy pork, chop chae, and dol sot bib bim bab have all been excellent. I'm allergic to shellfish and my husband doesn't like seafood so I can't vouch for the seafood dishes though. Prices may seem a bit high at first glance, but they are fair for the amount of food you get and the amount of work that goes into making each dish. My husband said the service was spotty the first time we went, but I didn't think so. If you're used to servers at chain restaurants making the table rounds, that doesn't happen here. The servers don't come around to check on you every few minutes, but I like it that way. It gives you a chance to eat, talk, and enjoy your meal. They do come once or twice to see if you need anything, but if you need a refill or anything else in the mean time, just make eye contact and they come right over.
<review# 220,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/23/2013,3/25/2014,41,11,,6,2>Appetizers and food were well made.

<review# 221,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,3/24/2014,4,3,,8,5>If you want to be treated like royalty, this is your place! My husband took me for Valentine's Day. It was all last minute since work plans changed, but totally worth it. Of course we did not have a reservation. We arrived at 5 pm, and were quoted a wait time of 2 hours (pretty normal for Valentine's day to be turned away completely without a reservation at other restaurants.) We were seated after only about 75 minutes. The wait staff was so very accommodating and welcoming. Never before had we experienced this kind of restaurant. The waiter was quite informative, and ran us through how everything works. We made our first visit to the "salad bar". Really, a better name for this would be the "appetizer bar". Yes, there is salad, but there are also soups, a cheese selection, pastas, sushi, FRUIT sushi, and lots of other choices. My husband raves about a broccoli salad, and I loved the fruit sushi! I have to be very careful with pre-made selections, as I am severely allergic to mushrooms. The Manager checked with the kitchen staff to ensure which selections were safe. We flipped our cards to green, and instantly were offered a vast selection of different meats. There are no words for the filet Mignon!  We only tried 4 or 5 of the meats before being too full to continue. Also, during our meal we were brought 3 sides to our table. Mashed potatoes, fried bananas, and another that I don't quite remember. At the end of the meal, spiced grilled pineapple came out. Oh my, that was pretty fantastic. I think the only thing that could make the pineapple better is for them to use the Maui gold pineapples. Our waiter came to take our after dinner drink orders, and the dessert cart was brought over. We shared a tiramisu. We left, completely over-induldged, stuffed, and raving. We were treated like royalty. The wait was completely reasonable. The staff was 100% customer service oriented. The food.....oh the food!!! For this price, we will absolutely return...with friends!!! (Sheesh, I hope that they don't raise the prices!!! ;)
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/13/2011,3/23/2014,3,18,,7,4>I'm a huge fan of Rosso. I've eaten there many times and have never been disappointed by the food. For antipasti, I highly recommend the risotto fritto. Although fantastic on its own, the fire-roasted tomato jam is a wonderful side. Next, the insalata di casa is a must! The greens are always crisp and fresh and the gorgonzola and glazed walnuts add wonderful texture. The citrus vinaigrette is amazing and (although I've tried), it just can't be duplicated. Amazing salad! For the main course, the chicken parmigiana is wonderful and is a perfect-sized portion. I've also had the rack of lamb and was pleasantly surprised not to see the mandatory mint jelly that everyone thinks makes the dish "classy". Instead, it was dijon grilled and tender enough to cut with a fork. Yum! If you are looking for a vegan option, the maltagliati is a good choice if you don't want the typical pasta and marinara dish. It was light and filling, but honestly, I would call it more of a soup rather than a pasta dish. Next, I've read some negative reviews on the desserts, but I've found them to be delicious and not bland as other reviewers have said. I think some people just aren't used to authentic Italian desserts as we here in the USA are used to our sweets having ridiculous amounts of sugar. The Italians know how to make their sweets without causing diabetic comas. Finally, the wine list is fantastic and the decor and ambience makes it a great place to enjoy a meal. It should also be noted that they partner with local farms and co-ops for their produce and use organic, free-range chicken so if supporting local farms and sustainable farming practices is important to you, then this is another incentive to try Rosso.
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2014,3/22/2014,24,74,,5,4>This place blew my mind. A honest, friendly, and frank auto mechanic is hard to friend, but AAA makes it a whole lot easier. We only went here to get a bum battery replaced, but they were able to fit us in on short notice, and turn it around in an hour. Several Year battery warranty, and free towing to the repair station were all perks. I used to wonder why I have a AAA membership (besides the hotel, and rental discounts), but no longer after this service.

<review# 225,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2014,3/14/2014,2,2,1,9,4>I absolutely loved this nail salon. Both my mani & pedi were done by a pleasant young woman who held great conversation. My nails were done with patience and professionalism. She did a great job in making sure I got exactly what I wanted. The environment was very clean and professional. Complimentary drinks, massage chairs, tv, etc. All employees that were working greeted me at some point during my visit, which made me feel very comfortable. I live in Gilbert and drove to Red Bank just to try this place out and I can assure you, it was worth it. I will definitely be coming back and will recommend Blush to anyone!
<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2014,3/13/2014,0,9,1,8,4>My fam of 4 tried this place out and loved it! It is a hidden gem in west columbia. The price was right, the owner is very nice. My favorite on the buffet was the fried chicken, Mac& cheese, and collard greens. I also lived the Pecan pie. We are going back next weekend!!
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2014,3/12/2014,2,7,1,5,4>Pretty well done... I had delivered the stromboli, veal parm with spaghetti, and a small anti pasta salad. The entire meal was well cooked, full of flavor and the small salad was a generous portion. The veal parm was an incredibly large portion and ooh soo cheesy. My only complaint is that they used sausage balls instead of the true shaved Italian sausage for the stromboli. Other than that... kudos.
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2014,3/11/2014,4,1,,5,4>Hands-down! Best Mexican food around! Prices on food AND drinks are low.. Tho it doesn't show in the quality of the food. We love coming here. The staff is wonderful, very friendly and personable. Would recommend to anyone! Bonus at the end of the meal they almost always bring out a free dessert! Ice cream and sweet Mexican chips with whipped cream! (My favorite part) :) yummy!
<review# 229,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2014,3/10/2014,50,119,1,7,3>I don't know why I haven't gone to this place sooner.  It's amazing!  I really didn't see anything I like on the menu, and the guy working said I could build my own.  So I did.  I ended up ordering the philly with bacon with provolone and cheddar cheese.  It was cooked fresh and all of the toppings were fresh.  The pita was delicious.  I will diffidently be back!  If you haven't gone here before, check it out!  You will not be dissappointed.
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2013,3/9/2014,209,314,3,14,9>True BBQ serves up the best bbq/smoked meats that I have ever tasted to date.No sauces for me please,the meat it tasty as is.On my most recent visit they were out of my favorite,white chicken so I ordered a pork chop with mac n cheese and baked beans.The pork chop was out of this world delicious,the mac n cheese is still the best and the beans were tasty.I ordered a rib plate for the little lady and as usual she thoroughly enjoyed everything.I do not recall ever having hash n rice before venturing into True and I must say it is very tasty...
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,11/13/2013,3/8/2014,102,139,3,7,6>I went to Frankie's last Saturday night. (Yes, I am 24, an adult, and this was an actual Saturday night.) Judge what you will, but the nostalgia I encountered was stellar. I'm competitive by nature and thus Frankie's is like my own little personal heaven... as long as you go with someone who foots the bill for you. (Did I write that out loud?) It can get a little expensive as all of the arcade games add up. Each go-kart ride costs about $7 and is over in just about 7 minutes or less. I was most impressed with the cleanliness of the facilities. Everything was super eye-catching and shiny, and the bathrooms were in good condition. I think it always helps when everyone in your vicinity is smiling and laughing. Just makes for a great time.I wasn't able to play laser tag this time but I certainly will the next time I'm there. Of course Frankie's is a perfect place for families, but I'd advocate for just a little Saturday date. Let your inner kid shine. (And even better if you win everything!)
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2013,3/7/2014,35,32,3,12,5>Love this market! It's not the kind of market that you go to for your weekly grocery haul necessarily, but for the fun and socializing, as well as the great breakfast, dessert, and other items from vendors.Vendors not to miss include the Cannonborough Beverage Co., Chill Out Pops, Rosso, Crepes et Croissants, B is for Butter, Eleazer Farms, Bell Honey, and more I'm sure to add here later! It runs year round and has an alternate rain location in the parking garage at Sumter & Taylor.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,3/6/2014,1,4,,6,3>I have been eating at Michelle Wang's restaurants since her simple Main St location opened in 1997. Though I don't eat much sushi, I've never had a dish that wasn't good to excellent. There are a half dozen locations in metro Columbia, including MIYO's.I've noticed several negative comments about the 'too-large' menu, probably referring to a now-gone 'book' of numerous pages, which I also found to be much too cumbersome. But this has been replaced by a concise front/back menu, refined like the selection of dishes, over the years. M Vista is definitely for the discerning palate. I consider this to be Columbia's finest Asian restaurant, with all other locations close behind. The Thai Basil dishes are my favorites, especially with shrimp. The Singapore Rice Noodles are to die for, just the right amount of curry.One can find this quality of food only in much larger cities, and I date Columbia's 'foodie' renaissance as BM or AM [before/after Miyo's] :)Did I say no MSG...ever.Also a great bar and staff.
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,3/5/2014,1,3,3,8,6>This place is AWESOME!  My kids' favorite place too. Great NY style pizza. Great salads and other entrees. Lasagna like Mama made. Sausage and mushroom calzone is to die for!  On Friday nights it is crowded, but worth the wait. Did I mention the desserts!  Crazy homemade chocolate bread pudding and an amazing fried Carmel pound cake! Simply stated an all around GREAT restaurant. P.S. Make sure you buy a loaf of freshly made bread too! Makes an amazing thick cut French toast for breakfast. I'm glad I bought some the first time. Now I don't leave without a loaf.
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,3/4/2014,2,9,1,7,4>Best chicken salad I've ever had! I had the Kickin' Kay Lynne, which if I'm not mistaken is ranch, jalapeno, cheddar cheese, buffalo sauce, and bacon, on a soft hoagie. I can't remember the name of the meal I got, but in addition to the sandwich, it came with a side (I chose grape salad-yum!), a pickle, and a cookie of the day (cooked PERFECTLY!) It was only about $8 and it was a nice sized portion. It was so good that I came back the same day for a togo tub of chicken salad! I recommend this place very highly, just keep in mind that they are usually pretty busy at lunch!
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2014,3/3/2014,67,157,2,8,4>I've been a southerner for about six months.  This is my favorite place in Columbia.  It's peaceful yet full of people.  There's something for everyone.  Like the water?  Rent a paddle boat or go fishing.  Hate the water?  Slide down the slide or go for a walk.  There's mountain biking trails, camping and a nice little trail that goes around the lake.  It's my favorite place to run and "get lost" in.  If I had any friends I'd probably organize a cook out and bbq here.  It's very pretty and serene and never feels unsafe.  It's a nice getaway from the area and a place to just enjoy the weather and nature.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,3/2/2014,1,2,1,7,3>I went for the first time yesterday and had a color consultation and hair cut. I was immediately impressed by my stylists hair instinct. She was able to see on first glance that I had had bad haircut and a fixed cut. My hair is not easy to manage as it is not just one texture and it is curly/wavy and very thick. She was able to blend all of the cuts together and make it look good without removing too much length. I am looking forward to my next appointment for coloring. Did I mention that she massaged my head during my shampoo??  It was glorious!  I am planning to return for all of my future hair needs!
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/18/2013,2/28/2014,29,85,,7,3>Really love Motor Supply. I have been going since 2011 and it almost never disappoints. Always fresh farm-to-table food with local farmed ingredients often from City Roots.I have never had a salad from Motor Supply that has disappointed and tonight was no exception. The crab claw meat salad with sweet chili vinaigrette was so tasty! My mouth waters thinking about it. I also had the beet salad tonight (my staple at any restaurant if it is offered). There were so many coarse salt grains on it that the saltiness completely dominated the dish. I actually have never ever sent food back, but fortunately our waitress very graciously offered to remake it. It was much more to my liking when the salad returned without all the salt grains. Fish such as the mahi mahi are also consistently well cooked and not dry. I have had their salmon in the past as well.  The pork porterhouse was really amazing. Served with creamy sweet potatoes, the bacon gravy had a subtle cheesy quality to it. Wow, what a combo! They really complemented each other. I have had their duck (either confit or thigh form) at least twice now and it is not my favorite in terms of preparation ...it is often medium well done on the drier side as opposed to medium. For duck, I highly recommend Momo's.Finally, my only "complaint" is that their desserts never really impress me. Items are usually "safe" like a flour less chocolate cake or creme brûlée is usually on the menu. I would love to see something more innovative from their pastry chef, like at Terra. For that, I'll be docking one star because my sweet tooth demands it. :)FYI There are limited parking spots in the lot but they also offer complimentary valet parking if you dine with them. No private dining areas but the covered patio is nice when the weather is good. Oh! And did I mention they infuse their vodkas?!
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2013,2/27/2014,204,446,4,7,6>Best place to get great German sausage's and deli meats I will not even try and pronounce. I love this place come here and get some real brats for your cookout. It has never disappointed me in flavors and trying something totally new. Don't be afraid to ask questions about what they have in the case. The owner will tell you how to cook and prepare these fine meats! Happy Octoberfest means great German beer and these fine meats!
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/12/2013,2/26/2014,44,54,3,9,7>Becoming one of my favorite gems in Columbia.  Finally got to make our way in for dinner with another couple. Server was attentive and offered great suggestions. Started off with a round of drinks - I got the American Harvest drink special - some sort of basil and vodka concoction and it was delish! Moved on to apps to share - baked Brie with peach chutney (app special), mussels, fried green tomato and crab cake Napoleon. Yum yum and YUM! One of the people with us doesn't even like mussels and said he is now a fan! The broth with the mussels is to die for! Moving on to entrees - I got the Huevos rellanos and the ensalada 116. Just stop what you are doing now and GO GET THE HEUVOS RELLANOS! Sounds weird - tuna and deviled eggs?! Just trust me and go get it!Food coming out was perhaps a tad slow but for a tapas style restaurant, I am fine with that.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/9/2014,2/25/2014,12,23,,5,3>Catch and Release is a consignment shop for outdoor gear, fishing, hunting, camping, boating, etc. Most of the gear is technically used, but as a shop it caters towards items that are "like new" and in really good condition. So it's definitely possible to luck out and get your hands on something really nice for much cheaper than new retail. For example, I got a practically brand new pair of Columbia hiking boots (over $100 new) for only $25.I really like the prices and the variety of merchandise (clothing, guns, boats, golf carts, etc.).  The customer service is great. The one aspect where they could use a little improvement is the quantity and selection of merchandise: because they are consignment shop they might only have limited sizes, models, brands at any given time. For example, I lucked out that they had a few options for my size boot, but that was just luck.Overall, check them out before spending a ton of money on a new piece of gear, gun, fishing rod, etc. They might just have what you're looking for at the right $.
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/15/2014,2/24/2014,13,6,1,9,4>Very happily surprised to find this gem in Lexington! Great cocktails, try the Avocadotini. Don't worry, you can't taste the avocado, but it gives it nice texture. We tried the jerk quesadilla, spices were very good. Ahi tuna tacos were very good, but the wonton "taco" shells were a little odd. The Cuban sandwich is VERY good. Great bread, yummy ham. The mofongo was yummy but I felt it needed either more or larger shrimp and some rice to help cut the richness of the sauce and plantains. Caipirinha(Brazilian cocktails) were excellent. The space is small,  little dark, odd layout. Not enough seating. But the staff was great. We will definitely be back.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,2/23/2014,13,10,2,8,6>This is my favorite place for a frozen treat in Columbia!  They have delicious ices, but my favorite is the frozen custard. I've been to Paradise Ice dozens of times.  I always order something different, and not once have I had something I didn't love. If you're in on a cold day, they have great coffee. The "Cup of Awesome" is as-advertised. There are a variety of hot chocolate flavors as well. I tried peanut butter hot chocolate this winter, and HOLY YUM. The service is unrivaled also--Paradise Ice is owned and operated by a super sweet couple. Have a dog? Pick up one of their homemade frozen dog treats! Our pup loves them!
<review# 244,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2014,2/22/2014,1,12,,5,4>Went in on Valentine's day and was completely blown away. The restaurant's owner/manager was at the front desk, explaining to another couple that he'd had 100s of reservations that night. I'd been turning to leave when he explained to all of us standing there that he'd try to seat us if we could wait a little bit. I figured why not - could go have a seat at the bar, have a drink and wait a while.I didn't get the chance to, as he seated us almost immediately. The man had hundreds of guests worth of guaranteed business, and had no reason at all to accommodate me, but he did. Bluefin values its customers. Service was prompt and friendly, and the food and drink recommendations were excellent.The seared black pepper tuna was fantastic. My steak was cooked perfectly, the bleu cheese topping was excellent and the garlic mustard butter I ordered with it went perfectly with the rest of it. Kudos to you, Bluefin. You didn't have to deliver, but you did. That's five stars to me, anyway.
<review# 245,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/19/2014,2/21/2014,112,197,1,7,5>I went here last night - #tableforone - to get some dinner and some good carbs after eating nothing but protein and greens all day.  I was happy to find out that they serve whole wheat pasta, which helps since in order to meet my current fitness goals I'm only really taking in complex carbs.I tried the caprese salad which was pretty good, but quite large for one.  I didn't quite finish it, and would recommend that anyone who goes for the caprese to split it between at least two people.  As an appetizer/salad, it really can even be split between four, but I digress.  A very good caprese, with great presentation.The entree was a whole wheat pasta carbonara that was very good.  Very flavorful, good-looking dish.This place must be a popular stop on Tuesdays (right?) because it got packed pretty quick.  Couple rowdy fellas were at the bar next to me having a grand old time.Staff was very attentive and friendly.  I'll definitely be back here for my italian fix in Columbia...also very glad it's walking distance from my place!Bonus: dishes are not terribly expensive and taste great...which was surprising.  I thought it would be either pricey or taste like something out of a frozen bag, but neither was true.  Good stuff.
