The entire staff is friendly and efficient. Not to mention that they're a local company, giving back to the community that they reside in! They've helped more than once with concerts for local youth that we've put on... Awesome people, awesome printers!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/16/2013,3/31/2014,0,1,,5,2>Hands down BEST SALAD in town! Turkey, provolone, sunflower seeds, Gorgonzola and the dressing is the perfect balance of olive oil & balsamic. We eat here with our 6 & 7 year old almost every Saturday night and the food & service is always great! Its hard to find consistency like that in a restaurant. **Get a slice of banana cake. Even if you don't like bananas you have to try it. Delicious!!

I've been waiting for a delicious, fresh, and heavy handed margarita serving Mexican restaurant in Springfield for a long time and this, folks, is it. Our food came out fast, our waiter was friendly, and the atmosphere was great. The bar is the type you can get rowdy at if that's what your heart desires. I saw a guy with a guitar so there might be some serenading going on somewhere. The margarita is kicking in so all I'll leave you with is that you should stop by.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/27/2013,3/29/2014,3,40,4,3,3>What a fun place! We could have spent all day in here. We ended up with several good finds and even got a chance to just "shoot the breeze" with the guys that work here.Funny story: I was standing with my back turned from everyone and was looking through some crates by the front door. All of a sudden, I felt someone or something touch my rear end. I turned around expecting to see my husband and saw a dog instead. He was very sweet and followed me around the whole time we were there!

Thank you for saving her cruise and making me look like a hero!!

No telling how long this place will be here because Springfield can be a hard place for a REALLY good restaurant to survive. This place is one of a kind, unique, and worth every penny. It's time for all of you foodies, picky-health-freaks, AND greasy-spooners to hit up Sommer and Mike. This place will blow your mind. Good music, good vibes, good food, and a good price. The fruit infused water will refresh you instantly. The fish tacos are on point. Falafel, fattys, breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack on guac and hummus. They are literally covering all their bases. Mexican, Thai, Greek, and American-- swirled into one if you would like!Do it! Go here! You may not have much opportunity for this kind of yumminess in Springfield anytime soon or at any other establishment I am sure!Did I mention there is beer? Craft beer. Mexican beer. And surely a beer of your fancy or to compliment your wrap or bowl!
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/10/2013,3/25/2014,9,50,,3,2>Hebrews is a full service coffee shop. They do breakfast, lunch and dinner menu. The coffee is from PT's Coffee Roasters in Kansas. They also serve MADCAP coffee which has become a new favorite. They have a house blend that they have waiting in a press pot for you. They will do hand crafted espresso drinks, chai, pour overs and chemex brews.  Speaking from a coffee snob perspective you will be satisfied. The barista's and staff are very knowledgeable of the food and coffee they serve.  The baked goods are fresh and will satisfy!  The standard mixed berry muffin is a must have. The food choices are diverse and will be to your liking. Service is always excellent and with a smile.The atmosphere is great for a large coffee house.  They have a diverse seating arrangement. They are continually improving their shop.You won't want to miss one of the best coffee shops in MO!

Then once you get into the tap room there is plenty of sitting room to your left and large window looking out unto the breweries intricate inner workings. Advancing to get into line to order your beer the menu on the right has all the beers they are showcasing at the time, they always have a wide variety of seasonals and the annuals. Their seasonals express intriguing blends of flavors that never disappoint. Don't know what type of beer you like? Ask anyone behind the bar they know it all, for your possible beer related questions.I can only say good things. Enjoy your experience at Mothers, I do.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/13/2013,3/23/2014,12,35,,5,2>Golden Korean is usually the place I go when I'm craving Korean food.  It's also where I introduced my husband to Korean food, and he likes it a lot.Usually we just get bulgogi and bibimbap because those are things he likes, but for those looking for more obscure Korean dishes, you can find many of those there, too.  I ordered the doenjang chigae once and really liked it, but that type of soup is a taste I acquired living in Korea and it's probably not something someone who is new to Korean food would like.  I also think their kimchi is really good.Tip: Korean tradition is that everyone shares everything on the table.  This is really the best way to make sure everyone gets to try several different things and nobody goes home hungry.

He is thorough and straight-forward, which I appreciate, but he is kind and understanding. He does a great job making sure you are comfortable even with long dental procedures. Plus, his dental assistant, Judy, is the best there is. She is helpful and comforting. I couldn't recommend this team more highly.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2012,5/9/2014,5,18,,3,1>This is the only place I like to go in town for hibachi style food. They have a nice selection of sushi also.  I have been here many times and everything I have eaten here was great. They have a spicy fish sauce that I just can not get enough of. I even asked if you can purchase it to take home. YOU CAN! Although in my classic style I forgot to get some the last time I was in. Try this place you wont be disappointed.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/15/2014,5/8/2014,56,52,1,3,2>The whole Thai Basil Fish is my go to dish every time! You might need to ask Tong, himself, to make it for you as a special request.

They are in my opinion by far the best place for all your fresh herbs, local and organic produce, coffees, teas, home remedies and anything else healthy related. Staff is super friendly and helpful. I am now trying out Chia seeds and you can buy them here in bulk and save some moola.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2014,5/2/2014,50,220,4,9,3>Been here twice in a week period (hey, I love Vietnamese food, what can I say), and I must say, it's pretty darn good. So far, my eating companions and I have had the following: - spring rolls (had with both visits due to having two different lunch buddies, both who wanted spring rolls). Ultimately, they're good but not great compared to other ones I've had (even within town, I must say); and for me, the peanut sauce consistency was a bit too chunky and the amount provided was a bit too scarce. - banh mi with bbq pork (I think it's the #2): HUGE. This very well may be the largest banh mi I've seen before. My dear lord, that's one big banh mi. And per my lunch companion: "Oh my god. For $4 I get this much GOOD FOOD." So, there ya go.- B1 (bbq pork and eggroll bun). Here, they give you the option of small vs large dishes for a $2 price difference. I really like this b/c I am never able to finish a bun dish but always want a giant bowl of pho so I can slurp up all the broth. The bun dish overall was good. The pork was delicious. The eggroll was decent. The fish sauce (nuoc mam) with it was good, not too salty and bitter like some I've had around these here parts. I would get again, and I probably would stick with the small. On a weird note, I thought the noodles with it were almost too thin, but I'm weird about noodles, so yeah, moving on...- P3 (pho with rare beef and well done brisket): this is the best pho broth that I've had in town. Really. It's so flavorful--perhaps a bit salty, but I'll take that over bland any day--upon first taste that I wanted to drink the rest of it down before dousing it with all my condiments. I like my pho with chili garlic sauce instead of sriracha; they have some  in the back if you ask super super nicely (or just nicely, I'm sure). One complaint: the lovely bowl they serve the pho in is a bit shallow, so it makes it difficult to mix all your goodies together.- R4 (lemongrass chicken). This was probably the most disappointing dish so far, although it was still good and worth trying. The chicken was a bit dry, and instead of serving a saucer of fish sauce to mix in with the dish like I've seen before, it tasted like it was mixed with the meat and veggies right after they had finished cooking.So, yeah, I'm thrilled another Vietnamese place is open in town, and I'm even more thrilled that it doesn't suck (in fact, it's quite good, and everyone else who happened to be in there today when we were had the same great things to say). Ultimately, I hope this place does well, and I hope to hear more people really enjoy it (including that table who I could've sworn I heard say, "I can't wait to give this place a Yelp review"). Yelp away, fellow Yelpers. Yelp away.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/3/2013,5/1/2014,6,22,,3,2>Yummy!! I've heard and read good things about this place, and there true! I finally ate here for lunch (I work two doors down at Family Back & Neck Care Centre) and I will definitly be going back to Sushi Village more often. They give you a piece of a sushi while you wait and look at the menu (thank you! so delicious!) The waiter was very patient and helpful knowing I had not been in before. The portion was very generous for the price paid. Such a wide variety and so much to try. If you enjoy some good sushi in a cozy atmosphere you definitly need to check this place out!
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/3/2013,4/30/2014,11,18,1,4,2>Very good vegetarian options!  I'm a spicy food fan, and ordering my food 5 star here has never disappointed me.  I've had several of their curry dishes, as well as noodle dishes like Pad Thai.  All of which are clearly marked with meat-free options.Sure, you will not be instantly transported to Thailand when you walk in the door, but as far as ethnic cuisine in Springfield goes, this place is pretty solid. Staff has always been friendly, helpful, and fast.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/21/2014,4/29/2014,37,70,1,10,6>I am not normally someone who goes to the gym.  I hate the smell, the sounds, the atmosphere. But this isnt what I think of when I think of a gym. EVERYTHING is a happy purple.  They don't allow 'Lunks". AND THEY HAVE HYDROMASSAGE! The basic layout is a huge area of treadmills each with its own tv and other cardio equipment like elliptical machines who are laid out under a huge bank of 60 in tvs.  The weight area is not set up for body builders as they prefer to focus on fitness - so the heaviest weights are just 75lbs.  They also have the hydro massage tables, massage chairs, and total body enhancement booth, and tanning beds.  For someone who doesn't like gyms - well lets just say I dont like gyms other than Planet fitness. Awesome job guys - I might be hooked.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2014,11/30/2014,6,18,3,4,4>It is good food at a pub. They have good Half prices apps from 4-6pm. The fish and chips is great my wife says best fish in this part of Missouri. The rest of the food is good and a very nice beer selection. They have a pool table and lots of high top tables. Te bread pudding dessert is well worth it. The only reason for 4 stars is service is hit and miss. Some excellent servers some very ghostly. A place we visit once in a while with great fish. Try it one night for a good bite, not a kids spot.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/11/2014,11/29/2014,0,7,3,3,3>Took my mom here for Mother's Day. It was our first time here today and I can honestly say we will be going back! It was a bit confusing on how to get into the place if you've never been considering you go through Ophelia's to get into Gailey's. But for it being around 8:30 on a Sunday on a holiday we only waited 20 minutes for our food. We sat at the bar and watched all of the delicious food come out. All in all if you've never been GO!
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/12/2014,11/28/2014,1,6,3,3,4>There's more Chinese food places in Springfield than anywhere else in the world (probably). Yan's is a little unassuming place nestled in the business of MSU. You can get the standard fair: cashew chicken, broccoli beef or crab rangoons, however, there's these little white menus with a bunch of Chinese on them and some English mixed in. If you're in the mood for something magical, pick up that little menu and pick something that sounds good. You won't be disappointed!!
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2014,11/27/2014,7,18,4,4,4>Somewhat standard sports bar selections, but top-notch for what it is. The kitchen isn't the quickest, but you get steady, friendly service while you wait. The mostly fried apps are big and delicious. And the sauces... their honey mustard is my personal fav (smooth and sweet), and the ancho ranch and BBQ ranch are awesome too. Oh, and btw: mini corn dogs. They make a killer BBQ chicken sandwich. I get it with the BBQ sauce on the side and take turns with the other sauces--especially BBQ ranch. I'm also a fan of the big ass crispy chicken salad.I've ordered the ribeye three times. It's been a little inconsistent, ranging from seriously incredible to kind of meh. They definitely let the meat speak for itself--very little seasoning. It's a friendly and popular spot. Lots of people and energy on game nights. I'm not a big sports guy, but I live directly across the street, and trust me, people have a blast over there.
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2014,11/26/2014,4,4,5,4,4>With the multitude of Chinese restaurants in Springfield, it is hard to stand out. Bao Bao accomplishes this with a different take on their cashew chicken, and an additional traditional Chinese menu that offers menu items not found anywhere else. I love their cashew chicken, and other menu items are great as well. If you have a chance to try it, do.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/16/2014,11/25/2014,2,21,3,3,4>On my husband and I's first date several years ago, we frequented the Nonna's Italian Cafe establishment in downtown Springfield. Nonna's has been a quaint, charming, restaurant with some of the best Italian food in the Midwest.This review, however, will be about the Nonna's South location (just off of National). It recently opened up a couple of years ago to reach out to the "south-siders" and their business. Every time we have come to this establishment, the service has always been excellent. On weekdays, the business is a bit slower, but the food is not lacking in flavor. We recently came here with a group of 10 for dinner on a Thursday. ...and everything went smoothly! Happy Hour here is not to be missed! Half-price appetizers. Discounted drinks. We ordered calamari and ravolis for the table under this Happy Hour special.I enjoyed the fact that the calamari is fresh and gives choices of the rings or the tentacle bunches. Although, the bunches can be a bit tougher. The remoulade was flavorful with a touch of horseradish. For an entree, I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and a side house salad. The sauce is rich and creamy on the pasta-- so filing that I always take half of the order home. The salad is light with parmesan cheese, house dressing, cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. My husband either orders the Eggplant Parmesan or the Chicken Parmesan, both are fantastic and served with a side of fettuccine alfredo. The marinara is rich and chunky (great for dipping and reheats well for leftovers). My only complaint is that recently with the bread this location of Nonna's has gone to a garlic compost butter instead of the minced garlic, parmesan, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar mixture. You have to ask for the ingredients to make the dipping mixture, which our waiters have always obliged too. Sometimes, a bit hestitantly though. Overall, Nonna's southside location is a great addition to the downtown establishment. Southside can be typically quieter and a more suburban feel compared to the busy, loud, and vibrant downtown location. The service across the board is great!
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2014,11/24/2014,38,244,2,2,3>My favorite place in town for coffee!  I love love love getting a Mudpuddle.  I drink it so fast and then I want more.  :)   The atmosphere is so relaxing, I just really enjoy coming here!
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/21/2014,11/23/2014,2,18,3,4,4>First time in. We had great service. The ribs are good.  Ho mah gosh... I do not like new places for BBQ because I don't want a dud. This place has it going on with the ribs. Thick, tender, St. Louis style with good sauce on the table. Not a fan of the hot but the regular sauce was good. I was impressed with the ribs. We got two sides - okra and beans. The beans were a bit soupy for me but still good with little chunks of meat and BBQ spice. We ordered a two meat platter but never again. We will get the 1/4 or 1/2 slab in the future. Good joint.
<review# 29,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/7/2014,11/22/2014,3,60,2,2,2>Have been here twice now and each time was very good.  Food is cooked to order and flavorful.  The decor is modern and clean.  The service very friendly. One thing to know is that some dishes are a bit hands on to eat.  The short ribs are still on the bone and the shrimp have the tails still on.  I really don't mind this because it adds a ton of flavor.  Some might be turned off though.  Love love the green beans as a side.  Not sure what they put on them but I have to say its one of my favorite preparations of them.  Give this place a try.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2014,11/21/2014,0,15,3,4,4>Ah Tasia. When you want the best bowl of Hot and Sour soup in the Springfield area, it's Tasia. The broth is a smooth clear flavorful bowl of stock, with veggies that bring a subtle exchange of taste for the touch of heat at the end. The Chinese is clean, crisp, and delicious. Not one bad item on the menu. Their heat is a little on the weak side, just ask for extra extra spicy if you like it warm. The atmosphere is welcoming and there isn't a bad seat in the house.  But seriously, when I'm sick, Tasia Hot and Sour soup, when I'm cold, Tasia's Hot and Sour soup. Or if I'm just plain hungry... You understand. You will not be disappointed.
<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2010,4/14/2014,24,69,4,3,2>Yeah, my first 4 star rating EVER. This is a solid place. Yeah, you're eating on paper plates and wiping your mouth with paper towels, but since when is BBQ fancy? Everything about this place stands out as BBQ. Hell, the toothless cook really put things in motion for me: if she can eat it, then it must be good.Price is skewed. It is too expensive. In actuality, the price is only what it supposed to be because it is a mom-and-pop shop.Ketchup-based sauce. Spicy.I'm at a loss for words right now. I'm actually drooling.The only reason this gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because I'm not an idiot. BBQ can never earn a perfect 5 because that would mean that BBQ can be narrowed down to a science rather than a fine art. With that said, the cooks at Crosstown are artists!Why are you still reading this. Get your meat on! GO EAT!
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2013,4/10/2014,5,15,,11,4>My husband and I moved to Springfield from Austin last year, and one of the things we've really missed about Austin is the variety and diversity of restaurants. Neither of us had tried Peruvian food before moving to Austin, but after a couple of Peruvian food trucks opened there, we were both hooked. When Nick found there was a Peruvian bistro in Springfield, we knew we had to try it, so we made it our Valentine's Day date spot.Before I get into this, a word on Peruvian food... Peruvian food is influenced by the cuisine of Peru's indigenous peoples, but also heavily by the large populations of immigrants from Spain, China, Italy, West Africa, and Japan. Immigrants from these countries attempted to recreate their traditional dishes with Peruvian ingredients, and over the years these culinary traditions have blended and become a distinct national cuisine. Corn, potatoes, and chilies (especially the aji amarillo) are staples, along with quinoa and ingredients brought to Peru by immigrants: rice, wheat, beef, pork, and chicken.Basically, Peruvian food is like nothing we'd ever had before in the most delicious way possible. Paternoster's got it right. The Bistro is set up behind Cravin' Pizza; you walk into Cravin' Pizza, take a hard left, and follow the blue neon glow of the "BISTRO" sign. The atmosphere is totally different... exposed wood beam ceilings, murals of the Peruvian country side, low lighting, table cloths, and a long bar, making it more formal than the front room but not fussy or stuffy. We started out with their ceviche "simply" - meaning only whitefish, no mussels, clams, etc. It was absolutely delicious, very fresh and fragrant, slightly spicy, and very refreshing. I had a pisco sour along with it (pisco, a brandy, lime juice, sugar, and an egg white shaken til very frothy) and it was very, very good - a great pairing with the ceviche. I'd definitely recommend ordering an appetizer. The menu and staff make it clear that everything's cooked absolutely fresh when ordered and so entrees take a half hour to come out. We didn't try any of the empanadas but the table next to ours did, and they smelled and looked heavenly - definitely something for us to try on our next visit.For our entrees, I had the Camerones a la Plancha en salsa de Vino Blanco - shrimps grilled on a metal plate with a white wine salsa. It was served with a slice of sweet potato, a fluffy potato pancake, a large fresh salad, a half of a mango, and grilled asparagus wrapped in a hearty slice of crisp bacon. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the white wine sauce was like nothing I'd ever had before. It was citrusy and light, very nice with the shrimp, but there were also hints of curry spice - absolutely delicious! All the accompaniments were great. The salad was very fresh and lightly dressed, with greens, cucumbers, and avocado, and the potato pancake and sweet potato were great for mopping up the last traces of sauce. I particularly appreciated the inclusion of the bacon with the grilled asparagus, a dish that can be boring and bland, but the asparagus was grilled just right and seasoned excellently.The name of my husband's dish escapes me and it doesn't seem to be on the menu posted online: it was a filet of fish lightly fried on top of rice, black beans, and with a citrus/garlic/butter glazed ear of corn, as well as the same salad and asparagus I had. The fish was delicious - it was listed on the menu as comfort food, and definitely was - and was seasoned with a blackening spice. I know this sounds weird, but his rice was seriously the best rice I've ever had! It wasn't at all sticky, had just a lovely texture, and was very fragrant.I think the best part of our dinner was when the owner, Jim, came out to visit with us and see how our meal was. He was excited that we were fans of Peruvian food and delighted to hear how much we had enjoyed ourselves. We talked about he and his wife's travels to Peru and around the world, his time in the Navy, and he shared a taste of his favorite Spanish roja wine with us. Jim told us about his chef, a woman he had met in Peru whom he sponsored so that she and her daughter could come live in America and work with him. Just a lovely, lovely man. We're so looking forward to talking more with him on our next visit!All in all, I don't think I can recommend Paternoster's highly enough. I can't wait til our next visit... I think I'll try the empanadas, and I'd like to see Jim's take on Lomo Saltado, a traditional Peruvian stir fry dish. We need more places like this in Springfield!
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2013,4/9/2014,13,68,,7,3>A buddy and I decided to stop in to watch some of the NCAA basketball tournament, and I'm glad we did!  Like any good Sports Bar should, they have large TV's and plenty of them!  We were able to snag a hightop table which allowed us to see all three games that were on.  Most excellent.Harbell's has a decent selection of draft beer, and they were running pitcher specials on typical 'Big 3' domestics.  We opted for a pint of tasty beer instead.  I went with Mother's Seasonal, and he had Three Blind Mice.We ordered the Fried Pickles and Cheese fries for appetizers.  The pickles are thick cut slices and are really tasty.  The fries there are fantastic.  They are crispy on the outside, but still tender on the inside.  Cover those bad boys with cheese, and you've made a good thing even better.  We planned on enjoying them over a couple of beers, but they were gone in near minutes.  I also ended up having the Spicy Burger for dinner.  It was delicious!  The burger is cooked to order and comes with Spicy Bottle Caps (battered and fried jalapeño slices).  I hated that I could not finish it, but I was already loaded with pickles...and fries...and beer.  If I graded the service, I would give it a B.  Our server's personality started things off on the wrong in a negative way, but she was attentive and quick to deliver, so I can't really complain.  When it comes to bar food, this place delivers some of the best stuff in town.  I am a fan!

Prior to living in SGF I was not big into coffee but a friend invited me along to go to The Ethic with him. One of the BEST decisions of my life!The mocha is excellent but my fave is the regular house coffee. It's cheap yet exquisite. The Coffee Ethic is my first stop whenever I visit Springfield. I am addicted.

Last year my lawn area was at least 50% bare patches. I thought I would have to completely dig up the old growth and plant a new lawn. The TruGreen representative assured me that they could get the existing lawn area healthy and over-seed in the Fall. I was doubtful, but signed on the dotted line anyway (what did I have to lose?). Well, like I said, I now have the greenest lawn in the neighborhood. I couldn't be happier with TruGreen service. TruGreen should use before and after pictures of my yard in their advertisements.
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2014,4/6/2014,11,22,,5,3>The Italian Beef Sandwiches are wonderful. Everything is fresh and scratch made. Nice people own it and are very pleasant. This is is the type of place that makes me so happy to dine local here in Springfield. They have recently added burgers to the menu. What can I tell you it is a very good burger. Quality ingredients well prepared and at a good price. Check them out!
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,4/5/2014,2,8,,3,2>This place is a gem in an otherwise dull world. I moved away from Springfield about a year ago. This is the place I miss most. If ever there was a time that you wanted a spicier version of general chicken this would be the place to get it. And, I say spicier as compared to sweeter versions of general chicken that you find at most other places. Anyway, the couple that typically runs this place are very nice. They get to know you of you come in enough. :) you can even call ahead on orders. I recommend the crab Rangoon, and the spicy general chicken. Also, this place is typically open until midnight and perfect for that late night craving.
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/1/2012,4/4/2014,44,9,,5,3>I've been to the Dancing Mule a number of times and have never been disappointed. Randy and the team know coffee. They serve PT's coffee and sometimes sell coffee from other pastries as well. Espresso, regular brew and pour-overs (my favorite) are available. They also have sandwiches, pastries, etc. for sale...and various coffee-related items (chemex, clever, etc.). It's in a part of town with no other good shops and I like that. They also have a drive-through. One of the best things about Dancing Mule...they're Johnny Cash fans, and I like that a lot.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/7/2012,4/3/2014,5,41,,10,5>A guy from Traeger Wood Pellet Grills was demoing griils out front, and the Bratwurst Hut (they own that, too) in the parking lot seemed to be going full tilt, so I thought I'd stop by this newly opened store. Figured I'd stop in, be let down by the selection and prices, and leave. Boy was I wrong!They have all kinds of 'old fashioned' items from Dandelion Preserves to the old time candy, and, of course meats. A deli area, and fresh cuts of meat like any other butcher shop - all at prices that meet or beat the nearby chain stores, which was quite a surprise. I'd even go as far as saying the deli selections are much less than Wal-Mart! And, they are all premium quality products. They were sampling the Andouille Sausage, Italian Sausage, and Breakfast Sausage. I was prepared to laugh and tell them how the Andouille should be spicy, the Italian well balanced, etc., as I have done countless other times at other places around here. I was amazed! While I must give some credit to the cook and his Traeger grill, the simple fact is these are very high quality meats perfectly seasoned. The stuff of countless hours of trying a recipe, failing, and trying again - somebody put in real effort to get them like this. I am very picky about these items - and I dislike breakfast sausage - however I found nothing to complain about here, even the breakfast sausage. If I hadn't been converting from a gas stove to electric (and thusfar too lazy to run the 220 line!) I would have bought some Italian Sausage on the spot. They also had some pre cooked BBQ selection that looked very good, although I did not try those - they were also priced reasonable. They also had some heirloom garlic, always a plus!They did mention they just opened, and will be adding more items which I look very forward to!Can't  say enough how impressed I was... will be back, often, I am sure.
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/31/2013,4/2/2014,38,244,,4,2>I have not had a chance to walk through the trails, but from what I saw of them, they are very well shaded, which is a plus in the hot Missouri summer!  The indoors area has plenty to keep kids, young and old entertained for a good hour to hour and a half.  There are puzzles, puppets, a laser shooting game, microscope, and a dark room where you can learn about night animals.  I will definitely be back to check it out some more!
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2014,2/23/2014,24,18,2,6,4>NO MSG!!! If you have a delicate digestive system that Asian food often tears up, come here. Huge portions for a great price. I love the broccoli chicken, hot and sour soup, and spicy crab roll. They do not cinch in the filling on the crab rangoon. Their sushi is excellent. Try the Bolivar Roll is you're adventurous...it's giant.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/10/2014,2/22/2014,91,41,3,4,3>Yes, Ali's looks like a truck stop. It has pay-by-night big truck parking in the back, so it actually might BE a truck stop. I don't know.  Either way, I love this place.  It's run down and a little tired looking, but give it a shot. They are open 24 hours a day, have a drive-through (which I have never used...seems weird to me), and will also deliver. They have a ridiculously large menu, and they serve everything all day long.  If you want breakfast at 9pm, you can. If you want catfish at 7:30am, you can. High five to all the options!  Plus, the portions are HUGE and the prices are beyond reasonable.  Every time I've been in Ali's, they have half the building roped off.  I remember back in the day, it used to be half smoking, half non-smoking. Who knows why the rope is up...I just go wherever everyone else is sitting and find a table.I have been ordering the cinnamon bread French toast meal lately-it's made with bread from a local bakery whose name slips my memory at the moment. You get four pieces of French toast, and it's soft and fresh even when you order it for dinner. Trust me, I know. I am a breakfast master.  You also get two eggs, and bacon or sausage.  It's quite the meal for $6.  Ali's definitely knows how to do breakfast dishes...I just wish they served sausage gravy with their biscuits and gravy instead of plain white gravy.Their clientele definitely includes some characters--it makes for a fun people watching experience along with a good meal.  Yes, there are lots of hand-written signs taped to the doors and windows, and there are a  couple dry erase boards propped up with the daily specials written on them.  They probably refill the ketchup bottles with generic ketchup and water down the hot sauce.  I don't really care. The food is good and I've never been disappointed.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2013,2/21/2014,50,220,7,8,4>Sad, pathetic story to illustrate my true life of gluttony (note: this was for a group of people, so it was a cackle of gluttons, thank you).Me (having had a delicious pepperoni pizza and pepperoni rolls from The Big Slice previously): "Hi, I'd like to place an order. I need an 18 inch bacon and onion pizza and 3 orders of pepperoni rolls."The Big Slice: "I'm so sorry, but we're almost out of pepperoni, so we can't do the rolls."The Boyfriend: "Why don't we order some pepperoni rolls from pizza hut and the pizza from Big Slice."And then I acquiesced to this disgusting yet brilliant decision.Long story short: the pizza rolls ordered were $1 less than the pizza ordered, and the pizza was waaaaay better. Although I was totally upset that The Big Slice didn't have enough pepperoni to satiate my crew with pepperoni rolls, the Big Slice still delivered totally delicious pizza. For the first time since I moved here from Chicago, I thought to myself, "Finally, enjoyable pizza." Thank you, Big Slice to filling a giant "I need good pizza" hole. Really, thank you. Also, please continue to be patronized and please don't close b/c I may just cry. The end.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/6/2014,10/11/2014,77,42,6,6,5>My kind of vibe, my kind of bar. My husband and I discovered this bar about a year ago but didn't come much because we were living downtown. Well that has changed, and we can walk to it. We enjoy everything about his bar. You can come in dress clothes or wear your leggings and a hat and no one judges you. The drinks are cheap and the atmosphere is very divey. They have drink specials throughout the week, like 2 dollar bloody marys.They also have GREAT pitcher prices. You can get a pitcher of beer for $6.50 and listen to people sing all night. We enjoy stopping by and grabbing some beers on occasion or come in  on Sundays and play the touch tunes music with friends. They also have a great outside area to drink or just enjoy the weather. If you're into playing pool and watching a sports game as well this is your dive bar. Thanks Stepchild for making a place where we can come in and relax!
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2014,10/10/2014,2,10,3,3,3>This is a wonderful Springfield gem that took me a few years to discover. I have tried much of the menu an have not had anything that I would not order again. I recommend the rigatoni a la Tony, which is probably the best pasta I have ever had.The venue is very classy, you would never guess it is located in the strip mall from the inside. There is a party room that is available for events that seats about 15 or so comfortably.I highly recommend Avanzare for special events or a nice night out.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2014,10/9/2014,37,70,5,6,5>We went to Jin's for my birthday lunch... While the building looks a little run down - HOLY BEJEEBUS THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC! When I expressed my concern over possible animal products in the food - the server went out of his way to make sure that we knew the sides he brought us were animal free. even the kim chi is vegan!  I had the vegetarian bento box, and while the tempura veggies were excellent - I sorta wish there was less fried food and maybe some more of the delicious kim chi like turnips. will i be back?  as soon as possible!
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,10/6/2014,79,209,5,6,5>You guys, this place makes me kinda love Springfield. I was in town for an interview and after spending most of my free time driving to and from Kansas City to see a friend, I was only left with half of a day to get a feel for Springfield. I was hoping to hit up Mother's Brewery as beer tasting is definitely on my short list of favorite activities, but then I realized I also really wanted something to eat before heading to the airport and being subjected to terrible airport food. I was super excited when I discovered that this place has beer from Mother's AND HH starting at 2pm - I could try the local brewery and eat! Hooray!I came in a few minutes after 2 and there was only one other person at the bar. I had a seat, asked for a beer suggestion and settled in to look over the menu and drink my beer. The bartender was just-right friendly. I'm the nerd who sits at the bar with a book, so I obviously just wanted to drink my beer, eat my food and chill out and she was in no way bothersome, but when I asked her questions about the area and things to do she was super helpful and friendly - just what I expect from an awesome mid-west bar. I ended up ordering two appetizers (for variety!) and getting 3 beers (all from breweries I'd never heard of - this delights me!) and all said it was $17. Dude. SO CHEAP.Someone else said in their review that this bar would fit right in the PNW (Seattle/Portland) and I completely agree - so does the hipster, flannel wearing moose on the cover of their menu - but it is better than the PNW because you gte no weird passive aggressive attitudes, it's the  friendly mid-west!
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/12/2014,10/5/2014,0,7,3,2,2>Without a doubt, one of my favorite restaurants in town, period! I generally go on Tuesdays as its my day off, which also happens to be Taco Tuesday!  $1 tacos. The carnitas are my absolute fav! Staff has always been friendly every time I've been, and they have Negra Modelo ON DRAFT! see you Tuesday!
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/3/2014,5/14/2014,3,10,,2,3>This is a wonderful little shop! The people here are all incredibly friendly and the food is delicious. I am especially fond of the Garden of Eden schmear on the jalepeno cheddar bagel. Their rueben is to die for as well, and they have excellent pour-over coffees available. My SO loves the egg and cheese bagel sandwich, and we always have to get one of their chocolate chip cookies (they are huge!). Everything we've had from here has been top quality, and I cannot recommend them enough!Also, if you happen to be in when they have their small donuts available, DO NOT PASS THEM UP.Lots of Legacy love!
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/1/2013,5/13/2014,7,9,1,6,2>I love Finnegan's Wake. Great staff, great times, and great beer. Looking for a great place to start your night before hitting downtown, start here. It is also a great place just to be there all night. With Darts, Pool, and more games to help entertain you. Also they have the best seasoned fries in town. Go get lunch there, great food!
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/7/2013,5/12/2014,3,8,3,5,1>My boyfriend and I came here for date night because I knew how much he had loved coconut chicken (thank you David H.) from a different Chinese restaurant we'd gone to. So glad that we chose this place! The food... ERMAGHERD! It was so delish! He had the coconut chicken which I had got to try a bite of, and it was yummy. Creamy, tender white meat with a nice glaze to it. I took Matthew B.'s advice and had the honey chicken, which was just as yummy (if not yummier). Not too sweet, either. The fried rice was good, and the crab rangoons were off the chart yummy! I even ate the crispy bits, which I usually leave on the side of the plate anywhere else. The place was clean, and the staff were friendly and prompt. Not to mention they had an adorable maneki-neko (beckoning cat) there at the front to greet you. I might have squeed a little it was so cute. For $18 for the two of us (which included our meals, fried rice, 2 crab rangoons, 1 egg roll, and two medium drinks), we had left full and had to grab a to-go box. Which is nice because we didn't need to gorge ourselves and feel miserable like we normally would at a buffet. Definitely will be coming back again to try out all the other different flavors they offer! I'd dare say that we have found a new favorite.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/12/2013,5/11/2014,0,6,,5,1>This is my favorite place to go for a special occasion. The service is as good as it gets. Friendliest people ever! The food is as good as the service. (Wine is a must.) Tucked behind a beautiful Victorian on downtown Walnut Street, it's a beautiful location. The decor, lighting and music is perfect. I've been here with my husband for dinner. Another time went for a girls getaway for just appetizer, dessert and coffee. We arrived 30 minutes before closing (I called ahead to make sure it was okay). We never felt rushed in the least. This is the place. Trust me. This is the place.
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/2/2011,5/10/2014,27,13,1,6,1>Awesome! This is the place to get meat. Especially Steaks. Cool local market feel. Been around a loooong time. I remember getting meats here when I was a wee little tike.
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/7/2014,10/21/2014,0,5,2,5,3>I really love this place! I take my kids every year to make a Christmas ornament and other times of the year to just have fun. It is a great place to go for Girls Night Out or to just go, relax and get creative. I like that you are able to get your own supplies and paints but that the staff are very helpful if you have any questions. I really like the specialty glaze that you can use. They also to Pottery to Go and come to my daughters preschool each month. I have a whole shelf of things that she has made over the years.

Everything we've had here has been great and now w/ the Springfield location we don't have to drive to Branson to get this great cuisine! Great for kids, lunch, dinner, family dates. All the above!! Staff is super friendly, too!
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/22/2014,10/19/2014,16,171,3,2,2>This venue has been solid for every event I have attended. It is large enough to cater to a decent crowd but also intimate enough to feel like a smaller club. It is a historical building but always is comfortable in this venue. When they have bands you can get close to the stage to really enjoy. Also, their tickets are reasonable. They do have a bar and it is expensive but this is a huge place and they have to pay their bills.If you want an easter egg, there is a strange baby doll in the balcony just right of the stage. You should be able to see it when the lights are on. Kinda creepy!
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2014,10/18/2014,8,16,2,1,1>Best hummus in town. The falafel is fresh and is made in house. In fact, our server (who was fantastic) told us that almost everything is made in house.  I got a veggie burger that had falafel, some sort of yogurt, pickled veggies, and came on pita bread. It was a refreshing take on my western view of what a burger can be. I will definitely be back and I'm excited about trying so many of the other items that are  foreign to me.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/6/2014,10/17/2014,8,3,3,2,2>The only complaint I have about Aviary is that it has stifled my once-adventurous interest in other area restaurants. The good news is that Aviary is constantly reinventing its sumptuous menu, which means that my wife and I are perfectly happy creping it up every time we go out for dinner. This is one of the very few restaurants for which I can wholeheartedly recommend each and every item on the menu, as my wife and I have been playing the menu game (that is, systematically sampling everything on the menu) for years now--without complaint or regret. Oh, I just thought of a second complaint: I do miss the Elvis dessert crepe (but its replacements are rather delicious consolations). Do yourself a favor and hit up Aviary for your next outdining experience, and then the next and the next and the next...
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2014,10/16/2014,3,25,3,2,2>This place is unique in today's environment because the folks running it and working here actually care about getting it right. The food is prepared to order, and the atmosphere is fun.  I had a Cuban sandwich which was really good, and even the sides of fries were quality.  Its a busy place that has established the right balance of noisy yet intimate dining. Most fun in the summertime!
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/5/2014,10/15/2014,2,7,2,2,3>I love love love the étouffée!!! A coworker told me I had to eat here. And so I did. I got the shrimp étouffée the second time I went and I crave that sauce with rice all the time. For me, it was delicious. Not necessarily where I would want to eat everyday, but good enough for me to go during lunch since I work nearby. It can get pretty crowded during the lunch hour... But most places are crowded. It's yummy! I was a happy camper.
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/10/2014,10/14/2014,0,14,2,3,4>This salon is awesome!You def want to call ahead and make an appointment... they have always been super busy everytime I go. They do accept walk ins but sometimes you may wait an hour since they are do busy.The salon is very clean inside and has a soothing atmosphere.  There are 8 pedi chairs with an additional pedi chair for children.  There is also 8 spots to have your regular nails done.  They have a lot of options for nail polish or shellac. It almost seems endless, lol they also have a ton of options for acrylic nails. You can ask for any type of design or show a picture and they will do it for you. I have been here several times for a pedicure, manicure, or just a polish change.  The staff is very friendly and no matter who I go to they always do a great job. They have a mani/pedi special that is $45 for a shellac manicure and regular toe polish. You save $5.The salon is also went out of there way and stayed past closing so they could do a mani/pedi on a group of my friends and I before we left for vacation, we felt very pampered. :)
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,10/13/2014,8,56,3,2,2>This was our first trip here and not the last!  The decor is great.  Urban but still fits into our midwest style.We were there about 1 pm on a Sunday so it was the brunch menu still.  I had a tough time choosing as many things looked interesting.  I opted for the Cheeks Benny which was a riff on Eggs Benedict but had beef cheeks and cornbread.  Hubs had ham steak and eggs.I had literally no complaints at all with my selection.  It was delightful!  Hubby had some grizzle and a lot of fat left on his ham (this was my opinion of it) but he said that it was very flavorful.  He also enjoyed a Bloody Mary made with a Habenero vodka and bacon salt.  Service was good with a friendly staff.  Liked that you can see the kitchen but it doesn't have a diner feel.  We also love that they support our local farmers and give them a shout out on a chalk board in the seating area.Well done, folks!
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2014,10/12/2014,0,67,4,5,3>Will I go back?  Absolutely!  We went on a Thursday night and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for two.  On the recommendation of a friend we tried the Firehouse Shrimp for an appetizer.  This is shrimp covered in a sauce that is similar to a spicy southwest ranch sauce and was outstanding.  We normally don't order appetizers but we will definitely get this again.  We ordered the FD Burger and the Alaskan Fish and Chips and would order these dishes again.  The burger has the Firehouse sauce on it that when combined with the cheese almost melts in your mouth.  The Alaskan Fish was a battered white flaky fish that had a nice mild flavor that could be enhanced by the tartar sauce provided if desired.  I enjoyed it both ways.  The fries that were served came out hot and fresh and had a good flavor without being under or overcooked.  The fish and chips was also served with cole slaw.  Unfortunately, this was pre-made generic out of a tub cole slaw that can be found at several restaurants and grocery stores.  The portions were great and the prices were very reasonable making this a great value.The service was up and down.  While our waitress was cordial my water glass sat empty for quite some time and she promised to fill it up multiple times without following through.  This was the only damper on what was an otherwise enjoyable experience.
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/21/2014,11/20/2014,22,9,4,3,3>The only New York style place I've had in Springfield.  I know lots of people who actually get a craving for this even when they move away. The pizza by the slice is awesome if you're not starving but want a cheap way to get some great pizza. I'm a big fan of the plain cheese slice or pepperoni. However, I know they make a variety of interesting toppings for their pizzas that my friends love.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2014,11/19/2014,1,14,3,3,4>Such a great selection of food and bulk items. But my favorite part of this store is the amazing knowledge of the employees in the supplement section!! I've used them for 4 medical conditions (hives, anxiety...) that my PCP couldn't help with and they were able to help me! They always listen and give new ideas for your health!!!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2014,11/18/2014,9,38,3,4,4>Best service in town, even when they're slammed. Great rotating selection of seasonal beers on Draught and awesome bottled selection. Best group of guys around. Also, best place to watch soccer and other sports.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2014,11/17/2014,13,5,3,3,4>One of my favorite places to eat in town!

<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/6/2014,11/16/2014,39,4,4,4,3>Try the pizza or the lasagna.  It's a favorite for date night!  The owner is very friendly, when we take the kids they are always allowed to go tour the kitchen and make their own ice cream.  Great place!
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2014,11/15/2014,0,7,1,2,2>Just left here not too long ago, the staff are very friendly and helpful. I ordered the specialty grinder 9 inch fries and a drink, came out to roughly $10, not bad price considering I couldn't eat the whole thing in one sitting, flavorful sandwich with a light toasted italian bread! The fries were nice n crispy not soggy or greasy at all. Will definitely be bringing the family here to check it out. The place is really clean as well.
<review# 70,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2014,11/14/2014,22,33,3,5,4>Not many people know about this place, however Asian express has become our favorite place.  I love healthy Vietnamese food, and my boyfriend loves Chinese food there.  I think the food is great quality and right portion for the prices.  My boyfriend had a sweet and sour chicken and the quality of white meat chicken and the way they fried it was just better than most places in Springfield. I always have lemongrass beef on the Vietnamese bowl.  The middle aged guy who works there is so friendly, he tries to accommodate all the customers. He was checking on us many times and asking if we needed anything.  I'm impressed with the quality, taste of food and the services.
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2014,11/13/2014,4,5,4,3,3>The new location for the Moxie has been, in my option, a huge success. The building layout makes more sense now--before, at the old location, you had to park behind the building (unless you could find street parking) and walk around the block to enter. Now you have the option of street parking, garage parking, or there's a parking lot directly across from the entrance.The inside of the theater itself has greatly improved, as well. It is much larger, the seats are a very comfortable, leather-like material, and the cup holders have two sizes built into it--one size that fits a glass bottle and a wider ring that fits a stemless wine glass. I'm much appreciative of small touches like these.This leads me to my next point, which I love about the Moxie: they sell alcohol. Forget popcorn (although their popcorn is great, too)--I cannot express enough how nice it is to treat yourself to a glass of wine or a beer while enjoying a movie. They also sell high-quality chocolates (ChocoLove is the main brand, I believe) in two sizes, and their concession prices are very reasonable. Wine is $5-7, beers are $3-6 or so.On a recent trip here, a friend and I got tickets for Magic in the Moonlight, the newest Woody Allen film. We showed up around 5ish minutes before the movie started, and there were only 4 seats available after we got our tickets. Unfortunately, there was a line waiting behind us, so some were turned away :(. When we entered the theater, there were only a few vacant seats that were all scattered. We were prepared to sit apart from each other, but a row of extremely kind people moved over to make room for the two of us to sit together. Also, a Moxie worker came in and brought two fold up chairs for two gentlemen who came in after us and couldn't find seats--true hospitality, in my mind.I cannot boast about the Moxie enough. It shouldn't be fair to compare it to other theaters in Springfield because they are not one and the same, but if you have visiting guests from outside of Springfield and they are looking to go see a movie, your first recommendation should definitely be here!
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/19/2014,11/12/2014,1,33,3,3,3>I love Lola's. It's a local family, and I've been going there ever since I was in high school. The place is situated in the middle of Nixa, just behind AutoZone in a house. It's homey, warm, and everything you wanted for a lunch date with mom or friends. My favorite is the salads or the club- which is best served with the chips and you need to request a side of the blueberry poppyseed dressing to dig your potato chips in. It's good- promise. They are also pretty reasonably priced. You can usually do lunch for two with a piece of the amazing cake for under $20. The serve breakfast too, which is extremely girly, but pretty good as well.
<review# 73,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/27/2014,11/11/2014,5,4,3,2,2>I've tried Ben's several times. I like the simple sandwiches and salads. The potato soup is good, too. My fave is the BLT sandwich. My kids love that he serves potato skins chips with the sandwiches. The Chai tea is delicious and I stop and get one when I'm on the square in the morning.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2014,3/6/2014,0,9,,4,3>This place has been in Springfield for quite a while and I still love it so much every time I go. Jesus is an awesome guy and always so friendly and the food is amazing! Living in Springfield really has its limitations when it comes to authentic food and this place is where it is at when you are looking for something close to that. I always get the Cachete (beef cheek) and the lengua (cow tongue) in tacos and its so good. I'd bring anyone to this place even if they aren't an exotic eater.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,3/5/2014,1,1,,4,2>With all due respect to earlier reviewers, I have to rate Prima's very highly. Our party partook in three different entrées (smothered carnitas, carne guisada, and mine--asada tacos). All three meals were delicious, none lacking in seasoning at all. They give you a choice of refried beans too. I ordered the black bean version, which had a savory flavor. The traditional pinto bean version was equally good. The two salsas--regular and hot--combined very well as well. In conclusion, this location may have had its problems when it started off, but I've been twice in the last month, and both visits were wonderful. Ignore the earlier reviews and give it a try.
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/22/2014,3/4/2014,40,236,,6,4>Our family loves going to this zoo.  We bought a "friends of the zoo" membership so we can go anytime we want. That alone has payed for itself over and over again.  It does cost a little extra if you want to feed the giraffes or ride the train but still makes a day of fun with the family extremely inexpensive.The staff is always friendly and they do a great job keeping the zoo clean.My wife and I went there before the kids and enjoy it even more now that we have two little ones that love the place.  I highly recommend this zoo.
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/27/2014,3/2/2014,56,52,2,6,6>While I have not been to the new location on historic Commercial Street, and haven't sampled the new lunch menu, I will review my experience of placing a special order for homemade bread from this purveyor. I was working a photo shoot and we needed some specialty bread that most bakeries in town do not carry. We were shooting muffulettas. I considered asking a national franchise chain known for those type of sandwiches if they could fulfill our needs, but then my creative sensibilities held sway. Having patronized their Farmers Market booth at Farmers Park many-a-Saturday, I called Craig Crosby, proprietor of The Artisan's Oven, and gave him my client's specific requests. He was able to produce quickly & turn around several very large and very beautiful loaves for us! Our clients were thrilled with the finished images. Lucky for us all, we hit the money shot with the first flawless loaf so there were copious leftovers to take home and toast for breakfast, grill for lunch and devour every last crumb. From this moment forward, we will use this source for all our baked-goods requirements...hoping & praying for more crumbs to savor!
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/17/2014,3/1/2014,0,4,1,5,3>What can I say? Atmosphere is AMAZING! Love the music! The hostess was very polite and sat us right away. Amanda, our server was awesome and so helpful. I will definitely be back again to get the bananas foster dessert. We started off with two cocktails. Soho refresh and mango tango..both excellent. For dinner I got the blueberry salmon which was excellent! My taste buds were in heaven. My boyfriend got the sea bass and it was just as amazing. The plating was beautiful, I didn't even want to touch the plate! Whenever you come ask for Amanda. She's so sweet and will help you chose an excellent entree for yourself. Manager was also very helpful and came to the table to make sure everything was alright. Pricing is rather expensive for dinner. But it is totally worth it! :)
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/24/2014,2/28/2014,3,10,1,5,3>Heard good things about Mojo Pie and decided to give it a shot. While it is tucked away a bit, its hard to miss if you're looking for it. Everything about this place is interesting and sort of oddball (in a good way). The service is very friendly from everyone, and the atmosphere is very relaxed. The vibe of the place is unlike any other salon I've been to.I had my hair cut by Tony, the owner, who is a very nice and sociable man with a good eye for style and who does excellent cuts. He told me while I was there that he built the building from the ground up, which I found interesting. I was very pleased with my cut (I gave him creative control over it) and have recommended others here. They have all been pleased with the results as well. I did pay a little more here than I would elsewhere, which made me leery at first, but in the end, I felt I received a comparable increase in quality, so for me the difference is worth it.
<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2014,2/27/2014,1,24,,5,2>Really great grooming services for a fair price! Walked my dog in, dropped her off, and got her back looking beautiful and smelling great. My dog is very stubborn too, therefore I wanted to take her somewhere to get her nails trimmed and have her thoroughly bathed. She usually hates getting bathed and having her nails trimmed, but the staff handled her well and I am a satisfied customer! I can tell they actually cared about her and did a great job because she normally comes out from places whining or wild, but she was doing fine when we got there and on the way home. $17 for a Beagle wash, brush, and nail trimming. Definitely taking my pup, Kalohe back again!
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/30/2014,2/26/2014,3,54,,6,4>Don't be fooled by the exterior of this building. Hole in the wall businesses can be the best. The space next door to Austin's is closed, but Austins is running strong. My girlfriend and I went to Austin's to get taxes done the other day and we were very surprised at the very low price we paid for tax preparation. For our particular situation the cost was $60. For the same tax preparation, Jackson Hewitt wanted two hundred some dollars. Glad we shopped around for prices!Austin's is a family owned business and as expected, the folks here are very friendly and helpful. They were very patient as we bombarded them with multiple questions and were happy to answer all of them thoroughly. We came in near closing time and our taxes were done by noon the next day. Now that's expedient! We really wish we knew about this place before this year. We will be going back to Austin's.
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2014,2/25/2014,37,70,1,5,4>The Basil Julep alone would rate this place a 5 star for me - but what really clenched the rating was the super awesome staff.  Super friendly and dapper to boot. I like this place enough to come here sober - and for downtown Springfield that's saying a lot.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2014,2/24/2014,0,16,1,4,3>Quality does seem to be a bit different every time I go in, but never enough to make me dislike my meal, the past few times I've been have actually been my favorite. I've have tried many other Chinese restaurants in Springfield but none of them seem to match up to Peking. My favorites are their sweet and sour chicken and the veggie lo mein. Also, I highly recommend the chocolate chip wontons. Warm wontons filled with cookie dough and hot fudge on the side- one of my favorite desserts.
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/24/2014,10/31/2014,0,5,3,3,3>Great little taco place. Have been numerous times. The tacos are bigger than one is use to eating. Having said that, I usually order one at lunch and two at dinner. I keep coming back to the crispy flour shell, as it's a nice change. I've been working my way through the different taco selections and enjoy them all. Prices are on the high side for a taco but definitely worth it. It's fun to pick out the different combinations you want. I really like the salsas. They always bring out three different ones when I ask. I've also had one of their guacamoles but I can't recall which one. It had bacon in it. Very good! I'm itching to try one of their burritos as I always see someone with one and they look great. Most of if not all of the sour cream has cilantro mixed in. Shoot me now. No biggie as I always request just plain sour cream. I don't understand the route the owners are going with the 80's memorabilia on the walls but I don't care. I'm there for the tacos!
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/29/2014,10/30/2014,0,2,3,5,4>This sweet shop is definitely the sweetest. Their hand-churned key lime ice cream is amazing with chocolate covered potato chips or chocolate covered macadamia nuts. They've also got amazing fresh coffee and the best hand made marshmallows. I recommend this little sweet shop when you're craving great dessert and great conversation. The Pickwick community that surrounds the shop is also great for walking around and exploring.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2014,10/29/2014,3,24,3,4,3>Springfield's best piercing studio! Ash takes  her job very seriously and has a passion not only for putting holes in people, but making sure that the customer is satisfied and understands what she is doing, while she is doing it. Makes sense that she is a board member of the APP.     Her shop is organized and immaculate, with cases full of beautiful jewelry to select from and she can order custom jewelry from suppliers, all of which are high quality materials, not that cheap junk you get at the mall.    I am always welcomed when I come in whether it is with a question or just coming in to look at the new jewelry. Don't waste your time or money going anywhere else in town, come to Kira Kira!
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/6/2014,10/28/2014,6,22,2,3,2>What's not to love about this place?  Hearty servings, southern hospitality, local beer, and amazing BBQ!  Best BBQ in town hands down. My wife absolutely loves this place as do I. Chicken and pork are top notch.Will continue to come back and would definitely recommend it!
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/9/2014,10/27/2014,21,6,3,4,3>People need to quit throwing a fit about the location. We just relocated back to the area after being gone 2 years and we love going here. Yah, I miss the vibe of the old Galloway location, but that started to dwindle anyway--the food is still amazing and consistent. The staff is friendly and laid back. And the bathrooms are hella nicer. I'd suggest this place to anyone new in town for its welcoming environment, great menu and reasonable prices.
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2014,10/26/2014,12,35,3,4,4>This food truck contains a mobile brick oven and parks at Farmers Markets throughout the Springfield area.I wanted to post a review on Yelp because it is now my favorite pizza in Springfield.  The crust is soft and chewy with that slightly charred taste that only a brick oven can impart, and the toppings are fresh and well balanced.I can't wait to eat their pizza again.As of this review, they park at the Greater Springfield Farmers Market (in the parking lot of the Battlefield Mall) on Saturdays from 8:00-1:00 and at the Ozark Downtown Farmers Market (in Ozark, MO) on Wednesday from 4:30-7:30.I recommend checking their Facebook page, facebook.com/remospizzer, for more details.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2014,10/25/2014,123,171,3,5,5>I wish my review could be as in depth as some of the others in regard to how the chocolate is made.  In fact, I probably can't tell you anything new that hasn't been said before.  So I'll just make mine short and sweet (!) ...This chocolate is delicious.  My husband and I went to visit their little storefront where a very informative young man was passing around samples and telling stories about each one.  I'm not sure how many people were there to actually buy anything, but you could tell this guy wasn't the least bit concerned about it.  The samples were flowing let me just say.  Had we stopped long enough to listen to what he said, my review may be a little more informative.  However, what I can tell you is the variety of flavors and uniqueness of each bar will leave you figuring out which one(s) to take home right away.  Unfortunately, because of the almost $10 price per bar, it makes it very difficult to buy one of each.We settled on a tin of Mexican Sipping Chocolate (thinking of cool autumn nights ahead), a jar of the chocolate/hazelnut spread, and the Mexican dark chocolate bar that had a sugar crystal texture that melted on your tongue almost instantly followed by a mild vanilla bean flavor.  Can't wait for dessert this week!  And once this is gone, we will definitely go back for more.If you're in Springfield on a Tuesday afternoon, stop by for a factory tour.  I'm regretful  we were unable to do this, but next time I'll be sure to plan better.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,10/24/2014,4,12,3,4,3>Fun fun fun! Neat and different bar.  Great for gathering with friends or doing business.  We found some of the ideas were very different and really sets them apart from other places in town. Loved that the menus were in old encyclopedias,  great re-use of those! Great cocktails and wine selection,  can't wait to go back.
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2014,10/23/2014,11,22,2,2,2>I have to agree with Paul D. I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad meal here. I enjoy Korean food and this is where I come to get it. The family who own it are very nice people. This restaurant is off the beaten path but worth coming to. This is a great example about why you should dine local. If you have someone who insists on Spfd Chinese chicken they do that as well or better than anyone in town. This is a hidden gem in a strip center on the south side of Sunshine west of Fort.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/8/2014,10/22/2014,50,220,3,6,3>Been to Cafe Cusco a few times, and each time it was pretty good. But today, I went there for lunch with my husband. It was simply delicious. The fritas appetizer is excellent (I second Molly R's assertion that those are the best sweet potato fries ever), and my entree (Trout with Basil Aioli salad) was great, although a little too heavy in the aioli. The husband had the goat burger, and with his first bite, the egg oozed all over everything. That to me is one of the most perfect aspects of eating something with egg. The burger was delicious, and he said his side salad was great too. On top of that, our server was kind, friendly, and very helpful. I find servers who insert themselves into the meal (as if they're part of the party) annoying, and our server did not hit that point. He was excellent. Given that I've had some mixed experiences (last time I went there, the server was weird and the shrimp caprese salad is just okay; time before that, the black bean quinoa burger was good but not outstanding), I think 4 stars is an appropriate rating. Cafe Cusco serves as an excellent and more exciting food option for Commercial Street and Springfield in general.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/12/2014,3/21/2014,77,42,,4,3>Once you try this place, you will want more! I have now been there four times and I still can't seem to get enough. I am a huge salad fan, along with being health conscious and this is right up my alley. There healthy options are endless! I always struggle between eating the steak Gorgonzola salad or the cranberry and walnut salad with feta cheese and champagne dressing.  IT IS UH-MAZ-ING. You can get your order to go or sit down and enjoy your meal with a glass of wine or beer. Prices- everyone always wants to know why healthy options always cost more; but that is not the case on this one. The salads are around 7.99-9.99 and they even ask you how you want your steak cooked!I ventured out and got the make your own pizza and it was just as fantastic. I ordered artichokes, green peppers, feta cheese, zucchini and cucumbers with a basil pesto sauce. I ate the entire thing by myself. It was so delicious I just couldn't stop! If I could afford to just get take out every night from this wonderful place I sure would. Lastly I want to comment on the blu cheese chip appetizer, I ordered this app for my mother-in-law and my mom to try while we were waiting on our take out. It was a perfect size for a quick bite before our meals and was also very tasty. The staff is wonderful, the food is, well, I could eat here every single day, and the location is great! LOVE LOVE LOVE.
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/22/2013,3/18/2014,7,18,2,3,2>Tiny hole in the wall with great food. Meaty sandwiches and deep fried sides. I've tried several sandwiches, but I'm a sucker for the Philly and fried mushrooms. The fries are really good too, if ya don't mind skins. Canned sodas, only 4 stools, definitely a bit minimalistic, but especially great after a few beers. Expect to order for takeout. It's pretty cramped. Side note: it's covered in fliers and stuff. Try to find a face on one without a drawn-on mustache. And draw one!
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/31/2012,3/17/2014,1,4,,3,2>Excellent gem in Springfield MO.   While the instructors are all very fit, it is not a typical experience in a gym-type atmosphere in Springfield.  There is no indication to not simply be comfortable with your body, whatever shape it may be in, or to over extend in postures (unless you just want to, of course).  If you find you have a lot of expectation (or anxiety), best to read up on what to expect before going.  From their website, the internet, or other sources.  Then it's really up to you if your experience is negative or positive.  Be okay with getting lost the first class (or even the first 3 months of classes), breaks you give to yourself,  and using the modifications; and , should you find it does not suit you, be ready to accept that this may be the reality of it as well.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/6/2012,3/16/2014,23,114,,8,3>This is my first review of a restaurant in Springfield. I'm choosing this one because I went there for my birthday a couple of weeks ago and remember it being a very good experience.Tasia does a lot of stuff very well. It's a nice place, has a friendly, helpful staff, and its moderately priced.What they do very, very well is have a nice variety of higher-end Asian food, from Thai to sushi to Korean. My family and I had some sushi--the beef bulgogi roll was something we'd never seen before and we were very happy we ordered it, as it was fantastic, a mix of Japanese and Korean I haven't seen (or noticed) before. I had pad thai--started with the basics--and it was above average, and there was a lot of it.Tasia isn't reinventing Asian food but they made for an excellent dining experience, better than carry out in a white box for sure, and worth the trip to sit down and spend time there.
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/23/2013,3/15/2014,1,1,,4,3>Big Momma's has been a cornerstone of my college years. In fact, I would be unable to tell you the amount of times I've been here in the past -- whether for SUB nights (free coffee paid for by our Student Union Board), karaoke nights (sponsored by SUB, not a regularly occurring event), listening to live music (also not a completely regular occurrence), or just coming by to study in a warm, comforting space. The last of which, combined with the proximity to Drury (and my apartment) is what keeps me coming back.Well, I guess that's not all -- the food is definitely a primary reason for coming here, as opposed to the many other inviting coffee shops littered throughout Springfield. Their food is the greatest companion to studying, since most of their menu consists of sandwiches, soups, or salads, and the option for typical coffee shop fare like scones and other pastries. I've only ever gotten two of their sandwiches: The Firehouse and the Hobo Alley. Both sandwiches always leave me feeling satisfied and my soul warmed. The Firehouse is off of their 'Gourmet Grilled Cheese' menu, but is certainly more than your average grilled cheese, offering smoked sausage, jalapeños, pepper jack, cheddar, spicy chipolte pesto on deliciously thick and perfectly toasted wheat berry bread. And while the Hobo Alley may just sound like an average peanut butter & jelly sandwich from their menu description, I can tell you from experience that it's much more than that (PLUS, it's like $4). For as amazing as their food is though, I've never had a completely adequate drink from Big Momma's. While I would never consider myself a coffee connoisseur, any coffee drink I've gotten there has just been OK, and their smoothies are are made with an artificial syrup/juice mix that ultimately just tastes too sugary and never satisfying. Luckily, you can always opt for water alongside your sure to be delicious food.I love coming to Big Momma's to study, relax, and indulge in some good eats -- it's served me more than well these past 3 years, and I'm looking forward to continuing this weekend tradition.
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2013,3/14/2014,0,10,,3,2>Imagine going to a place "where everybody knows your name" and your order? Yep, I'm that girl and Mud House is that place. I walk in and my order is being made. I fancy the Peanut Butter Puddle, but a Happy Hippie is a close second. Besides amazing coffee, great music, always changing art on the walls and personable service, the Mud House is really one of a kind and should be visited by any new comers to the Springfield area. Its not just coffee, you can get a delicious lunch of soup, salad and sandwich!
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/18/2014,3/10/2014,0,67,1,5,5>Will I go back?  Yes.  Mexican Villa is a Springfield original.  Many knock it for not being authentic Mexican cuisine. I don't care about that.  All I care about is that the food is good.  I always order the Burrito Enchilada Style.  This is a beef and bean burrito stuffed with cheese and sweet sauce smothered in cheese and enchilada sauce.  It is a dieters nightmare but is a tasted that one will crave.  I find the pricing to provide an excellent value.  The chips and hot sauce that are served are also very good.  If visiting Springfield you should try this place.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/20/2014,3/9/2014,0,2,1,7,4>I can never go in this place without finding something I absolutley adore! It's truley amazing to learn that everything being sold here is produced by LOCAL artists. I attend figure drawing here and I honestly couldn't ask for a more welcoming and relaxed environment to work in. Downtown Springfield wouldn't be the same without it.
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/4/2014,3/8/2014,0,14,,4,1>Wanted to try a new lunch place by my work, and stumbled into this new coffee shop/bakery in hopes that they served lunch. When the woman at the counter told me they did not, but showed me the tomato mozzarella tart, I thought... "Hm, I'm pretty hungry.  I guess this will do." So glad I stayed. The tart was deliciously layered on top of a flaky crust. They've definitely mastered the light and airy bread! It was just like the croissant I tried when I was in France. Buttery flaky goodness without the heaviness. The latte was fantastic,  too. Decor is elegant. Service is friendly. I'll definitely come back to this little place.
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,3/7/2014,11,7,3,7,4>This place can be best described as a warehouse filled with comics and records, with both being literally wall to wall.  If you decide to venture out to the store, and you want to make the best use of your time, I recommend you bring a list if you are searching for for either comics or records.  Over the last several months, there have been many improvements in organizing all of what is offered at the store, but you will be amazed, and overwhelmed of how much stock and overstock there is in both comics and records.  I don't think anyone else in Springfield even comes close to carrying as much.Bare in mind, most records do not have price-tags on them.  The prices are typically negotiated upon checking out.  Please don't let this be a factor in passing up a great buy!  The same rule can be applied to the comics, with a few exceptions (some of the rarer comics have fixed prices).  HOWEVER, for those who need to have a dollar amount assigned to your purchase before heading up to the counter, there is a section just for you. At the front entrance of Missouri Comics & Records, on both sides of the wall sits several hundred records, all priced at 1.00.  As far as I can tell, there is no real order to them, so happy hunting!Josh, the price negotiator, and also the owner of Missouri Comics & Records is an incredibly nice, very knowledgeable, "goes the extra mile" kind of guy.  All of my experiences with him at the store have always been positive, and all the prices he has negotiated with me have been more than fair.  Josh does not gouge your wallet like some other local places (that shall not be named) do.  A lot of the records I've bought are usually in pristine shape (the record itself, not always the album cover).  Make sure you inspect each record to your satisfaction before deciding on your purchase!Most of the records being sold don't span too far outside the 90's, but rather prior to that.  Lots of Jazz, Blues, Rock, Metal, Country, Folk, Rap....and a little bit of everything else.  Most of the genre's are separated by sections, and follow an A-Z format...to an extent.  But, there are still stockpiles of records in multiple rooms that have yet to be organized.  So if you decided to plow through the unsorted sections, make sure you set aside a couple of hours, if not more.If you become a frequent shopper of Missouri Comics & Records, make sure to like them on Facebook.  They usually post great specials and deals frequently, and pictures of recently acquired inventory.
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,11/10/2014,0,7,3,3,2>Great food, good service, great price, period. Shared a pizza and the Norma pasta. Very good sauce and excellent pasta. Fairly new restaurant, this was our second time there and have thoroughly enjoyed our meals both times. 2 meals for less than $25. Definitely a two thumbs up recommendation. I hope they are around for years to come.

<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2014,11/8/2014,2,6,4,3,3>Jimms is one of the first places I came to when I moved here from Georgia. We walked in and were greeted immediately. They sat us down and cordially thanked us for coming in. We then were greeted within seconds of sitting down. The server told us their special and started to make great recommendations after we told her we had never been there before. We started with the papadew peppers for an appetizer. They were sweet with some spice to them. Absolutely outstanding. If they did a happy hour with those on special, I'd go a lot more. My fiancé got the ribeye with he described as very tender. I got the Cajun chicken pasta. Which was served with focaccia garlic bread. The pasta wasn't over cooked, which means the noodles weren't just sitting there. They were fresh. And the chicken was perfectly seasoned. Your meal is served with honey wheat bread and butter and they give you the option of a salad of your choice or the salad bar. I say go with the salad bar. It's got a lot of options and it's always very fresh. Two thumbs up. We will be back.

I trust my hair to no one else. His skills in styling are beyond explanation through a review. He is friendly, loyal, experienced, and all around amazing. Milk and Honey Salon will be on the top of my go-to list from here on out.
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2014,11/6/2014,7,4,3,3,3>We just ate here for an office lunch during the 417 Magazine Lunch Break special. I found the appetizers to be unique (American with a heavy Asian twist, like the jalepeno poppers) and tasty! Crab rangoons are EXCELLENT. First one I've had ever that had more crab than cream cheese.The hibachi chicken was good, veggies and meat and rice all cooked perfectly. But Nakato is my standard for hibachi, and it wasn't as good as theirs. Still, very good. If the worst I can say is "Not as good as Nakato," that is not very bad at all. Definitely recommend Kobe, and I will be eating here again.

I corroborate other mentions of the higher prices however, I've paid similarly for far less. We took home enough for each of us to enjoy as tomorrow's lunch! Lamb Korma with medium spice was tender & comforting, both chicken & fish curries with mild spice were devoured by younger kids! Cauliflower naan was worth the recommendation by the owner. My nephew says that he recommends this place to adventurous kids 5 & up! We'll be back!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2014,11/4/2014,22,15,3,3,3>This is the absolute BEST place for training, grooming, boarding, and daycare for dogs. When I was looking for a daycare around here for my dog most places gave me a super weird vibe. I would always bring Mia in with me to check it out and they barely looked at her! They just talked to me in a monotone voice about their facility.When I brought Mia to Howliday Inn the girls at the front immediately came to pet her and ask me questions all about her. These people are genuine and they love animals. They also record the daycare every day and then post it on their facebook page so you can see what your dog did that day! You can trust these people. It is a little farther away but it's worth every penny and your dog will have so much fun. Plus the training they do is amazing. These people are legit!
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/22/2014,11/3/2014,11,12,3,3,3>This place was fantastic. We had the peanut chicken burrito, mojo tacos, chip and guacamole, and the Pad Thai. The burrito was the best. Enough to feed two people and filled with everything. The tacos were fantastic. The pad Thai was different then any other I have tried. I will try the vegetarian next time because I didn't care for the chicken. You have to try this place. Can't wait to go back and try something new.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/7/2014,11/2/2014,0,14,3,3,3>Fresh donuts and very creative ones!My brother also had their strudel donuts catered for his wedding.AMAZING. I mean seriously just  a phenomenal donut.Some people in Springfield just don't understand that at a unique local eaterie you are going to have to pay more. If you want cheap, go to Krispy Kreme but don't count out Hurts for their prices.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2014,11/1/2014,2,9,3,6,3>This place has the best pizza in town! Try the Mama Mia Meatball pizza- it's to die for ! I haven't tried any of their Brews yet but I plan on it next time I go there which will be the next time I'm craving pizza and that will be very soon considering pizza is my fave food ! I don't think any pizza place could top this place !
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2013,4/28/2014,2,18,1,4,4>Great naan bread and spicy chutney!  Good buffet selections if you are wanting to try Indian food. No American dishes slipped in either to the buffet like pudding or weird jello!!  Rice pudding was good and we loved the chicken tika. Good lunch for $10.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/27/2013,4/25/2014,42,118,1,8,5>One word: obsessed.I keep coming back to this place because there is honestly not a single bad dish on the menu. And trust me, I've tried every single one several times. My favorites are the flash-fried spinach, the baked brie and the "Yoakam" steak tips. To die for! Just make sure you order half the spinach portion. If you get the whole order, the spinach tends to be a bit soggy instead of deliciously crispy and garlicky. The wine list is enormous but you can also bring your own bottle as long as you spring for the corking fee. I went there yesterday and am craving their food again already.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/17/2013,4/24/2014,21,17,,4,2>This is the wife and my home away home. JOB is the whiskey mecca of the Ozarks. The staff are a wealth of knowledge in the realm of bourbon, rye and scotch. If you're hungry try one of the Cubicles. We are partial to the Ham and Apple with brown sugar fries. Always an interesting mix of clientele. Never pretentious. THE choice place for all that is spiritus frumenti.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/25/2014,4/23/2014,2,21,2,6,3>Ever since Hurts opened, I have been a fan. Local. Experimental donuts. Not only are the donuts delicious, there is something for everyone. Springfield has Andy's Frozen Custard as novelty. In addition, we now have Hurts, just so some of us that crave donuts can get our fix (especially with Andes mints on top). Springfield is/was in need of local, unique eateries. Hurt's has answered the calling. My top favorites: Streusel, Andes Mint, and the Caramel Pretzel Crunch. ps. If you are local, get the coupon shirt. It will pay off in the long run. If not, get the shirt anyway and help out an awesome local business.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/3/2013,4/20/2014,5,19,,8,3>For grabbing a quick bite, I might not pick Gailey's. However, for a nice, leisurely mid-morning, 12-cups of coffee, sit and chat with a friend meal, I think there's no place better here in Springfield! I live around the corner, so Gailey's is becoming a regular stop for me. Simple, delicious breakfast food. I've never eaten anything off of the lunch menu, but everything I've ever had on the breakfast side has been great, especially the sweet browns. The service is usually pretty good, but at times it can be a bit slow. I guess I've become used to it and like I said, I don't ever really come here for a quick bite. All of the servers are super polite and my orders have never come out wrong even with all of the substitutions and eliminations and things that I'm prone to throw in at the breakfast meal. This place has a really laid back atmosphere and I really do enjoy it!
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/1/2013,4/19/2014,11,2,,4,3>The best sushi in Springfield, Mo! Mijuri is my favorite place. The sushi is always delicious. We went on Wednesday (Jan 30) and our server was knowledgeable, had recommendations ready when asked, and made sure our glasses were always full. Each time we go, we try a new roll. Highly recommend the Ping Ping Girl Roll (tuna, salmon, yellowtail and masago with pink seaweed). It's light and refreshing. I'm not sure how sushi can be refreshing, but this roll is! :)
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2014,4/18/2014,7,2,,4,2>Great hole-in-the-wall restaurant. It is easily one of the best places to get Chinese in Springfield. Even though the interior is small, just a few tables, it offers a wide selection of both authentic Chinese dishes and ones that are more American styled. I have yet to find something I haven't enjoyed.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2014,4/17/2014,2,5,,4,3>I had an absolutely lovely experience here. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was impressed. Beautiful decor, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and DELICIOUS food. We loved the fact that virtually everything they offer - from coffee to entrees to their delicious desserts - are made with local ingredients. Cafe Cusco is a unique and wonderful addition to Springfield's restaurant scene! I'm excited to go and check out their upstairs Summit Lounge, where they've got White River, Piney River, AND Mothers brews a-flowin'!
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/30/2009,4/16/2014,17,13,,3,2>This is my favorite place in town to go. A true BEER bar, it has the best selection of premium beers in town - including a limited edition line of Rogue beers that is delivered to only one bar in the stateof Missouri - The Patton Alley Pub! Staff is great, food is great, Sunday trivia night is great!  Oh - I also recommend the Philly Steak and chips!
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2013,4/15/2014,123,171,,3,2>This place is just darling! I would give it 5 stars just on ambience alone. But luckily the food is pretty good too. They serve wonderful Illy coffee, which is fantastically Italian. I had a tiny espresso with a shot of mocha. Yummy!I've only had breakfast here, and I love the Venetian Garden savory crepes. My fiancé always gets sweet crepes, but to me, that's not breakfast, that's dessert!  But they are delicious nonetheless.Will go back to this place over and over again.
