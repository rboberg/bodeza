<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/14/2014,11/25/2014,3,63,,2,>Garlic chicken, so good!! I love this place. I have for years, and I miss it when I can't have their delicious garlic chicken. The beef with broccoli and fried wontons are amazing too. Sesame Chicken? Yum! Classic or veggie egg rolls? Yes please! The carry out service here is spot-on, and the dine-in service is executed promptly and well. If you're looking for a well-established, tried and true Hixson Chinese food fix, DEFINITELY add Formosa to your plans!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/12/2014,11/24/2014,10,10,3,4,4>What a lovely affair! A cozy cavernous atmosphere full of charm and swank, delicious mini bites of maple sesame crusted caramelized bacon (bacon candy ^_^), mulled wine, and warm and invitingly chatty folks. The event was held in what seemed to be a private dinning/boardroom. I took a walk thru the main dining and bar area as well and was dazzled. I'll definitely return to experience more of TerraMae's atmosphere and it's full menu. Thanks to all who worked to put together such an event. And thank you Stephanie for adding me to the list; this dining experience was a great reintroduction to Chattanooga.
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2011,11/23/2014,11,79,1,4,2>This place might not be the best restaurant in Chattanooga, but I absolutely love it.  It's a great deal and they have the best pork chops I've ever had (And I might have had a few pork chops).  You know it's a great deal when you see all the seniors in the dining room!
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2012,11/22/2014,0,5,1,3,3>INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!  I had never been hang gliding before, and honestly, have a great fear of heights. The instructors are so wonderful and helpful. They made me feel so comfortable on the training / bunny hills, and then on the tandem 2000' flight, truly gave me an experience I will NEVER forget. They are one of the top training schools for a reason. If you are looking for the best, look no further.
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2011,11/21/2014,138,256,3,5,3>To say I was skeptical is an understatement. I  mean, "fresh seafood" and Cleveland, TN, just don't seem to go together.So I reluctantly gave it a try almost resigned to the fact I would catch salmonella.I'm glad I was wrong! Outstanding. Great decor, good service, nice wine list and excellent food at reasonable prices.Certainly the best seafood spot in town, of course that's kind of like having the best sushi in El Paso or the best BBQ in San Francisco.
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2011,11/20/2014,11,53,1,5,2>The BEST NY Strip I have EVER had!  I'm not a big steak eater so I always use A1 to give it flavor, no need for steak sauce here, the Jack Daniels glaze was to die for... the place was clean, it does allow smoking which is rare these days, I took the pic in the profile, our waitress Stephanie was very sweet and took great care of us, this lady is a top notch server! We drive a Semi based here in town and WILL be back to visit! A MUST VISIT FOR ANYONE THAT LOVES A GREAT STEAK! (Oh and they cut their own steaks here)
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2011,11/19/2014,40,78,1,6,3>I've been to Vaudeville twice. Once with a group, and once with a date. I think it's really well organized. The cast does an awesome job at staying in character and keeping everyone in attendance involved. I think you feel like you are as much a part of the show as possible. It's the best murder mystery dinner theatre I have tried. Deep down I am still always hoping to experience a place that will feel like that episode of Saved by the Bell when they all visit one and it's AWESOME, but I'm unsure if that is realistic. This was a lot of fun. The cast keeps it high energy and you may have to get up and dance or move around. BUT it's not uncomfortable, and they don't put you on the spot in a way that would make you wish you had decided to stay at home. It's just fun. The food is good. It's not really the reason you go. It didn't change my life or anything. The food was good, the theatre was good, and it was a lot of fun. Definitely worth the cost. I'll be back.
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2014,11/18/2014,567,567,5,6,5>I was impressed so that I might have to go back if in area again or even close. It's located off the 153 north on highway 58 east.I got the meatball parmigiana submarine.  I got it to go and they packaged perfectly in a round airtight container just fitted the submarine.I was delighted in my first bite. It is the simple truth; it looked so good when I opened it that I forgot to take a picture. I almost inhaled this sandwich without chewing it.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/30/2014,11/17/2014,40,9,1,4,4>Pass by this place hundreds of times but just got the courage to stop. Came at exactly 12 noon on a Thursday so it was fairly busy and food took a little longer than a chain would but it was expected in a growing new restaurant. This place is better than Ghengis!!! And they have white sauce!! We will definitely be back it is a great addition to this side of town!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,11/16/2014,177,489,2,4,2>Finally got down to Cashew.  First impressions were clean, modern, and friendly.  We ordered the starter Polenta dish, the Thai sweet potato, and the Portabella Hoagie. Service was great.  My wife really disliked the Thai taste on the sweet potato, but I loved it.  It was very tasty.  The Hoagie was amazing.  The chips served on the side (I think beet?) were a good taste, but I would have liked a little more crisp to them.   The polenta starter was made from a layer of polenta, sweet potato, tomato, and mushroom with a nice sauce.  It was beautifully presented and tasted very good.  The one downside was it was difficult to cut into bite sized bits.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2012,11/15/2014,10,10,2,2,2>Hands down the best lunch stop in town!  Premium meats and cheeses, TLC food prep, and a grassroots culture make for the best sandwiches from Cleveland to Chattanooga. I'm really surprised to see only a couple reviews for these guys.Heads up though,...don't go at 12:00 if you're in a hurry, and it ain't no $5 footlong.
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/11/2014,11/14/2014,12,53,1,2,3>Yum!  Loved the beef & lamb meatballs!  My husband had "The Big Katz" (pastrami sandwich) and he really liked it.  I had a bite and the pastrami was delicious.  Also, having wine on tap makes me happy, so we will definitely be back.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2010,11/13/2014,0,17,1,2,3>yes, I'm a FAN! I have eaten here on several occasions, including during the rush of Riverbend. I've also used their facilities next door for several work functions as I feel we are ALWAYS well taken care of.I even brought my foodie sister & brother-in-law here when they visited, and as far as I am aware, they were pleased. I must be missing something from the other reviews, as we have never had the experiences others have listed. Our servers are always attentive & prompt. (or is it that I don't expect to be in & out of a sit down restaurant in 20 minutes?) I recommend the hummus salad.. (but don't get thesalmon added unless you're REALLY hungry or you'll be overwhelmed.)
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/9/2012,11/12/2014,1,41,2,4,2>I give this place two forks up as my wife and I loved our meal.  We started of with the fried pickles and loved them.  Disclaimer, these are pickle spears not chips. We ordered them then saw that after the waitress recommended them.  The batter stayed on them and was cooked to perfection.On to the main meal, I had the cheeseburger add bacon. Simple but cooked great, I can't go on about a burger but it's great.  My wife got the pot roast and it was awesome!  It fell apart in my mouth, great gravy and her sides were good also.  On to desert, we had the blackberry cobbler.........I woke up a day later and asked what happened and my wife said you fell into a flavor coma.  It was phenomenal, probably cause I'm a cobbler fiend.  Awesome homemade goods.I have been here about 6 times and I wish this place was closer to home. Go and eat here, please
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2013,11/11/2014,59,49,1,3,3>I love, love, love Good Dog. Not only do they have a veggie dog (you can get any of their menu dogs as a veggie dog), it's a GOOD veggie dog. Seriously, I don't know if they make it themselves or what, but it's not a rubbery SmartDog and I love them for it.They also have a small but good beer selection. It's mainly cans, but if you're not into that they usually have Chattanooga Brewing Company on tap. This place is tasty, cheap, has a great atmosphere and serves beer (like any good hotdog joint should). What's not to like?
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/15/2012,11/10/2014,11,66,2,2,2>We really enjoyed our lunch: my husband had the jerk turkey sandwich, and I had the lox & bagel with capers, onion, & tomato.  The lox was so good, a generous amount, and plenty of capers (I love capers).  I do have one tiny criticism: I had to slide the lox & capers off the toasted bagel to schmear it with cream cheese (again, plenty of it, more points for that), then put it back.  This wasn't a big problem, but it would've been easier not to have to do it.  The owner?  Yeah, he's definitely not a Southerner.  He gave my husband some grief b/c he ordered the sandwich without the pineapple chutney.  But he also made a point of telling me that the lox was center cut & sent from Brooklyn.  I actually found his 'tude reassuring: I'd expect a New Yorker to know how to do a New York style deli.  I would SO go back.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/5/2012,11/9/2014,6,15,1,2,3>New to the area and wanting to try all the unique BBQ spots, my husband and I went for lunch today. Server was very nice. We both had the pulled pork sandwich. My husband ordered the large sandwich hoping for more meat but it wasn't much bigger then the regular side. BBQ sauce was excellent. We thought the pulled pork was ok. Not the best we have had but would try it again. The coleslaw was a little bland, didn't have much flavor, and I was really looking forward to it since it was homemade. My husband ordered fried pickles and potato wraps. He loved the fried pickles and the potato skins were wrapped in bacon and cheese on top. Different for sure but very yummy. I had the homemade macaroni and cheese and it was tasty. To full for desert we took Nanna pudding home. It was the best banana pudding I have ever had! The menu had many options and we will be visiting again. I have several things I would like to try including the shovel plates!
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2014,11/8/2014,21,11,2,4,3>The best Greek/Mediterranean food I've had outside of Europe.To me that's saying a lot - this is the food I grew up on. My mother and grandmother made Spanakopita and Dolmades regularly. Our house was always full of different yogurts and Baklava. Walking in here feels like walking into my family's kitchen, or any Balkan restaurant.The owner knows what he is doing. Point blank. He's been making this food for decades, you can taste that. It's experience and culture and everything you need and want from a great restaurant.White washed walls with tourist pictures of various Greek islands adorn the walls as Entehno music calms you down for the fabulous experience you're about to have.The gyro is the staple of course and especially in America, because it's easy. However, the Spanakopita plate is where you really want to be. You get the Spanakopita, a few Dolmades, a classic tomato/onion salad, and half a baked potato. All seasoned perfectly. All exquisite. All life affirming.Now, stop reading this and go! Take your friends, and your family - hell, ask a stranger if they'd like to go...
<review# 19,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/11/2013,11/7/2014,5,77,2,4,3>When you see the truck begin to smile.  If they have food left then game on. These folks get simply done flavors all together to create something wonderful.  Have eaten off this truck maybe 10 times and each time is fantastic. The kimchee BBQ on a hot August day is a hoot but a cold beer kills it quick.Clean, friendly, creative and darn good food.  Its fun to follow their facebook page too. Lots of cool pictures and comments.Don't pass this truck by.
<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/21/2014,11/6/2014,15,14,2,4,3>Went there on a Saturday night around 8 o'clock. We were told it'd be a little bit of a wait because we had such a large party (7 in all). We were only waiting for 20 minutes before we got our table. Which wasn't too bad because we were expecting much longer. Once we were seated we were given drink and food menus. Instantly impressed. Seating choices were bar, high tables, booths, outside seating, or some leather seating around some pinball tables. Also took note of the ping pong tables that were available for people who were waiting to be seated.Drink selection was diverse and had quite a few throwbacks to college drinks but a lot of local mixes as well. The food options all sounded and looked amazing. I had a hard time choosing and decided to go with the Shrimp Po Boy that the waitress told me was her favorite. I also decided to try the candy bacon appetizer.Was not disappointed. From the pickles and beer cheese chips on the side of my sandwich to the flavor of the thickly sliced bacon everything was on point. I tried my friend's Jamaican chicken sandwich and wasn't let down by that either. They even had something for the vegetarians to eat.I will definitely be going back and trying the other things that I couldn't choose between.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2014,11/5/2014,5,44,,3,1>Best I can say is that I love this place!  I love Pho and they have it.  The Pho Ga is great!  Make sure to check it out!
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2013,11/4/2014,11,20,3,3,2>I am thrilled with this place. They have a great selection and a very friendly staff. This is the go to place in Chattanooga for all of your landscaping needs. They also have very inexpensive delivery services.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2014,11/3/2014,24,101,1,3,2>This was the best breakfast I have ever had in chattanooga. Service was great as the servers seem to help each other and worked as one big team. During my breakfast I had 4 different people interact with me. The Colorado omelette was amazing as were the hash browns. The wheat toast was thick and hearty and perfectly toasted . If you like breakfast you must go here. This place is locally owned and that makes me happy too. When the plate arrived it looked as if it was staged for a photo it was so pretty. .
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/28/2008,11/2/2014,3,22,1,3,3>Good Southern Country Cooking on a Lazy Susan in the middle of your table. Bea's has been in business for 50 years. Great Fried Chicken, homemade yeast rolls, good pinto beans, Mac & Cheese...Good Southern Cobblers too. This is the place for folks who are from the South and like Southern Cooking you would have at home. Paula Deen would like this place too....
<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/17/2013,11/1/2014,11,21,1,3,2>This is hands down the beat meat quality that you will find at any barbecue restaurant. I also love that they make everything fresh in house right down to the sauces. Not sticky goopy sauce either. You can eat a lot and not feel like you have a brick in your stomach. Also love that you can mix the sauces for just the right combo for your taste palate. My one suggestion is not to forget to douse your meat, no matter what it is, in the Clearly Sauce. You might think it would be hot at first glance. It is not. It brings out the flavor of the meat and makes it SO good. The staff here is always friendly and go out of their way. They are always helpful with any questions for first timers and make great suggestions as well. And the view is one of the best in-town. I only give this Sugars location 4 stars because the menus is missing my favorite item that they make and serve at the downtown location.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2013,10/31/2014,13,15,1,3,2>Googled Soul Food and found this hidden gem. We went during Christmas break and the entire restraunt was decorated according to the season. This was the first time I have had soul food and even though I tried to look knowledgable in Soul I decided to ask the waiter what he recommended. He suggested the chopped steak, something I have never had, did not know what to expect and was absolutely blown away with the flavor that came with my meal. I was with a party of 7 and the chicken and waffles seemed to be the crowd favorite but if you want to try something new and different go with the chopped steak.
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/22/2012,10/30/2014,19,5,1,3,2>I ate here last night with a party of 9.  Two of the 9 were children ages 5 and 2.  The service was good and the waitress was very attentive.  This was my second trip to Bi Ba's.  The first time the only thing ton the menu that was gluten free was a salad topped with a grilled chicken breast.  They have recently updated the menu to include some gluten free pasta choices.  I was very impressed that not only were they offering gluten free penne, which is the usual selection for gluten free pasta when dining ou,t they also had gluten free spaghetti.  I failed to order the salad without croutons and my waitress remembered for me.  The manager served my gluten free pasta plate and twice asked for my input on the dish.  The food was good as was the service.  I will be eating their again.
<review# 28,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/24/2014,10/29/2014,7,9,1,2,1>I really liked this place.  Paid an impromptu visit while on a last minute trip to Chattanooga.  My nails were a mess. Had some old acrylic underlay with some gel on top.  I had no appointment but they worked me in, gave me a bottled water, spoke perfect English and were very thorough and detailed.  My nails look beautiful now--despite walking in with lots of chips and breakage.  Added plus:  at the end of the gel manicure, they put lotions on my hands and spent time massaging my hands and pressure points.  I thought I'd fall asleep right then and there!

<review# 31,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/18/2012,10/26/2014,1,13,3,3,3>I'm not what you'd call a "buffet afficionado" -- that's a tough gig for a longtime vegetarian -- but the buffet at Sitar is excellent.   About 3/8 of the available fare is vegeterian-friendly,; all of it is fresh and of good quality.  In fact, so far everything I've tried here has been tasty enough that I'd eat it again.The buffet price is excellent and so far the lunchtime crowds haven't been too bad.  the staff is very friendly and the location is convenient if you work anywhere downtown or on the North Shore.Good Indian food, as with most ethnic foods, is difficult to find in the south.  Sitar stands up to Indian restaurants in much more food-friendly cities; this one is a keeper.
<review# 32,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2014,10/25/2014,8,22,3,5,2>This place is totally "badass" as the boyfriend put it! Very informative and polite staff. We asked for a tri-tip which was not in the case and the butcher cut it fresh for us, right in front of us! Very clean establishment and fresh products. If you're looking for a farm to fork type of place look no further! All meats are natural! That means NO hormones, no GMOs, etc! REAL MEAT! They also have fresh eggs, cheeses, and deli meats. We got a pound of back bacon which does not have nitrates or any other preservatives. He even told us how to cook it for the best results. We will definitely become regulars at this butcher shop!
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/12/2014,10/24/2014,3,13,1,3,3>This is one of my favorite places to eat in Chattanooga. Go here if you have a chance. I usually get the pupusas or the Black Bean Tostadas. The guacamole is different than most places', but a must to try with the plantain chips. The complimentary sauces are delicious. I usually finish them myself.
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2014,10/23/2014,0,1,2,1,2>I have no idea how anyone has given this place a bad review. This was the first breakfast I have had in 7 years that came close to the one I had at the Palace Cafe in New Orleans. The atmosphere is very nice and homey feeling. There are some tables set up between oversized easy chairs overlooking the kitchen area if you like to watch the action, or a patio area to enjoy the weather. I had the omnivore's breakfast pie with the goat cheese grits. Both components of the meal were so good I had to make my wife stop eating her breakfast to try them. The meal started with complimentary biscuits that were perfectly light and buttery, served with house made blueberry preserves and honey. Maybe the previous poor reviews were from vacationing northerners who were upset not to find bagels and lox on the menu. Who knows? Try this place. It will be all worth your time.
<review# 35,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2013,10/22/2014,0,15,2,2,2>Purchased strawberry lemonade cupcakes and a brownie. Brownie was excellent. Liked the cupcake also but the brownie rocked. Staff very friendly will definetly be back
<review# 36,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2014,10/21/2014,2,23,2,4,2>What a great find! Cleveland is rife with chain restaurants and while there is comfort in that sometimes, eating food that isn't on every other plate in town is more what I seek. Great choices, fresh, tasty, and in a cute environment! Great service, too. Coffee was good and they serve real half and half instead of the fake creamer. We stay in Cleveland a couple of times a year and will definitely skip the free hotel breakfast to eat here instead. Yum!
<review# 37,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/13/2012,10/20/2014,6,242,4,4,2>I'm told this is the largest non-auto Honda dealership in the U.S. and it certainly feels like it when you walk inside their giant warehouse. I couldn't believe the selection. Motorcycles of every variety: cruisers, street fighters, motorcross, trail, racing, crotch rockets, etc. Four wheelers, side by sides, personal watercraft, scooters and more. They also have a good selection of accessories (helmets, bike upgrade parts) and it looked like a decent sized repair department. Every Saturday they seem to have an event going on. Somebody is barbecuing outside (often a bike club) and sometimes a radio station is there. I've spoken with a few sales guys and they have been very friendly and helpful without being pushy. Prices seemed good.The only negative I can think of is that this place is that it's in the hood. I wouldn't travel to that location after dark. It's in an odd, out-of-the-way spot, too. It's not on a main road but down some beat up old road in an industrial part of town. But once you're there, it's a great store.

<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/11/2012,10/18/2014,66,187,7,5,5>I consider myself a doughnut connoisseur. (So do my pants which all appear to be getting smaller?) The chocolate creme filling doughnut I had the other day from Koch's was THE BEST doughnut I have ever eaten. I adore how they seal all their doughnuts with a nice thin layer of perfect glaze. The retro no-frills ambience of the place suits the bakery's fare, which transports us back to a time when baking with margarine would have been considered sacrilege. They could probably afford to throw a few more tables and chairs in and really make the place cozy, but my guess is that their chief order of business is being a purveyor of excellent cookies, cakes and doughnuts. I am in deep trouble now that I know how accessible this bakery is on the outskirts of the Southside. Deep fried, deep kind of trouble.

Our waiter was super helpful in going through the menu, and he made himself available for any questions we had.We started with the garlic knots, which were good - they weren't the best bread apitizer I've ever had, but you really can't mess up too much on garlic bread. I'd get them again, nonetheless.We ended up ordering the Drunken Pig - and it was delicious. I'd definitely try out one of their neapolitan pizzas next time.Everything came out quick and hot, and not terrible on the wallet either - about $24.I'd go back!

<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/28/2012,10/13/2014,16,27,4,4,3>TLDR: These folks roast their own coffee and cacao beans from their family's farm in Guatemala.  The hot chocolate and chocolate tort are divine.  The tortas, mole, and guacamole are authentic and tasty.  Eat here and skip the cookie cutter mexican places.Full Review:We came on a Sunday afternoon.  The restaurant is in a building shared with an empty space.  The parking is sort of small on the side of the restaurant but there appears to be more around the empty side of the building if it's needed.  The front of the building leaves a little to be desired in terms of presentation.We almost didn't go in, because the hours on the door said they were closed from 2 to 5.  The owner who was in his car outside came over to us and told us they were in fact open from lunch to early dinner close at 9.  The inside is a totally different feel from the outside. It feels like being inside a hacienda, with adobe walls painted in bright colors.  What later turned out to be our server took us down the hall to the dining room.  There is an interesting display in the hall of how cacao beans become chocolate.  We found out that the owner's (incidentally the man who told us the restaurant was open) family has a coffee and cacao farm in Guatemala.  They roast and prepare the chocolate and coffee.We were seated in a corner booth.  There were only two other people in the restaurant, which was to be expected given the hour.  The server (also the hostess) advised us on the sections of the menu.  We ordered guacamole app, my wife ordered hot chocolate and papaya aguas frescas and I ordered the mango aguas frescas.The owner came out to make our guacamole table side.  He also chatted with us about the food, telling us that they wanted to offer authentic mexican cuisine.  I told him I was glad to see this available in Chattanooga, particularly tortas which are difficult to get done well in Tennessee.  He expressed concern that they were offering too much authentic mexican food and not enough standard American mexican dishes (chimichangas, fajitas, etc.).  He is apparently still adjusting the menu to make it more accessible.During this conversation he was making the guacamole.  He asked us for the spiciness level prior to making it, and spent a good deal of time and care, preparing it in a traditional stone bowl.  The care showed because this was damn fine guacamole.  Additionally the salsa that came before the guacamole was fresh and spicy.The aguas frescas were good but a little sweet for my tastes.  My wife loved them.  The hot chocolate was nothing short of magical.  It had ground chili powder in it giving a wonderful level of spiciness to the hot chocolate.I ordered the mole chicken (chocolate from the farm) which came with a side of spanish rice and sauteed squash and zucchini.  My wife ordered the ahogado torta.  Both of these were absolutely fantastic.  The chicken was moist and the mole was rich and chocolatey.  Not the best mole I've ever had, but the best I've had in Tennessee.  The squash and zucchini were simple, which was perfect.  They had a nice char and seasoned to balance with the inherent sweetness of the vegetables.  The rice was mild but totally good.The torta was awesome.  The bread was crusty, and the chicken was flavorful.  The sandwich was served with the cut sides down in the broth, which was also fantastic.  The broth made the cut side of the sandwich soggy but flavorful.  My wife wasn't crazy about the soggy parts, so I gladly got rid of them for her.  These bites were awesome.  She enjoyed the rest of the sandwich greatly.We were utterly full halfway through the entrees, but we persevered, finishing the rest of the meal.  We couldn't pass up the chocolate tart with house made pomegranate ice cream, though, so we ordered it to go.  We ate this later and it was just as great as the rest of the meal.All of this was 45 dollars, which was a great value in my opinion.  A couple of points where they could improve is by offering more vegetarian and kid-friendly options.  Also, I'm not sure why, but they offer no alcohol of any time.  It's kind of strange.Honestly, though, it's obvious that these people take great pride in what they are doing and it shows through and through in the food.  The hot chocolate alone would be worth going in here.  But then there are also the authentic tortas and fantastic mole.  Even the guacamole was fresh, flavorful, and chunky in the traditional style.  These people roast their o

As always, you should keep in mind that people rarely go online to write a compliment, but will rush to complain...so take everything with a grain of salt.EASILY some of the best, consistent BBQ in chattanooga. Are there better places? Yes. Are those places I will go? Not usually. Here's why:Nooga Q is:1. FAST (I place a to-go order every day. Its always ready in 5 minutes)2. REASONABLE (on average 25% cheaper than standard prices)3. TASTY (I challenge you to order their BRISKET, which is really hard to find at other places! $6 for a sandwhich PILED HIGH with thick, juicy, cooked to perfection beef brisket! Yum!!! I get it every day, and will continue to do so if they keep things the same)4. The owner and her waitresses are HOT. But don't hit on her, shes married to a coast guard guy (thanks for your service). Can't help but mention that though.You won't be disappointed! Skip over those lowball reviews and I think you'll agree!
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/6/2011,10/11/2014,5,7,1,3,1>This is one of my favorite places to go when I eat out. Definitly the only place that comes to mind when I want sushi. The prices are reasonable and the selection is good. Ive been eating here for a while now and just recently learned that there are a few specialty rolls on the menu that aren't on the paper you make your selection on. So if you want to see them you have to ask for the sushi menu. My favorite rolls to date here are the volcano (a must have), potato chip, spicy tuna, philly, and hot and crunchy. I've tried others and I don't think I've had any that I didn't like at least. I will agree with a previous review about the spider roll. I love them but theirs has never impressed me so I eat the ones I know I love.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/31/2013,10/10/2014,5,26,1,3,>...aaaand then for the real review of Quality Tire Center...One of the biggest hassles of moving to a new city is finding a trustworthy auto repair shop. Whether your problem is no garage, no time, or no know-how, you have to put a lot of trust in your local wrencher. I can change the oil but that's about it, so if I'm told my "differential is shot" or that my brakes need to be bled, it's a game of faith until it becomes trust. I've used Quality Tire twice now; once to have the tires balanced and oil changed on the hybrid (there is a ton of annoying bodywork on the bottom). This was the litmus test and QTC passed. Tire balancing was perfect and the oil change, rotation, and balancing was less than the last 15 minute job done at a random quick shop. Those Valvoline/Jiffy Lube shops do what you need, but I'd pay more to not have to repeat that I don't need new wipers, air cleaners, etc. In the case of QTC, I paid less for more work and less hassle.After the great/cheap/easy job on the Honda, I chose QTC to install a new suspension on my Jeep. Here's an area of auto repair where they could really fleece you if they wanted. However, they did a great job (including final front-end alignment) and the hourly total is almost exactly what manufacturers recommend. Again, they could easily tack on a few hours, but they didn't. Quality work can be seen/felt, but the trust that your mechanic won't overcharge you has to be earned. Although irrelevant dog hater won't be back, I and my friends will be.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/11/2014,10/9/2014,14,10,1,1,1>Great beer prices. Great food and well portioned sizes- believe it or not they have a great steak at this dive bar Great wait staff. Karaoke starts at 930 every night if that's your thing. 3 pool tables and 4 dart boards upstairs.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/4/2012,10/8/2014,1,29,1,3,1>Crazy how polarizing this place is.  I've been there many times and I must admit that it is always different.  I've seen other reviews complaining about the server being high but good lord if they weren't high I 'd send them back and ask for a server that was.  I will also admit I have a soft spot for the barrel as it was one of the first places my wife and I went when I was courting her.  The good... It is a very unique place and you will not find anything about it that reminds you of a chain restaurant.  The sandwiches and burgers are great straight forward American bar food.  I really enjoy the Reuben.  It isn't anything that hasn't been done before but the pastrami is cooked on the flat top and the combination of kraut, dressing and rye bread is about perfect.  The fried pickles are also delicious.  So if you want a good sandwich and a take on the bar and grill experience not honed by some marketing executive then try this place out.  And, yes it is smoky as hell, but enjoy the deck in the spring or fall if that bothers you and you can dine peeking out from the tops of trees.Oh and lastly, it is next to patten towers which houses many variously disabled people and I am not making fun, but there are always interesting people in the streets while you dine.  I dig it because really at the end of it all it takes all kinds to make the world go round.
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,10/7/2014,27,12,,2,2>Dr. Peter Lund is the best. He is very thorough with everything, examining your injury and giving all the possible options of treatment. I like that he even talks about possible future treatments after I have another followup appointment.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2014,10/6/2014,0,12,1,2,1>Big thing to note...be prepared to wait at the top to come down.  We waited for almost 2 hours at the top.  The crowd wasn't huge but there are two separate lines and they alternate loaded on the train cars.  It's takes way too long.  Other than that...this is so much fun.  Our three kids, 16, 9 and 7 loved it.  It's about a 10 minute ride...round trip if you like at $15 a head.  We bought the triple play (includes ruby falls and rock city) to save some dough.  You get to see some awesome views and take a fun ride.  At the bottom you can explore St. Elmo on foot.  We walked around a bit and ate lunch at Mojo Burrito.  We only waited about 15 minutes in line to come back up.  They sale pics for $20 if you are so inclined.  Get it...inclined.  Excellent all around day.
<review# 52,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/11/2014,10/5/2014,32,48,1,1,1>Best buffet for the $ in Chattanooga. Good for a business lunch because it's quite. Easy to get to and parking is usually fairly adequate considering the location. Great quality considering how fast you can be in and out also. Of course the selling point to most is the fact you can eat a greatest and as much as you want for under 15.00. Menu usually changes daily and Sundays are the best!
<review# 53,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/27/2014,10/4/2014,39,19,1,1,>Love this place. The food has always been great. It is great to finally have a place in Cleveland that serves Thai food. I have been waiting for years for a place like this to open. This place is always packed during lunch time. I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant. It is also quick which is great at lunch time. The owners remember me every time that I go to eat. They have also always been very friendly and have also offered to make any Thai dish even if it isn't on the menu.
<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/6/2012,10/3/2014,16,11,1,5,1>Great service!I've owned Apple products for several years, and in the past I've had several experiences with getting repairs completed by Geniuses at the Apple Store. Normally I would go to the one in Knoxville. Well recently I needed my iMac repaired under AppleCare warranty. I called Apple and they said I could get it repaired at the MacAuthority since it was much closer to where I live. I was skeptical, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I am so glad that I did. They ended up replacing the display and the hard-drive, all covered by AppleCare. The repair was quick. The staff were friendly and knowledgable. The icing on the cake: they transferred all of my data from the old hard-drive to the new completely gratis. That alone save about 5 hours of restoring data. I will certainly use this store again. In fact I will use them over the Apple Store when possible. They are that good.
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/13/2014,10/2/2014,2,12,1,1,1>Try their Breakfast Bar!  They have the buffet on Friday - Sunday from 8:00an - 1:00pm. They have cat head biscuits (I'm talking as big as your fist!) On the bar they have sausage, bacon, chicken strips, ham, eggs, oatmeal, grits, gravy, French toast sticks, donuts, cinnamon rolls & fruit. The price is reasonable @ $5.99. Not as much options as Golden Corral, but about $3 less cost.

<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/14/2014,9/30/2014,20,63,1,2,2>This is not your place if you're looking for tons of classes, like yoga or spinning. Nor is it your place if you're looking for a sauna, towels or chichi body products in the locker room. Also, don't expect a ton of staff and/or trainers... You won't find them here. Though all these things are nice, they cost $$$ and honestly, I just don't need the extras. I need a gym with well-maintained machines, open 24/7 to accommodate my always crazy schedule and at an affordable price. Now THAT'S what you'll find here.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/6/2014,9/29/2014,0,10,1,2,2>Mmmm...delicious.  We started  with the green bean appetizer, which admittedly was battered and fried, but it was more like a tempura batter typical of a Chinese restaurant.  The green beans were long and thin, like you would get at an upscale restaurant alongside the main course.  Anyway, they were delicious.  It came with ranch dressing for dipping (tasted house made), but I ate them without it.  I ordered the salmon, which was prepared perfectly.  My husband had the chicken alfredo, which he said was excellent.  We ordered three vegetables that our two granddaughters shared.  The portions were generous and I really liked the fact that nothing was oversalted or greasy.  The green beans that came with my salmon, which were different than the appetizer--more like what you would expect a side dish of green beans to be--were the only item that could have been cooked a few minute less.  They were still tasty, though.  The biscuits were heavenly!  We were tourists, but we could tell that most of the diners were local.  We will definitely eat here again the next time we are in Chattanooga!

Leave it for the folks who want an enjoyable meal. Such good service & such good food. Team service and terrific food. Cold beer and golden margaritas. Fresh chips and delicious salsa served in a casual (bars on the windows) atmosphere. Don't let the exterior fool you. Dining rooms full of happy patrons saying "mmm" can't be wrong. EAT HERE!!!
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/9/2014,9/27/2014,1025,471,4,6,8>Great first step for organized Yelpers in Chattanooga. This is too large city with so much nightlife not to have little Yelpers trolling the city and sharing their experiences with our group. Stephanie T, choice a nice place that few of us had heard of so we all experienced a very cool place in North Chatt. Nice sampler layout and the sangria was excellent.   Even had mortal combat between GE and Whirlpool with Sarah joining the Yelpers and my background with Whirlpool. Overall a great night. Looking forward to our next event.
<review# 61,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/1/2014,9/26/2014,52,247,4,4,4>Now named T-Macs since everyone called them that anyway.  The remodel and expansion are complete and it was very successful.  Love the new look and the new menu items.  The queso dip is still the best in town.  The new flat breads are excellent and 96 beers on tap are just awesome.  Service was fast and friendly for us.  They have an entirely new staff so I suspect this can be hit and miss until they get a bit more experience.  We have been a couple of times and had great service.  TV's are everywhere and this is a great place to catch any sporting event you could care to see,  Lots of patio seating and great for groups.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,5/21/2014,9/25/2014,38,99,6,17,8>Anyone notice how there aren't many reviews from Chattanooga locals? That's because we avoid this place like the plague. Which is a shame!Aretha's is a fun little dive with fairly decent food. But the service is deplorable. Because of this uneven mix of food and service, the stars are split down the middle.The food is usually really good and the pancakes are huge. (You can buy the mix at stores, though.) Just a note - don't try to customize your plate. It won't happen. But still, everything comes out tasty. Now about why we now boycott Aretha's. My last trip to Aretha's was on a Thursday morning. We were only the second table there, and the server rolled her eyes when she saw us walk in and sit at the bar. After about a 10 minute wait, she brought menus and took our orders. I literally watched the staff hang out in the kitchen for 20 minutes pounding Red Bulls and Monsters before even firing up the griddle and cracking eggs. Once our plates were ready, I watched them sit there for another 5 minutes or so before our server brought them out...without saying a word. She never came back to check on us or bring us our bill. We finally just put some cash on the table for what we thought was about right and left. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day...but we haven't been back since.

<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,9/23/2014,64,311,1,1,>This place is as authentic as one can possibly get for Mexican food. The food was pretty similar to what I had when I visited Mexico. As the culture dictates, it is not vegetarian friendly although the rice and beans were delicious. My friend had the carnitas and carne asada tacos. Just like a true taco should be. Corn tortillas, meat, onions and carnitas. None of that Taco Bell inspired nonsense. It most certainly is a shack. A must visit shack for anybody that wants authentic tacos or delicious beans and rice.Oh. And the prices were ridiculously cheap. I am not sure how much they charged before but they are still pretty darn cheap.

The fried chicken is awesome, as are all the other entrees. The salad bar is well stocked, the veggies and entrees vary throughout the day and evening. My only "issues" I have with Wally's is that they're now closed on Sundays - wish they were open 365/24/7. Love all the waitresses, too - they are all absolutely awesome - they take good care of their customers, and keep the tea, coffee, etc. flowing all the time you're there.
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/25/2013,9/20/2014,29,75,1,2,1>The greeting when we walked in was amazing.  I thought the guy was playing around, but he really just talked that fast in a thick accent.  It only got better when the waiter started talking.  He sounds like Herbert from Family Guy.  The entertainment value alone was worth going in.  The food pushed it over the top.  I got the prime rib sandwich.  The meet was delicious and overflowing the bun.  I was told they grow their own tomatoes outside the restaurant. I followed the other reviews and topped it off with the coconut cake.  If you don't have this while you are there, YOU ARE WRONG!  It was so light and delicious.  The piece they gave me was huge!  If I'm around, I'm down... to go back.

The Bruschetta is amazing if you like lots of tomatoes and garlic. The geek salad is high quality and topped with fresh Greek olives and feta cheese. The spaghetti with meat sauce is a classic favorite and the bread sticks with olive oil are delicious. The price is very reasonable for the area and the staff have always been friendly.

I've tried the ribs (Memphis dry are my favorite, but the wet rubs are also great), pulled pork, chicken, and ham, and all are excellent. Selection of mild original, hot, and Carolina sweet sauces. Best sides are calico beans and sweet-potato chips. My VERY picky 7-year-old LOVES their chicken strips and fries.

Mojo is and always will be Chattanooga fresh dining at its best for me. I only ever order the Elmo burrito (vegan), but have had several omni friends who eat the Mojo and love it. All of the ingredients taste like they came straight from the garden. The guacamole and salsa are always made fresh. Their fresh jalapenos will kick your ASS. The atmosphere is SO old Chattanooga kitsch.  This is my favorite location to come to, but the other Mojos on Jenkins and Dayton blvd are good too. Can't go wrong. I strongly recommend it.
<review# 74,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/14/2013,9/13/2014,0,10,,2,2>I love this place. The daily specials are great and if you are in here on a Friday I highly recommend the catfish. Prices are reasonable. Service can vary depending on the time of day and who you get as a waitress. Recommended for families and someone wanting good home cooked food.
<review# 75,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/26/2014,9/12/2014,5,12,,4,5>I love this place. There just aren't enough GOOD bars in Chattanooga. This place has an awesome vibe, with a speak-easy feel to it. I really look forward to visiting this place in the winter time to hunker down in the basement bar and warm myself with a dark stout beer.My only complaints at this moment are due to its newness (e.g., limited draft selection and food selection). But these will get better with thime.
<review# 76,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,9/11/2014,1,7,1,2,4>My husband and I stopped in last night after hearing about this place from a family member, and we were not disappointed. We ordered two lattes, a mocha, and a french press, trying both of their regular (not decaf) coffees of the day. Their prices are competitive and reasonable, especially for the taste. We really liked everything we got, but I would recommend the french press.Their current coffee source is pretty local, Batdorf and Bronson Coffee Roasters in Atlanta, Ga. While they may not roast their own beans here at Wired like some other local shops, they aren't missing anything in taste. I found their staff to be polite, helpful, and friendly-and they aren't coffee snobs like some places! The decor was very well done in a modern industrial style, with many comfy areas to choose from. There is plenty of parking, and nice outdoor seating with music and a fountain too.I would highly recommend a trip out here, whether it be for a quick cup to go, or you're bringing a book for the long haul.
<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/1/2013,9/10/2014,10,19,,1,2>Bangkok Spicy...Bangkok Spicy...Bankok Spicy.  Trust me.  This is their signature dish and it is magical!  My good friend remarked "this is the best meal I've ever had in my life!"  If you want a light meal and want to pay more, get the shrimp but the best bang for your buck is to select chicken Bangkok Spicy.  You can't go wrong.  They are a little inconsistent on heat levels so if you don't like heat stay away from anything above a 2.  Service is usually pretty weak here (on the slow side), but the food is good.
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2014,9/9/2014,2,9,,2,2>What a great shop! My wife and I just finished our first visit here. The staff were very knowledgable and friendly. All the products are high quality. We love being able to buy in bulk - such as the Castille soap. We never heard of Good Fortune Soaps before but now that we have, we will definitely be back!
<review# 79,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2012,9/8/2014,9,32,,3,3>Went in on a Tuesday evening for some family time with a group of seven. The hostess was very sweet and quick about getting two tables put together for us. Tim and I were there with our moms, his step-dad and our two daughters. We'd heard the place had good steaks, good music, great waitresses and reasonable prices. Unfortunately, the steaks are only served on Friday and Saturday and Tuesdays they don't have live music either. Despite our disappointment, the place was still inviting and our waitress was very pleasant and good at her job. After checking out the menu, we ordered the fried pickles and mushrooms as our starters and they were typical fried snacks. We then ordered one pork plate, one chicken finger plate, one pork sandwich plate, a Cajun shrimp salad, and three plates of fried catfish with various sides. All the food was tasty and well cooked (except the macaroni and cheese which did not appear to be baked as listed in the menu and was soupy with overcooked noodles.) We ordered peach cobblers for dessert and it was also very yummy although at that point we couldn't finish them. We had some leftovers that we took with us because the portions were large and the food was worth taking home and having for lunch tomorrow. The prices were quite reasonable for seven people, two of which drank alcohol, and we had 2 appetizers and 3 desserts as well. Our waitress was on the ball and our drinks never went dry. We enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere and will definitely be going back again and hopefully catching some music next time.

<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/29/2014,9/6/2014,7,21,,1,2>Ok had to try out the cleveland tn. BBQ so far nice place first thing though a BBQ sandwich chips and a pickle 7.50 a little pricey I think had to pay an extra 1.50 to upgrade to potatoe salad so 9.00 not counting the drink yikes! Well food is here service has been fast and friendly and luckily at least the sides and sandwich is large so makes me feel a little better about my expense. Well let's dig in and I will give you the rest of the details. Well have to agree with a previous review very dry meat disappointing but what can you expect from the state the Tennessee vols are from full of disappointments.  Also got some baked beans I agree they are canned beans doctored up with brown sugar. Wow such a nice place great service but below average food I will return to see if just a bad day just wish yelp had a system that let you rate by category because it's hard to give a low rating with such great service.

The interior gives of the vibe of a whole new establishment, the music is at a comfortable level, it's is generally a welcoming place to eat. This evening we came for the dinner service and the portion sizes were well within the price range of the dishes and the flavors were off the scale. Asian food can excel or flop very easy and today Fulin's soared!

They have different specials every day and always fresh.I am not a big fan of the type bun they seem to use on every sandwich but doesn't keep me from ordering them anyway!Always friendly service.
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/13/2013,9/2/2014,1,18,2,9,2>Point Park is the main Chattanooga portion of the Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. The "headquarters" is the Chickamauga Battlefield, about fifteen miles from Point Park. For some brief context (I'll try not to be dull here) Point Park commemorates the Battle of Lookout Mountain, Nov. 24th, 1863 -- often called the Battle Above the Clouds. This was part of the broader Chickamauga-Chattanooga campaign for control of Chattanooga.The park itself is situated at the highest point of Lookout Mountain, 2400 feet. You can drive up or take the Incline Railway. I suggest driving, unless you're uncomfortable on the winding mountain roads. Once at the Point, you should check for free parking behind the visitors center before surrendering your quarters to the street meters.The visitors center is small but impressive, with a book store/gift shop, interactive exhibits, and the original, recently-restored painting "Battle Above the Clouds," which Union Gen. Joseph Hooker commissioned James Walker to execute. It consumes an entire huge wall.The chief attraction is the park itself. There's a $3.00 entry fee for adults; it's better to pay in the visitors center, as the outdoor fee machine is temperamental. Regardless of whether you like history, the park is well worth exploring. It offers incredible panoramic views of the valley, the Tennessee River, and Chattanooga. Hike down to Ochs Observatory for more views, and also go in the Observatory's miniature museum for some good exhibits, including some devoted to the area's archaelogical heritage.If you have time, the park has quite a few walking trails, including one that leads to Cravens House. Robert Cravens was a wealthy industrialist of the 19th century, and his home-site is worth a visit. The trails are steep and rocky (I once twisted an ankle on them), so be cautious.Back at the visitors center, if you go next door, you'll find the Battles for Chattanooga Museum. This is a touristy, pricey shop but has some neat stuff and a small selection of Civil War weaponry and artifacts.Point Park is absolutely worth the bit of time and effort it requires to reach. The only caveat is that you should go on a clear day. When the weather is poor, visibility can be reduced to almost zero, and the roads and paths can be treacherous. More than most places, weather should play a role in whether or not you visit here.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/11/2013,9/1/2014,3,63,,1,1>I love the Chattanooga-area institution that is Lake Winnie! Vintage rides and a carnival atmosphere make this amusement park as quaintly magical for me today as it did when my dad took me as a little kid. The park's many new rides have added some greater appeal to big kids and adults, and the park's wooden coaster (the Cannon Ball) is a great ride for kids (or adults!) to use as a first toll roller coaster!!If you visit LW fully aware that she is a small, classic style, family-oriented amusement park, you'll likely love her for all that she is. There is no pretending to be anything else! The quality of the base park, the staff, and the consistency should all garner a 5/5, but I had to dock a star...Why?The addition of the Soakya! Water slides have come with a $5 up-charge to the all day ride pass, so now one adult's entry + an all-day stamp costs $31...6Flags over GA is $36, so the price\ value ratio is rapidly decreasing.Tips:Summer is hot and muggy here, so plan to stay cool using the parks shady areas, mister zone, or picnic areas to rehydrate.Go in the evening on the open til 10 nights if you have young ones. The likes are shorter and temps are better. Check when the water park will open and close; its hours differ from the main park.Use the COKE CAN coupon (shop anywhere in 'nooga and you'll find one) to get the BOGO all day ride pass. It's a much bigger value than the McDonald's or Sunbeam bread $5 off.
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,8/31/2014,567,567,3,5,5>First of all, admission is totally free. This is a Great Clvil War park with more than 600 stone and bronze monuments. They were erected by Chattanooga and Chickamauga veterans between 1890 and 1930 under the direction of Park Commissioners at that time. The funding was provided by the U.S Government, states, and veterans organizations.Second, and most important I would recommend visiting the Chickamauga Battlefield Visitor Center to begin your visit of the Park.  The visitor center is open daily from 8:30 am to 5pm. Inside this building is a theatre that shows a 23 minute film of the Battle of Chickamauga.  Also, while here, pick up your free brochure at the Park Rangers counter before heading out into the Park.Now, one fact I learned is that this is the Nation's first National Military Park. There are artillery battery monuments throughout the park as well as numerous canons on display. Also, there are metal tablet markers signifying Confederate soldiers or Union soldiers. The Blue is for the The Union Army and The Red is for Confederate Army.One feature of this park is a 7 mile auto tour of the park. The tour stops are numbered 1 through 8 and you start by calling a phone number which is 585-672-2619 and clicking on the corresponding number depending on your location in the park. As far as history is concerned, there were over 34,000 men killed or injured here on this battlefield.  There were exactly 33,624 casualties on this battlefield. Of this number, there were 16,170 Union casualties and 18,454 confederate casualties. One feature of this Battlefield you don't want to miss is the Wilder Monument Tower.  The monument tower is 85 feet high but there are 136 steps leading up to the top of the observation deck.The Wildlife in the park is abundant.  You can see deer every where like along the sides of the road as well as in the woods. I saw over 7 Eagles at the top of two trees beside each other.Outdoor activities. Well, they have many.  You can ride your bikes, ride horses, jog, walk, take pictures, fly your toy airplanes, look for wildlife, ride your motorcycle, and they have Civil War reenactments. As far as reenactments are concerned, the Vice President has come here just for it. If he comes, they must be good. Just call or visit the visitors center for schedules.In summary, Chickamauga Battlefield was the largest Confederate Victory in the Western Theatre.  Stop at the Visitor center and watch the film and browse the gun museum. Then, get a brochure and drive the 7 mile auto tour route.

<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2013,8/28/2014,6,9,2,4,2>This place has been here since the 60's with the same basic menu.They have BBQ shoulder, ribs, bbq beef, chopped weinie plates.It is all carry out and they do not take credit cards.Fast service, great food, Its easy to order, get served and get out. I have called ahgead for bigger orders and found it to always be ready.I'm very fond of the chopped weinie plates. Its a bbq/chili mix with chopped up hot dog. It was something my father got me hooked on at an early age.You dont stay in business in the same spot for well over 40 years and not be doing something right.The hot sauce is just that HOT. They will offer it to you and it has a zing.Try it you'll like it.

<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/18/2013,8/26/2014,15,14,4,2,1>Sing It Or Wing It is what it is. It's a karaoke joint that has good drinks and good food to snack on while you're being serenaded by people who want to be the next American Idol. You will be around drunk people. You will possibly become one of the drunk people.The song selection has way too many songs to choose from. Most of them are country ballads but what are you going to do, this is Tennessee. If there was one complaint I'd have it would be that when you are performing you can't hear yourself singing. You can hear the music, but the way they either have the mics or the speakers, you can't hear yourself. But other than that I had a fun time celebrating with my friends.
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/8/2014,8/25/2014,5,4,,2,3>We went here for the first time today. Great beer, food, and service. They even brought samples of a few beers without us asking. They don't have a huge selection,but we enjoyed our choices. I had Hoegaarden, always do if it is available where I am, my gf had a standard Blue Moon. Lol! We shared the potato cakes nachos and they were excellent and plentiful! We both highly recommend the Brewhaus.

Took us forever to figure out where the actual restaurant was, hardly any blunt signage to a newcomer.. We sat at the bar and had a couple drinks... Bartender was super nice. Barefoot wine (bottom of the barrel) was way overpriced, imported beer priced normal. Didn't eat the build your burger but will try it out next time we are looking for a burger joint.

Our service was excellent both at our table and the bar.  We will be back and highly recommend it.
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/26/2012,8/22/2014,13,8,1,3,3>My boyfriend and I chose Bluewater for a dinner with friends one weekend night. The restaurant was busy, but not just packed. We didn't have to wait at all. Fortunately, the boyfriend had been smart enough to make reservations for the four of us, and we were seated immediately upon arrival. Our server greeted us promptly and seemed very outgoing, friendly, and eager to please. After taking our drink orders, she gave us a few minutes to look over the menu.The server returned with our drinks. I had selected a Georgia peach martini, which was super sweet, just the way I like it. While our server was back with us, we ordered appetizers: salt and pepper calamari (with Thai ketchup) and tavern shrimp. Then we ventured to select our main course. This is where I discovered a dilemma...I had no idea what to order! Everything on the menu looked delicious, not to mention the additional daily specials that weren't on the basic menu. The server had told us upon arrival that all of the seafood at Bluewater Grille was fresh; nothing was frozen or prepared beforehand and then reheated. I finally settled on the grouper picatta.Our appetizers came out quickly. Everything was hot and delicious. I was a bit nervous about the tavern shrimp, since the menu mentioned that it was tossed in a "spicy creamy sauce" (I'm not into spicy foods so much), but the heat of the shrimp was mild, and they tasted delicious. The calamari was my favorite, though. Some places put so much breading on calamari that you can't actually taste the calamari itself, but Bluewater breads and seasons their calamari perfectly. They serve it with Thai ketchup...so yummy! It compliments the calamari perfectly. Our server also brought a basket of bread. It was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Perfect.Our main courses arrived just as we were finishing our appetizers. My grouper picatta looked scrumptious. It came with sides of rice pilaf and steamed summer vegetables, which I sampled before tasting my grouper. I was very impressed by the taste of the vegetables. They were seasoned perfectly, no additional salt or pepper needed, and while they were thoroughly cooked, they weren't mushy. The rice pilaf was also very tasty. The grouper was absolutely delicious. It was very lightly breaded and covered in a white wine, butter, lemon juice, and caper sauce. I was worried that the sauce would overpower the taste of the grouper, but my concerns were unfounded. Everything was perfect and delicious.Our server did a great job of keeping our drinks filled and ensuring that we were pleased with our meal. She also took our dessert order; I already knew what I wanted: Dolly's Triple Chocolate cake. The server brought out a huge piece for the four of us to share. Aside from my grandmother's chocolate cake, this might have been the best chocolate cake I've ever put in my mouth! It was moist, and very rich, and topped with a delicious fudge icing. It literally melted in my mouth. Words just can't describe how good this cake is! Don't leave Bluewater without having Dotty's Triple Chocolate Cake.If you're looking for a romantic spot for a date, or a trendy spot to socialize with friends, I would certainly recommend Bluewater. The service is great, the drinks are yummy, and the food is simply delicious. It also has modern, attractive decor and a cool, relaxed atmosphere. Bluewater Grille is THE spot for fresh, delicious seafood in Downtown Chattanooga.

I never post on Yelp, but felt the need for this place.
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,8/18/2014,5,4,1,1,1>The food is delicious and good quality. True, it may be a smidge pricey, but sometimes there's a price for quality. That's understandable, in my opinion. If you don't mind lesser quality, then you could easily go down to Wendy's or Five Guys or something and inhale a grease bomb instead.Delicious burgers. Awesome truffle fries. Very tasty veggie burger as well. I love that there are some legitimately good veggie options. Friendly service. Old-timey decor makes for a really neat atmosphere. Some great views of the Incline and Lookout, especially when dining on the front porch.Just all-around love this place and intend to go back regularly. And that is just a first impression.

I usually get a combo with taco, enchilda, and beans and rice. It's always a big portion and I leave feeling stuffed. Chips and salsa are good.Service is usually decent but I've had some hiccups. Such as them hammering a chair in the middle of the dining room. And one server who is usually a great one ignored us one time while talking to someone. And it sometimes takes a while to pay.Other than that I really enjoy the food they make and the atmosphere.UPDATE: After eating at some other Mexican restaurants in town I can't eat anywhere else but here! Easily the best Mexican food in town.

<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/11/2014,8/11/2014,70,178,9,10,8>I discovered this place by searching Google for a place to meet some family for a meal in Dayton.  We weren't sure what to expect but it was fantastic, so we've been back a couple times since!Quite a while ago this place changed it's name from Jacob Myers Deli to Jacob Myers Restaurant on the River.  While they still have the sandwiches everyone raves about, they have a full menu now including steaks, burgers and seafood!  Everyone that I've brought here has raved about the food.  I haven't had a bad dish yet!My favorite meal by far is the Black and Blue Steak. It's an 8 oz sirloin with cajun seasoning and served with their black and blue sauce on top.  This is so good, I could eat just that and die happy.  The steak is a great cut of meat, always cooked exactly how I ask for it, and it tastes oh so good.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.  It comes with two sides and a dinner roll and if you eat all that, you will be full!  If you like seafood, I've really enjoyed the fish and chips.  It's very light and crisp.  You can't go wrong there.My favorite appetizer is the fried green beans.  It comes with their "Boom Boom" sauce, which has a little kick to it.  The green beans are battered whole, so they look like french fries.  We tried to convince The fiancée's son that they were french fries... but he didn't buy it.  We did, however, manage to get him to eat one or two.  That's a major feat to get this one to even touch a vegetable!The restaurant is built on a hill, so if you have trouble climbing the hill, get someone to drop you off at the front door.  Parking is at a premium near the door.  Your best bet is to park in the dirt area at the bottom of the hill.  You are overlooking a river here too, so get a table by the window so you can see!This place is always busy, busy, busy!  But even though they are super busy the servers are always friendly and helpful with menu questions.  They keep your meal well placed and your drinks full, and they do it all with a smile.  I have no complaints about the service at all.Being that it's busy, it's also very loud inside.  Not much of the noise is restaurant noise, but people talking.  I don't know if the place echos or if people just feel the need to talk loud here, but be aware of that.  No quiet romantic meals here!I haven't had any of the desserts here, but they have a display case by the hostess stand and they all look so good.  I'm just always too full to even think about dessert!  Jacob Myers Restaurant is worth the drive from both Chattanooga or Knoxville.  You won't be sorry you came here.

Everything is amazing - the wings (OH the wings - smoked and then sauced - a wonderful combination); jalapeno hushpuppies (do they get any better than this?); rack of ribs (the BEST in Chattanooga in my opinion - fall of the bone, flavorful, yumminess); and finally, the bread pudding (which will leave you feeling intoxicated with all that wonderful bourbon sauce on top - oh my - amazing!).Perfect any time of year, but especially during warm summer days when the deck is open and you can sit outside, eat wings and ribs, sip sweet tea (or beer if you prefer), and look out over the water as you take the last bit of that bourbon bread pudding.

The staff was very kind, courteous, and prompt.  Not pushy but informative. And this was the first time I'd been in since they switched to waiter staff and service.  Even the owner came out at one point just to see how our experience was and to see if the food was ok. We ended up having a great conversation. I tried their new Raleigh Burger (fried egg, fried green tomato, and pimento cheese) it was delicious. And I hand my favorite sweet potato fries around... What a great meal.  Waiter even offered drinks to go and we didn't have to ask. Go check this place out.
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,8/6/2014,2,11,2,3,3>My first visit, parking lot was packed, that should tell you something. Inside is not that large but we were seated immediately. A VERY large selection of food to choose from. Didn't take long to get our meal. You get 1 meat and 3 vegetables. Portions are more than enough. I must have seen a half a dozen people getting 'to go' plates. Another large selection of deserts, really looked good but no way after the more than ample meal. Everyone was very nice, friendly and professional. The bill was $36 for 3 of us plus tip, 3 regular meals and drink. I would definitely recommend this establishment to others and plan to go back again myself.

Let me tell you... He was probably one of the best servers I've had in a long time, at any establishment! He was personable, friendly, and helpful. Being it was our first time there he was happy to answer questions and explain the menu items we had questions about. He was attentive, but not a nuisance. And best part, he kept our drinks full! He was very genuine and had passion for his job, which is refreshing to see!I had the lamb kabobs, b/f had the gyro, and his daughter had chicken Parmesan. My meal was delicious and filling. It came with two kabobs with nice big chunks of lamb that were perfectly cooked and not fatty at all! Veggies on the kabobs were cherry tomatoes, onions, and green bell peppers. It was served with pieces of pita bread, rice, and taziki (I don't know how to spell it). B/f said his gyro was good. It was definitely big and filling. He couldn't even finish it! The meat was yummy (I took a tiny piece of the meat) and nicely seasoned. I don't remember what his came with but he got a side order of fries. His daughter had the chicken parm and she said it was "yummy!" Being a picky teenager, that's a lot coming from her! My and b/f's daughter got cake to go. She had the chocolate and I had the strawberry. Mine was to die for. It was nice and moist, but not dense. Not overly sweet but enough to give in to that pesky sweet tooth! Overall, I would recommend  Acropolis! The staff was friendly, atmosphere was great, food was delicious, and the cake was yummy too! Next time, I'll have to take pics!
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2014,7/30/2014,12,157,2,3,3>We heard this place had 'authentic' Mexican food. So authentic usually means no combo plates and everything covered in some type of red, green, or white sauce. We saw some of the plates people had and what we heard was correct, very authentic and delicious.The place is pretty basic in it's decor, you don't feel like you're walking into every Mexican restaurant you have ever seen. The staff was pleasant and didn't hover.I had a chorizo torta and it was awesome. So awesome in fact that there wasn't a need for the Alka Seltzer intervention and hour or so later!The parking is street parking with a very small lot behind the restaurant. We'll definitely go back and try something else.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/20/2014,7/29/2014,0,2,2,3,2>Best coffee shop in town- friendly baristas, great coffee, delicious food. The ambiance is wonderful, too! Their breakfast sandwiches and pastries are always fresh and tasty. Highly recommend a stop here for anyone in town!
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/7/2013,7/28/2014,12,2,2,2,2>This is hands down one of my favorite bars in the city.  It's right downtown and has an amazing porch.  It can get pretty smoky inside on busy nights but has fantastic bar food and great beer selection. They also have the most fun trivia in town every Wednesday night!
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2013,7/27/2014,6,12,2,2,2>Best chicken and gnocchi soup in town. Plus their white bean and turnip greens are the bomb!!! Their staff is always so polite and the atmosphere is a great place to meet for lunch. Salad bar is loaded up w good stuff and their dessert bars are great!!!
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/24/2012,7/26/2014,4,13,2,3,2>Loved this place! I haven't had a whole lot of experience eating Indian food, but this place is my new favorite. The aromas and different flavors are awesome. The service is great and our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful when we didn't know what to get.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/25/2014,7/25/2014,1,41,2,4,4>My wife and I had the pleasure of eating here.  We were set to go to Dipped Fresh when we found out it was no longer there.  Sad, so we had to find another lunch location when I remembered Opa. I had been eyeing it until it opened, and the stars aligned for us to try it out.  So we get in and sit down and was immediately greeted by the excited owner.  This guy is authentic Greek and loves to share with the customers his enthusiasm for food.  He lively told us what everything was while we drank our warm pomegranate/orange tea.  So we decided on Greek Lasagna and a version of the lasagna without pasta.  While we waited the owner gave us a flatbread with hummus and yogurt type dip. They were delicious and also the salad that proceeded, but note the Greek salad does not have lettuce.  It is cut up tomatoes, bell peppers, onions, and cucumbers topped with a delicious dressing and 3.5inch long feta cheese rectangle.  When the food came out I could equate it to 5lbs of food.  All the food was great and we only could eat half but we NEEDED dessert!  so the owner hooked us up by throwing a piece of baklava on top of a slice of chocolate cake..........uh! yeah! This was redonkulous.  All in all a great place to eat, bring an appetite but there are smaller options we plan on trying next time we go.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/1/2014,7/24/2014,4,2,2,5,2>On my Top-5 for Nooga for sure.  I've only been once but they absolutely hit it out of the park for everyone at my table. Highly recommend: The Salmon, the mac-n-cheese (trust me), anything steak! The Okra & Pimento cheese appetizer is amazing!The food, oh the food! Everyone at our table ordered something different and everyone's entrees were excellent!  Highly recommend everything about this place!
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2011,7/23/2014,37,8,5,4,3>I am so obsessed with this place. Best chicken in the world. My favorite bartender (Gerald!), heavy pours, a very interesting jukebox which may or may not be possessed (Everything from the Pixies and Portishead to Clarence Carter and Billie Holiday).  Have a birthday coming up? Well on the sweet gold velvet wall paper lies a happy birthday banner thats up year round. I wish they would open up the back ballroom again so bands could book shows there (Of Montreal, Jason Isbell, and so many others have graced the stage) or maybe be open Sunday through Wednesday in addition to their normal schedule of 5pm- ? Thursday through Saturday. PS only newbies park on the street (MLK). Park around back.
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/22/2013,7/22/2014,2,38,2,2,2>A very nice dining experience. We liked: ambiance, service, food, nice beer selection. Disliked: nothing. Together, our family enjoyed the spaghetti special (with Benton's bacon & pink sauce), angel hair (with gulf shrimp & soffrito sauce) and mushroom pizza. The restaurant looked very nice with a contemporary look. Warm features include the wood fired pizza oven, long bar and 300 year old wood trim. We will definitely come back to Alleia.

It was so relaxing to be pampered. We had it catered and had the whole place to ourselves. I would highly recommend this business for a fun girls day!
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2013,7/19/2014,7,86,,3,1>Cool place!!  I went here as a child and never forgot it so I took my partner here for our anniversary and was reminded of how neat it is. Forgot how narrow "fat man's squeeze" is and there is now a restaurant on the top of the mtn. I am still wondering how they pulled that off. This is a place everyone should see at least once in their life. To see a natural place like this in its natural state still is incredible. Also, if you go, try to catch the Birds of prey show. It is great!! I think it shows at 11, 2, 4. I know for sure the first show is at 11:00.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/7/2013,7/18/2014,0,6,,1,>I have been to Korea and the food reminded of the food I had Korea.   I was expecting an Americanized food like Chinese restaurants, but this wasn't so.  The small appetizers that I received with my food, kimchee and different veggies and noodles, was just like you would get at Korean restaurant in South Korea.  If you want traditional Korean food this is the place to go.  I haven't tried Vietnamese food yet but I bet it is just as good.
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/4/2014,7/17/2014,7,3,,3,1>Seems to be in the middle of no where, but the food was excellent and the attire was casual.  Right outside the restaurant is a garden where fresh veggies are harvested for the kitchen.  The locals all had their own wine and beer with them, don't forget your own corkscrew!  The restaurant even had buckets if ice for patrons to bring to their table.  The single serve French press coffee was delicious!
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/20/2014,7/16/2014,0,1,,2,1>You'll never be disappointed with anything you get here. I have been here many times each time I have ordered something different. If you are from out of town coming to Chattanooga you must give this place a try. This is one of those places that you like to see thrive in the town in which you live. Five stars all the way.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/9/2014,7/15/2014,38,99,,2,1>Niedlov's is an awesome bakery. Period.Whether you prefer dense and chewy or soft and fluffy, this place will have what you want. It's not often I get to stop by, but when I do I revel in the yeasty aroma of fresh bread. There is something inherently comforting about that scent. Couple it with the smell of fresh brewed coffee and a hint of sweet from the muffins and you'll have yourself asking why you spent money at the spa on an aromatherapy session.Niedlov's bakes one of my favorite artisan loafs - the whole wheat four seed. The farmer's rye is perfect if you enjoy red meat and mustard between two slices. And I have enjoyed the baguette on more than one occasion. You won't be sorry to stop in and grab a few bagels either.
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,7/14/2014,10,65,,4,1>Love going here especially on my birthday or when you have someone in your group that has a bday...Free entrée and dessert!  Knowing that they are usually crowded we always go early and show up at least 30 mins before we plan to eat.  They do take reservations but we have had no wait to short wait (10 to 15 mins) the last couple of times we have been.  The food is always delicious and the service is good!  I have sampled a variety off of the menu and it all has been good!
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2013,7/13/2014,23,13,,2,1>An amazing place with great atmosphere! Plenty of room to blend with the crowd or take your friends to find a quiet corner. Play darts, people-watch, see a live band. I love the historical details of the building (I was told it used to be a brothel back in the day..)The food is so good that it's something I daydream about! Only drawback is smelling like smoke when you leave - but I can deal with that. It's a bummer that you have to be over 21, because eating at unique places is something our family likes to do together. Try to carpool and have a DD, because you are sure to let loose once you get there!
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/19/2011,7/12/2014,5,5,,8,5>This place is a hidden treasure in Chattanooga. The methodology to their coffee brewing process is down to a precise science, one which is quite successful. The source of their great coffee is from Counter Culture coffee, who has produced some of the best coffees that I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Their micro and macro brews always feature a great pick from Counter Culture, and definitely recommend you try these upon first visit. A 12 ounce will only set you back a couple bucks.The service is very prompt, and the baristas are always friendly. Also, despite the renovated warehouse environment, the atmosphere is set at  calm and quiet, with very relaxing music playing softly in the background.For studying, hanging out, or just a desire to have good coffee, The Camp House is definitely worth surveying.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/1/2010,7/11/2014,26,5,,4,2>If you are looking for a tavern the locals claim as their own, this is the place.  Tremont has a huge bottled beer selection, with about 15-20 draft selections.  The food is great!  The tavern burger is always a winner; add your favorite cheese like gouda, muenster, or swiss and enjoy.  Every night there is a special going on:  Monday - Trivia, Tuesday - Open Mic, Wednesday - Beer Tasting (Free Beer!), Thursday - Burger and Beer special, Friday Pint Specials, Saturday and Sunday - Specials vary based on events, but always live local music.The staff is very personable and inviting.  They all make an attempt to know your name and what you like to drink.  If you are looking for a nice place to relax, enjoy a cold beer, and meet up with some friends, this place is ideal.Did I mention it is SMOKE FREE!  how wonderful!
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/7/2014,7/10/2014,33,103,2,4,3>Yelp brought me here, and yelp did me right!Bought a dozen gourmets for customers. $15. It's about $5 more than Krispy Kreme, but the variety and unique flavors makes it worth it.Oh, did I mention the bacon and pancake donut? Shut yo mouth mama! I'm sure this wonderful concoction is killing my body on the way down, but it's oh so good.
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2011,7/9/2014,18,37,2,8,4>This place make me happy.  Really happy.The decor is great and the atmosphere is, well, dare I say urban?  When I walked in I felt like I was back in Chicago.  And it just gets better once you see the menu.  We started off with a carafe of their High Tea, which tasted like tea/cider/bourbon deliciousness.  We got about 4 glasses out of it, so the $15 price tag was really fair.  We also had the nachos, which are made with their homemade potato chips and chili.  Yum!  I couldn't name every burger each of us had, but all 4 of us enjoyed what we got.  My husband got the Asian Q, which had an Asian style bbq sauce, kim chee, and a whole lot of other awesomeness on it.  I had the jive turkey, and it was amazing!  It's a turkey burger with a pepper relish, gouda, and a hot pink cranberry mayo.  I am already craving it again.Sure the prices are higher than your standard burger joint, but this is no Five Guys' burger you're getting here (which, don't get me wrong, is delicious in its own right).  The burgers here are unlike any other you can find in town and are definitely worth the price.
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/2/2014,7/8/2014,11,21,1,5,2>Met up with a friend for dinner on a Tuesday night. The restaurant was fairly empty but don't let the lack of patrons fool you. The atmosphere was great. Drinks were fantastic and food was excellent. We started with the truffle fries. Only complaint was that there just weren't enough. Plenty for a starter but they were so good you just didn't want to stop eating them.  I had the salmon and Brie salad.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  The salad had a bit too much dressing and was somewhat sweet with the cranberries, candied walnuts and poached pear but I should have asked for it on the side in any case. Overall the flavors were excellent and the prices were great.  I will definitely be visiting again.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/26/2014,7/7/2014,10,96,2,6,3>Alright, so this joint has undergone some changes, including a change in ownership, and everything has been for the better.  The baristas have upped their game no doubt, the menu has seen a welcome reduction in goofy Starbucksesque offerings, and they're rolled out a rotating monthly guest roaster program for retail beans and pour overs.  The new owner is making good moves and Pasha is rapidly rising in the ranks to become a definite go-to coffee stop in the Chatt coffee scene.  The drink quality has improved significantly and the new, and unique roasters that are coming through as guest coffees are excellent and not offered anywhere within 2 hours of Chattanooga.  Psyched to see these changes happening and I'm excited to see what else these guys have in store as time progresses.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/22/2013,7/6/2014,40,132,2,6,4>I don't get it, haters. The Boathouse is great. I see many reviewers complaining about service. Over the course of several visits, I had one bad service experience (the waitress wasn't rude so much as she was an airhead). Honestly, this is a pretty standard experience at every Chattanooga restaurant I frequent so it just isn't that deep.I suspect that visitors expect more from the Boathouse because of its prime riverfront location and lovely view. I wonder if customers go in expecting an upscale establishment. The Boathouse is actually quite laid back and that's one of the things I love about it. The food is mostly very good and reasonably priced. The Lotta Lotta Garlic chicken platter is one of my favorite entrees. I tend to visit during happy hour, when they offer excellent drink specials, tasty $2 tacos and sliders, and $2.50 off oysters and appetizers. It usually isn't too crazy busy at that time, which may explain why the service has been fine. Grab a seat on the deck if it's warm, but the atmosphere inside is also quite pleasant. I dig their touristy postcard themed murals of local attractions.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/17/2014,7/5/2014,3,13,2,5,3>This has been one of my go-to bars for the past few years and I've had the privilege of really watching it grow during that time.  The first few times I came here it was like going into your neighbors basement and having a beer with them; dingy, unfinished, overall questionable, but the beer this place produces made everything better.  Since then they have really designed this place to be a great meet-up location with a stage for live music, a finished bar, tours of their production facilities and darts/foosball entertainment.  They also happen to produce some of the best locally made beer in the area (especially the Sweet Potato that comes around for what seems like one week a year that I ALWAYS miss out on).
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/24/2013,7/4/2014,87,21,2,6,3>We ate here to celebrate our 15 year anniversary. The service was excellent! I had the Filet and it was cooked to perfection! (medium rare of course!) I had the mashed sweet potatoes (not on the menu but normally part of another dish) and they were like dessert! The roasted mushrooms were great as well! My wife had the shaved prime sandwich and loved it! The wilted collard greens were okay, but hey, they're collard greens, how good can they be? Bailey was very attentive and even gave is a recommendation for a good coffee shop! Overall wonderful experience!
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,7/3/2014,3,38,2,4,3>Being a NYC guy, I tried a slice of the NYC style pizza first and thought it was good enough, but after trying the Neapolitan pizza next, it was PERFECT. The crust, the sauce, the fresh mozzarella, the toppings, etc...just perfect! Our server was terrific as well, very nice and knowledgable about the pizza. Great atmosphere, great location, great service, and great food. Will be back soon.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,7/2/2014,106,46,2,3,2>I love tacos.  I really LOVE tacos.  Stumbling on Taco Mamacitas was the best happy accident possible.  The decor is both comfortable and trendy.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  And tacos....oh the tacos!  With over 15 different tacos on the menu, making a selection is difficult, but I guess that guarantees a return trip!  I settled on the California Club and a Korean BBQ.  Both were delicious, but the Korean BBQ was out of this world.  The flavors were complex and complimented each other well.  I rounded out my meal with a side of Mexican Street Corn.  You're gonna wanna try this too!  I was pleased to find that 2 tacos and a side dish would only set me back $8.99.  My next trip back to Chattanooga will certainly have a stop in at Taco Mamacitas.  My next adventure will include trying their guacamole and the mojitos which looked incredible.
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/27/2014,7/1/2014,112,17,2,3,2>Trade the regular bread for all garlic- it is seriously the best! I think we ate a whole loaf. This sweet restaurant has great outdoor seating if the weather is nice and is within walking distance of all the great things about Chattanooga, the riverwalk, acquarium, etc. The food is incredible if you still have room after the bread. If you're visiting Chattanooga, there's a great bed and breakfast next door that's all part of the same complex where we've stayed in the past.
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/11/2014,6/30/2014,59,49,2,5,2>While my husband has had dogs before, I've always been a crazy cat lady. So when we adopted a 6-month-old shepherd/collie mix, I knew I wanted to take her to some obedience classes.First we met with Nancy Miller for a one-hour session to get some help with crate training, leash-walking and house-breaking. We'd only had the puppy for three days before our session but I was crying every day out of frustration. After we met with Nancy, I was ready to cry with joy. She really helped steer us in the right direction as far as crate-training, and gave us some helpful tips for leash-walking and house-breaking, too. Then we signed up for the STAR Puppy class, which lasted six weeks. The cost was very reasonable (it was actually less than what PetSmart had quoted me and from what I've heard their trainers aren't actually certified or anything, they just do a one-week crash course), but I would have been happy even if it cost more. The class was tremendously helpful. Our puppy got a chance to socialize with other dogs before and after class, but during class you're not supposed to let your dog play with the other dogs because it's disruptive (just like a real school, haha). Nancy Cambron was our instructor and she was wonderful. She's very soft-spoken and gentle, but can whip even the most unruly puppy into shape without ever raising her voice. She was also so great about staying after class to answer any questions the owners had about their pups--we got lots of help with leash-walking, since our puppy is pretty crappy about that. The STAR Puppy course is mainly about teaching *you* how to train your puppy, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Since I had never had dogs before I didn't know squat about how to train them, and my husband hadn't ever tried to train any of his. We learned valuable lessons on how to get our puppy to focus on us, how to sit/lay down, how to come when called, and how to walk on a leash. At the end of the six weeks there's a test, and if your puppy passes you get a certificate and can mail off for a plaque and a medal. (Ours passed!)After just the first week I could tell how much the class was helping, and I've already signed up for a three-week focus course on recall (our little girl is crazy and could use some more help focusing on us in strange environments).I was so relieved to find PDX. Everyone with a dog wants to offer advice based on how they trained their dog, but it's nice to have a group of people with legitimate training to provide time-tested advice that really does help.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2014,6/29/2014,2,35,2,3,2>There are many of these type restaurants around but ToJ (as my son and I call it) rises above the rest again and again. Why?First, when you enter the business, the place is always neat, clean and orderly. They have a TV in the dining area that is on satellite. Secondly, the food is prepared while you wait and not on a hot bar waiting to be served. The food taste and prep quality is excellent and the quantity for the price is fantastic. If you are looking for a great Hibachi restaurant I would definitely recommend this place.
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2014,6/28/2014,0,9,2,4,2>Love it! My mom and brother went with me for a casual dinner. I got the spinach omelette, my brother got the bean quesadilla, and my mom got the pancakes. Truly the pancakes are as amazing as they make them out to be- very thick and flavorful. My mom and I aren't even big sweet tooths, but they are definitely good. Omelette was also good and potatoes and the quesadilla I thought was really good as well. Cool atmosphere as well. A+ (:
<review# 151,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/20/2014,6/27/2014,30,13,2,4,3>Holy brunch food, Batman! Showed up with the boyfriend last Saturday, and was seated upstairs next to the giant windows.  Our server, Will, was outgoing and attentive, and immediately advised us of the $1 mimosa special.  You heard me right... One. Dollar. Mimosas.  I ordered the Pork Carnitas Tacos and a side of Brunch Potatoes - the tacos had decent flavor, but the roasted potatoes were the real winner on that plate.  To be honest, I could have eaten a whole plate of the potatoes... yum.  BF got the Strip Steak and Fries, which was reportedly a "pretty good" meal as well.  We also split the Banana Walnut French Toast, and let me tell you - it's amazing.  The toast is made from slices of French bread, and that banana/caramel syrup was out-of-this-world. The bacon that came with it was nice and crispy.There are a number of Sunday Brunch spots in Chattanooga, but this is one of the few that has a great selection on Saturdays as well.  It fills up pretty quickly, but if you find yourself stuck with a long wait, simply walk down the hallway to the giant antique store.  Great food and great shopping, all in one building? It's a weekend morning must.  And don't forget the $1 mimosas.
<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/9/2013,6/26/2014,8,61,2,6,3>I really like this place.  Awesome service.  At least 3 staff members in addition to our server stopped by our table as they were passing by.  These folks really make you feel like your satisfaction is their priority.On a recent visit (early on a Saturday evening), we sat in the bar area by the windows looking into Warehouse Row.  At 6:30 pm there were not many customers, but by 7 pm it was packed!  Even though a football game was on and the bar crowd was enthusiastic, we didn't feel like noise was an issue.  Rather, we felt part of a happy, neighborhood crowd.We noshed on appetizers instead of ordering a meal.  I enjoyed the cheese plate.   A choice of three cheeses were paired with some grapes, some spicy, toasted nuts and a heavenly fig paste along with grilled, rustic slices of bread.  Along with that, I ordered the side of sauteed mushrooms.  My idea of a perfect meal!  My husband ordered the house salad and the scallop appetizer.  A home run!  He loved every bite.I asked for, and received, a Cosmo perfect for my taste.  I asked for it not to be prepared too sweet and I got was I asked for!  A rare occassion in Chattanooga!   I followed that with a lovely glass of Temparillo and Public House is not skimpy on their pour.  I am looking forward to returning.  Public House has made our (very short) list of favorites in Chattanooga.
<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/18/2014,6/25/2014,58,21,2,4,2>It was a Tuesday evening and I was in the mood for sushi.  A close friend of mine was with me and he lives in this neighborhood. We had two options. This one and the one in Coolidge Park. Glad we opted for this one! Little did we know, that Tuesday's are their half-price off their special rolls. We would have gone there anyway, but the game changed when we knew that their rolls were half off. Highly recommend the chefs roll, the California roll, the Hawaiian roll, the Frazier roll and any of their nigiri. A true testament to a wonderful and delicious sushi bar, is if there Tamargo is fresh. Tamago is an egg like omelette. It should be served neither too cold nor too warm. The texture should be soft but firm. And it should have a little sweetness to it. I would have to say that their Tamago fell short of epic. These guys know what they're doing and the customer service was spot on. I could not recommend any better sushi bar in the city honestly. Their sake choice was short of phenomenal, while reasonably priced. Their sake a.k.a. Salmon was to die for. The nigiri just melted in my mouth. I highly recommend this sushi bar to any sushi aficionado. Atmosphere is great, the service is great and with much attention. Highly recommended!
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/3/2014,6/24/2014,4,3,2,3,2>I went to Rembrandt's with my boyfriend after having dinner at a nearby restaurant. The location and set up is wonderful! The inside area is beautiful and quaint. There are numerous options for desserts, coffee, and tea! We ordered a slice of Tiramisu, Black Tea, and a Hazelnut Latte. Every thing was delicious!!! We sat outside, next to the little pond and it was so so pleasant. The outside dinning are feels so calm and eclectic. I absolutely loved the ambiance that all the other reviewers mention. You will not want to leave!! The building is beautiful and the food is outstanding. I cant wait to come back again!!
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/25/2014,6/23/2014,52,247,3,8,4>I LOVE this butcher shop.  Excellent meats and sausage.  We also bought a pound of their bacon.  Oh Lordy was it good.  I bought a bunch of New York Strips and a couple of T-bones and dinner was amazing.  Locally and responsibly sourced. Great staff just makes the place perfect, that and the location next to Niedlov's bakery.  They also have a lunch menu we have not yet tried but we will.  I do not give five stars often, this place rocks.
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/11/2014,6/22/2014,5,12,2,4,2>My wife and I visited here by way of Groupon. We loved it! Homemade tortilla chips, authentic Mexican offerings (e.g., mole), good service. We went back the next day (Sunday) for brunch and it was very cheap and good. My wife ordered something she was less than thrilled with and the waitress immediately replaced it with the menu item she had ordered the day before and thoroughly enjoyed...again.Chattanooga has just a handfull of decent Mexican restaurants, but I put this on in the top three with Tacqueria Jalisco and Ovalles. Not the Tex Mex crap that you can get just about anywhere else in Chattanooga.  Don't come here expecting $5 combo meals.Here's what we ordered and enjoyed:MoleChicken tortilla soupTres AmigosGuacamoleOmelette with chorizo and peppers (brunch)
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/12/2014,6/21/2014,36,6,2,3,2>Great place to bring your vegetarian and vegan friends. I have tried their seitan meatloaf last time and the 'meatloaf' was way too salty for my taste. However their Zucchini Pancake is one of my favorite appetizers. They top it off with their own mayo, and the portion size is good to share with a group of 4. Even their entree portion size is huge. For anyone who eats a moderate to small amount, I'd suggest you share it with someone else. Their popular dressing for their salad is called 'the Goddess' (get that). Also their thai chili bowl is also good. I would recommend this place for anyone new in town. It's pretty safe to order anything from their menu.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/31/2014,6/20/2014,177,489,2,3,2>Maybe 4.5 stars but rounded up.Stopped by for a quick beer and bite.  Looking at vegan or vegetarian options downtown, we were given this as one of our late night options.  It did not disappoint.Great service.  Cool atmosphere.  And they have a wonderful beer selection.  I never thought of ordering taster flights, next time I will.  A great price for them and always fun to try different brews.Happy the menu lists vegetarian food with the easy icons. ++We ordered the black bean hummus dish for a starter and it was quite good. Served with warm pita and crisp tortilla chips.  I think next time I will ask for hot sauce, but it was tasty.  We then ordered the fungi pizza with no cheese.  Frankly, some of the best pizza sauce I have ever had, it pops with flavor.... and great tasting dough.  Not greasy at all.  With the starter, the beer, and ow a 14" pizza, we could not finish it all.We will be back
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,6/19/2014,21,11,2,3,1>I've eaten here only twice, but my last time was truly memorable.My friend took me out for a birthday dinner a few months ago, and I fell in love with the place. We spent close to three hours sitting on the patio and creating our own little slice of Hemingway's Paris. Hell, there was even a busker outside playing some classic Motown cuts.Our meal started off with the crawfish & artichoke dip, and steak tartare which were both divine. Topped it off with a few cocktails (the "Ginger Smash" being a favorite) and then dove into the best oysters I've head outside of Baltimore (pro tip: they are $.25 on Thursday nights). I haven't had a full on meal here, but I can tell you that the oysters are amazing (and I've eaten my fair share of oysters in places like Baltimore). The other highlight is easily the finely-tuned cocktails the girls inside make. I rave about their drinks to anyone I meet. The best in town.

Formerly Bell-south Park until March 2007. Construction of this park began March 1999. The first pitch was thrown in this stadium on April 10, 2000. AT&T Field fan capacity is 6362.This is the only minor league base ball field I have ever visited.  The tickets are reasonable as I have been paying $4 to $5 over the last few years to get in.The parking is easy and free for me as I find a meter to park at a few blocks away.  If you don't mind walking, you can usually find free parking down town.The concession stands are easy to get to and usually have  no lines. They have food and drinks at reasonable prices. The seats are general admission and you can sit where ever you want in the higher decks. Now, you can pay more for lower seats but to me, all seats are great here no matter where you sit or stand.The beer garden is a popular hang out located behind the third base line and left out field.  Look for special events at the ball park. For instance, they have used car night, and fireworks night too. I like going on days they have fireworks shows. It is mostly on Friday nights during a home game. See schedule for these specific dates.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/10/2014,6/17/2014,50,170,5,8,6>I'm not from New York but I've had authentic NYC pizza while visiting New York on multiple occasions.  Regardless of if you think it's really traditional/authentic pizza, this place is legit.  The staff is really helpful and super-attentive (at least in the two occasions that I've visited they were).Insider tip: the last time I visited we were told that there's a dude from Philly in the back making authentic Philly cheesesteaks.  Now, I can't vouch for them since I hadn't tried them yet but I'm super-excited to go back and try it.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/29/2014,6/16/2014,1025,471,2,3,3>Well after hearing from Steven L about this place I finally made my first visit here. It will not be my last. A true hidden gem on MLK street. Plenty of parking and they need it as this place gets packed. Had the fried chicken and it was great. Very crispy crust with a touch of the Mississippi spices. Baked beans and mashed potatoes were were excellent as was the friendly service. I sat at the bar with some regulars who were having some craw dads. This is truly more that a dive bar. It's an iconic place in Chattanooga.
