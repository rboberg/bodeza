<review# 1,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/20/2014,11/24/2014,1,7,1,2,2>Delicious! I just had lunch there today with my mother. I had the chipotle brisket on sourdough with pasta salad as my side and my mom had the taco salad. There was a 20 minute wait for food so I'd suggest calling ahead if you can but since I didn't, I sipped on an orange passion sweet tea which was super refreshing. This little place gets busy and now I know why! My sandwich was delicious and cheesy. Melt in your mouth kind of good. The brisket was expertly cooked with fantastic flavor. The chipotle flare was a perfect touch. I don't think that I came up for air the entire time. The pasta salad was delicious and simple, very creamy. I probably could have eaten a whole bowl of just that. The taco salad was comforting. The vegetables were fresh and then there was a "sloppy" component as a taco salad should be. Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone that has a big lunch appetite!
<review# 2,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2014,11/23/2014,6,16,1,3,3>So close to my house which is great. Probably visit this place at least once a month. Service is friendly. Small and cute place. Never been disappointed with the sushi I order
<review# 3,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/23/2014,11/22/2014,59,9,3,4,3>My husband wanted some pizza for dinner and we had our neighbors over. They suggested Roma's. We've never had their pizza before, so we decided to give it a try. We ordered a large half meat lovers/Hawaiian, and a medium cheese (for the kids). They said it would take about 20 mins. They don't have a delivery service, so we picked it up. Which was fine since it's not far from us. They have a new location, off of Old Perkins Rd (side street from Prairieville Walmart) same parking lot as Tommy's Fish House. They have a large opened eating area. My friend said it was way bigger then their last location. When we got there our pizzas weren't done yet so we waited a few short minutes, which was fine since the smell is delightful. The pizzas were huge! I'm not a fan of thin crust, but surprisingly it was very tasty. I had the Hawaiian and it was yummy! My husband said the meat lovers was pretty good too, not too much meat but just enough. Their prices seem right for the amount and quality you get. They also had specials but I didn't get a chance to take a picture. We will order from them again.
<review# 4,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/16/2014,11/21/2014,1,19,1,3,3>Love this Place! I can only give 4 stars because I hate the lighting in this place :( and I was disappointed a Mexican restaurant did not serve Mexican coffee's. Really, I laughed myself to death when I had to tell the bartender how to make it; but we had a fun. :) The food is AWESOME and the plating was gorgeous. I had the Diablo Shrimp, outstanding! Stick to the Denham restaurant, we went to the Watson Papi's and it just did not compare. Service was not as friendly, food was not as good, drinks were terrible, the wait for food was horrendous, and the overall atmosphere was cramped. We will keep going to Denham Papi's; you have fans with us!
<review# 5,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/27/2014,11/20/2014,5,5,4,5,5>I have so much to say ab this place, so bare w me...I've heard a lot about this place from friends and thought it was too good to be true. I mean, all you can eat sushi for $25 is unheard of. Especially after years of going to places like ichiban and paying a crapload of money, and still being hungry. But when I went the other night w a few friends, I was blown away by the entire experience! So I'm giving this place 5 stars just bc I've never experienced anything as awesome as this. First of all, if you haven't gone yet.. Then GO!!! Second of all, there's this all you can eat sushi deal for ab $25. (The catch here is you have to finish everything or pay for each individual item that you do not finish.)Anyways, if u have a big appetite, it shouldn't be a problem. They have everything from sashimi to sushi to specialty rolls to soups (if that's what you're in the mood for). Also, dessert and drinks are all you can eat and drink as well! Of all we ordered (and we ordered a lot!) My favorites were the eel, the mango salmon rolls, and pretty much all the specialty rolls. For dessert my friends got chocolate and green tea ice cream! I got the strawberry w a couple rounds of deep fried Cheesecake!!! (Btw.. Who does that!? .. Who deep fries cheesecake!?!)Also I've got to give a major round of applause to the service here! The Service was amazing! They let me on their wifi for a fantasy football draft, and even took my friends phone to the back and charged it for her! Also more importantly they checked in w us often and pleasantly answered any questions I had. In conclusion, this place is #AmazeBalls!!! Please go check it out if you haven't already. I'll def be back soon!
<review# 6,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2014,11/19/2014,111,195,5,5,3>Credentials first.... Lived in Dallas, TX for 25 years, the capital of BBQ in the state of TX and have eaten at well over 30 BBQ places in TX and other states. I've also  written the first ever Jewish-Cajun cookbook and was raised in the deli business in NY.I am shocked at all of the bad reviews for this place. Maybe it's inconsistent, I don't know. All I can say is that this joint served up BBQ about as fine as any I've had in Texas.- Ribs - superior - tender and flavorful.- Chicken - Moist and delicious- Brisket - really excellent. Tender, lots of smoke flavor. Exceptional.- Potato salad - not bad at all. Homemade.- Onion rings - homemade and crispy.I would not believe for a second all of the people slamming this place. Examples - Peter N calls it Pull Pork. It's PULLED pork dude, and calling it pull pork shows you don't know the first thing about it... and the idiot who said that he didn't smell BBQ when he walked in needs to get his sense of smell examined, as it's evident that he doesn't have one.I am giving 2Pauls the fiver. easy.
<review# 7,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/10/2014,11/18/2014,110,62,1,2,3>This is one of my favorite places in town.  I should have posted a review before now.  Perhaps I was just waiting for one more stellar visit.  My friend and I went today!  Excellent service and excellent food!  Let me start by saying that David, our waiter, and Angela, at the bar, helped make this a memorable lunch.  The grapefruit sparkler, $7, is Angela's special creation and it is terrific!  She was kind enough to show me how it is made.  Thank you!  We started with the above cocktail and ordered the Boursin (sp?) cheese and crab soup and a wedge salad, sans bacon.  The soup was outstanding and the salad fresh and crisp.  The home made blue cheese dressing was spot on.  David, our waiter,  accommodated my friend's special request for an oyster platter with their great fries, as this was currently not on the menu. Don't you love a waiter who makes recommendations and knows the nuance of when to visit and talk?  I ordered the Juban burger with Havarti cheese and it did not disappoint.  Perfectly cooked to medium well and seasoned lightly, it boasted fabulous caramelized onions which were soft and sweet.  The bun had a slightly sweet flavor which was the perfect balance.  Thank for another wonderful visit.  Who knows?  Maybe one day I'll save room for dessert as there are several appealing items on that menu! ILove the ambiance as well, great for a date night, casual lunch or that special occasion!
<review# 8,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,11/17/2014,23,43,1,5,4>O. M. G. Go here. Make a reservation and go here NOW!Outstanding food and amazing service. My partner and I went here to celebrate completion of my doctorate. Getting a loaf of their bread was a fantastic idea, one I highly recommend to anyone else going here. I could have ordered an entire loaf for dinner (with extra spreads) and been totally content. In addition to the bread, I had the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer, the Eggplant Seafood Napoleon for the main course, and a creme brulee for dessert. To drink, I ordered a French 75. All of it was amazing.  Like, out of this world amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better place to eat. I just wish I could afford it more often! :PFinally, once the waiter figured out WHY we were eating out, he gave us free chocolate mouse as a way to say, "congrats." Sweet man, was totally on the ball for the whole night as far as refilling drinks, taking orders, and bringing out food.
<review# 9,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/31/2014,11/16/2014,19,27,1,3,5>Cupcake Allie is DELICIOUS! I've had their peanut butter cupcakes, Mounds coconut cupcakes and their pumpkin spice cupcakes. They're always moist and delectable. If you're looking for cupcakes, you're in for a treat because I highly recommend this place!
<review# 10,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2014,11/15/2014,92,45,1,3,4>I've boarded my dog here a few times. The staff is friendly. My dog gets to socialize with other dogs and gets taken out a lot during the day. I love how this business uses social media to share with owners the fun time their pets are having. They take photos and post them to their Facebook page and reply if you ask how your pet is doing.
<review# 11,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/3/2014,11/14/2014,2,5,1,3,4>This was my first time here and I have fell in LOVE! The Blue Velvet cake was AWESOME, with so much flavor. The cheesecakes are sooooo good! And it was my first time ever having a Macaron and I must say those cookies are the BEST! I recommend this bakery to everyone!
<review# 12,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/28/2014,11/13/2014,14,22,2,6,4>The location is great unless you are trying to get there and also leave during lunch traffic. I had a caesar salad with grilled chicken, and it was great. My buddy had the red beans and rice with Italian sausage and surprisingly, it was delicious! The few people we went with said they have all been there multiple times and that all of their dishes they have ever tried were great and never tasted a bad thing from there.
<review# 13,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2014,11/12/2014,3,8,2,3,3>Very nice. Stumbled in the other day as I was killing some time while waiting for an oil change. Impressed by the selection. Almost any size, shape and flavor of donut,  danish or pastry filled the glass display case and even more behind the counter.  The person behind the counter was friendly as could be. We had a great talk about the selection and the history of the place which looked awesome with it's 50's diner themed decor.  Today was the first time I sampled the wares though. I had an apple fritter and a cup of coffee. Both met my approval. I dined inside and had a pleasant experience.  It's a Saturday. Donut time, I take it. Lots of friendly faces and happy people. I will keep this place on my agenda and you should too!
<review# 14,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/31/2014,11/11/2014,30,85,1,4,2>And finally a place where they get what taco's are supposed to be! Nothing big and fancy, just enough of good, delicious combination of flavors inspired apparently by not just traditional Mexican ingredients and flavors, but food from all different places all over the globe. And none of that rice and re-fried beans everyone puts on your plate to fill up space, with a ton of lettuce and sour cream... (ugh! I shiver when I think of that...) Their salsa and their guacamole are great, but this is a taco place, and as they should, they are the stars of the menu. One of this days I'm going to sit down and have one of each, but so far I love the Argentinian, The Homeboy (I have to have one every single time), the Jamaican Surf, and the fish Baja tacos; but I haven't tried them all yet. And they promise to keep adding new tacos to the menu which only makes it more exciting!And for the cherry on top, they are one of the two places I know that carry Estrella Damm, a Spanish beer a love, (nothing really fancy, I just happen to like it). And there is almost nothing better than a few tacos and an ice cold beer!!.
<review# 15,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2014,11/10/2014,179,366,4,4,3>Been wanting to try this place out but never was able to catch them because of my work schedule.. finally had the time to catch the hype.  And the hype is real.  Easily one of my favorite spots around Lafayette now.  Their menu is pretty exciting, since places around Lafayette normally doesn't have food like this.. dare I say, it reminds me of a Cochon Butcher in NOLA?  Nevertheless, place is awesome, we had the following:- Chicken Skins - the deliciousness, crispiness, and saltiness makes this treat so much better, I can't stop eating them!- PCP Home Fries - shredded pork cheek pastrami & melted swiss - the flavors were so bold and delicious, just wish the fries were a tad bit crispier - Chop Block Melt Sammie - pork cheek pastrami, corned beef & smoked beef tongue, slaw, swiss & celery salt mayo - this sandwich is compact with so many elevation of flavors, very delicious- Porchetta Sammie - herb & garlic roasted crispy pork belly, onion jam, fried garlic greens, apple & spicy beer mustard - delicious pork belly with a array of flavors on one sandwich, one complaint I do have was that my pork belly wasn't crispy, but yet its still deliciousI can't wait to come here again for lunch!
<review# 16,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2014,11/9/2014,134,34,1,4,4>The service is very attentive, as well as the food. I remember the first time I ever called Nino's to make a reservation, I was trying to decide between Nino's or French Market Bistro based solely upon the wine menu for a date. I called and the hostess answered, and was very welcoming and warming and answered my questions about eh wine selection... and I asked if the food menu was good as well, and she responded "We have a great EVERYTHING menu!" and it made me laugh, and I reserved right away. The owner & chef often come out to personally check on the guest's experiences and opinions and accommodate to their needs. Everything is *authentic* Italian (please do not mistake olive garden for Italian food, people), and very FRESH and tasty! I could eat at Ninos everyday. By far the best Italian food in the city, even better than the well established, popular Ginos. The oatmeal cookies for dessert are to die for as well... deliciously gooey and topped with a raspberry sauce & homemade whip cream! The gulf shrimp pasta is incredible, especially if you ask for fresh basil & cracked pepper in it as well. The ciopinno... my god. that's all i can say... WOW! The broth is rich and fabulous, with the perfect amount of balance. Gotta love the homeamade sourdough bread as well, especially with the olive oil & parm dipping oil. The bar itself is kind of small, but the restaurant very intimately cozy, and even when the restaurant is full, it's not overwhelmingly loud. I am SUPER impressed by the quality of food, and how both Ninos & Oscars Pizza (same owners) are supporting the Slow Food movement in Baton Rouge - it is a dear organization close to my heart, and all about fresh, local food.
<review# 17,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/14/2014,11/8/2014,14,26,2,4,2>This is our companies unofficial cafeteria. It's right across the street and it's 90 seconds from our front door. They have a great menu, they're fast even when they're busy. It's a deli so they'll have the usual suspects, salad, po'boys (they're called hoagies elsewhere), hamburgers, etc. They have GREAT French Fries. They also have great deli sandwiches primarily due to the different varieties of fresh cut bread they serve it on. I always go for the marble rye. I must admit, if you are not a foodie like me you may not appreciate this as much. I like to try different things, however I was raised in a German household and rye bread is something I ate everyday. It's nice to be able to get a sandwich the way mom used to make it for lunch and usually for only around $5 or $6 most times. Now they do have one thing that no one else has and maybe for me no one else ever orders (and one of the reasons I'm on a diet right now at the time I'm writing this), is they have Liverwurst sandwiches for $5. Big thick slices with spicy mustard and lettuce. Sounds gross? If you eat cracklings (that's worse IMHO). We each have our own downfall. Too bad we can't get scrapple here (Google it). Anyway, great place for lunch, quick, fast and they have an Italian market with boutique Italian sodas, spirits, cheeses, meats, olive oil, etc. They also have prepackaged frozen dinners ready to go. While you may not do it everyday, it's nice to know it's there. They also sell wine. Here's a tip for anyone in a real hurry, if you know they're going to be busy at lunch or you're in a super big hurry while racing down the road and don't want fast food. Call ahead! Order it so it's there when you arrive. You pick it up at the cash register when you walk in. I can't tell you how many times I have called ahead and walked in and got my order and left in just a few minutes only to leave people standing there asking, how did you get your food so fast? Another tip is that they always have a special on the wall on the chalkboard behind the lunch counter register. They are notorious for having out of this world burgers that they think up that morning or whenever (sometime as an experiment?) and they're awesome. I always look there first before looking at the menu in which case I'd end up with the Liverwurst sandwich and a plate of fries. Hope that helps.
<review# 18,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/5/2014,11/7/2014,3,14,1,5,4>Meet a few friends to celebrate an important birthday.  The Rum House has such a lively atmosphere, a perfect location to hang out with friends. Enjoyed the oyster & scallop tacos.  Just loved the way the Caribbean flavors popped in every bite.Second visit in 2 days.  It was good yesterday I had to bring my husband. Drew had the Crab sandwich  and all I can say is AMAZING!!

<review# 20,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/21/2014,11/5/2014,100,239,1,4,3>Little Saigon is just like the other Vietnamese restaurants around Sherwood Forest and Florida Boulevard, except that they seem to give you a lot of meat. I'm giving them five stars because of this. It's clean and the service is quick. I wouldn't say it's better than any other Vietnamese place, but it seems like you get more for the same price.
<review# 21,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/30/2014,11/4/2014,21,35,1,3,4>This is a great bar that few people know about. It's hard to find because the sign is so small but that's part of the intent!  (Just find Azteca's and go downstairs). The bar has a great dive feel but an upscale drink selection. No beers on tap but lots of great bottles at reasonable prices. Expect to see the owner Gary in there at least half the time and he's always chatting with customers. Most of the patrons are regulars and know the bartenders but they are friendly to visitors who are just passing through.  There are tv's, a cool digital jukebox, and darts to keep you entertained.
<review# 22,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,11/3/2014,18,10,1,4,4>Go there. Get kolaches. Eat them up. Repeat tomorrow. The only thing that would improve the fast, super-friendly service at this spot would be a front door delivery every morning at 7:15 am. I get a genuinely warm reception each and every time I walk through the door of this location. The staff is kind and altogether attentive to every customer, remembering their regulars well. The donuts are amazing and almost always hot, but the kolaches....oh, the jalapeño kolaches. This is a must-have. Get there before 9:00 am for a fresh croissant wrapped sausage with cheese and jalapeño goodness. Yeah, it's what's for breakfast! Bonus: they serve Community Coffee.
<review# 23,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2014,11/2/2014,124,131,3,5,5>Best burger I have had in BR so far! Gotta admit, there are still a few spots on my burger "to do" list, but I absolutely loved my Fat Cow experience. I had the Smoke Stack with yummy cheddar, bacon, BBQ, and onion straws--and sampled the husband's 120 burger with  bacon, gruyere, arugula, and horseradish sauce. While I preferred mine to his, both were juicy and awesome, and I am definitely planning to head back and try the other specialty burgers. We also split the duck fat fries and onion straws, which did leave us wasting huge portions, but totally satisfied, as both were pure  perfection! Of course, our daughter loved her Cookies and Cream shake, too. Overall, nothing we didn't adore. A new fave!
<review# 24,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/2/2014,11/1/2014,8,17,1,5,5>"Hands down the best and most authentic Lebanese food in Baton Rouge. Perhaps the best I have ever had.

<review# 25,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2014,10/31/2014,2,17,2,3,3>I've been going to this dentistry ever since I was a little girl and it is one of the best we have in Louisiana. The staff are very friendly, helpful and lenient on if you are 15 -20 minutes late. Dr. Michael Rabel is an excellent dentist that is very thorough, precise and knowledgeable. Very quick cleaning check up as well. Typical routine consist of xray, checkup, and cleaning if you don't have any dental problems then you go home with a nice little bag of goodies (toothbrush, toothpaste and floss). It is very clean, the clinic is getting remodel and expanding so I can't wait to see it complete! Offers services to all ages too.
<review# 26,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/21/2014,10/30/2014,39,40,4,4,4>Love, love, love this cafe and cannot wait to return. I grew up in the surrounding area and am first of all super impressed with how this area of Baton Rouge has blossomed into a unique restaurant lover strip. First of all the appearance was very casual and cozy. Outdoor seating and plenty indoor with a coffee trip feel. Definitely appropriate with the close proximity to LSU. I would have adored this place in college before I moved to the other side of town.Service was friendly, and food made right in front of you, which is always exciting. I ordered the paleo special, which I had no idea what they event meant. They asked me if I ever tried it, then explained it very well. I decided to be adventurous and get it a whirl.  So glad I did!The paleo special of the day was an open faced sandwich with turkey, fig jam, pear, and arugula on a homemade paleo bread. I'm actually posting weeks after I ordered it, and my mouth is still salivating. I must go back there soon, and if they don't have that special, no worries because the menu had lots of delicious options.Definite 5 star review, and I can't wait to return with a friend :-)
<review# 27,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/26/2014,10/29/2014,16,60,2,7,5>The owner of Zoroona messaged me on Yelp noting that I liked Mediterranean food and that I should check out his new spot.  When I walked in, I was surprised to see how nice the interior decor is.  They bring a rosemary bread to the table, which is awwwsome!  I ordered the Zoroona Chicken, lentil soup, and grape leaves.  All of it was very tasty, which means I will have to return and see what else they have to offer.  I have my eye on the lamb.If you want a change of routine from Albasha or Roman's, give this place a shot.  I'm glad I found a place to put in rotation with Zorba's, since my pocket book was getting upset with me.

Tabouli is good, but once I ordered moussaka as a side.  It was not good nor resembled the moussaka  I've had before.  Serope's is a great healthy alternative to much of Perkins Rowe.
<review# 30,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/21/2014,10/26/2014,25,31,2,3,3>This is a truly local toy store that has been in business for 30 years!   It's in a victorian house in mid city.   They make the most of their small space, so yes, its filled from floor to ceiling with toys and games.  Nicely organized into boys, dress up, art, dolls, girls, bath/water, games/animals, baby etc... each has its own space.  The prices are high (hence not the 5 stars), but the experience makes up for it if you can afford it.  Everyone is so nice.  They carry unique things and common things, and they wrap !!!!  Even at Christmas and they make the prettiest easter baskets in town.  I'm always wowed at how they put it together.  I've seen so many local stores close, this is the only one left.  Or else you are left with the dreaded big box stores or online.   I do also shop online but I never price check.  If they help me pick something out, I buy from them.  They don't have everything but you are sure to have a great experience here.

My family loves the boudin balls and the boudin stuffed chickens. Everything looks and smells so good in this place!
<review# 33,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/13/2014,10/23/2014,19,36,2,4,3>Although it's off the beaten path, this place is pretty sweet! As I searched for a new lunch spot near my office I came across this spot. It is small, quaint, and quiet. The quality of the food was just a bonus. The food was fresh and well seasoned. I could tell that it was made with great intentions! I will most definitely visit this spot several more times!
<review# 34,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/29/2014,10/22/2014,1,5,2,2,2>This Plantation Home is absolutely Gorgeous!! The Bed & Breakfast Inn was very quiet & nice (you do not stay in the Plantation house, but a little Inn built just across the pond). Our Breakfast was very tasteful & loved our tour of the home, which was given by the daughter of the current owner, whom was raised in the home. She was very nice & and her passion for her home really showed, not a memorized tour speech at all. Loved our stay!!!**The only reason that I did not give it a 5, is because the Inn needs a little updating & maintenance. Our AC unit seemed to be struggling, some lamps did not work, and the room had a "musty" smell, similar to a log cabin, but overall a nice, roomy place.

Would love to come back on another night for a proper dinner!

Very clean establishment
<review# 38,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/15/2014,10/18/2014,66,126,1,4,3>Stroube's is, unfortunately, a place I don't always have top of mind, but when I do make it downtown I always wonder why I don't eat here more often.  Their steaks are cooked perfectly.  The last time I was here they had a cream of artichoke soup that was one of the best soups I've ever eaten.  The seasoning was slightly spicy but still had that great artichoke flavor too.  I've had the duck here and I would give it an 8.  The skin could have been rendered a little more but the meat was cooked to a very beautiful medium rare.  This restaurant is worth the drive downtown....now, if I could only get a ride home.
<review# 39,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/23/2014,10/17/2014,37,137,2,2,2>Nice neighborhood coffee shop with free wifi and plenty of seating spaces both indoors and outdoors. I usually get the medium sized coffee or the latte and I've never been disappointed. They have a bunch of baked goodies too but I've never tried those. Good location, and they have additional parking near Coyote Moon. I wish they'd start a small breakfast menu sometime...it looks like the kind of place that should serve breakfast too :)
<review# 40,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/8/2014,10/16/2014,19,23,2,2,2>When I am home, I have to stop and get a  shrimp basket with homemade onion rings! Their fried chicken is the bomb! Actually anything off the menu is great! I don't eat liver and gizzards but I have heard they were the best thing here. If you are passing through Opelousas, you have to stop.
<review# 41,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,10/15/2014,1,9,1,2,2>Everything was great.I came here on a first date a couple weekends ago and this place was a last minute pick. She really wanted pizza and being from up north, I know a good pie down here is rare. We gave it a shot and were rewarded with good food and service.The atmosphere was nice. It's a laid back sports themed restaurant with a nice little bar. We took the booth in the back with the little flat screen at the edge of the table so we could watch the baseball game.The caprese salad was Amazing! The mozzarella was some of the best I've ever had. We split a margherita pizza and a goat pizza with goat cheese and balsamic vinegar. Obviously we had to take some home. We topped it off with some strawberry shortcake ice cream, which was maybe the best decision of the night.We were enjoying ourselves so much and didn't realize that we had been sitting there an hour and a half past closing! The young staff was so courteous and kind that we had no idea. I tipped them well.The date was a big success thanks to the food and staff of Oscars so I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for good eats and chill vibes.
<review# 42,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/25/2014,10/14/2014,13,11,1,5,3>Don't be misjudged on the outside of the restaurant even though it does not look appealing. They have two different menus for Chinese and Japanese food. I HIGHLY recommend ordering the Chinese food only because it is the best Chinese food I had in Baton Rouge. The service was decent and the pricing is cheap and affordable. Will be back here again.
<review# 43,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/8/2014,10/13/2014,0,4,1,1,1>Fantastic atmosphere and food, I think it's best enjoyed in larger groups but no matter what the food is going to be great and our srver, I'm sorry I can't remember his name, was professional and attentive. I would highly recommend this place.
<review# 44,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,10/12/2014,6,5,3,2,2>Best view in town! Fantastic place to take out of town guests. Beautiful spot!!! Sushi is great, especially after they expanded the menu recently. Start with the eggplant miso appetizer. The Lava Roll, the Cupcake Roll, and the Green Monster are MUST HAVES. The entrees look great, but I love sushi too much to not get sushi! Thank me later. For dessert, the chocolate tsunami or whatever it is called is also a must have. Be sure to get reservations and ask for a window table, or if the weather is nice, an outside table.
<review# 45,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/7/2014,10/11/2014,1,16,2,3,3>Great little lunch spot. The service is friendly and efficient, and the food consistently delicious. It can get pretty busy, but the line moves quickly. I know Serop's tends to be the "go-to" for take out Greek food downtown, but I think this place is way better. Their prices are much better as well. Definitely try the Fatoush salad, which is topped with their cucumber salad. While I prefer the gyro, the chicken is always moist and good too.
<review# 46,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/5/2014,10/10/2014,2,38,1,2,2>I believe it is best, when ordering smoked or BBQ meats, to have it "Dry", i.e., no BBQ sauce. That way you can taste the meat and THEN you can say it was good bbq or not. Getting that out of the way, my wife, daughter and myself all had the Fulton Street ribs, AWESOME. The service, her name was Lele, was awesome.
<review# 47,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,10/9/2014,19,43,1,3,4>I have semi-high standards for Italian food, and I love Monjuni's. The red sauce is delicious, and luckily, they sell it in jars! Portions are generous, but I always wish I had more leftovers. The restaurant has a nice ambiance, and I usually can't say no to their cheesecake.This review would be five stars if based entirely on the food, but I've had a couple inattentive servers at Monjuni's. Not even close to a dealbreaker, but something to consider if you're on a schedule.
<review# 48,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2013,10/8/2014,2,3,2,6,3>Ethel's Snack Shack serves food that can only be described as sublime. It is the best southern cooking I have ever eaten.The meat falls off the bone. You don't need a knife, and they don't bring you one  The red beans and the rice are perfect. The cornbread muffin melts  in your mouth. The green beans are firm yet fully cooked the broccoli is the same It is all perfect. The place is small, very clean, informal, quiet, and very pleasant. It is a hidden  And very inexpensive A succulent large smothered pork chop with the two included sides which for me were red beans/rice and green beans was a mere $8.75. Incredible . Plus the waitress Carol was incredibly nice and efficient plus the service was fast Worth the 20 minute drive from downtown Baton Rouge. Run don't walk to Ethel's Snack Shack you will love it if you like great southern cooking . If you haven't had southern cooking, Ethel's will make you a devoted fan of it.
<review# 49,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,10/7/2014,22,50,1,3,3>The sugar cookie was always safe around me or in my house because no one liked sugar cookies and they just aren't worth the calories...until now. These are not your typical dry, no flavor, gritty sugar cookie...no ma'am. This is the most delicious, flavorful, melt in your mouth cookie you're going to find. Oh my, I could eat my weight in these delicious morsels. And if you like king cake, try their king cake cookies..better than the real thing, no kidding. Their designs are adorable and they can also customize with your business logo. What a great way to promote yourself or your business.  And they seem to be the new "it" thing for wedding favors. They also have AMAZING pecan brittle, fudge, and salted caramel topping which is to die for. There is no storefront yet so you have to order online or by phone and/or they will ship. This is an absolute must try...seriously.
<review# 50,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,10/6/2014,5,50,1,3,3>Absolutely the best Greek food in town! The atmosphere is warm and intimate. The staff bends over to help you. Our favorite is the combination plate. The portions are so big it's great to split. Baba Ghanouj is addictive et good. Can't get enough of this place.
<review# 51,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/12/2014,10/5/2014,16,11,2,3,3>Nine Dragon serves excellent, fresh Chinese food.  They have a good variety of options to choose from.  You get your choice of rice or noodles and 3 other choices plus a drink for around $7.  My husband and I can eat there for less than $15.

<review# 54,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/16/2014,10/2/2014,8,33,,3,3>We tried out Hello Sushi for Restaurant Week and were not disappointed! You can't beat $20 for 3 courses. For appetizer, I got the crabcakes and my husband got the Vietnamese eggrolls. Both were good. The star of the meal was by far the 2nd course! I had the Who Dat roll and he had the Cajun roll. Wow! They were both so delicious. For dessert, my husband had the fried cheesecake and I had the cake balls. To be honest, I was already so full that I barely touched my dessert. What I did eat was rich and satisfying. My husband loved his. He's a cheesecake fanatic so he was very happy to get his fix.Overall, we had a great experience at Hello Sushi and we'll definitely be returning. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very attentive. I highly recommend taking advantage of the Restaurant Week menu soon!
<review# 55,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/11/2014,10/1/2014,5,39,3,4,3>Love the atmosphere, beer selection, and food.  I've been here several times and I've never left less than absolutely satisfied.  They have a great selection of beers on tap.  I've tried their burgers and fried gator poboy, all of which were good.  The atmosphere is great for the 20-30 something crowd.
<review# 56,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,9/30/2014,19,9,2,3,3>As I sit here and eat this Carolina Red Slaw BBQ I am forcing myself to write this review between bites. This sammich is amazing. The meals are all fine and dandy but what gives this place a 5-Star rating is some of the best bread pudding around.
<review# 57,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/11/2014,9/29/2014,0,6,2,3,3>Excellent selection and customer service! Only reason not 5 stars is the price. If you are looking for a hard to find spice, they will have it. I recommend the Pecan BBQ rub.
<review# 58,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/16/2014,9/28/2014,5,51,1,2,3>Another reviewer described Fleur de Lis as "dark and divey" and I'd say I agree. If you are looking for a well lit Chuckee Cheese then you're in the wrong place.  It's "divey" but it's clean, and the staff is well-mannered despite what I've read here. Been going there many years and no one's ever been rude; slow perhaps, but not rude. Again, it's the nature of the "beast" - if you want a different experience then go elsewhere.This place has been making award winning pizzas in the Baton Rouge area for longer than I've been alive. The "Around the World" with anchovies is my favourite and a large is just about enough for two people. This is thin crust "Sicilian" style pizza and NOT what you will get at Pizza Hut or Domino's. It's rectangular, not round... thin and somewhat crispy.There is only a single dining room and the space is PACKED with chairs and tables. Large groups (over 8 people) will OFTEN have to wait for enough tables to empty out and be put together if they all want to sit together. AGAIN, if that irks you in some way then get over it or go somewhere else. The service isn't the "lightning fast" expectation of modern America; not at rush times like lunch or dinner. Your pizza isn't constructed in advance, cooked and waiting in a warmer oven for you to walk in like Little Cesears, It's cooked once you order it and.even if NOBODY else has an order in before you it's going to take 15 to 20 minutes for it to be prepared and to properly cook. Again, if you're impatient then go somewhere else.As for me and my friends, we understand and appreciate that part of the experience that is Fleur de Lis is that it IS an experience, not just a meal. Maybe it's not the sort of thing some people appreciate, but that's to be expected - not everybody wants to wait or finds dark and old to be interesting. They sure must be doing something right though - just check 225 magazine etc. and you will find them "Best Pizza in Town" if not every year then quite often.  As far as "dirty," I suggest people who think that check with the city's restaurant inspection listings - I don't think you'll find any violations... so that's just not the case. If it were there'd be health code violations listed.So, all in all... don't diss mah favourite pizza place! Very BUSY place! Kick back and RELAX! Your server isn't ignoring you, she just has eight other tables of people just as hungry and demanding to deal with.
<review# 59,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2013,9/27/2014,74,83,1,6,3>I have become a massage addict due to Vida Pura Spa. Rebecca does an amazing job with lots of little extra touches, like hot stones, essential oils, etc. She may be small, but she is seriously strong and can work out even the worst knots in my shoulders and back. The hour massage is definitely the way to go, but if you only have a time for 30 minutes, the shoulder and back massage is pretty awesome too. "Like" her on Facebook to keep up with her promotions -- her spa does facials, mud wraps, etc. as well, but really, the massage is KEY.Tip: Her spa is a *little* bit difficult to find -- the best way to go is down Siegen away from i10 and taking a right at its intersection with Airline Hwy onto the frontage road.
<review# 60,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2013,9/26/2014,23,18,2,5,4>Expensive, but worth it.The food here is beyond heavenly and perfect. I didn't have ANY problem with ANYTHING I tasted.I had seafood ravioli and I could have eaten five more plates of it. It was superb.You can't go wrong with anything you get here.My only bad note is that the atmosphere was awkwardly dark and quiet. I didn't want to say anything because I knew that everyone could hear me. But the food made up for that. :)Highly recommended.

Its usually quiet, casual, and the cheesecake is also delicious! Wish they included less carbs and more greens in their plate servings though.
<review# 62,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2014,9/24/2014,24,19,5,5,3>So like most people, my friends and I saw the show that this restaurant was on. So we thought, "How cool! A restaurant in our town! Yay Baton Rouge pride!" So we went during lunch one afternoon to see what the hype was about. I will say first that it was some of the best pizza I've ever had. However, the way my friends and I were treated makes me fearful to ever go back. We were greeted by a cashier and the man who owns the place. The owner started questioning us as to why we're were even there. The questioning slowly turned to interrogation. He seemed angry when we told him we saw the show. Then he went on a rant defending himself. All the while the cashier was asking what we wanted and giving suggestions. There was so much going on I had to leave the situation just so I could read the menu. I learned later that the owner had insulted one of my friends (who hadn't even seen the show) telling her she should stop trusting what she sees on tv and basically telling her she was stupid for reading into things! I don't know what was worse, the ranting owner or the cashier that kept interrupting him and rolling her eyes. It looked like no one respected this man, and he's the owner! Once I finally was able to read the menu and decide what I wanted I came to find out that they were out of most things. This started another rant about how they are so busy because of the show that they run out of things or they don't have time to make them fast enough. The cashier even told us that the owner was supposed to be making meatballs instead of lecturing us! Good grief I didn't care. I just wanted some damn food at this point. When we finally ordered and sat, the food came out fast. It was really good! It's so good I may go back. However, it will definitely be a while before I recover from such service. I am giving this restaurant 4 stars based on food because it was really good. However, if you go DO NOT MENTION YOU SAW THE SHOW!
<review# 63,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2014,9/23/2014,1,10,1,3,4>Great place with delicious yogurt! Very clean place and very nice owner. Tuesday is kids day! Local bakery has sweets that look delicious!  We will definitely be back! Also coffee and cappuccinos!
<review# 64,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2014,9/22/2014,16,12,1,2,3>The beignets here are absolutely delicious! I brought my mom here when she visited a few months ago, and I am so glad I picked this place! Being brand new to the beignet scene, I had only had them at Cafe du Monde while in the FQ. My mom had never had a beignet before, and I definitely thought it was worth the trip. We went on a weekday morning, and it was surprisingly busy which I knew was a good sign. We ordered fingerling beignets and cafe au laits. The fingerlings were hot and crispy when they came out, so definitely made to order. The price was very reasonable, as well. The atmosphere, while small and possibly a bit cramped when busy, is still very pleasant and quite clean! The service was very friendly and helpful when we told them we were first time customers. I would definitely recommend Rue Beignet if you are looking for well priced, made to order, authentic beignets.
<review# 65,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/15/2014,9/21/2014,95,166,2,3,5>I'm so glad this opened in my neighborhood. It's within walking distance from my house and I love going over there and getting a smoothie or a juice. It's always kinda quiet in there so I find it a little intimidating. The employees are nice and helpful. It just takes forever for them to whip up your drink. I have been wanting to do a juice cleanse but it's rather expensive. I mean a smoothie is $9!  You could drive down the street to Smoothie King and get one for $5 but it wouldn't be as good of quality or healthier. They have some sort of rewards method where you give them your cell number and you get points. I've yet to receive a discount so we shall see!
<review# 66,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2013,9/20/2014,4,6,,3,2>This place really should have a lot more people there every day.  I love their catfish poboy.  It is so fluffly and full of food and definitely worth the money.  Delicious!
<review# 67,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/17/2014,9/19/2014,0,7,3,5,1>The sign on the door is in Spanish, that tells you how authentic it is. Tried the chicken, pork, and beef tacos, each tasted a little different. Their prices are reasonable, they have salsas and pico/cilantro/onions out where you can help yourself. A little difficult to get into during lunch time traffic but worth a visit.
<review# 68,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2013,9/18/2014,0,4,1,3,>Wonderful Flavors, Great Service.  This was a real treat for lunch today.  Started with the best salsa in Baton Rouge.  Good heat and fresh taste.  Had the tamales with chili for appetizer and we were all impressed.  When our entrees arrived, they were beautifully plated and once again we were impressed with the quality and quantity.  Seafood entrees were very tasty and traditional entrees were well seasoned.  By far the best Mexican food in Baton Rouge.  Can't wait to eat my way through the menu!  Can't end without mentioning the service.  Everything was timed perfectly and the server was very attentive.  The type of flawless service you expect in from higher end restaurants.
<review# 69,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/18/2014,9/17/2014,50,194,,2,3>I recently visited TJ Ribs because I wanted a steak from somewhere close.  I'm not usually a big fan of TJ's, but they won me over on this occasion.  I started with the wings.  Delicious.  Wing/Flap combo that were really big.  "Smoked 12 hours".  I got the chipotle sauce on the side, which was a good call b/c I barely used it, the flavor of the unsauced wings was so good.  For the main course I had the special.  Pan seared redfish with a meunier sauce on top along with fried crawfish tails and sautéed shrimp and red and green and yellow peppers.  They called it the Mardi Gras and there was definitely a Carnival in my mouth.  I didn't expect such a good seafood plate at a BBQ joint.  And...only $17.99 (included 2 sides).  A steak worth eating will run you at least $25 at this locale, so the fish special was a pleasant surprise to both my taste buds and my wallet.

Couyon's is hands down the best BBQ I've ever had, including anything in Memphis. Try the brisket tacos. Loaded potato casserole is the bomb diggity.
<review# 71,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2014,9/15/2014,3,122,,2,3>Great sandwich shop at the North Gate of LSU campus. Everything is fresh and prepared when ordered and the menu selection covers a range to suit almost anyone -- from fresh salads, to cheese steak, to veggie burger, to Cuban, to chicken, to shrimp. It is all pretty basic, but definitely good food.
<review# 72,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2014,9/14/2014,63,48,1,4,4>Get their newsletter! The oldest cigar shop in BR. This spot is definitely paying a visit to. You have friendly patriots who are willing to help you narrow down the choices & even help you if It is your first time. It may not be fancy inside but it is your neighborhood, locally owned shop to get expert advice. They have a lounge area where you can relax & take a load off, free magazines.Also, on Friday's the elderly crowd gather around to discuss the local issues, sports, politics & daily grind so for me this is where community starts-at the grassroots level. You can also find them on fb too. Their prices are reasonable and they carry a select quantity highly desired pieces, they also have great pipes for sale that range from $50 to $700, something I would like to invest in soon.*They offer law enforcement, firefighter & military discount as well.

I really love the Dude, Strawberry Fields 4-Ever, and the Chocolate Sunshine. The only downside to this place is its location.

<review# 77,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2014,9/9/2014,14,22,5,3,4>If you like greasy delicious pizza, being fat and happy, or eating so much that you list the pros and cons of both driving home or just sleeping there in the booth, then this place is for you! If you care about your six pack abs, know what a carb is, or prefer to eat a salad and act like you're full, then don't bother coming here. Seriously, the pizza is awesome and it's a great atmosphere to go grab a beer or 7. Beware, it is fairly warm inside there with all the ovens and lack of a/c. Also, the draft beer sizes are 10oz and 34oz, quite a difference in sizes
<review# 78,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/16/2013,9/7/2014,19,141,1,6,4>I recently treated my parents out here for my dad's birthday and it was the first time going for all of us. We all loved the food, which is quite the compliment for this place coming from an Italian family that grew up cooking good Italian food. The appetizer bread is good, but I really wish they would cut down a bit on the butter - it was pretty much soaked through and through. I also ordered the Italian style char-grilled oysters and the fried green tomato appetizers. The oysters were delicious but possibly some of the smallest I've seen, so I probably wouldn't get them again because they just weren't worth the price. The fried green tomato appetizer was nothing short of incredible, and between the three of us we had that bowl cleaned in about a minute. The sauce over them is great, though a bit heavy and rich so keep that in mind. It also comes with fried shrimp which for me was just a bit too much breading on one dish. They would probably be willing to sub sauteed shrimp if asked, which I would rather recommend. My dad and I were thinking about getting some beers to go with dinner so we asked about a happy hour and the waitress told us "Only at the bar". This pretty much confused the hell out of us because I could glance over my shoulder and see I was seated about 10 feet from the bar. Did she expect me to get up and walk to the bar to get my drinks? We decided against getting beers so they missed out on a bit of $$ by confusing us with that one. Most of the entrees come with a side salad, and I got mine with the house dressing which was quite tasty. They do throw a bit of rotini on the salad, which I enjoyed but my dad claimed ruined it for him despite devouring every bite. That's old Italian men for you, I suppose. For my entree I had the Veal Picatta, and the flavor was great but the meat cutlet was maybe 2 ounces tops so next time I would get the chicken... just not enough meat for me. The sauce blended perfectly with the angel hair pasta and capers. In comparison, my dad ordered some sort of stuffed Chicken Parmesan which came out with an absolutely massive chicken breast. It was supposed to be stuffed with pancetta but he said he couldn't taste any, and to me none was visible while he was eating. That being said, he once again ate every bite of it. My mom had ordered a grilled Chicken Pesto dish, which appeared to be full of chunks of chicken and she said was very good. The portion sizes were all filling enough, though as I said before mine was maybe 5% meat and 95% pasta, while my dad's was about 50/50 and my mom's about 40/60. I have no idea why they would choose to skimp so much on meat in some dishes and load up others. I get that veal is expensive, but a serving on top of pasta shouldn't look like it was meant for a Carpaccio appetizer. In summation, I definitely recommend this restaurant, but there are a number of little things they could tweak here and there to take it from a 4-star experience to a 5-star one.

<review# 80,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2014,9/5/2014,1,9,,1,2>This is Lafayette's best kept secret. To many of you, it looks like just another BBQ place at a gas station. Go inside and I promise you that the food will blow you away. The chicken falls off the bone. The ribs falls off the bone. I'm not a fan of their sides but that's ok because I can cook that on my own. The only bummer is that it's closed on Sundays and most of us Cajuns love to eat BBQ on a Sunday.
<review# 81,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,9/4/2014,4,9,,1,2>I really enjoy the food here. The hibachi is great (although it's not displayed), sushi is fresh, and the staff is really friendly. We've tried all of the appetizers, several of the sushi rolls (not the raw ones), and all of the hibachi. I can't find anything bad to say about any of it. I recommend the steak hibachi!
<review# 82,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,9/3/2014,22,6,,1,2>When our vet told us that it was time to euthanize our beloved 14 year old Papillon,  we were devastated.  It was important to me that Tosca's last breath be taken in her bed, in her home, surrounded by those that loved her, and because of Dr. Carrie her passing was peaceful, most of all, devoid of fear.  Dr. Carrie is a kind and caring professional and she provided our family with a valuable service.   I will be forever grateful to her for providing us this very special moment and final memory.
<review# 83,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/3/2014,9/2/2014,3,14,,,1>My husband and I went here for a date night and really enjoyed the ambience and the food. It has a warm, modern decor and feels very inviting. I had the sweet fashion (a citrus infused take on an old fashion). It was strong and well balanced, always a great start to the evening. We split a few tapas-- the gnocchi, tacos, and egg rolls. All had interesting flavor combinations and tasted sophisticated and fresh. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is because our first order of gnocchi came out cold and although they did refire the dish, no one from management came over to speak with us and no offers were made to go above and beyond to rectify the situation. That, to me, is a service that really sets a restaurant apart. But other than that, we were very pleased with the food and drinks, and would definitely come back!
<review# 84,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/2/2014,9/1/2014,122,389,2,6,8>This place has only recently opened and is an indoor recreation area and is for kids from 2 yoa up to about 10 yoa... They have several separate areas for the various ages of children... they have a reading nook, an engineering/science section with tables with gears and other such stuff for active little minds...They have a cool fort with slides and climbing sections and rope bridges for the older kids to play on and in.... this thing is totally enclosed for the kids' safety and they also have a section with a couple of smaller slides for the kids not ready or able to handle the big fort.... plus there is an indoor bouncy castle...Refreshments are available for purchase but one really cool thing is you can bring in your own food and drinks...They also have a section with tables and seating for the parents and for the kids to eat, either the food the parent has brought in or purchased refreshments...Lastly they are available for birthday parties and have a nice sized room in which to hold such a gathering... also you can purchase memberships or pay by the visit....
<review# 85,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/17/2014,8/31/2014,5,23,3,6,5>Best Chinese restaurant in Denham Springs, by far. And great customer service. This is somewhat embarrassing for me, but I get the general tso's chicken and sweet and sour shrimp to go about 3 times a month and the owner recognizes my voice on the phone. They give you tons of food!!! My husband and I could share an order of the general tso's chicken but I'm stingy so we get separate orders. I'm not a huge fan of Chinese food, I prefer Japanese, but this place is great. It's very very fresh and not dried up and greasy like most Chinese food. My husband loves Chinese so I have to compromise sometimes and this is about the only place I've found that I actually truly enjoy the food.
<review# 86,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2014,8/30/2014,11,30,1,2,3>The staff was very friendly, the muffuletta was good and didn't have the super thick bread. The Patin burger was spicer than i'd expected it should have been. Low key place that doesn't mind kids which is great. No kids menu though. Very interesting selection of food, can't wait to go back to try more!
<review# 87,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/5/2013,8/29/2014,8,16,2,4,4>So my friend and I just ate here, trying to find a hole in the wall kind of place. At first glance you wouldn't expect this place to be good or friendly. We ordered the seafood gumbo and 6 fried shrimp. It was the best gumbo I have ever had. The fried shrimp was also something to dream about. The dinner was topped off by a story from the owner, Binh, about his life which let me tell you, is worth listening to. It's not wonder why the food is so damn good, it's made by a man and woman who have a lot of love. Cheesy I know, but true.
<review# 88,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2014,8/28/2014,6,10,1,3,3>The Seigen store has a majority of sale items! I can always count of Bella Bella to have a cute pair of sale shoes for as low as $10!!! Plus they have a ton of regular priced merchandise. LOVE!!
<review# 89,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/23/2014,8/27/2014,1,13,2,7,6>We have eaten here several times.  We had lunch here today.  For our appetizers we ordered the fried pickles,  they were a little too salty, but good and crisp and not soggy.  We also ordered a 5 pc. Boneless wings in hot sauce; they were great with the right amount of sauce & the fall apart tenderness was good.  For our entrées we ordered the Open Faced Roast beef poboy and the Chicken Sandwich.  My husband really enjoyed his chicken sandwich,  he ordered it fried and with hot sauce on it.  I didn't enjoy the roast beef as much.  I ordered the gravy on the side and it was like water, not really a gravy.  I suppose I am also more accustomed to a shredded roast beef on this type of poboy and not a sliced roast beef.  The flavor was just off to me (and it may be because I am pregnant & pregnancy taste buds are different and picky at times).But to make up for the lack in food taste of the roast beef... was the service.  TYLER was the most wonderful server I have ever had in a restaurant ever!!!  FANTASTIC service!!  He was always checking on us, made sure we had what we needed & wanted, made our dining experience a great one!! If you ever dine here, make sure to ask for him as your server, you will not be disappointed.
<review# 90,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/6/2014,8/26/2014,30,85,2,2,2>So far so good... I've only been here once, so I can't be too specific, but I do like the concept. The plate lunch was pretty good, and the menu seems pretty exciting. I'll definitely have to go back and try a lot more, but I did manage to grab a box of their pretty tasty fried chicken skin!!. Just keep 911 on speed dial.
<review# 91,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2014,8/25/2014,0,9,2,2,2>Man this place was great! I've been meaning to try it for awhile and finally did. It is local which is also cool! I has the fish tacos which were made with panko breaded fish and the flavor was SUPER!I highly recommend this place!
<review# 92,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/17/2013,8/24/2014,179,366,2,6,3>Heard so much about this place, so decided to give it a shot.  They have really nice decor and ambiance, a little small, but isn't all coffee spots?  The people here are nice and helpful, and doesn't mind answering questions.  We had the following:- NOLA Style Iced Coffee - which was pretty decent, I like my coffee a tad bit stronger.- Nutella Croissant - this was decent, they had to microwave it, so it was probably sitting out for a while.. so it probably lost it's flakiness, nevertheless, it was decent- Swamp Pop - I was so excited to hear that they carry swamp pop, I've been waiting on the release of these suckers since forever, I had got the Praline Cream Soda, and it was good!I can't wait to come back to try the other goodies they have here!
<review# 93,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/8/2014,8/23/2014,1,13,,2,3>I've been to the Chimes several times since moving to Baton Rouge; tried it the first time and then went back because it was just good! (Duh?) It's a young atmosphere and it does get VERY crowded, but the food is good, the price is good and the servers are prompt to make up for all the hustle and bustle.
<review# 94,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2014,8/22/2014,30,7,1,4,4>I have enjoyed every trip to Lock and Key whiskey bar. They have an informative, fun, and happening Women and Whiskey Wednesday I think the 3rd Wednesday of the month.  Most of the regulars are fun and friendly and intelligent. I love the abundance of sofas and cozy seating areas. Every bartender I interacted with including the owner was skillful, knowledgeable, informative and fun!  They have a whole page of some of the best unique craft cocktails in town. I would feel very comfortable coming here alone as a single woman and I'm sure id have a great time!  It's a great grown up bar without feeling pretentious and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I'll be back fo sho
<review# 95,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/18/2014,8/21/2014,1,4,1,4,5>Delicious! I had the salmon pasta and the sauce wasn't too heavy or too thin it was perfect and had the right creaminess and garlic with tomato. The salmon was excellent! Our waiter was awesome and this place is one to come back too!
<review# 96,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/24/2013,8/20/2014,19,6,2,11,7>This establishment is truly a gem in Baton Rouge and is one of my most happy-making places worldwide. The name is slightly misleading, though, as it doesn't do justice to their excellent selection of fresh and customizable hot tea options. Since they gather the leaves and create the tea bags by hand, you can request any combination of flavors and scents for a truly excellent tea experience.They also have delicious freshly-made soft granola bars, cakes, and stuffed croissants. No one cares if you're there for hours. Park your bike on the rack, say hi to the regulars, put some honey in your tea, and enjoy the free wi-fi.In late May, sit under the honeysuckle trellis. To maximize your pleasure, do this when it's just about to start raining. Don't be afraid of the humidity; the smell alone is worth it.
<review# 97,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2014,8/19/2014,19,19,,2,1>I haven't tried any of the food items like the sandwiches or anything but I have had their yogurt, super tart, just add strawberries on top and I'm in heaven. Yum yum, just the way I like it. :3
<review# 98,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2013,8/18/2014,418,77,1,1,1>I am basing my rating mostly on service, although the food was quite good, I hardly ever have a server pay such close attention to detail without hovering or being overbearing. Honestly, the simple things like omitting tomatoes on my salad because I asked for them to be left off of my sandwich and simple suggestions are really hard to come by in standard dining. I was quite impressed. Being the roast beef nerd that I am, I got the poboy. My only complaints would be that there is not enough meat for my taste (order double next time) and the au jus that was served on the side, was very salty (didn't need it anyway.) My salad had their house garlic Parmesan dressing and this vinaigrette was really tasty, as long as you love a lot of garlic (glad Im taken.) I stole a fried shrimp off of my dining partner's plate and it has best batter I've had in a while. It was almost as light as tempura. I really can't wait to go back there to try more food, especially if Andrew is there to wait on me! (No I don't have a man crush, he was just that good!)
<review# 99,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/14/2014,8/17/2014,33,23,,3,4>Coming from Illinois and (deep dish) I thought good pizza would be hard to find. However, this pizza is so good it even taste good for lunch the next day. I had the supreme which was packed with jumbo sized toppings. If you looking to spend a little extra for some good pizza this is the laid back casual place for you! The atmosphere is bar/pizzeria which I like.
<review# 100,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/9/2014,8/16/2014,8,61,1,2,1>Consistently, reliably good bar & grill food and Louisiana seafood. Easily on par with Sammy's, without the long wait times and noisy crowds. The soups and gumbos here are especially good in the winter. The poboys are also  awesome. I like their French dip better than most in the BR area. Service is always friendly and attentive, although the food does not always come out super fast. It's never been long enough for me to complain; just sometimes feels a tad slower than similar establishments. (Definitely not a reason to skip going there. Even if you're starving, there are baskets of crackers on the tables). Dempsey's is definitely worth a visit.
<review# 101,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/19/2014,8/15/2014,62,129,2,5,4>The Cove is a connoisseur's dream with an elite collection of rare beer, world renowned Scotch and Bourbon, masterfully crafted cocktails to please every drinker's wildest desires,all served up by the best bartenders in Baton Rouge! The Cove is in my Top 5 Bars in the country! Yeah, its that good!Like Ahab, I'm always on the hunt for the white whales of the beer world. I've driven hundreds of miles and scheduled long layovers to make pilgrimages to score a bottle of the best the beer world has to offer. The cove saves me the expense of travels by keeping about 475 bottles in house and about 40 drafts in the tap room. This isn't just inflated numbers with most shelf space taken up by brands of the domestic giants, but a highly respectful and well researched collection of the best beers in the world. I would put their list up against anyone's in the country. The list is usually heavy on Belgians. The only thing about the bottle room is to make sure you have a backup. They may be out of a few beers. However the beers I did have were insane! The Scotch game is ridiculous and some rare and coveted bottles on the shelves. I've only had a few, but each was definitely worth the price of admission.Besides having a treasure trove of alcohol, The Cove boasts the best servers in the city that take care of the customer. These people are not here for a job, but booze is their passion and all are very knowledgeable. Chris who runs the tap room is a certified Cicerone. I thought I knew everything about beer and he routinely puts me in my place and makes me look like a child with his Wikipedia like knowledge of fermentia. Cocktail whiz Joey whips up some of the most perfectly made drinks I've ever had. Also, they know scotch and ask you about your preferences and help steer you to the right choice. They all have done things in the past to go the extra mile and make every Cove experience memorable.The decor is kind of sparse but I don't go there for the ambiance. The biggest things I dislike about the Cove is the smoke and location. Other than that, The Cove is almost perfect. Its one of the things I love most about living in Baton Rouge!
<review# 102,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/9/2014,8/14/2014,19,19,1,1,2>$15 for all you can eat sushi? Yeah, this place is worth it. Also, you can order as much as you want at a time. Just make sure you eat everything you order or you can get charged, which makes sense
<review# 103,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/4/2014,8/13/2014,31,68,2,4,3>Lovelovelove French Market Bistro.  The in-laws go every other Friday, sit at their table, and have the same waitress (Susan!).  We are invited every once in awhile and I have never had a bad meal.  Susan is so personable and on top of her game with the service.  The food is always great, fresh, and substitutions aren't an issue.  They have a good wine list but you can bring your own (which we normally do, I don't know the corkage fee, however).  We've had a large party there as well (12 maybe?) and they sat us up front, it's by the door but cut off from the main dining room so it feels a little more intimate.  The bar set up is a little strange (you walk past the back of the bar and around to the bar which has about 8 seats) but most people are coming for dinner, and I'm sure it would get super crowded if the seats were in the walkway. They have art on the walls that's for sale by local artists and it changes every so often, great stuff.I will always recommend the Crab Cakes, the Napa Salad, and the Warm Duck Salad, I know the linguine+clams are a favorite at our table, and the specials are always well-received!  Prices are moderate, a little on the high side but for a  small restaurant doing it right (and down the street from the country club), I have no problems paying for great service, great ambience, and great food!Edited to add:  We usually end the meal with a slice of cheesecake, but I've had almost everything else on the dessert menu and they are all great!
<review# 104,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2013,8/12/2014,1,7,2,4,3>Best dogs in town, hands down.   The service is quick and friendly.  You can watch them prepare your food in the kitchen behind the counter.  They keep the place extremely CLEAN, which is a rarity from my experience.  I enjoyed the Philly Cheese, and have tried the Dawg House as well, both very filling and delicious.  The thing that I have to mention that you MUST TRY however is their tater tots.  They are the best I've ever had, hands down.  Try them plain, or get the loaded tots and enjoy.Prices are solid too, this is a great place for lunch or even dinner on a weeknight.  If I lived closer, I would try to hit this place up for late night too.
<review# 105,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/26/2014,8/11/2014,5,55,2,3,2>This is my go to place for chicken pho soup!  It's the perfect meal when I am fighting off a cold or just not feeling well.I really enjoy the taste of the broth and the wonderful fresh vegetables that are served with the soup.Consistently good service and great pricing.
<review# 106,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2014,8/10/2014,20,5,2,3,2>Outstanding is my word for Stroubes. Though we have only eaten there a handful of times for a meal, we have visited the bar area and ordered appetizers more frequently. Can't go wrong at Stroubes!
<review# 107,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/17/2014,8/9/2014,39,40,2,2,2>Large portions but heavy on the price. My family of 4 absolutely loved that we could get Yogurtland quality make your own yogurt in the same place as we got delicious Vietnamese cuisine! Nice, clean atmosphere with good service too. Only reason I gave it a 4 was because I expected lunch prices, but they only have the one menu so it seemed a little high. Would definitely return though!
<review# 108,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,8/8/2014,6,13,2,2,2>Exceptional sushi.  Best flavors.  Fresh and delicious.  Thank you God that I live nearby.  I'm coming back again & again.  Their specialty rolls average $9.95.  Baton Rouge roll probably the best.   And tonight is Saturday & this place is packed with large parties of 10+.
<review# 109,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/18/2014,8/7/2014,4,17,1,4,2>This place is great for date night! If you're downtown for "Live after 5" on Friday nights, this is a great place to go afterwards! I've been to the downtown one and to the one off of Sherwood Forrest for live music night on Thursdays. Everything I've tried has been excellent!! My favorite, the grilled fish tacos!
<review# 110,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/2/2014,8/6/2014,5,12,1,4,3>The food was amazing! The bartenders were friendly and they even asked if we wasted to request a specific type of music! I loved it!  Even though its a short drive I'm going back!
<review# 111,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/24/2014,8/5/2014,5,7,2,2,2>Great food, great employees, great prices, good atmosphere. This is a place that could benefit from having a larger building. Parking limitations can be frustrating sometimes, especially when you are ordering to go for lunch, which is the only reason I don't give it 5 stars. Wish there was a way to give it 4 and 1/2.
<review# 112,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2014,8/4/2014,4,118,2,2,3>It took me 11 months to make my way to Zippy's and my only regret now is that I didn't come sooner.  This place doesn't have the best reputation, but I enjoyed it for many reasons.  Good food, nice service, great outdoor seating, nice beer selection, and good drink specials.  I look forward to coming back here often, especially during World Cup.
<review# 113,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/23/2014,8/3/2014,100,239,2,5,3>It's about time they built a Rum House in Baton Rouge! I've always loved the original location in New Orleans, but it's nice to have one here too.First off the food is every bit as amazing as it is at the NOLA location. The atmosphere is awesome, especially with the Captain's chairs lined up on the inside bar and the swings on the outside bar. It definitely different than the NOLA location, but it still has the same vibe.Personal favorites of mine here are the lamb vindaloo tacos, the jerk chicken tacos, the chopped shrimp, tacos, the damn good nachos, and the rasta veggies. Every now and then I'll have an item I find too sweet, but that doesn't mean someone else will.I don't have any actual complaints. The biggest gripe I had was that i had to park in the field by the shopping center, but that's so minor it almost seems petty to point out. If you like eclectic food you'll probably enjoy yourself here.
<review# 114,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/17/2014,8/2/2014,22,45,1,3,2>I've eaten at Le Creole a handful of times. I've been impressed with the food, drinks and service each time. I've loved every item I've been able to try. I would highly recommend the Cajun lemonade from the bar, it tastes like an herbal tea. I can't say enough positive things about Le Creole.
<review# 115,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/2/2014,8/1/2014,1,5,,3,2>The thing I like about Sno's is the fact that anything goes as far as attire is concerned. It is a true 'Come As You Are' restaurant. Tonight was a great example of this with business suits at one table, a guy wearing a wife beater at another, at least one John Deere camouflage cap in the room and everything in between. Personally I enjoy the people watching potential here but the best part is that the management and wait staff treat everyone equally respectfully. The dining room does remind me of an old geriatric banquet hall a little but I can tell there have been some recent updates, including the restroom and parking lot area.I was very pleased with my dish of Chicken Florentine with a steamed vegetable medley. The vegetables were perfectly seasoned and cooked just the right amount. Not soggy, slightly crisp. The chicken was grilled through without being dry and I could easily make a meal out of the creamed spinach topping. There is a lighter/healthy version of this dish under the 'Ideal' menu and I appreciate that should I ever have the will to opt for it.We started with an appetizer of seafood stuffed mushrooms and they were excellent. The mushrooms were not overly juicy which tends to ruin them for me when fried but not here. Dessert was a slice of Charlie's Cheesecake to go. It is always phenomenal but I did feel a little slighted since I got home to see it was just a sliver and not even close to the picture shown on the menu. I hope that was an oversight due to it being a to-go order. I didn't need to eat a big hunk anyhow.I also noticed the parking lot is monitored with a nice security system that is consistently viewed from the hostess/manager station. I will be back soon.
<review# 116,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/29/2013,7/31/2014,1,18,2,3,2>We so glad to get to see a wine bar in downtown.  Blend has a great atmosphere and a staff that knows and appreciates wine.  What makes Blend truly special is the food...   The new chef is inventive and loves to experiment.   The menu focuses on local, updates every day and we love it all.   Standouts are the short ribs with peaches glacé  - heavenly, the  BBQ shrimp and the desserts.Great spot for after work of for an event (the upstairs space is really nice)With food this good, I wish they were open for lunch.
<review# 117,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/3/2014,7/30/2014,110,62,2,5,3>Calandro's is great for stopping in when you need something quickly and do not want to wait in line. They have lots of specialty items and a good selection of in house prepared salads and dips. The beer selection is also vast.  I also like that they carry the Boar's Head line of meats and cheeses in the deli. Pricing is a little more than the big box stores but often worth it for the convenience. This store is always clean and the staff helpful.
<review# 118,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/25/2014,7/29/2014,0,14,2,2,1>Bin77 is my hands down favorite bar/restaurant in Baton Rouge. I make a point to go at least once a week.When I first started frequenting the establishment, I never had trouble getting a table. Recently, business seems to have picked up, and on several recent visits I've been forced to wait out a table at the bar or find another place to eat. They have several high top tables, multiple low tables with cushy seats and lots of outdoor seating. The outdoor area shares space with The Loft (which is right next door). I haven't explored the drink list much, but I am always satisfied with the wine selection. The pours are generous and I've sent back a glass I didn't particularly care for without any problems. I think they also do wine tastings on Thursdays but I haven't had the opportunity to make it yet.The food is delicious, but a bit pricey. By far the most tasty and best portion for your dollar (in my opinion) is the Bin Burger, substitute truffle fries and chive aioli. People, if you have anything to eat here, have the truffle fries. They are epic. Also recommended are the flatbreads - all very tasty. I love me some Bin77 and look forward to my next visit. Highly recommended.
<review# 119,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/4/2013,7/28/2014,3,3,2,3,3>My husband and I have been going here for 14 years.  We go at least once a week.  The food is AMAZING!  We love the atmosphere and the staff.  We have taken a lot of our friends with us on several occasions, who we have now turned into regulars as well.  I personally have not been in the kitchen of this restaurant, but I have always imagined an older, 4 foot tall Italian woman back there doing all the cooking.  If you have not been here, do not hesitate to try it.  You will become a regular too.
<review# 120,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,7/27/2014,3,10,1,4,3>Love this salon. Warm and friendly atmosphere. My stylist Jensen is amazing. He transformed my blonde straw to look like hair again. I walked out loving my new style.
<review# 121,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/15/2014,7/26/2014,19,36,2,4,4>I've visited this joint more than 10 times. I've not been disappointed yet. The $4 bottomless champagne is worth the trip alone. People also rave about the bloody Mary's but I don't drink them so I've not ever tried it. So for the food, you must try the sweet potato pancakes. They are by far one of my favs from the menu. There is also this seafood sauce that randomly shows up on a few meals.... If you have something with seafood chances are you should add it. It's great over the seafood or steak omelette. The fries seafood is always a winner as well. And don't forget to add a cup of gumbo with your meal. Best way to start! But did I mention $4 unlimited champagne??? Lol great reasturant, always great service, and awesome atmosphere!
<review# 122,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/1/2014,7/25/2014,20,57,2,4,3>This is my go to Chinese food stop.  Not the biggest, nicest, or best around, but they are consistently good.  I have not had a bad choice yet on the menu.  Seem to always order the Mei Fun, so that is a favorite.
<review# 123,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/10/2014,7/24/2014,7,5,2,3,2>A fairly new daiquiri shop in Baton Rouge and my favorite!!! It's a SMOKE-FREE shop with a variety of flavors. Their specials are AMAZING. I wish they would open up another location closer to LSU.
<review# 124,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,7/23/2014,30,8,1,3,2>Fantastic arrangements and great value. I spoke with Ms. Matte who normally works in the Government St. location but was at the Staring Lane Heroman's. I explained to her what I was looking for and she assured me that she would make something special. A few hours later, I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Matte in person when she gave me the most beautiful arrangement. It was exactly what I had envisioned and she told me that she closed her eyes and let the flowers talk to her after speaking with me. I was beyond thrilled and so was she. My interaction with her completely made my day and my friend loved the arrangement to boot. I can honestly say that I don't think I have ever had a better customer service experience and Heroman's gained a customer for life.
<review# 125,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2014,7/22/2014,98,6,1,4,3>Absolutely the best. Tuna Lover is my favorite but I also love the lobster roll and the salmon appetizer. They amaze me each and every time.
<review# 126,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/22/2013,7/21/2014,18,4,1,4,2>I won't go anywhere else! I got a full set a couple of weeks ago and they still look great. The ladies there were super nice. For $20 my nails looked like a million bucks! Very clean, comfortable atmosphere. I would recommend this salon to everyone.

<review# 128,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,7/19/2014,23,43,,2,1>Best kolaches in town. The fruit based ones are my favorite. Cheap, but large servings. Great for college students strapped for cash.
<review# 129,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/23/2014,7/18/2014,2,3,,2,1>Good atmosphere. Cheap eats. Chicken and waffles. There's also a very Canes-like sauce on the side. Get the willy wich.
<review# 130,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/2/2014,7/17/2014,26,4,,2,>Latte e Miele is a local gem. Inventive flavors, great staff, and a cool vibe. Try one of their homemade sodas. I'm not a soda drinker so I consider these a special treat. We've hosted events here for Creative Louisiana and always get great reviews from attendees about the great atmosphere.
<review# 131,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/5/2014,7/16/2014,0,10,1,4,3>Tres tres magnifique!This place blew my mind.  I found Maison Lacour mostly by accident:  my family came to visit Baton Rouge and we wanted somewhere with great food that we hadn't tried yet.  Maison Lacour was listed on the pricier end, but had fantastic reviews.  And with good reason!Now we have been back a second time, and I can tell you it's just as good--if not better--when knowing exactly what to expect when you walk through the doors.  The service is impeccable, the atmosphere is both relaxed and comfortable as well as feeling high-class.  It really is like you stepped through a door into the real French roots of la Louisiane.  Those commenting on the slow service may not have known that this is how restaurants with several courses work.  It is supposed to be relaxed time to enjoy your friends or family--the waitress is far from inattentive:  Neither our wine glasses nor our waters were ever empty.  I have nothing but good to say about the service.The Food:  The Shrimp Ravioli was so fantastic that we ordered it as our appetizer on both trips.  The Escargot is as good as any you'll find in France.The house salad and vinaigrette is delicious.  It's got pickled red onions (don't knock them until you've tried them if you think you don't like onions in your salad, both my husband and I feel that way about raw onions in our salads, but not so with these!), walnuts.  Since we had four people dining each time, we got to taste many things on the menu.  Personally, I had Carré d'Agneau (lamb rack) the first time and Sweetbread the second time--the sweetbread is probably the best thing I've ever put into my mouth.  Other dishes our party got over the two trips included:  John's Favorite (it was awesome!), Steak au Poivre (it was very good, but the other more traditionally Southern France dishes still knocked it out of the park), Flounder En Papillote, Wild Boar Chops, Crevettes Baton Rouge (spicy shirmp over angel hair pasta), and Rock Dove. As you can see, we tried a wide variety on the menu, and it was all very very good.  Open your mind to possibilities, and try a little something from France!  FYI:  The Eva Special Chocolate Martini is absolutely to die for.  Try it and you won't be disappointed.  It somehow tastes like actual chocolate cake.
<review# 132,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/26/2013,7/15/2014,32,17,1,6,4>Top notch.Perfect place for a great steak. Doe's is a genuine steak house. They're not pretentious, not overly sophisticated - they're simply a great, laid back spot for one of the best steaks in Baton Rouge.
<review# 133,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2014,7/14/2014,9,6,1,4,3>My family & I love this place! Always good food, always good service! My favorite appetizer is the Coach's plate and the cheese fries. My favorite main course is the seafood au gratin and you've got to try the blueberry bread pudding for dessert!! Yum!
<review# 134,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/10/2014,7/13/2014,22,50,1,3,2>If you're looking for south Louisiana style seafood, and don't mind paying for it,  then this might be the place for you.  The charbroiled oysters are some of the best around.  I always catch myself watching the grill chef's do their magic.  If you liked fried, they have you covered.  They also offer broiled seafood platter and a few other broiled dishes. If you like variety or not quite sure what to order, the 7 ways shrimp or crawfish dinner is a great way to try smaller portions of various dishes.   The shrimp and trout norman are topped with the crabmeat etouffee but the crawfish etouffee is far better tasting and seasoned.  I find the crabmeat etouffee to be bland and a smoother consistency like baby food.  If you want gumbo as meal, order the bowl.   The cup of gumbo is just that a cup.  I'm not a big fan of their gumbo so I would steer toward something else on the menu.  The small etouffee however is very tasty and perfectly seasoned and the perfect size for a meal. Crab fingers are favorites and if you like more filling, try the hushpuppies.  The onion rings are sliced thick and piled high.  The stuffed potatoes are great sides and the coleslaw is on the tangy side. They offer a low calorie selection, however it is limited to only 3 items so this is not the place if you are watching your figure.  They also offer steaks but they are quite large portions as well.  The smallest is an 8oz filet.  And if you choose a topping, it will add another 10-13 dollars to an already pricey meal.  The majority of their dishes are well into the 20 range.  The ambiance is very nice with large aquariums and fire place and brick archways.  They also have a bar area and you can eat in there as well as on outside patio.
<review# 135,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/6/2014,7/12/2014,3,14,,4,2>I truly love this place.  It all started last year when I bought a gift certificate for a friend who was expecting.  Then one afternoon I was having an awful day so I stopped in & they worked me in for a massage. It was an absolute blessing, I walked into church a few hours later & everyone noticed how relaxed I was.  Since then I have returned for other services.  Very caring and relaxed atmosphere.
<review# 136,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,7/11/2014,16,60,,4,2>Well after seeing my Yelp bestie Rebecca W. talk so highly about this place in her review, I figured I'd have to give this place a shot.  As you may or may not know, Mestizo was one of only four restaurants this year participating in Dining Out for Life (diningoutforlife.com/Bat). This place was a lot different than my typical experience with Mexican restaurants.  Normally at your standard Mexican place, the servings are huge and the prices are cheap.  This place has appropriate portion sizes that are a tad on the expensive side.  But I'm a mere mortal with very little will-power for delicious food, so I'm happy to pay a premium to not over consume.I ate the Cancun whic was a Shrimp and crab enchilada, a crawfish and spinach enchilada, with guacamole and a crawfish taco.  It was all very good.  The only downside was the guacamole, which was bland.   Or as I like to say, it had a subtle flavor.  The service was slow, which seems to be mentioned in other reviews.  I'm normally pushing a server to their max, as I drink an absurd amount of water each meal.  The service was not terrible, but not great.
<review# 137,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/22/2013,7/10/2014,12,33,2,3,2>So happy to have found this place! Not only is the food incredible, but the employees are WONDERFUL and pleasant. The meatball sub is like no meatball sub you've had before. Hot pressed, gooey.. perfect.The place is hard to find if you don't know where it is, but after some searching, I found it. There already isn't much in the ways of Italian in Baton Rouge, and then a large % of those aren't very authentic.. but Anthony's is a win.
<review# 138,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/20/2014,7/9/2014,0,18,,2,1>So tasty! Walked in and loved the atmosphere. Tried the Carolina Red Slaw BBQ, and 8t was quite good. Looking forward to trying something else!
<review# 139,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/4/2014,7/8/2014,0,7,,2,1>Wait in line to order and seat yourself. Fairly busy for a holiday. Waited over 45 minutes for our food, but it was very good. Although the wait was long, the owner tried to make it right by offering free dessert which was nice. Strawberry shortcake beignets were the best!!
<review# 140,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/23/2014,7/7/2014,1,3,,3,2>5 Stars yes absolutely . My wife and I were tying to figure out where to go for dinner last night and we had heard about Ninos from some other people. We arrived at 5:00  pm on Saturday night and we were the first to arrive. The hostess informed us that the restaurant had reservations for almost all the tables but we were fortunate that there were a few tables left.  I can see why the restaurant was almost sold out for Saturday night.The food was very very good. My wife had the Lasagna and I had the The Spicy Salsiccia (Homemade caseless Italian sausage made with locally sourced beef and pork cooked in a 17 creamy marinara, tossed with spaghetti and topped with Parmesan, fresh basil and shaved fennel). We had a great bottle of wine that was suggested by the very informed professional waiter who provided us a history of the restaurant . I love a good cappuccino and they did not disappoint -Just delicious. My wife and I were full after the meal but we wanted something sweet to top off the evening. You have to try their home made cookies yes I said home made cookies with their home made ice cream. They arrive hot  to your table with the fresh home made ice cream. We cant wait to go back. I would highly recommend that you call and get reservations especially for Friday or Saturday night.
<review# 141,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/8/2014,7/6/2014,48,279,,4,2>This store has a lot of stuff to choose from. They have everything from clothes to cooking.  They have veggies, spices, cheeses and a freezer section. I am always looking for paneer and this is the only place you can buy it. They have it fresh but i bought the lightly fried kind in the freezer section figuring it would be easier for me to cook since I'm a slouch in the kitchen. I guess we will see what happens.
<review# 142,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/19/2013,7/5/2014,3,9,,2,1>Great experience!  Requires appointments, but he fit me in as a walk-in.  I loved the salon and my haircut!!   Thrilled to find a salon I can keep coming back to in the Denham/Walker area.
<review# 143,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2013,7/4/2014,2,38,,6,3>I had seen differing reviews; couldn't stand the food, the staff was rude, etc., however, when I went it was lunch time, the buffet was out, which I had. It had home stuff: fried chicken, jambalaya, mashed potatoes, greens, BBQ pork chops, etc. My wife had the chicken lejuene, which is two chicken breasts smothered with bell peppers, onions and mushrooms, topped with pepper Jack cheese. Everything was awesome. When I checked-in to Yelp I had a coupon for a free dessert pop up. It was for this restaurant and no one knew about it, but they looked at it on my phone and honored it. That was THE BEST Turtle Cheese cake I have ever had. :-)The staff was very nice and friendly. All thumbs up.
<review# 144,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/8/2013,7/3/2014,66,126,,3,1>This is a great lunch spot with an enormous amount of character.  The menu is fairly simple but everything is worth a try.  A few of my favs are the chicken salad (cranberries & apples), jalepeno chicken sandwich and the chicken caprese.  They usually offer a decent special too and if you're on the email list, you'll get notice of the week's specials on Monday.  OH....I can't believe I almost forgot about the cake!!  You NEED to try the lemon berry mascarpone cake...it's so good and big enough to share.  The last, but not least, point is that you can shop while you wait or after you've eaten.
<review# 145,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/28/2014,7/2/2014,2,5,,3,2>Great happy hour! $5 martinis from 3-6!!  Really excited about this new place to hang out for drinks and dinner.  Great atmosphere and super friendly staff. I'll definitely be back.
<review# 146,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/26/2014,7/1/2014,5,3,,3,2>Consistently good food that's fast! All of the staff are welcoming and very friendly here, the chips (light and crispy) and salsa are great and the margaritas are pretty potent. A great place for lunch or dinner.
<review# 147,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/24/2014,6/30/2014,3,7,,2,2>Everything I've had from there is delicious. They have daily specials that are very reasonable. One of my favorite things is the crawfish pot pie! They also have the option of to go cups when you go to fill your drink, which I like
<review# 148,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/8/2014,6/29/2014,3,3,,2,1>Best pulled pork sandwiches that are made to order. The fries need a little work. My husband loves the philly cheesesteak poboy. Ethan provided us with the best customer service while waiting on our sandwiches to be fixed.
<review# 149,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/6/2014,6/28/2014,37,34,,2,1>I hope this place stays in business!  My wife and I love healthy alternatives after a few too many rich meals.  If you are looking for a tasteful guiltless meal you can absolutely get it here!  I stopped in around 5 pm and the place was practically empty, but I was told by an employee that they do get busy at lunch.  The place is clean, and the customer service is good.
<review# 150,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/13/2014,6/27/2014,3,122,1,3,2>OK... After the blackened catfish sensation salad I had today for lunch, this place deserves all the stars it can get. Absolutely sensational! And I fear that I will never be able to order anything different off the menu ever again. I'm going back tomorrow to eat another one.

<review# 152,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2014,6/25/2014,6,7,,2,1>Came with a group of 11 to celebrate my mom's 76th birthday.  Made reservations and we were seated at a square table in the very back.  Not completely cut off from the restaurant, which was nice.  The shape of the table made it easy to visit with everyone.  Our waitress (Michelle) was fabulous as was her assistant.  (I didn't get his name.)  The food was delicious.  Crabcakes with au gratin sauce, fried eggplant with crabmeat stuffing over pasta, stuffed mushrooms, stuffed portabella topped with grilled shrimp in a lemon butter sauce, etc.  All were delicious.  Get the House Vinaigrette.  To die for!  One complaint about food:  Crawfish pies had very, very few crawfish.  They were uniquely served with puffed pastry.  2nd complaint that kept me from giving the restaurant 5 stars:  They charged me $10 to bring a birthday cake.  I did ask when I made reservations, so it was no surprise, but I really think they should reconsider this practice, especially with a large party like ours who spent a decent amount on our meals and most ordered coffee to go with cake.  Most restaurants offer the birthday person a dessert, but since we brought our own, there was no need for that.  Yet another reason to waive the cake charge.  They will do separate checks, so that is a plus.  They add on the gratuitiy, and I'm fine with that.  I even added a little extra.  That said, I will be back because the food is that delicious!
<review# 153,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/16/2014,6/24/2014,13,8,,2,1>A local favorite. The food is excellent and has been for years. You can't go wrong with the veal or any of the seafood dishes. The atmosphere is warm and cozy. The wait staff has varied over the years, but Angela is a constant and will take good care of you.
<review# 154,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/16/2014,6/23/2014,2,32,,2,1>it was alright.  i would give it 4 stars, except for a couple of things.  it's a nice place, appearance-wise.  kind of a cutesy southern louisiana theme, bordering on over the top, but it pulls it off.  as such, i would like to 'sit down' and order.  upon arrival we were directed to a counter to order.  our meal came to a little over $50 + tip.  there was a tip jar there, and a place for tipping on the credit card receipt.  i tipped my usual 20% for good service, and just hoped for the best.  the service was great.  she earned it.  but i hate tipping before i've been served.  and i hate going out for a nice meal, and ordering from a counter.  i dunno, there's just something so fast-foody about it.  the food would get 4 stars, hands down.  i had gumbo and the blackened shrimp remoulade salad.  huge salad!  and it was good.  a little heavy on the dressing, which i will order on the side next time.  he had the seafood box and fried alligator.  both were crispy and delicious, maybe a wee bit too spicy, but i'll forgive that.all in all, i look forward to going back again soon.  i'd love to try their po'boys.
<review# 155,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,6/22/2014,0,3,,3,1>This was the best BBQ restaurant that I've been to yet. The sausage Poboys are absolutely delicious. The boudin is literally to die for. The Bread pudding is a reason to go all on it's own. It's making me so hungry thinking about it that I may drive their now.
<review# 156,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2014,6/21/2014,0,4,,2,1>My friend and I have claimed this as our new spot in Lafayette. They always have great food, amazing service, and drinks just as good. The atmosphere is amazing and flows very well. I have traveled through Spain and I rather eat here then most places there!
<review# 157,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/14/2014,6/20/2014,7,16,,2,1>My husband and I absolutely love this restaurant! We eat here almost every week. Our favorite appetizers are the Poutine and the House Smoked Mozzarella Flatbread. The tomato jam on that flatbread seems strange but it tastes out of this world. The best side is the mac and cheese. My husband loves the Chicken and Biscuits and the steak entrees. I always eat the Mac and Cheese for my entree. Delicious! Some dishes to steer clear of: Their pickles are sweet pickles, so if you are not a fan of those be warned. The Cheeseburger has the pickles on it or pickled onions, either way its not a nice flavor for someone who does not like sweet pickles. Finally, their potato soup has cinnamon in it which was weird. Its a little pricey but I feel that the experience and food is worth every penny. If you want the best server, ask for Logan.
<review# 158,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,6/19/2014,179,366,2,5,3>Tried this place while I was at a food truck round up, I was not disappointed.  The people here are so friendly and fast!  We had the following:- Fried dumplings - fried to a crispy perfection, and a delicious sauce to dip with- Kimchi fries - it may look a little messy, but this dish is bursting with flavors, the perfect spicy and acidity, and the greens to cut it just enoughCan't wait to try their other stuff!
<review# 159,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/8/2013,6/18/2014,2,21,,2,2>Outstanding meal. Outstanding service. The small plates were great. I will get the foie gras small plate every time I go back. You know it's good if it's illegal in California.  Of the four of us, three had seafood main courses and concluded their seafood is probably their forte. The dessert, a Swiss chocolate custard thing was incredible. The real question is not whether the meal is worth the hour drive from Lafayette, it's how often?
<review# 160,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2014,6/17/2014,0,6,2,3,2>Best coffee shop around! Very unique environment. Great coffee, but cold creams are the best thing here... Or the bacon stuffed croissants. I will pass up more convenient drive through coffee to get better coffee and service at The Lab. Great place for business meetings too.
<review# 161,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/7/2014,6/15/2014,37,137,,5,1>This review is for takeout only. I've gotten food from here thrice and every time it's been terrific. Yesterday I got the chicken tikka masala and the chicken biryani. The biryani was well flavored, it had about seven good sized pieces of chicken. In some stores the chicken is boiled and mildly spiced and tastes bland, but this was completely different. Really well flavored and soft chicken with perfectly cooked rice. It was a bit greasy, but I don't eat this stuff everyday so I guess it's OK! The CTM was not as good as I expected it to be...the dish had a ton of gravy and a about six bite sized  chicken pieces. The meat was well flavored, which was awesome, but I felt the quantity of chicken was too little. Also, it doesn't come with naan or rice...you have to pay separately for those. The naans I got were huge! I gotta go back for their buffet and try out other items on the menu. BTW they don't accept Amex.
<review# 162,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/9/2014,6/14/2014,5,4,,3,1>Surprisingly good.  Was expecting an average Americanized mexican food, but the steak was cooked as if it was being done at a hispanic home. Will for sure be back to try the fajitas.
<review# 163,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/7/2014,6/13/2014,14,22,5,7,5>If you're looking for a normal juicy American burger that Abe Lincoln would be proud of, then go to Burgersmith! But if you're wanting to eat a delicious gourmet burger, then come here. Beware: a small order of the duck fat fries will feed 2... small families! They are so delicious that I don't mind the fact that they are more unhealthy than a box of donuts wrapped in bacon and deep fried again!
<review# 164,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/1/2014,6/12/2014,42,42,,2,1>Crawfish Time is a GREAT place to eat crawfish. The crawfish is always big, fresh, and well-seasoned. I normally get regular and it seems as if they control their spice levels mostly by seasoning them after they've been cooked. This is good, but ideally, crawfish are best when they are seasoned in the water they are boiling in. Still though, great food!
<review# 165,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/2/2014,6/11/2014,8,31,,4,2>Great little hidden gem. There was live music the night we went which gave a really nice ambiance to the place. Wasn't loud either so you could carry on a conversation while still enjoying the music.For dinner I had the heads and tails salad and cup of seafood gumbo. Husband had the chicken gumbo. Both were very savory and tasted homemade. We split some boiled crawfish. They weren't piping hot and were a bit on the small side but the flavor was good. We split the bread pudding and although it was really good, it was oddly scolding hot with chilled pieces intermixed - maybe they microwaved it. So the odd temperature thing on both the crawfish and bread pudding is why I docked a star.Will definitely go again to try one of the poboys or entrees.
<review# 166,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/17/2013,6/10/2014,22,81,,4,2>Best selection of cakes, pastries, baked goods in Baton Rouge.  I've been going to Ambrosia for years and never had a bad experience or bad food.Today's selection, my wife and I had the fresh strawberry and lemon Doberge cakes.  Both were fresh and a good afternoon snack.  We even grabbed some shortbread cookies to go.
<review# 167,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/6/2014,6/9/2014,18,10,,2,1>Awesome service! The employees at this nail shop are happy to see you, remember you when you come in, and even recall what you like and don't like when requesting services. I've gotten a great mani/pedi at this friendly shop once a week since Mother's Day (brought my mom in and they took awesome care of her) and I still love it like the first time. The service and results were so great, I left my favorite nail shop of three years to stick with Avatar. Walk-ins welcome, but make an appointment if you have the time. The wait isn't ever that long, but appointments get in and out.
<review# 168,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/6/2014,6/7/2014,12,4,,3,2>So, let me start by saying I was a fan of Leroy's long before I even tried it.  My good buddy Wayne is a manager here, so I had high hopes for this place from the get go.  It did not disappoint.  On our first visit we checked out the chicken, of course.  And when it comes to fried chicken, it really doesn't get much better than this.  We've since ventured out to other areas of the menu such as the fried catfish and even boiled crawfish and I've yet to leave disappointed.  Also, we had the beignets for dessert once and they were pretty awesome, as well.  My kids love it too, so bonus points for being family friendly.  The service has always been great and my only hesitation for giving it a 5 star rating is that they are still working out some of the kinks as far as the menu.  For example, on our first visit my kids couldn't eat the chicken nuggets because they were too spicy, but I've noticed they've since modified that.  And I also felt that early on the macaroni could have used a bit more seasoning, but I haven't tried it again since we've been trying to branch out in our menu selections and try different things, so maybe it's changed since then.  And also, when we ordered crawfish, we got corn but no potatoes.  So, just minor things like that.  Otherwise, I love this place.  It's has a casual feel similar to that of The Chimes, but never too busy where you have a long wait and it has great food as well as service.
<review# 169,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/19/2014,6/6/2014,1,9,,3,2>I'd eat here for lunch every day if I could. Great Lebanese food for extremely good value. I sometimes go out of my way just to come here. Comfortable atmosphere and friendly service so whether you eat in or take out, you'll be happy.
<review# 170,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/5/2014,6/5/2014,24,19,,3,1>This place is fabulous. The bartenders are really personable and they really know how to sell their numerous number of beers and liquors. Honestly? Where else in Baton Rouge can you find a bar with 700 whiskies? The only sad thing is that it's kind of unassuming, almost too unassuming. It's set back in a shopping center with extremely unrelated stores. However, don't pass this little gem up. The quality, as well as, the quantity of the beer and liquor here will astound you!
<review# 171,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/20/2014,6/4/2014,6,29,,2,1>I love the all you can eat Sushi for $14.95. The price is unbelievable and you really can eat as much as you want. The food was fresh and good. However, the one thing that was annoying is since everyone ordered something different everyone's food came out at different times and it seemed like it took awhile although there weren't many people there. Overall I would definitely recommend to someone!
<review# 172,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/24/2014,6/3/2014,7,12,,3,1>This place is delicious! Service is great, and the food is made with lots of love. Just came in for the first time tonight and I will say it was a very pleasant experience. The music was fitting, the food was great, and the waitress was very knowledgeable and offered great suggestions. This restaurant has potential to be a very fancy fine dining restaurant had they had better chairs and tables, however for the local family feel, there is an exception. It works for them. Thanks for a great meal! We will be back.
<review# 173,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/14/2013,6/2/2014,7,85,,2,1>Great food and great service.During Monday night football, they have al you can eat wings and draft beer for twenty bucks, pretty good deal to me. Only negative thing I have to say was ice cream was freezer burnt.
<review# 174,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/25/2013,6/1/2014,7,14,,5,1>I walked in and they immediately sat me although they had no person to help me. They got my water started (I was getting a pedicure) & that was a plus. The people are very nice & good at what they do. The actual painting of the nails was great! I'd go back
<review# 175,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/6/2014,5/31/2014,5,55,,3,2>This is a fun little place to eat near LSU's campus.  Definitely a place that you should go to at least once while in Baton Rouge.  It's been around forever and serves a great burger and fries.  Grab a booth and get ready to enjoy nostalgia at it's best!Affordable pricing and good food!
<review# 176,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/23/2014,5/30/2014,9,19,,3,2>Ooooh..so good!!  My little girl and I shared a cupcake here and it was delicious!  I can't remember the exact name of the one we got but it was a rich chocolate one.  The lady behind the counter was super sweet and just let us linger debating and drooling over all the cupcakes.  The cupcake was rich and moist but light too.  Just perfect.  And I believe it had chocolate chunks in it too!!  Can't go wrong with that!  Not to mention, the shop is small, clean, and sweet looking, just as a cupcake shop should be.
<review# 177,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/15/2013,5/29/2014,0,4,,3,2>Awesome food and excellent service!!! It's a little out if the way for us but we always find time to cross town for this restaurant! We have never been disappointed. Family owned for 37 years, they got it right!
<review# 178,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/27/2013,5/28/2014,1,7,,5,2>I went here for the first time last night looking for a good date night spot and was not at all disappointed. Agree with other reviewers in that it is VERY unassuming from the street, but the inside is very nice and a "traditional italian" atmosphere. It was a little loud, but nothing that would make me not want to return. Our waiter was fabulous and took extensive time and care to help us select a bottle of wine to order, was not pushy about the super expensive options and really tried to help us find what we liked by bringing us a couple samples to try before we ordered. As a server myself, I really notice and appreciate a server going above and beyond for their guests. That guy gets 5 stars. My food was wonderful, the white cream sauce on my Tortellini Carbonara was decadent and delicious. My partner's food I did not like as much, but she did. She had ordered the Chicken Parmigiana The marinara tasted just a little funny to me. Also ordered the Minestrone soup as a starter, which was not the best I've ever had, but it was good. Overall, I will definitely be coming back - mainly because of the great service we received!
<review# 179,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/12/2014,5/27/2014,134,34,,4,2>The customer service issue that we experienced at Mis padres was immediately resolved, hence the 5 stars. Let me further explain that the manager was not in the restaurant at the time of my visit, so this said server who was fired did everything at her own discretion without realizing the consequences. Thanks for resolving the issue! Love mis padres, especially the home made tortillas.
<review# 180,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2014,5/26/2014,105,85,2,6,4>I have been going to Red Zeppelin almost every week lately, and always have a wonderful experience. The servers are very friendly and the food is always delicious! I've tried the jalapeno cheese bread, hummus, and all vegetarian pizzas. All are fabulous! The heartbreaker pizza is my favorite, and I love to get it with light cheese. The hummus is great too, and I love the pizza points it is served with. RZ has good drink specials too and a fabulous beer selection. The only downside is that it gets crowded ( and noisy!) quickly, and there are usually crying children around. But, I can't fault the restaurant for being so good that everyone wants to go!
<review# 181,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2013,5/25/2014,38,71,,4,2>Jasmine's on the Bayou is one of my favorite neighborhood restaurants. Their menu consists of mainly "Louisiana style " dishes such as gumbo, crawfish etouffee, etc. It's a small restaurant and tends to get crowded around dinner time but the wait is well worth it. The service is friendly and the food is great. The prices are mid-range, with an entree ranging from $13-$17. And if you really like the food, they also do catering, so be sure to remember them for your next catered event.
<review# 182,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/22/2013,5/24/2014,8,33,,3,2>We went to Portobello's for a Christmas brunch with my family yesterday. I have had some dietary restrictions lately so I mentioned this when making a reservation. While at times the service was a little slow, the waitress and manager were very friendly and accommodating. The manager went out of his way to explain options to me and customize a meal. He said they are even working on an allergen menu which is awesome! The waitress checked ingredient lists and was very patient with us. I ended up ordering a hamburger with bacon on the focaccia bread. It was VERY good even though they forgot to add the bacon. I was surprised at how good it was on the focaccia. And the hamburger itself was very tasty. I got it with pasta oglio olio which was bland. But to be fair, I had to order it without the cheese on top. I wish I were able to order it with fries but it shared oil with foods I can't currently eat. A nice order of fries would have made this meal so much better.The table also had focaccia bread, crabcakes, and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers. I was only able to eat the bread which is delicious. They all enjoyed the other apps. They also really loved the desserts: bread pudding with bananas foster topping and carrot cake. It pained me to watch them devour it and rave about how good it was.My one bid disappointment with this visit was that they no longer have wine flights. I use to love going there for Happy Hour and getting half off flights. I sure wish they would bring that back. And they also really should update their website which still shows the flights. That was a big reason we chose to eat here because I love to be able to try a variety of wines.I look forward to being able to return here when I am no longer limited in what I can eat. And I most definitely will be ordering the bread pudding!
<review# 183,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/5/2014,5/23/2014,19,9,,3,2>This is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Baton Rouge. The food is consistently amazing and always a very welcoming waitstaff. And the deserts are high level delicious. We even visited other locations and was treated with the same great food and service. I don't even want to try another Greek or Lebanese restaurant. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
<review# 184,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/28/2014,5/22/2014,124,131,,6,3>After months of being somewhat dissatisfied with the place I have been going in BR since moving from Houston, I decided to give Rigsby Frederick a shot. Boy, am I glad I did! Katie does such a great job--probably the happiest I have ever been with my color. She does a two-step highlight/toner process, then trims me up. The only complaint I could have would perhaps be the price for a trim--which is a little much since I have not had a major cut/style there yet, but the cost seems to be for a full treatment. Otherwise, so glad to have found my go-to spot here!
<review# 185,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/15/2014,5/21/2014,5,23,,4,2>Absolutely Fantastic. My husband and I stopped by to try it out tonight and we will definitely be back. The food was excellent and the service was great. Both the hostess and waiter were very very nice and attentive. The beef enchiladas were delicious as were the combo fajitas. The white queso was also awesome. This is the best Mexican restaurant in Denham Springs. I'm so glad we decided to drop by.
<review# 186,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/14/2013,5/20/2014,2,13,,3,2>Love this place! We went for the first time on Saturday for the zydeco breakfast and had a blast. It is loud, but so much fun. Amazing food too!
<review# 187,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/12/2014,5/19/2014,3,11,,4,2>We are always happy when leaving this place. Food is GREAT! People are GREAT! Excellent wine list. I really like to sit in the bar area even to eat. It has a good atmosphere with a large selection of drinks. Staff always ask if you need anything. I love it.
<review# 188,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/15/2014,5/18/2014,7,4,,4,3>This is one of my favorite places in Zachary. I can't say enough about how good the service is. The place is extremely clean and smells good, the coffee is better than any other I have tasted and the chocolates are a very convenient gift when I am on the way to anywhere. I feel like Zachary is blessed to have such a place!
<review# 189,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/12/2013,5/17/2014,2,24,,5,3>Good food, very clean, friendly owners.  Mmmmm, the fried cheese.  The gyro, stuffed grape leaves and lamb are some favorites.  Lebanese Ice Tea. Delicious. Fast service, fresh food, great staff, good prices.
<review# 190,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/27/2014,5/16/2014,1,5,,4,2>We had dinner at La Michoacana this evening for the first time (thanks to the great reviews here).  It did not disappoint!This has to be one of the cleanest restaurants/stores I have been to. We were hungry and did not take the time to browse through the grocery section but I could see from our table how neat, clean, and organized everything is. The ladies room and dining area were no exception.We were allowed to seat ourselves since there were plenty of open tables at the time. Our server was extremely friendly, even going so far as to explain what many of the authentic Mexican bottled sodas were and helping us make our selections. Each of us tried a different one - mine was called Lift I think (apple flavor) and the other was Jarritos grapefruit. Both worked nicely to counter the heat from the red sauce and jalapeno sauce.The chips and salsa hit the table immediately after we sat down. Fantastic fresh flavor, perfectly spiced with just the right amount of cilantro. No ketchupy salsa here! Both of our dishes were excellent and plentiful, and served steaming hot. One was Barbacoa and the other was the Carnitas plate. The plates came with salad, generous slices of fresh avocado, rice, beans, and diced onion and fresh cilantro. I cannot emphasize enough how perfectly cooked and seasoned the meat is! We also both chose corn tortillas which are the best I have ever had. Nothing at all like the stiff and dry store-bought corn tortillas.Great food, friendly service, and very reasonably priced. I can't say enough good things about La Michoacana. Highly recommended!
<review# 191,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/11/2014,5/15/2014,48,6,,3,2>The service is authentic and the food is great. I've had the fish tacos twice now, they were excellent both times. The "plain" beef tacos were so good I had to come back for lunch for more. I'm so glad to have a place I can look forward to enjoying some quality Mexican food.
<review# 192,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/11/2014,5/14/2014,60,159,,6,6>I'm a pretty big fan of Zippy's! Their chips, salsa, and queso are yummy, and I also love their tacos and quesadillas! Zippy's uses your basic roll-you-own set up for pretty much all of their menu items, so they come out pretty similar to what you can get at Izzo's or Chipotle.The thing I like best about Zippy's is their patio. I love sitting out there during summer evenings and enjoying a frozen beverage, and I also love that it is covered and can be closed in when it's cold or rainy. Plus, if you are a sports fan, your event is bound to be on one of the TVs, which are both in the indoor seating/bar area and the patio area.
<review# 193,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/5/2013,5/13/2014,111,62,,4,2>I really like this place. Any fish served "Louisianne" is outstanding. Their steak is also firm but tender and was perfectly cooked to "medium."  Our server was attentive and offered recommendations when asked. Bread was hot, fresh and plentiful. Our salads were crisp and nicely sized; perhaps a little heavy handed on the Sensation dressing ..but I should know to ask for it on the side. The Blueberry Bread Pudding was a dense mass of caloric richness. And yes..that is a compliment.  Nice selection of wines available as well.
<review# 194,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2014,5/12/2014,50,194,,4,4>Popped in here the other day with a friend for lunch.  I had The Riverboat sandwich which was a roast beef sandwich with melted provolone and chipotle mayo on white bread.  They have a cool toaster that leaves a fleur de lis toast marks on the bread.  Cute.  I was thrown off by the white bread b/c I felt it was a little plebeian for a $9 sandwich, but it turned out to be a very satisfying bite.  The potato salad had one flavor that we couldn't put our buds on...allspice? cinnamon? We couldn't figure it out, but it was a fun game.  Other than the mystery spice, I found the pot salad to be a little too vinegary for my tastes, I probably don't like creole mustard enough for this style either.  The gentleman behind the counter was very nice and hung for a chat when delivering our food.  It was nice to be around friendly people.  There was art everywhere too.  Not all my style, but it's art.  It's never always everyone's style.  All in all, I had an enjoyable lunch in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.  Next time I'll try the quiche or soup (suck it Bruce Feirstein).
<review# 195,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/22/2014,5/11/2014,3,8,,4,2>Ate there this week for the first time. The ambience was wonderful, very old-fashioned pub atmosphere. The food was great, well made and tasty. I did have to wait a bit, but not for too long and it was well worth it. Incredible selection of beers and ales. Wait staff was friendly attentive. Will definitely be back!
<review# 196,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/29/2014,5/10/2014,19,4,,3,3>So this lil spot off Florida!! (Don't drive too fast or you'll miss it!!) Great for crawfish and yes I'm in love with those budin balls!! Need to try some different foods.. I'm sure it's all just as good!!! friendly service hardly any wait! Yes.. I will be back again!!!!
<review# 197,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/5/2014,5/9/2014,31,68,,4,2>I don't get my hair cut very often, it's long and doesn't require much upkeep, so honestly it's every 4-6 months or so.  I've seen Mallory and Megan, with Megan being the two most recent times.  I really love what she does with my hair!  She listened to what I wanted, suggested a couple things, and made sure I was happy with the end product.  I will definitely be requesting her from now on.I was surprised when I called for an appointment, I called on a Wednesday and was able to get on that Saturday at a time that worked for me, which was much earlier than I had expected to go in.  It was busy, but not overly so.  I'm always able to find parking, if not on the street, then in the free parking garages.  The ladies at the front desk were happy and courteous and offered me a beverage.  The other stylists routinely cleaned the floor so there wasn't hair everywhere, which I've noticed in some places doesn't get done as often as it probably should.My haircut price has gone up $5 from the last time I went in, but was still reasonable, and because I hadn't been in so long, I had an email with a "$20 off a 'new' $40 service"... the "new" being "in the last 6 months".  So I ended up with a much cheaper cut than normal!  All in all, I like the place, the location, and my hairdresser, and will be coming back as long as these things are constant.
<review# 198,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/23/2014,5/7/2014,12,7,1,10,5>I went here on the recommendation of a friend.  It was great, so I took my boyfriend later that same weekend.  We've been coming back at least once a week every week since, and we leave very happy every time.  In his words from that first visit, when it comes to Mediterranean food, "We are never going anywhere else."  The atmosphere is amazing, the food is nothing short of fantastic, and the prices are great to boot.  Their name means "come see us," and they mean it.  We will be back.  And we'll bring friends!
<review# 199,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,5/5/2014,32,50,4,8,4>You want LEGIT Mexican food? This place is not Ninfas, Las Palmas, or Superior Grille. This place serves LEGIT Mexican food that I have seen in Mexico, New Mexico, and Arizona. The Al Pastor #perfecto. Simple menu and it is made right in front of you.
<review# 200,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/18/2013,5/4/2014,8,8,1,5,4>First of all, I think it's important for me to state:  I've never been a 'bar' person.  What's the point in over-paying to drink in a crowded, smelly, smoky bar when I can drink for much cheaper in the comfort of my own living room with only people (and entertainment) that I like?But the Radio Bar has finally given this homebody a place to "go out" to.  There's no smoking in the bar itself, which is a BIG plus for me.  The atmosphere is relaxed, comfortable, but not divey.  The staff is super friendly!  And the crowd is (generally) refreshingly bro-free.  I can go in at 7ish with a group of close friends, grab a booth, and hang out - we've even brought in food and games before, it's all cool at the Radio Bar!  The signature trait of the Radio Bar is the smartphone radio app that allows you to tap into their music selection (for free!) and vote for your favorite songs.  The music selection is limited, but for the most part, very good!  Even the music I don't like is at least ignorable, which can't be said for a lot of public spaces these days :/Drink-wise, I would say their selection is average to good....but then again, I tend to only order my same two or three favorite regardless of where I go, so I can't say I have the greatest frame of reference there.  But if you're looking for great atmosphere, Radio is the place to go!Oh, and I whole-heartedly agree with a previous reviewer - they have the CLEANEST bar bathrooms I have EVER seen!
<review# 201,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/24/2014,5/3/2014,59,9,1,7,5>I've never been to this location to eat. We regularly get catering service from here at work. The food is awesome and they always have a variety of different food. They're always on time and very nice when they deliver. Also, if you order dessert...you have to order the banana cake!!! It is to die for! It's very soft, flavorful, fresh and the icing on top is perfect. Yummy!
<review# 202,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/6/2014,5/2/2014,16,12,3,6,2>Went here on a Friday night with friends. Busy, fun atmosphere. Definitely a nice open space feel, hard to find in BR! We chose to sit outside since it was a nice night. The place was definitely busy, but after waiting about 15 minutes for a server, someone from my party had to eventually seek someone out, who then said they'd find someone else to send over. Not a huge deal, but a bit frustrating.  Once our server came over though, she was very friendly and attentive. I ordered a cosmopolitan (great!) and shrimp appetizer. Would recommend both! My husband ordered a blackened gator po boy, which he said was now one of the best po boys he's had since moving here! Will definitely continue going to the Pelican House. Again, great atmosphere, great drink selection, and good music on the weekends. Not to mention the delicious food!
<review# 203,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/26/2014,5/1/2014,1,11,,4,3>Went here for the first time tonight. They had a sandwich special where you could get a gyro or shawarma pita with a side and drink for $6.99. For the sides you can get fries, hummus, rice pilaf, or salad. My chicken shawarma was great, but the rice pilaf wasn't good at all. I plan on getting the hummus next time.
<review# 204,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/26/2014,4/30/2014,48,279,3,6,5>The Tokyo Poppers appetizer is amazing! It's a must try! Honestly we almost skipped ordering sushi because we wanted to order another round of the poppers. We ended up ordering the yellowtail naruto and Tokyo roll instead. I really liked the yellowtail naruto because it didn't have rice and was wrapped in cucumber. Very different and fresh for a change. On a previous visit we tried the miami, rainbow, and spicy shrimp rolls which were all really great and fresh. The Miami roll had mango which was a nice touch and they aren't kidding when they say the spicy shrimp is hot! Loved the music and decor. Awesome bar. Wasabi bloody mary was a hit and I love that they have kirin ichiban on tap.
<review# 205,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/25/2014,4/29/2014,32,52,1,5,4>I really enjoyed the experience. The instructors make the class fun and everyone has a different outcome. Lacey was our instructor and she kept things fun, ecxiting, and interesting. I even won a free painting playing one of the game. I'll be back.
<review# 206,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/17/2014,4/28/2014,7,8,1,4,3>One of my family's favorite places to eat! They have a delicious mix of the spicy and sweet. There is always a fresh fish of the day. The desserts are amazing, and well worth the calories! Be sure to try the fried green tomatoes and the Cajun crawfish salad.
<review# 207,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2014,4/27/2014,23,43,1,6,3>A friend and I went here for lunch today. Friendly staff and a quaint atmosphere Tiny place: there's maybe two or three staff members total and, maybe, 10 chairs plus the bar. Still, highly enjoyable. He ordered the spinach and feta quiche plus tomato soup. I had the cream of broccoli soup plus the vegan sandwich. Everything was delicious, especially the quiche!The standard menu is short, but they have a lot of options for their rotating daily specials. Excellent vegetarian and vegan options.
<review# 208,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/6/2014,4/26/2014,20,11,,3,2>Great pizza and atmosphere. Love to hang out and relax in the throw back building. Good cold beer at night and loads of tv action!Now open on Mondays!They also have a banquet room that can be reserved for parties or receptions.
<review# 209,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/30/2013,4/25/2014,5,13,2,6,3>The food was amazing!!!!!Love the southern quirky atmosphere!The food lived up to my Cajun expectations! Great quick service!Seafood Wontons / Crab dinner  / bread pudding = Highly recommended! I will definitely dine here again!
<review# 210,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2013,4/24/2014,107,31,3,7,5>What an awesome experience!For $5 you get a 5oz souvenir glass and three tastings of their beers on tap. I defeinitely stole a token from my friend so i could try all four beers that they had.  The facility is a giant warehouse and it gets pretty hot in there so the beer is extra refreshing. I went a food truck friday and there were three food trucks outisde.  There wwas also not supposed to be a tour but the brewmaster decided to give one anyways. I learned a lot from him about the brewing process. I will definitely be back another friday. Also, like their facebook page because they are opening up a tap room there and they will be experimenting with new beers.  The only way to try them is see when the tap room opens and follow their posts on facebook. Definitely looking forward to when they start that up!
<review# 211,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/30/2014,4/23/2014,15,12,1,4,3>I only ate from the buffet, which was mediocre. Boyfriend said sushi was 'okay'. The hibachi area had lots of options, including octopus (which my boyfriend got and ate raw). Desserts left something to be desired, the cakes were standard Chinese buffet stock, and a little dry. Ice cream comes in little single-serve Styrofoam cups..vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, orange sherbet, and rainbow sherbet. We'd eat here again because there aren't really any better options in the immediate area.
<review# 212,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/15/2014,4/22/2014,1,5,1,4,3>Service was great. Overpriced for the food quality though. Got raw oysters and crab cakes. The oysters were just ok. The crab cakes had so much shell in them that I finally gave up on trying to eat them.I was also really disappointed at the TV choice. We were eating lunch, about 12:30pm, with our three young children. They had some movie blaring that was extremely violent and had way too much foul language. Not good at all.We will probably not return.

<review# 214,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,4/16/2014,4/20/2014,30,23,1,4,3>A visit to Roman's Cafe will bring you interesting decor, decent food, and cordial staff.I walked in on a Wednesday night after asking a person on their way out of the restaurant what type of food was served at Roman's Cafe. From the outside, it is easy to know the name of the restaurant, but it is difficult to tell what they actually serve. Rome, Italy or Romans are not represented here. The website suggests "The best Greek restaurant in Baton Rouge," and the menu describes the cuisine as Greek and Lebanese.Upon entering the establishment, I was pleasantly surprised. Their decor was certainly representative of the the type of food they serve. I did not find any of the decorations on the wall statues to be gaudy, but served to set the mood. The mood is further set with some colorful accent lighting throughout and some white table "covers". The place was clean and cozy enough for a fairly intimate dinner (if that is your thing). They did have a flat screen TV, but it was no turned on.I ordered the spinach pie (spanakopita) and a large greek with feta salad. I was just finished with a workout, so I just ordered water.Before the meal, you are presented with some freshly made pita bread. It was quite toasty and good. On the table you can prepare your own olive oil dip with the nondescript Lebanese spice mix and a healthy serving of olive oil that you will find on the table (dash of salt, sprinkle of pepper).The restaurant has about 25 tables, and would call it a normal load for a weeknight. Nonetheless, I was not kept waiting long for my food to arrive both at the same time (my girlfriend ordered a chicken wrap, which arrived at nearly the same time, but a bit of forgetfulness caused her salad to come after the meal).The spinach pie was OK. There was only crust on the top and the filling was pretty sour. Not unbearable, but I have certainly had a better example of Spanakopita (a good fried of mine is Greek, and I spent about a week in Greece a few years ago). It was served with a side of yogurt sauce (Tzatziki). Why, not sure... perhaps to add some more salt to the appetizer.The Greek salad was satisfying. It had the right flavors with the dressing, crisp lettuce, onions, and cracked pepper spread liberally. However, this is the first Greek salad I have ever had that came sans-olives. There were some sliced sun-dried tomatoes and a sliver of artichoke heart. It also seemed that the lettuce used may have been fairly wet, evidenced by some quite bland bites and the small puddle of water left after I was done. Also, don't expect much more than some bits of crumbled feta. The largest pieces are about the size of a kernel of corn.Service was prompt and cordial. Not much to be said there. Prices were reasonable.All in all, I don't think I would suggest to go there, but I wouldn't hate it to go back.
<review# 215,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/16/2013,4/19/2014,19,141,1,4,3>How have I overlooked reviewing this place after eating here so many times? Unfortunately I can't remember exact experiences for this review, but I have been here many times in the past with myriad different people and I have never had one complaint from any of them, and especially not from myself. My favorite is the pork and egg roll rice vermicelli. I usually get it with shrimp but the shrimp here were kinda weird when I tried it... that is to say, it looked like they had been pounded into a shapeless mass before cooking. Maybe that has been fixed, since that was the first time I ever ate here. Other than that, this place has arguably the best vietnamese food in Baton Rouge. The staff is very quick and attentive, they're open reasonably late, and the prices and food are great. A really good place to take a date in my opinion. The only thing missing is Banh Mi on the menu!
<review# 216,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2014,4/18/2014,4,17,3,5,4>Endless studying isn't as bad when I'm at this place! The workers there are fun, interactive and nice! Their ice coffee is a must try! The parking can be a bit difficult but it never stops me from going to my favorite coffee shop in the city!
<review# 217,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/30/2013,4/17/2014,14,7,1,5,3>Loved the Cajun shrimp burger!!!! The onion rings are also awesome. The sweet potato fries were good too.

I suggest to get the Willy-wich. It comes with tater tots and dipping sauce which all really goes together well. I've been here several times since they opened and it is all very consistent. The prices and portions are great and so is their sweet tea and cool-aid. The staff members and owner are all very friendly and helpful. They are all very upbeat and the atmosphere is very fun. Check Willy's out!!!

I bought the bcaa amino acid sypplement (working out & recovering). Small mom owned shop, great books & resources..they apparently even have classes you can attend. I came in on a day where there were 15% off shelves & 40% off books leaving me a very satisfied customer.
<review# 222,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/3/2014,4/12/2014,16,60,,4,3>Not quite sure why this place isn't rated better. If you want quality sushi, this is the place I go to. Sure there are other places, but the special rolls here aren't just the same you can get everywhere. After I started making my own sushi I noticed the quality of the ingredients and combinations here. I love the Hawaiian roll
<review# 223,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/24/2014,4/11/2014,95,166,,4,2>I love this nail place. They also do some waxing. I think everyone that works here is so friendly. They do a great job. The spa pedicure is my fave. They massage your calves forever!  They also have the massaging chairs. They offer shellac etc. My only gripe is that I wish they had a little more colors for shellac. They just did a remodel and it looks wonderful. The prices are reasonable as well. When I was in Beaver Creek recently, they tried to charge me 70 bucks for shellac!!  Keep up the good work!  I've been coming here for years and don't plan on changing it up anytime soon.
<review# 224,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/2/2014,4/10/2014,25,31,,4,4>I have eaten at the NOLA location many times and was so happy to see this location opening.  I had to stop by on opening night.  I didn't have much time, so I only stopped at the bar for a quick drink, but was not disappointed.  They really captured a tropical, carefree patio feel.  They made great use of beautiful trees that are on the property and were really successful in bringing the "outside in".  it felt like all of the tables were part of the outside. The bar is very unique with rope swing chairs for two and captain's chairs at the bar.   The rum drinks did not disappoint, they taste of fresh juices, just like they do on a tropical vacation.  Will be back for food soon.... get there before the word gets out and the wait gets long  !

<review# 226,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/28/2014,4/8/2014,20,57,2,5,3>My wife steered us here because it sounded good after trudging through another new gym workout. Located around the corner from Schlitz-n-Giggles, where I wanted to go, this was a much healthier and fulfilling choice.   Everyone was friendly and the owner or manager? offered us samples of the juices to make deciding easier.  My wife got the Awesomeness smoothie, which was chocolaty awesome.  I got the very refreshing Root Awakening.  It is hard to describe the flavors they have.  So the best thing is to just go and sample.  But, I can't imagine any to be a bad choice.My only complaint is that it is a little pricey.  And I want to go here so often that I can see it becoming a financial problem.
<review# 227,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/26/2013,4/7/2014,66,126,2,4,3>I have to say this place isn't always on the top of my list due to parking and the distance from my house, but the brisket nachos are one of my favorite dishes in Baton Rouge.  You can get brisket on just about anything here and I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.  The top shelf margaritas are out of this world...and so will you be after drinking a couple.  Thursday night is their big night and they usually have a band on the patio.  However, you can find a good crowd here pretty much all weekend.  If you're there for lunch, sit at the bar and chat it up with Darren...he's a great bartender!
<review# 228,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/29/2014,4/6/2014,1,4,4,10,5>Mama Della's has the best pizza in Baton Rouge. Today, I am back again for the second time this week. I think I'll venture out from the pepperoni pie to try the Downtown Calzone. The atmosphere is delightful. The decor and the music are just to my liking. Grab a stool at the counter overlooking the kitchen to get a front row seat to an artist at work. The dough is his canvas. His hands serve as his paint brush. Mozzarella, tomato sauce, and pepperoni are his mediums of choice. There is no doubt. Mr. Barry knows how to cook up some awe inspiring masterpizzas. Enjoy.

I really enjoy their mapo tofu, spicy and kind of curry-ish. The waitress was also very nice and tried her best to see to it that we were happy.
<review# 230,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/11/2013,4/4/2014,1,4,3,6,4>The service at this place is B-A-N-A-N-A-S! This atmosphere is roasting. I go here to study, mainly. I also go here to relax my wrinkles in my tiny cerebellum. The place is a cute, little coffee shack. My colleagues think I wear coffee cologne when I leave there.
<review# 231,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/15/2014,4/3/2014,418,77,,4,3>Finally a real roast beef  poboy in this city! It was perfect debris, but not for the garlic shy! Their gravy is full of garlic, which I love! The bread is just right and it was washed down nicely with a barqs root beer in a bottle! Im slightly disappointed by the amount of meat in my sandwich (the reason for the 4 stars.) but my dining partner got their club and It was full of meat, so I will try that next time! I can't wait to come back!
<review# 232,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2013,4/2/2014,74,83,,5,2>This place is (semi-unfortunately) super convenient to the office where I work once per week. Yep, they're open (in the Main Street Market) during the work week, I believe from the morning to the early afternoon. They make a mean sweet crepe -- I'm a fan of the plain Nutella one, personally. It really hits the spot on a particularly long day of super exciting data entry!The only reason I didn't give them five stars (seriously, that Nutella crepe has pretty much saved my life) is that I got a savory crepe once, and it was way too salty -- maybe from the brie? I couldn't finish it. So I will stick with dessert, as I prefer anyway.TIP: If you only have a 30 minute lunch, better go on the early or late side because this place gets busy and crepe-making is not a speedy task. There gets to be a pretty big line at prime lunch time.
<review# 233,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/11/2014,4/1/2014,16,11,,3,2>My husband and I both work at LSU and frequent Atcha Bakery often.  We have never been disappointed in the food.  Very good Mediterranean food at great prices.  The atmosphere is not that great, hey it was an old Pizza Hut, but the facility is clean.  If you are around downtown or LSU you should check it out.
<review# 234,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/3/2013,3/31/2014,5,50,,4,2>If I had the option of 3.5 stars I would have gone with that.  I feel like many menu items are hit or miss.  I have been totally blown away by cioppino and completely let down by the Zapps crusted drum.  Other items fall on the spectrum.  Most of the time their little differentiating twists seem to fit into the "it seemed like a good idea at the time" category, but sometimes they can elevate a dish to greatness (case in point, the strawberry and cane vinaigrette on the duck breast).  In time I think they will nail some of the dishes they are attempting and those dishes will be the new classics I come back for again and again.I do feel that this place has grown a lot since it opened and I'm looking forward to continuing to eat my way through their menu.The only other reason I would have liked to deducted 1/2 a star is I have never, ever, been satisfied with the service.  Distant, condescending, insipid even borderline rude would all be words I would use to describe the general treatment.
<review# 235,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/10/2014,3/30/2014,39,40,,4,3>I've been told I have a bacon addiction, which if I had to pin it down, I think started when I first tried Tiger Deauxnuts' Maple Bacon Kingcake about a year ago. I bought it thinking I would share it to spread the word about this locally owned business but unfortunately devoured most of it myself before having the opportunity to share.  Needless to say, it's TO DIE FOR. Literally, last meal request worthy. I grew up thinking Mary Lee was all I needed to know about donuts, but truly sorry Mary Lee, you are officially replaced for this bacon addict ;)
<review# 236,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/22/2014,3/29/2014,3,8,,3,2>Pho is dankest in the city. If partaking in sushi order the fresh wasabi you won't be dissappionted. On 12-12-12 the pho was crap. Mr. Lee must've not been in the kitchen. I was dishonored. That's why I gave 4 stars only.
<review# 237,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,10/29/2013,3/28/2014,1,7,1,4,3>Ate here recently for lunch, and enjoyed it.  Started with grilled oysters, very well prepared.  They should put on the menu how they come, however.  They were served with a butter sauce and garlic topping (just how I like it,) but they don't really tell you that.  We tried the seafood etoufee with fried crawfish tails, and a fried shrimp poboy.  The etoufee is good but its not Chime's.  The poboy was pretty good, the shrimp were well seasoned and PILED HIGH which I liked.  I may return for dinner and try some other items.  Prices are on par with most seafood restaurants in the area.
<review# 238,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/19/2014,3/27/2014,6,16,,3,2>Consistently, pleasant place for both breakfast and lunch. The quality of food is excellent. It is not Frank's or Louie's but it is almost as good. The place is much better than the negative reviews. It is not in any way like Piccadilly. The food is flavourful. The portions are large enough. The service is excellent.
<review# 239,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/21/2014,3/26/2014,8,17,1,5,3>Best and most authentic New York style pizza with friendly service. Kerem is an excellent server who knows me by name and treats me like family. This iused to be a secret gem of mine but apparently the word is out. The pizza is always perfect amd in my opinion, the best in town.
<review# 240,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/6/2013,3/25/2014,1,18,,6,2>We moved to Baton Rouge about a year ago and were so glad to find Beau Soleil.   In a town that has an abundance of fried food and heavy Cajun fare, it is great to have a restaurant focused on providing local and sustainable product and not drowning dishes in sauce or batter.   The seasonal menu changes are great.  For Spring 2013 the pork chop it over-the-top good (and cooked medium to medium rare).   Service is solid and Meghan is a stand out.   Drinks are inventive and also change with the seasons.   Louisiana has incredible home grown foods from sweet potatoes to strawberries to responsibly fished seafood.  Thank you for Beau Soleil for celebrating what Louisiana has to offer.
<review# 241,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,3/3/2014,3/24/2014,100,239,,4,2>This place has some pretty disparate reviews. It's not hard to see why. The food is decent if you're into vegan/vegetarian foods or gluten free, but if not, you may want to skip it.If I come here I usually get a bowl with tempeh or shrimp and quinoa. My biggest complaint with the bowls is that both the teriyaki sauce and bbq sauce that come with it are cloyingly, almost sickeningly sweet. Maybe if you mixed up some sriracha it would cut some of the sweetness to a more acceptable level. Their tomato basil tastes a bit strange. It's a lot thinner than most tomato basil soups I've had. It's not terrible, but I probably would not get it again. On the other hand they have excellent veggie chili.As a lot of people have said, this place is way too overpriced for what you get. Another complaint I have that I haven't seen much of in the comments, is that this place has  a lot of service issues and can be extremely slow. I don't think that any of these issues are insurmountable, but this place has been open for several years and they still haven't addressed them.
<review# 242,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/18/2013,3/23/2014,37,137,,4,3>Never had a problem with food at this place. The portions, like most Italian restaurants, are huge. I usually order spaghetti and meatballs, but this time I decided to get a little adventurous and ordered the Neapolitan stuffed pasta, and boy was I surprised! In a good way though. The dish looked so pretty when it arrived. And tasted equally good. Since it was happy hours when we went, I got two sangrias for the price of one. All in all, I was a happy customer when I left.
<review# 243,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/15/2014,3/22/2014,105,85,,10,5>I visited Breck's today (their first day open!) with a friend for lunch. The menu looks fabulous and is very diverse- I was torn between a salad, 2 different sandwiches, and 2 different pastas. I eventually ordered the spinach and artichoke pasta that had bowties, olives, spinach, and artichokes in a creamy alfredo sauce. My friend ordered the linguine in alfredo sauce. The service was great and I was greeted at the door with a smile. Our server was friendly and helpful as well. The pasta came out really quickly and we had the pleasure of watching the cooks make our dishes in the open kitchen. The presentation was great, too!Most importantly, the food was totally delicious. The spinach was fresh and not overcooked, and the sauce was just right and not too salty. I appreciated the use of freshly cracked black pepper as well- it added a lot of flavor to my dish! My friend also liked her pasta but thought it was a bit plain. She said she'd order it with spinach added next time, and I think it would be delicious with broccoli and a squeeze of lemon!Finally, the "Lost bread pudding" is out of this world! I love bread pudding and have tried it at many restaurants in Baton Rouge. I have to say that this is the best I've tried! Looking forward to coming back and trying other menu items.

I was there for an engagement party so I got to try a little bit of everything on their menu. Frog legs, Stuffed alligator, pork chop, tilapia, and the boucherie board you must definitely try!! The crawfish Pot pie seemed pretty good, but I didn't try it. The tuna tartar and the short rib fricassee were not so impressive... And the Grits and Grillade cake... just don't. I'll pretend that's not even on the menu.

I recently moved to here from Chicago and didn't know where to go. I only need to get my roots touched up. Shane did my color and I loved it! The best thing about Shane is when he washes the color out. Hands Down Best rinse ever. Thanks Shane!!! Then I found out that for $15 they will take off the Shellac and put a new color on. Super pumped about this! The only sad thing is that she didn't have a lot of colors to choose from, but she did say she will get more options. I am going back in July for my deva cut... Gotta tame these curls in this humidity!!

<review# 251,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/21/2013,3/14/2014,4,5,1,4,3>We were a party of 4 on Saturday night around 7pm.  The parking lot was empty except for two cars.  Given that this restaurant is in one of the worse parts of town, that was not surprising.  We were greeted promptly by a friendly waitress who sat us in an otherwise unpopulated section.  In fact, there was only one other table with patrons in this spacious and well lit restaurant.  We made sure to tell the waitress before ordering that we had a groupon, which we had no problems redeeming.  Despite a little confusion with our drink orders (sweet tea vs. unsweet tea) and salad dressing options (who had which dressing?), our waitress was very attentive, personable, and warm. My boyfriend's entree was the only one that didn't come with a salad, so not wanting him to feel left out, she brought him a free salad.  My entree came with a choice of potato, I chose a loaded baked potato.  When my order arrived with fries instead, she brought me the potato free of charge despite my protests that the fries were fine.  Now for the food:We ordered the sauteed boudin balls as an app.  Honestly, nothing to write home about. I ordered the catfish plate, the fish was perfectly fileted.  Not too thick, not too thin, and it was also seasoned well.   I would have loved some cocktail sauce but ketchup with Tobasco substituted just fine.  My boyfriend ordered the catfish poboy; if you want tartar sauce make sure to ask for it. He says it wasn't mindblowing, it was just a poboy.  Our dining partners ordered the seafood stuffed potato and the ribeye.  The potato was huge and she didn't have any complaints.  The steak was perfectly cooked and he raved about it.  We'll be going here again as we bought a second groupon, not realizing we could only redeem one per table.

<review# 257,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/4/2013,3/8/2014,23,18,,5,4>There is no place like Meche's. I decided to review the one on Rue Louis because it's newer and therefore less popular. The donuts here are a little different from the ones on Guilbeau, but not bad different. I think they're a little softer and slightly "gewyer" here. Also their chocolate is slightly different. The only thing I will say is that none of the times I've been here have the donuts been warm. In my case, that wasn't a problem because I had access to a microwave, but some customers may not. That is the only "bad" thing I have to say. The best donuts in the whole world are at meche's - the one on Rue Louis and the one on Guilbeau.
<review# 258,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/23/2014,3/5/2014,22,50,,4,3>Not consistent-I have had some of the best jambalaya here and some of the worst. Plates and buckets of chicken and sausage or pork and sausage are available along with sides and pints and/or quarts of white beans and potato salad. Pork usually sells out first so if that's what you are wanting, get there early.  And trust me, you don't want the bottom of the pot jambalaya anyway.  They also have chicken and Andouille gumbo which is pretty good.  It is a shame they do not have a place to dine in as the others in Baton Rouge, since Gonzales is the Jambalaya Capital of the world!
<review# 259,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/7/2013,3/4/2014,4,5,1,6,4>Brewski's has changed ownership since the last 2 reviews were written.  You MUST go and experience it for yourself now! Menu has changed for the better!! While they have changed the boudin burger they did keep it on the menu- updated for the better!!! Try the Fiery Chicken wrap!! The bartenders are excellent!! Experienced and awesome!! Meghan, Lauren and Katie are awesome!! They are getting a better draft beer assortment so give them props!! Still have pool tables but are a true Ragin' Cajun sports bar!! They have special events all the time! Also DJ's periodically! Just an awesome neighborhood bar!!!The building is still the same (can't do much about that), but they have painted inside!Best of all still non-smoking - with covered area for smokers.
<review# 260,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/31/2013,3/3/2014,67,27,1,4,2>Dwight's crawfish etouffe is the bombdotcom. The best I've ever had by far! My friend ordered the steak and etouffe combo which I got a bite of and it was also so delicious!!! Will definitely be coming back for that. We also ordered boiled crawfish but it was slightly overdone. But still pretty good (not as good as Crawfish Time).All in all, a great place to bring anyone who is visiting Louisiana to give them a taste of cajuntown!
<review# 261,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2013,3/2/2014,6,6,,9,5>I'm a frequent diner for this place.  The staff is always skilled and polite and courteous.  I actually can't express that enough.  They're top notch.  Same goes for the food.  One of the best dinning experiences around.  They're a fine dining restaurant, but like most places in Louisiana, jeans and a t-shirt are acceptable.  I wouldn't wear gym clothes though.They change they're menu up seasonally and always have wonderful dishes.  They've had a few absolute standouts, a sous vide chicken thigh and last falls beef short rib dish.  For me, those were incredible.  For a first time diner I would suggest getting the sample appetizer with crab cakes, you won't be dissatisfied.  A cup of gumbo aswel.  They do experiment with dishes from time to time, and I'll be honest, there's been a couple of things I didn't care for.  But Charlie G's is very reliable.  The service combined with skill in food cannot be understated.
<review# 262,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/9/2013,3/1/2014,35,21,,4,2>There is a reason this place has won so many awards for the best crawfish in the Times of Acadiana.  The crawfish are quite simply amazing!
<review# 263,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2013,2/28/2014,20,14,1,4,3>We are new to the area and this place was literally two blocks from our new place.  We decided to try it out on a Sunday evening around 5:30.  There wasn't a wait at all, which was surprising.  Usually we've seen cars packed at just about any normal time.  Our waiter was super friendly and did a great job in keeping our drinks refilled.  The food came out in an acceptable amount of time, and it was amazing. Even something as mundane as mashed potatoes were perfect.  I ordered a salad with my meal and all the ingredients were fresh and crisp.  My husband had the stuffed grilled catfish with twice baked potatoes and I had fried crawfish tails with loaded mashed potatoes.  We agreed that it was the best meal we'd had in a while, and we came from Houston.  We decided we wanted dessert, so we settled on the turtle cheesecake and was not disappointed.  It was a giant portion and definitely enough for two! The chocolate and caramel sauces were divine!The best part about it was it was a super nice meal in a great atmosphere and for two people with drinks, a salad extra and dessert, it rounded out at $50. That was a great price.
<review# 264,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/21/2014,2/27/2014,32,76,1,5,4>I've been living in Lafayette for over 7 years and FINALLY tried this place out just the other day and... WOW. It may have also been my first Vietnamese dining experience now that I think about it, and I am a fan! Someone suggested I try the Pho, being one of their more popular dishes, so I took their word for it and was very pleased. I slurped that baby down in no time at all. It was so fresh and aromatic, definitely an interesting first take.Being that I've only gone once and tried one dish, I'll give it 4 stars for now. I'm definitely looking forward to going back again and trying more!
<review# 265,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,2/2/2014,2/26/2014,179,366,1,5,3>So I heard there was a new restaurant in town, and the pictures of the food here from other people makes the food look so delicious, I knew I had to try it.  Met up with a buddy of mine and went during lunch.  Drove up, packed parking lot, good sign right?  Wrong!  The people here are nice and the decor is very clean and vibrant.  Just wish the food matched their restaurant.  We had the following:- Boudin Eggrolls - pretty much boudin wrapped in egg roll wrappers and deep fried.  This was actually pretty delicious, having this as an appetizer, I was getting excited because I thought the burger I was gonna devour next was going to be good- Hook and Boil Signature Burger - 6oz patty, onion strings, pepper jack, spring mix and their hook sauce - honestly, the burger was mediocre, it wasn't bad, but wasn't great neither... but the thing that killed it for me was the very dry bread.  Yeah it looks cool with a stamp on the buns and all.. but really, who wants a dried out bread to eat their burger with?? I know I don't.Had a bad first time experience, not sure when I'll be back, or if, I'll even be back.
<review# 266,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,6/15/2013,2/25/2014,69,47,1,5,2>Generally, I like the food but service is soooo slow. Don't bother ordering carry out. It will never be ready when you get there so it would actually take less time to just eat-in.
<review# 267,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/4/2014,2/24/2014,19,23,,5,2>The food is amazing! The turkey necks & boiled seafood are boiled to perfection. The popcorn shrimp is my favorite however, I have to add catfish bites to my order. Try anything in there and you will not be disappointed.
<review# 268,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/12/2014,2/23/2014,30,7,1,5,3>I love this place -  hits the nail on the head in creating a successful "local coffee shop" - you know, those kinds we always enjoy the feel of so much when they first open but don't last a year....When a friend first introduced me to Brew-Ha-ha in 2008 I figured it would go that way as well; I underestimated Gabby Loubiere's moxie and business savvy and je ne sais quoi :) the coffee is good and choosing at the cake ball bar is like being a kid in a candy store :).  But this place thrives on it's vibe and culture.  Feel free to become old friends with the staff and everybody in line with you - it's easy to do, every time....Everything that appears here ends up great - sandwiches at lunch, open mic nights, art shows, breakfast, brunch, and "Munch..."  I am glad this place is here, for sure, and am always excited to see what's next. And now there's a Little Free Library, sponsored by Sophie!  Thanks Sophie!
<review# 269,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/1/2014,2/22/2014,20,5,,4,3>Ivar's is a local hangout to watch sports on tv. Pool table and other games in back. I like their bar food - especially the catfish and I always get their Quesadilla Sticks but I ask for Ranch Dressing with them. If you are a wing person, order those.
<review# 270,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2014,2/21/2014,6,5,4,8,5>As a foodie, I was looking forward to checking this place out. The wait was long, even on a Monday night, for a table (45 min or so), but I now see why as the food was absolutely incredible. The place is pretty pricey, but the quality is fantastic. The decor doesn't quite make sense as a seafood restaurant, but the locals know this building used to house Zorba's, a Mediterranean restaurant, and it definitely has that kind of flair.Ok, back to the food. I had the Pontchartrain, and it was honest-to-God one of the best plates of food I've had anywhere, no kidding. Perfectly cooked fish, crispy soft shell crab, creamy sauce, and a sprinkling of honey roasted pecans and almonds that added a perfect amount of sweetness to balance the saltiness of the dish. If I had had the $$$ I seriously would have ordered two just for myself. It was THAT good!
<review# 271,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2013,2/20/2014,1,8,,3,2>Love the crab fingers and stuffed shrimps. My first time coming to this location I fail in love.
<review# 272,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,12/17/2013,2/17/2014,3,24,,3,2>Custom burgers with a whole slew of condiments, to include even avocado, and fried onion strings.  They offer sweet potato fries as well as regular.  U order at the counter and wait at a pick up counter for your order.  Totally self serve here!  Manager is all over the place making sure everyone is happy.  This burger spews juice so u have to make sure that u r over the tray when u bite into it.  The burger is a very slim patty but delicious.  This burger and fries is every bit as good as Five Guys!
<review# 273,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/1/2014,2/16/2014,22,45,,4,2>My husband and I were here last night to celebrate his birthday. This was our third time dining at Restaurant IPO and I highly recommend it! Last night we started with duck rolls and the seafood martini thing. While the seafood martini thing was good I probably wouldn't get it again. The duck rolls were great, though! We didn't get the bayou eggs this time but we have before and they're awesome; too. We each got a cocktail with our appetizers. I tried a pomegranate cucumber basil martini. It was bright pink and sweeter than what I'd normally prefer; but it was very good. My husband said it tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher. He got what our server described as IPO's take on an old fashioned. It was great! For dinner I ordered the steak frites and my husband had the wall street burger. My dinner was good but his burger was amazing. He struggled to finish it and he made a mess of this giant, drippy burger; but he thoroughly enjoyed it. And it comes with wine!
<review# 274,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2013,2/15/2014,2,14,,4,2>The tacos are amazing! And the drink specials are really good! You walk up to the counter and order, which the menu lets you pick individual things instead of a plate, then you go sit in a booth and wait for the kitchen to call your number over the loud speaker to get your food! Very fun!
<review# 275,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/6/2013,2/14/2014,14,26,,5,2>My wife and I were driving down Highland near Lee towards our normal sushi place when I suggested that maybe we try another, I broke out Yelp and found this place. We walked in about 5pm and there was only one other group in the whole place. It was a Monday night after all. We asked for a quiet table in the back which we got. The wait staff was very nice and attentive, the sushi chef's busy at their posts and the decor was very nice and fitting. My wife ordered the edamame and iced green tea for the two of us. We ordered the LSU Roll and the Tokyo Roll. Total bill was $30. The Edamame was steaming hot and fresh, a bit too salty for our tastes, I guess just ask when you order to hold back on the salt a bit. Otherwise these were very good and just enough to satiate us before our order came. Sushi was fresh. Tokyo Roll was $6.50 and the LSU roll was $10 or $12. We normally go all out but tonight it was low key. We were content with what we got, split it 50/50 between us and we were done. I think we'll go back and try some other things. I liked that they had Pho in the menu as well. I'm glad to know it's there.
<review# 276,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/10/2013,2/13/2014,4,5,,6,3>I stumbled upon this shop trying to kill time. I wanted to try something different, in Addition it was HOT outside!!! I have nothing negative to say about it. I like the variety of flavors & the exotic menu. Smoothies are good . Oh & the cup they serve it in is cool, hard to spill.
<review# 277,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/26/2013,2/12/2014,46,53,,6,3>PBL deserves a 6/5. This is a staple downtown Baton Rouge.If you want something that is the epitome of a southern restaurant then you need to go here.Their food is pretty simple and they have most of the regular stuff. They have been in business for years and over the last 5 years I've been there about 7-8 times and everytime I get the same top quality po-boys. Unfortunately, my review is a little bias because I haven't had much other than their po-boys besides fried pickles but if you want a po-boy, you need to go here.Highly Recommend these guys.

<review# 279,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/7/2013,2/10/2014,0,8,,4,2>Great family owned Italian restaurant.  Friendly service and great food.  Have not gotten anything that was not good.  Large servings for the price that you pay.

My only complaint was that the ends of my taquitos were empty, by a lot. Lots of extra tortilla on the end and in the enchilada my boyfriend had, the meat also contained potatoes as an extra filler. That could have at least been specified as he doesn't like potatoes. But food was great otherwise and waiter was very attentive with food and drinks!
<review# 283,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/10/2013,2/6/2014,1,4,,6,2>Great southern soul food recipes. Fair prices, fast service and CONSISTENTLY excellent food right in the heart of the Capitol city! Try the carrot soufflé, it's absolutely amazing!

<review# 285,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/9/2013,2/4/2014,0,11,4,10,7>This place is by far the best Mexican in baton rouge. Everything is authentic and tastes like it should . The staff doesn't speak much English which is fine with me....they are sweet, attentive and fast.  Each table receives complimentary chips and salsa. The ingredients are so fresh and tasty. The tacos are delicious and they have a variety of meats to chose from.  I'd also recomend the tamales, also very fresh and tasty.  The burritos are huge and delish... as well as the tostadas and gorditas. They also bring out sauces if you like extra spice.  I've been here enough times to try all these things.. and I've yet to be disappointed.  They only thing I don't like so much is no free refills on drinks, aside from that...everything is great.
<review# 286,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/21/2013,2/3/2014,6,29,,4,2>The food here is divine! I've gone a couple of times with coworkers and enjoyed myself. The sweet potato hush puppies are to die for but then again most of the things on their menu are. With that said there are a few downfalls. I've had to send my drink back there a few times because they tasted awful. Diet coke with no fizz, sweet tea that tastes like syrup, etc. Also the gumbo tasted over cooked. The service can be a little slow I noticed but the wait staff always look like they are workkng hard. Would definitely recommend someone eating here.
<review# 287,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/20/2014,2/2/2014,3,7,,4,2>Very nice and cozy without feeling cramped. Went here during the holiday season and very much enjoyed the pianist doling out holiday tunes. The lighting was perfect for a romantic date.

<review# 289,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/11/2013,1/31/2014,0,5,,4,3>Finally a Johnny's Pizza in Baton Rouge. I live right by this place and eat here all of the time. The buffet is always great, but I recommend going ahead and buying a personal pizza or a pizza for your group of people (sometimes the pizza goes pretty fast on the buffet). My favorite is the Chicken Bacon Ranch pizza, but honestly everything I have had here is amazing! Can't go wrong with pizza, especially here. Skip Dominos and Papa Johns- they have those everywhere. GO TO JOHNNYS!
<review# 290,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/3/2013,1/30/2014,8,8,,3,2>Spanish Moon was the first bar in Baton Rouge that I could actually enjoy myself in.  I usually went either on Thursday nights, for 80's Night, or on Friday or Saturday nights if my friend's band was playing.The crowd is generally 18 - 25 year old artsy hipster types, but there is actually a decent mix of people most nights.  The atmosphere is pretty cool, especially once you know all the stories of supposed hauntings - it has a bit of a New Orleans feel to it.  The downsides are:-First and foremost, it's SO FREAKING SMOKY.  Even when nobody is actually smoking at any given moment, there's so much smoke and nicotine stink in there that you're going to come out reeking, even after just a few minutes.  I guess it's not an issue if you smoke, but as a non-smoker, this is a MAJOR turnoff for me.-It gets incredibly crowded sometimes.  Like, can't-make-your-way-to-the-bathroom, bar or exit, can-hardly-turn-to-talk-to-a-friend kind of crowded.-Although some pretty great acts have played here, including a lot of awesome local talent, the acoustics are pretty poor.  Not sure if it's the acoustics of the building itself, or if it's just bad sound equipment.I've read a lot of reviews saying how nice the bartenders are.  However, I've never been particularly struck by the bartenders here one way or the other - except once, when a bartender threatened (after two or three beers) to stop serving my husband if he didn't start tipping her.  He usually tips at the end of the night when he closes out the debit tab.  She didn't have any way of knowing this, I suppose, but that's still not exactly quality customer service in my opinion.  Out of spite, he did start tipping cash-per-drink...to the other bartender.  That was certainly an exceptional occurrence...but even on the best nights, the barstaff never seemed anything but harried to me.
<review# 291,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,8/11/2013,1/29/2014,24,19,,4,2>This place had one huge problem. The prices were ridiculous! The food was actually pretty good, but boy oh boy those prices. We had the cheapest appetizer: The boudin balls with spicy mustard. They were very good and the came out very fast. For dinner (which also came out fast) I had the seafood platter, my boyfriend had the crab au gratin and my friend had the crawfish enchiladas. The entrees were spot on. All of my food was fried to perfection. The crab au gratin was truly an experience and the crawfish enchiladas were a perfect Cajun/Mexican fusion. However, the sides left something to be desired. The fries were bland. If you blinked you would have missed the corn maque choux. The stuffed potato seemed to be something one would microwave and the rice dressing was forgettable. Lastly we had a very average bread pudding. It was good, but again, forgettable. All in all, I will not be returning to Boutin's. the food was good, but not for those prices. $100 for 3 people is a little ridiculous. We didn't even get alcoholic drinks!
<review# 292,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/7/2013,1/28/2014,3,4,,4,2>This is one of the rare salons which accepts walk-ins in spite of its heavy client volume. I really appreciate them for accommodating me anytime. These guys are so quick and fast and of course very talented. they know what they are doing and they never experiment with my hair. I usually get my hair done with Leigh Anne Watson, she does it pretty nicely and is very entertaining. I would 100% recommend Salon Chateau. Though it is little expensive, I feel it is worth it after being to other salons.

<review# 295,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/22/2013,1/25/2014,30,5,2,5,3>This is the one of the  best Mexican restaurants in Baton Rouge ! Not just because of the food, but for the atmosphere and service.The menu is pretty standard Mexican. But what makes Superior stand out are the seafood entrees. When you order shrimp fajitas or shrimp enchiladas you won't end up with just a handful of scrawny shrimps. All of the seafood and fish is very fresh and you get a generous helping. Speaking of enchiladas, I'd say that's the must get on the menu.I tried the tacos, tamales, and tostadas. All are very good, but the enchiladas stand out because of their flavor. There are several different kinds of sauces and all the choices are loaded with an amazing cheese that melts so smooth it becomes almost like a sauce. The tortilla chips are made in house, which you can tell from their crispiness and light flavor. The salsa is pretty good, but I wish there was a spicier option. I asked for a spicier  sauce to put on my food and they said no they don't carry any! :(If you come for the lunch it's a pretty laid back crowd. But the restaurant  gets packed at night. I'd say it's a great place just about any crowd( kids, date, friends). However,  I wouldn't bring the kids too late though because there's live music and drink specials..  and with that can come a few drunks!
<review# 296,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/13/2013,1/24/2014,58,10,3,9,5>Okay I need to put my stamp of approval on this place. We had a party of 20 last night (on Mother's Day) for a birthday and their hibachi grills are definitely accommodating. There was no wait (we called a day ahead). Also, You had a good view of everyone and the 2 chefs cooking on each grill from any spot. Food:BEST CLEAR SOUP EVER! It's slightly on the spicy side but very flavorful. I ordered the filet and scallop hibachi and my steak (med rare) was perfectly done. The scallops were on small side but still tasty more so when dipped in the provided sauce. As for the sushi, my friend ordered a couple of rolls and they brought out a plate the size of a turkey platter! Way more then he expected and he seemed to enjoy the rolls.. Nothing to write home about there. Drinks:The cold bottle of Haiku sake was good and reasonably priced. I ordered the Small house sake cold and they added pineapple for me which was lovely. The accommodation:I told the waitress at the beginning we had a birthday boy and a drummer ended our meal with a complimentary sundae and a beat to sing along to. :D
<review# 297,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/5/2013,1/23/2014,10,4,2,4,2>Great neighborhood bar. The building used to be a car garage, and the owners managed to make that charming--huge garage doors that open to the patio, industrial style lighting, etc. There's almost always a food truck or cart in the parking lot. This bar quickly turned into my Old Faithful.Go when the weather is nice and sit on the patio. Download the remote app on your smartphone and vote for what songs you want to hear (mostly indie music). There's a ping-pong table on the patio and a shuffle board inside. The cocktail specialties aren't always great, but they're fun to try if you have some extra dollars. If you can manage drinking a bloody mary after 4:00 in the afternoon, order one from Olga--she deserves an award for those masterpieces.
<review# 298,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2012,1/22/2014,32,7,1,4,3>Whenever I'm hankering for great sushi I make my way to Derek Chang's Koto.  The Hawaiian roll is my absolute favorite though most everything else is pretty good too.  My boyfriend had never tried sushi and he was all over the Pretty Roll.  I've been here for the hibachi too and they didn't disappoint.  The meat and veggies are cooked perfectly, the dressings are all delicious, and you never leave hungry.  The atmosphere is very nice and chill bordering on swanky.  Its a bit more expensive than some of the other sushi places in town but it is definitely worth it.

<review# 300,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/26/2010,1/20/2014,108,213,2,3,2>I had the Grilled Eggplant Avocado Panini and it was SUPER delicious!!! I would definitely order this again! Here's the description from their menu: grilled eggplant, avocado, light mayo, tomatoes, onions, and mixed greens, with freshly made hummus.The panini also comes with a side and I chose Baked Sweet Potato Fries. I don't know what I was thinking but for some reason I thought it would come out as Fried potato fries when obviously it said "Baked". I guess I am  use to being everything fried around here. Nonetheless, the baked Sweet Potato Fries were great! And adding cinnamon on top of it was a great idea!What stopped me from giving it a 5 star rating is because I wished my fries were super hot but they were only semi-warm when it reached to our table. A little disappointing but I would still order this again!Service was very good and my bill came out to be $12. It's not cheap and it's not too expensive. And I have yet to try their baked goodies!
<review# 301,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/29/2013,1/19/2014,4,6,2,3,2>ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES EVER!!!  The first time I ate here I wasn't a huge fan, because I didn't order the right thing, but the next time I came, and the next, and every time after that I have absolutely loved it every single time.  I'm so glad I gave it a second chance.  A few of my favorite things are the cheese sticks, the fried veggies, the blackened tuna steak, boiled crabs, the house dressing, and that's just to name a few.  There are always very delicious specials and I always look at the specials board first to see if there is something that catches my eye.  If not, I go back to some of my old favorites on the menu.  The best thing about this place is that it's perfect for a group of people who don't all like the same kinds of food because there are so many different types of dishes, something for everyone to love.  I love this place!
<review# 302,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/1/2012,1/18/2014,6,92,,2,1>I still rate this sandwich/salad shop as my favorite one.  Mrs. Inga is so sweet and so nice and it shows through her food.  She really cares about her customers.  She sets high standards that her employees must meet.  The service here is VERY prompt and super nice.  The amount of customers they process for lunchtime into early afternoon is insane.  Especially during a semester.  I don't know how they do it other than really good organization!  You walk up to the register, look at the menu chaulkboard if you don't know what you want, then place your order with the cashier, take your receipt, and wait till they call your number.  When they call your number, you pick up your food on a plastic cafeteria type tray and grab your chips (that are on a rack near the pickup area), then fill your own drink at the soda machine (just like you would at BK or McD's) then sit down at the small round tables that remind me of Coffee Call's tables, and enjoy your meal!  It's that simple.  Inga's salads are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  I can't seem to put my finger on it what she does to make them so good.  Been tryin to figure it out for years!  I always get the Chef salad.  It is made with rolled up swirled Cheeses and meats.  It has turkey and ham, swiss and American processed VERY thinly sliced cheeses and meats.  SO good!!!  Then in the recent years, she has started adding pickled sliced banana peppers and I think pepperoncini's, and thinly sliced (almost julienned) white onion.  She also includes several thin slices of tomato.  She always asks if you want oregano sprinkled on your salad and they always ask what type dressing, which I always get the red wine vinegar and oil.  I don't know what type of red wine vinegar and oil she's using but it is SO GOOD!  Awesome quality!  The oil is not heavy, but light.  The red wine vinegar tastes like a really good quality.  Not too potent, but just right.  The green lettuce is shredded Iceburg.  That would probably be my only suggestion to her that she might want to change the way the lettuce is presented because it makes it a bit difficult to eat when it's shredded.  But I know she does that as a time saver for the sandwiches.  The quality of meat and cheeses she uses are TOP NOTCH!!  I have NOTHING bad to say about that.  I only wish I knew what type she used so I could buy some for sandwiches to make at home haha!  Then again, she'd probably want me to come to her shop to eat! Great sandwich shop, uncomparable to the others.  The sandwich bread is fresh fresh.  The zapp's chips are really great paired with a sandwich too.  She serves fresh brewed Community brand Iced Tea (Sweet and Unsweetened).  I usually don't get the sweet because at other places it's usually too sweet. At Inga's, however, it is perfect.  Not too sweet, but just right.  Really great shop for lunch!  The chicken Teriyaki bowls are SOOO good!!!  She knows her business!!  She knows her customers.  She knows her stuff. two thumbs up!  Keep it goin Inga!  We love you!!!  She's open till 9 p.m too.
<review# 303,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/9/2013,1/17/2014,25,32,,7,3>Magpie is a worthy stop on the way to work or a comfortable destination for an afternoon of work or study.  Whether you are searching for a lighthouse on the rocky coast of otherwise crappy Louisiana coffee offerings (PJ's, CC, et al) or need an escape for a soft chair and a tasty meal, Magpie just might become part of your life.True to form, James has listened to customer feedback and updated Magpie's whole bean offerings with more single origin variety from Portland's Coava Coffee.  Coava is one of the more recognizable names in third wave coffee and the attention they devote to their whole bean sourcing and roasting is a welcome companion to Magpie's focus on quality and meticulous preparation. I wish Magpie would dose pour overs a bit heavier, and I also wish they would have somebody zoned to slow bar at peak times so you could count on a consistent result (a V60, like risotto, rewards attentiveness), but these are big labor and resource commitments and therefore easier said than done.The juices, relative newcomers to the menu, are quite good.  You can order a fresh one or grab a to-go bottle if you're not staying.  Be relieved (if you like putting good stuff in your body) or warned (if you like Sunny D) that these are the very nakedest of juices; you're getting liquid fruits/vegetables in a cup, not sweeteners and fragrances.  There's not much better than an ice cold watermelon lime juice from Magpie after mowing the lawn, let me tell you.The usual house-made, fresh scones, muffins, quiches, casseroles, sandwiches, and now pizza (!) are as strong as ever.  If you're a homegrown Louisianan expecting to be punched in the face with blackening spices and thick gravies, you'll be disappointed, but if you want a profoundly local, elemental, nourishing meal, Magpie delivers.  Also, they're on this Paleo diet tip and offer a bunch of things that are good for all you cavemen out there; Magpie is the only place I know of that caters to that particular diet.The best part of Magpie, though, is the people.  James and crew are always friendly and attentive, and the care they put into their work shows in their product, in the cleanliness of the cafe, and in the growing coterie of regular clientele.
<review# 304,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/20/2013,1/16/2014,193,124,2,8,6>Overall, I am a huge fan, and intend to find myself in there whenever I am on that side of town.I first found them when I was gathering some information for a newsletter featuring La Tiendita, and I found out about Pinedas and I am so glad that I did. The first time I had a sampling of a couple of things: a cookie with a cheesecake filling, an elephant ear, and some kind of pastry with a pineapple filling. I took them to go and enjoyed them later. The lady who helped me is always really nice, and she suggested I try the elephant ear with coffee. Well, I don't drink coffee, but it perfectly complemented my tea the next morning. The last time I went, I got the cheesecake, a huge piece of flan and some kind of chocolate pastry. The flan was a little firmer than I am used to, but it was still sweet and creamy. The cheesecake was huge, sweet and gives my own cheesecake a run for its money. The best part? A big slice of cheesecake, a huge piece of flan and a chocolate pastry cost my just over $8. If you want something sweet, but a little outside the ordinary, I definitely suggest moseying on over to Pinedas.
<review# 305,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/8/2013,1/15/2014,111,195,3,5,5>Azteca's is a very cool place. One of the nicest looking Mex places I've been to... beautiful decor, granite bar, lots of wood... and about the nicest bathrooms I've seen in any restaurant lately.Their chips and sauce are killer, as are their margaritas. I am excited to go back here again for a full meal experience, as the initial sampling of their fare, atmosphere and service was top notch.
<review# 306,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/12/2013,1/14/2014,48,279,3,10,3>I would rather go here than Albertson's. They carry Shur Fine products which are surely fine and surely cheap. I mean, like, a dollar for 4 rolls of good quality TP. Rest assured I know my TP.They also have a good salad bar. Service is friendly. Best of all-it's never really packed. Getting in and out is a breeze.
<review# 307,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/14/2013,1/13/2014,60,159,,5,3>I had a good experience at Alfred Angelo. I will be the maid of honor in a wedding this coming April, so I went with the bride to try on bridesmaid dresses to determine which one(s) she wanted us to wear. We were able to get a same-day appointment, and the staff was very helpful. We gave some ideas of the styles we liked from the catalog, and the consultant helped us pick out several very good options. She was also very helpful when it came to zipping up dresses, lacing corsets, and clipping things to make the sample dresses fit. Overall, we came out with 2 great options for me (so great that the bride and I are having a hard time deciding between them!) and a similar but less expensive option for the other bridesmaids. My only very minor complaint is that it was difficult to shop within a price range because the dresses weren't really grouped by price, which would've been helpful since cost is often a huge issue for bridesmaids' dresses. All of the dresses I tried on ended up costing a little over what all the bridesmaids could afford until we specifically hunted for a more affordable dress. More affordable dresses were definitely available though, and since the consultant was so helpful, finding them was quick work.I would definitely come back to Alfred Angelo for my own bridal party needs if I were to get married.
<review# 308,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/1/2013,1/12/2014,111,62,,2,1>Outstanding personal service. I had a request that Heather accomodated a few minutes before opening time. She graciously allowed me to purchase what I needed so that I could give it to a friend before she had to leave for the airport. Nice merchandise as well as excellent service. Thank you!
<review# 309,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/28/2013,1/11/2014,7,85,,2,1>Good service and price. I like the fact that I can actually pick and choose whatever mexican food I want. It's not huge and the review comparing mexican food here to the mexican in California, just stop because there is no comparison to Baja style in Cali, which is the best most fresh mexican you will ever find in the states. My fave was the pork fajita meat(so much flavor) and tres leches for dessert.
<review# 310,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/13/2013,1/10/2014,38,71,,3,2>Ahuua's is my neighborhood Mexican place. I've dined in and ordered take-out and have always been satisfied.The atmosphere is festive, with a nice covered outdoor patio space. They do have live music on the patio on weekend nights. The service has always been prompt and friendly. Their prices are what I would consider mid-range, with dishes ranging from $12 to $18. I love their black bean soup and the grilled tilapia dish.
<review# 311,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/28/2013,1/9/2014,1,9,,2,1>The family and I ate here on October 24, around 7pm. Not crowded and we were seated promptly. Our food was very good and the service was good. We've eaten Deangelos several times and found it consistently good. Not expensive. Clean.
<review# 312,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/30/2013,1/8/2014,122,389,7,11,6>Seriously, how can anyone go a "5" on a driving range? Well I can & here's why... this place is more than just a flat piece of ground with hitting areas, a lot more...first off, yes it is a flat piece of ground where duffers such as me can go to work on that unfolding lawnchair of a swing (props to Roy Mcavoy from "Tin Cup" for that line) in hopes of being able to repeat it when playing in that $20 money match at their local course...this joint also has lights so you can continue to punish yourself with that jacked up flailing you call a swing well after the sun has become embarrassed and left the sky! AND this place has a nice clubhouse structure with a bar! Hell yeah that's worth 2 stars right there and we all know it... So you only have to walk up some stairs to get a beverage to drown your frustrations in as you wonder why you love this damn game that never seems to love you back...Plus this place has a little pro shop where one can get new shafts or grips for one's sticks should one feel the need... on top of that they buy used clubs and sell used drivers, clubs and putters at a reasonable price...A large bucket (100 balls) will run you $12 which is in line with most driving ranges...medium bucket will run you around $8...Now the main drawback is getting here... the best way to access the place is off of I-10 at the Siegen Lane exit, if heading east on 10 take the exit and keep bearing to your right so you're heading south on Siegen, make sure you're in the right hand lane and once you cross the overpass be prepared to make a right on a little road that loops back under said overpass and you're there... if you're heading west, take the exit but make a left at bottom of the exit ramp and follow the above directions. If you're looking for place to practice that swing and then have an adult beverage to soothe your nerves afterwards give this place a whirl, I'm thinking it'll be just what the (swing) doctor ordered!
<review# 313,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/5/2013,1/7/2014,2,24,,2,1>Went to George's after a LSU BB game.  It is under an overpass, near several other restaurants.  At first you might wonder if you are at the right pace.  A small, dark place.  Dollar bills cover the walls.  Menu written on a black board.  Very clean. You walk up to the bar to order.  Write your name and order on a ticket.  Very nice people.  You will be called to get your order.  Dined with a 12 yr old.  Welcomes kids but it really isn't a "kids" kind of place.  Beer and full bar.  Had a bacon cheeseburger and catfish.  Lots of homemade fries.  Good food.  I found it to be more expensive than advertised.
<review# 314,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2013,1/6/2014,30,23,,4,3>Best Dim Sum in Baton Rouge. Well, only Dim Sum in Baton Rouge really. If you can't make the trip to Houston, this place will massage the appetite.This place does have it's flair though. I mean where else should you find good Chinese food than, well "off-the beaten path". This place does look a little menacing from the front, but come inside and it will really surprise you. The inside is well decorated in traditional Chinese form with special detail on the ceilings. Now moving on to the culinary experience:Note: I am Cantonese and have enjoyed Dim Sum from Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston, and Hong Kong, so my standards may be above your normal aficionado.As for the menus, they are nicely done with both Chinese and English as well as pictures (ABC's rejoice!). I ordered a few items my first go round:Fried taro root dumplings: Not the best I've ever had. Good thing I like taro, because these tasty pockets had plenty (meaning less other stuffing) and they were fried right.BBQ pork stuffed rice noodles - These were a little off to me. My gf enjoyed them, but I thought the noodle part was too glutenous.Pork Spare Ribs - not badPhoenix Claws (think chicken) - These were edibleSteamed Beef Tripe - Flavor was OK, overcooked in my opinionBeef chow fun - decent attempt, but misses the mark on noodle texture and sauce flavor. Does well in terms of beef quality.There are plenty of things that I still want to try on this menu and I will certainly be coming back to this little diamond in the rough. I was also surprised at the selection of traditional teas they had available. I wouldn't write home about it, but certainly adequate.Since this is my favorite Chinese place in Baton Rouge, I have to give it an extra star!
<review# 315,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/20/2013,1/5/2014,12,33,,3,1>As far as picture-menu Chinese joints go, I think this place is one of the best. They offer a lunch special that has a buffet and you can fill a to-go box with as much as you want, but we opted for lunch specials instead because they're only $4.50 and your food is freshly made for you rather than already sitting out.Had the sesame chicken and the garlic sauce pork. I think their sesame chicken is one of the best around. And their fried rice.. Perfect. I don't like it too greasy, but I also don't like it too bland. Their's was perfect. Overall, a good little gem in a random spot.
<review# 316,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/1/2013,12/31/2013,45,125,,2,1>Finally found a place worth writing a positive review about in Baton Rouge. I decided to  give this place a try and I'm really glade I did.I decided to  get an order to go.  I ordered the triple basket.  This  came with crawfish, shrimp, and catfish with jambalaya and hush puppies. The seafood was well cooked  and lightly seseasoned. I prefer this light seasoning to some places that are heavy handed.  Especially with the salt.  The jambalaya wasn't really a jambalaya but a good rice dish none the less. The hush puppies were really good and not at all greasy. Good food, service and price I'll definitely be back.
<review# 317,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/25/2013,12/30/2013,20,57,2,2,1>Great place to go and feel healthy.  Visit at least once a week since I recently moved close by.  Prices beat the grocery store.  The selection of fresh fruit and vegetables are nice and I like the frozen options for good meal/dessert ideas.  Addicted to their hot salsa selection.
<review# 318,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/11/2013,12/29/2013,18,10,,3,1>Amazing food and good service, but it's always such a long wait to get your order. The Tiger Shrimp app is amazing and the Alaska roll is a favorite. The six-three roll has the freshest tuna and crab...it's a must try!Each time we visit everything is always fresh and friendly service. Worth the wait.
<review# 319,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/19/2013,12/28/2013,1,4,,2,1>This place has awesome BBQ! I come here for lunch whenever I'm in mid city because it's quick and easy, excellent hot food, and great service. My favorites are the pulled pork sandwich and the boudin egg rolls!
<review# 320,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/23/2013,12/27/2013,8,13,1,8,3>This place is the best!!!Listen, getting a hair cut can be a anxiety-ridden experience for many men (myself included).  I used to just be one of those "play it safe" kind of guys.  I was content to just go to the barber and get the typical no. 2 or whatever.  I did not give it much thought as I figured the finer nuances of hair cuttery were well over my head.Anyway, after years of going to barbers and receiving anywhere from mediocre to hideous haircuts, I dragged myself to a hair salon (I remember being mentally scarred from having received a bowl cut once....the worst!).  This was a barrier to overcome considering I harbored the incredibly wrong notion hair salons were only for women. It turned out to be an excellent decision.I received one of the best hair cuts in recent memory from Brocato! The hair stylist was very experienced and clearly knew exactly how to cut my specific type of hair.  He blended the top and bottom far better then I have seen any barber accomplish. I gave him leeway to do what he thought was best and I was not disappointed.On top of his abilities, the hair stylist (also the owner) is a very friendly and relate-able person.  The time sure goes faster when you have a good conversation going! Anyone who needs a new and improved haircut for an upcoming date. interview or just in general needs to hit this joint up!
<review# 321,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/11/2013,12/26/2013,2,11,,2,2>You may not get the best impression at first, when you get to and enter this restaurant, but after you tasted their authentic, Cajun seafood platters, you'll be glad you stopped by!  Try the char grilled oyster, (yam, yam!), combo seafood platter,  broiled or fried Catfish, giant shrimps, and by all means, get the coleslaw!  They are out of this world!Rating of food: 5*****Service:  5*****Atmosphere:  4****Location:  4****Hospitality:  5*****Come hungry and leave "stuffed" and extremely satisfied!  Don't forget the dessert!  We had the pecan pie with vanilla ice cream and the bread pudding; we liked both of them.

<review# 323,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/7/2013,12/24/2013,19,36,1,2,2>First time trying Honduran food, and must say that it is awesome. It was difficult to decide what to get so we used some of the yelp reviews to help us :-) First thing - ANYTHING WITH BEEF WILL BE AMAZING!  We had the Honduran tacos and they were amazing. We also ordered Pallea that was great as well, but I would probably only order it with a beef side. We had the pupusa and that was worth the drive alone! We will return for that if for nothing else. The Tostones were not so great, but they were out of the crema. I think if I had crema it would have been much better.Adding this to my fav list!
<review# 324,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/13/2013,12/23/2013,1,22,1,2,2>Favorite place in Baton Rouge!  They make their food from scratch and you can tell.  The weekend brunch is fantastic and we also love wing night.  Their prices are reasonable and you get what you pay for.  A definite winner.
<review# 325,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/25/2013,12/22/2013,19,141,,4,1>I'm not exactly an authority on Hawaiian food, but I do know when something tastes good whether it's supposed to taste that way or not... and the food here tastes incredible. I went about a week ago and got the combo platter with bulgogi and spicy pork, with the macaroni salad. The meats were perfectly flavored to go over the plain white rice, and juicy enough that it wasn't dry. The portion was fairly large (don't be fooled by the fact that the to-go boxes look small on the outside) and I ate twice off the one platter before it was gone. The only downside about it was the macaroni salad - it was very plain tasting, like it was just macaroni with a bit of mayo and sugar. I didn't care for it at all. It needed something to spice it up and take that heaviness from the mayo out of it. You can substitute sides though so next time I won't get the macaroni salad. And there definitely will be a next time - for just $10 and change I got to eat twice on a box loaded with delicious spiced meats, so I really can't complain. The owner was friendly too and they give you a stamp card where you get a free meal after buying so many. I wish more places did that, it lets the customers know you appreciate their repeat business.
<review# 326,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/24/2013,12/21/2013,37,137,2,4,4>This place was a surprise for me. We were shopping for a green egg and I was reluctant to get out of the car and check out what I thought was just another hardware store. I know some people get super excited to see spanners and screwdrivers and neon orange cables, but I wanted to stay in the car and watch my Netflix video. I'm glad hubby persuaded me to get out because the store was nothing like I'd imagined. Of course they had spanners and screwdrivers, and neon orange cables, but they also had cool LSU gear, scented candles, aprons, shiny home appliances, cookware, cutlery, outdoor furniture, fake plants, kitchen islands, and a whole lot of grilling items. They had decorated this last section as some kind of mancave! Our green egg was put together and ready to leave with us in about an hour, and we got a free bag of charcoal, and a green egg cookbook with it.
<review# 327,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/25/2013,12/20/2013,75,181,1,2,2>Pepper jack hash is a must. Biscuit gravy is a must. Sitting at the bar and being entertained by Frenchie is a MUST. If you go into Louie's expecting fine dining, you will be disappointed; BUT if you go in fully expecting a diner with wonderful food, great entertainment from the staff and patrons alike, you'll love every minute of your time here. Enormous portions, great prices and my favorite breakfast in Baton Rouge.An LSU landmark that is an absolute MUST visit when you visit Baton Rouge.
<review# 328,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/21/2013,12/19/2013,44,69,,3,2>Visited early in the evening (7pm) when the place was dead.  I liked it though.  The bartop was lit up all white... looked kinda chic.  Simple layout.  Didn't get a chance to head upstairs & check it out.  Maybe some other time.  Sat outside on the front patio (aka smoking section)... good spot to people watch.
<review# 329,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/3/2013,12/18/2013,51,62,,5,3>I visited OoT for the first time with a friend who was visiting from out of town and this place was walking distance from my apartment, so we lived here for about a week.The ambiance of this little spot is perfect. The bar is nicely sized and doesn't stink like stale beer, the music is always on point, and it is a very comfortable place to lounge. Bonus points: No P.Rowe parking frenzy! They use a lot of freshly squeezed juices and a great variety of infusions and liqueurs and serve some of the most unique and delicious cocktails I have ever had. They are taking the bar back to the mixology days, instead of serving premixed sugar junk on tap.A few MUST-TRY's are:Bulletproof- Don't read the ingredients, they sound scary, but it really is very good.Spa- If spa had a flavor, this is it. Light, refreshing, awesome.Mojitos- Pick one, any one. Sazerac- This one is a tasty PG version of the original from the Sazerac bar in NOLA- they mist the glass with the legal version of absinthe. *Note: If you are in Nawlins and haven't tried the original, don't, unless you enjoy feeling like you're going to die... seriously.  This is easily my favorite spot for cocktails.
<review# 330,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/15/2013,12/17/2013,8,33,,1,1>Rama is my favorite Thai restaurant in Baton Rouge! The panang is awesome and the portion is large. I loved it so much that I brought home the leftovers then ate it when I walked in the door. I just went there on Saturday and I'm craving it again. I would have given it 5 stars if I didn't get an eggroll appetizer. That was just ok. I won't be ordering that again. The décor is awful and the service is quite slow. I knew all that going there though based on other reviews so my expectations were low in these areas. The food more than makes up for these shortcomings. I can't wait to go back!

<review# 332,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/13/2013,12/15/2013,1,4,,1,1>This place crafted my meal perfectly. The hummus made me want to hit a mezzo soprano note! Instead, I chose to eat my food super fast. I needed a whole bag of napkins when I finished. Sloppy eating is good eating (don't tell my mother). Meals here are meals of a lifetime. The tranquil atmosphere allows me to unwind and think about all the troubles and worries that I don't have (haha). Go here- you'll want a bed so you'll never have to leave. I bring sheets in when I go, just in case. GO! Just take my bogus word for it. Thank me later!
<review# 333,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/20/2013,12/14/2013,66,126,,2,1>Everyone in Baton Rouge has their favorite location of George's, but no one can deny the food is great...even if the owner tends to be a DB!  Friday is my favorite special...thin cut fried catfish with fries and cole slaw.  The fish is so thin that I simply cannot eat catfish any other way after this dish.  I'll say there are a few other items that I definitely suggest to anyone browsing the extensive menu.  The hamburger club is my BF's fav...think club sandwich but with a hamburger bun.  When I'm feeling healthy, I order the low carb chicken plate.  Grilled chicken breast topped with grilled mushrooms and a hearty side of steamed veggies.  Last but certainly not least is the hot dog.  And before you think it's just a regular ol' hot dog, I'm going to stop you!  It's a LARGE grilled hot dog served on a crisp bun...so much better than anything my mom ever made when I was a kid.  I don't think this is a great place to get your drink on, but for a great lunch or dinner spot, it's a winner!
<review# 334,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,11/2/2013,12/13/2013,100,239,,1,1>This place has some damn good sandwiches in an excellent atmosphere. They have a huge amount of toppings and the bread is excellent. I've been here three times so far. I don't remember what I ate the first time, just that I saw a lot of potential. On my second visit I ordered the Italian Roast Beef with double meat. It just may be the best sandwich I've ever had.The only complaints I have with this place is that it's a bit pricy and the service is a bit slow. Other than that, it's excellent.
<review# 335,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/5/2013,12/12/2013,175,75,,3,2>Chelsea's.  Good Food.  Good Music.  Good Beer.  Real Talk.  This is a hip neighborhood stop in BR.  Their menu is unique as well.  A large variety of dishes that are all delicous.  I find myself having a difficult time deciding.  Last night I dined on the Smoked Pork Loin au Jus: 8oz. center cut chop smoked over pecan wood served with garlic mashed potatoes and fresh lemon garlic green beans$11.95.  DELICIOUS.  chelseascafe.com/menu/enThis is a place you can pop in for a daily lunch special, bring a date, have a beer, listen to great bands (local and traveling), hold a meeting, host a themed birthday party, or just sit at the bar and chat up one of the locals.  I recommend it to anyone.  Never a disappointing experience.
<review# 336,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/16/2013,12/11/2013,418,77,,5,3>Ya know, I was skeptical about going to this place until I had a hankering for a roast beef poboy. I found that a couple people said that they had a good one. I ventured off and came to a place that was very busy and the server was behind a bit. No biggie, just patiently waited at the bar. The owner came up to take my order and about 20 mins later my delicious debris poboy arrived. I found it dry and asked for gravy. The fries were crisp and my dining partner got the burger with onion strings. The onion strings made me jealous I didn't get them. It's not fancy, but the food was spot on. I'll be back...tomorrow maybe?
<review# 337,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/16/2013,12/10/2013,50,194,,3,2>I almost hate to give this place 5 stars because I don't want you to go and spoil this ultimate hole in the wall.  The bartender makes drinks that'll put hair on a woman's chest, the coppertop bar is cozy and there's plenty of sports on the T.V.  The back room has darts and pool and maybe a couple video games.  HOV used to do dj parties here all the time.  Trying to start it up again.  You know these guys from +ONE and Dirty Disco.  Always tasty jams.  Come down to ONO's for a good time, a bartender that will never forget you and a taste of ol' New Orleans.
<review# 338,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/29/2013,12/9/2013,105,85,3,9,4>I was headed to neighborhood Walmart for an ingredient I was missing for dinner when I saw that 9 Dragon Noodles was having its grand opening! Of course, I had to put my homemade dinner plans on hold and check out the new restaurant. I've been waiting for weeks for it to open! The restaurant was super busy with all tables filled and several people waiting for to-go orders. Even so, the hostess who took my order was very friendly and answered a few questions I had about the extensive menu.I ordered the "Indian style pancakes" which were described to me as scallion pancakes, and the vegetable pad thai. I waited for about 15 minutes for my food (no big deal since I spent my time creating this Yelp business page!). Waiter Michael was very friendly and brought me some water and checked on me a few times as I waited. My to-go bag felt satisfyingly heavy as it was handed to me, and I took it straight home to devour.First, I opened the pancakes. Though they were described as having scallions, there were no scallions to be found... Even so, they were delicious with a savory sauce to dip to them in (the sauce had bits of scallion!). They were also pretty greasy but not in a bad way... just required a bit of blotting like a piece of pizza. I am not making these sound very appetizing, but trust me they were!Next, the pad thai-- wow! This container was jam packed with delicious noodles, veggies, bits of egg, and crushed peanuts in a great sauce. This has to be the best pad thai I've had in Baton Rouge, and it didn't even have tofu! I've had pad thai at both Rama and Thai Kitchen and this wins, hands down. Also, it is enough for 3 meals.I am so happy that this restaurant is open, and I can't wait to try all of the veggie dishes (there is bitter melon on the menu, which I love!). I just wish there were a few more tofu dishes or a vegetarian bibimbap... Finally, I'm not sure if the restaurant is BYOB-- I saw a table that had a 12-pack of beer open (probably purchased from next door) but I forgot to ask about it before I left. If it is BYOB, that would be excellent!
<review# 339,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/25/2013,12/8/2013,107,31,2,4,4>Let's just start off by saying I love places that deliver! I had the combo fried rice, which was packed with beef, chicken, and shrimp.  It was really delivious, and i could not stop eating it.I ordered a couple of rolls that also had great flavor, and they tasted really fresh.  I had the spicy tuna roll and the salmon avocado roll. The prices are great and the delivery driver was very nice. They originally quoted me 30-45 minutes, but it ended up only taking about 25minutes which is great for delivery. I can't even get a pizza from dominos that quick. I will definitely be ordering from them again in the near future when i get the craving for sushi!
<review# 340,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/29/2013,11/1/2013,60,159,,6,4>Overall, I enjoyed my visit to Texas de Brazil, but man, was that place loud! I could barely hear the server (who was very nice, by the way, as was his trainee) as he explained how everything worked. Also, one of the hostesses was pretty rude to my friend and me - not really sure what her problem was, but I did notice in another review that someone else said the same thing. Maybe Texas de Brazil should look into it?The food was pretty excellent, though. Not being a big meat eater, I was a little nervous about getting my money's worth, but after having a little bit of everything that was available (as far as meats go), I found it: flank steak! It was cooked about "medium," maybe "medium-rare," and it was great! If I went back, however, I would probably just get the salad bar. (I think they call it the "light dinner" option.) That's where the real gems were: lobster bisque, potatoes, salad options galore, cheeses, different types of sliced ham, smoked salmon, shrimp, etc. I feel like, for my tastes, that would be more worth the money.The before dinner drink I ordered was pretty good, too, and the bar tender was very nice. I had the Girl from Ipanema, and I would definitely get it again. I just wish I'd finished it before the meal started. It just isn't one of those drinks that goes well with food, in my opinion. My friend ordered the white wine from Sonoma and really enjoyed it.To sum things up: yes, I enjoyed my experience, but there were a few things I would change. I think, next time, I will go early for drinks and, as I mentioned above, I'll get the salad bar option and just forgo the meats.
<review# 341,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/14/2013,10/31/2013,3,24,,4,4>Really good food.  Unique recipes.  Great service ....everyone is friendly.  I would recommend the Lemon pesto shrimp or chipotle chicken sandwich.  Go early because there is limited seating and always busy.
<review# 342,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/19/2013,10/30/2013,122,389,8,10,9>This place is GREAT! Roomy yet cramped and I love the character of this joint....During the week it is breakfast and lunch that drives the place...Weekends they stay open into the evening for dinner...My 2 visits have always been for lunch...and lunch is good...They offer plate lunches and seafood offerings but when I walk in I'm hungry around the mouth for 1 thing....the Hot Roast Beef poboy!!OOH MAMA, that damn poboy is freakin' outstanding! Tasty, tasty, tasty and just dripping with gravy and the bread, MAGNIFIQUE (a little French lingo there)!  I always get the HRB poboy, I'm sure the other offerings are great but why branch out when you've found a slice of heaven!! I call it the "11 napkin-er" cause that's about how many I typically run through when shoving this delectable delicacy into my gaping maw! Be warned though, don't think for a second you can order the ol' 11 napkin-er and eat it daintily...not gonna happen. Put aside any self embarrassment you might have and get in it up to the elbows! If you do you'll revel in the experience that is the benignly named Hot Roast Beef poboy!!If you find yourself in the area of Lafayette & Florida in downtown BR before 3 PM Monday thru Thursday stop in and get you some! Hours run later on Friday, Saturday!! Closed on Sundays
<review# 343,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/8/2013,10/29/2013,12,16,,2,1>Awesome place to take the kids.  We had a great family day there and the staff was friendly and helpful.  We played a fun game of miniature golf and then hit the arcade.  Great price, lots of fun for small kids.  We will be going back often for our 5 year old and for us!
<review# 344,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/2/2013,10/28/2013,48,279,4,2,3>I reviewed before and if I remember correctly I only gave 3 stars. Not sure if I was drunk when I came in here or what? Or maybe they remodeled parts of the store or maybe I'm just not very good at observing my surroundings because this place is awesome. Very very good selection of everything. They have some crazy beers here. I posted a couple pics of the funny ones. Don't know how I missed this the first time but they have a brewing and tasting area in the back and as I was browsing they offered me some wine...what? YES! I will definitely come back here.
<review# 345,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/11/2013,10/27/2013,831,210,,1,1>We tried Red Zeppelin pizza for the first time after using the Living Social deal.  We absolutely loved it!  Being on a budget, the deal was perfect for us.  The pizza is a little pricey w/o the deal, but it was really good stuff!!  We are definitely fans!!
<review# 346,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/14/2012,10/26/2013,5,40,,2,1>After living in Baton Rouge for six years, I think I've finally had a chance to try all of the places around town that are typically called the "best" places for a burger. Friends, I am here to tell you that you will find no better burger in this town than the one that is served out of the side of this truck. You have a choice of several "usual suspects" that are always on the menu, plus a series of rotating specials. I've yet to try one that hasn't been exceptional. All of the ingredients are sourced locally, and as a result are tremendously fresh and tasty. The buns are phenomenal. The beef seems (to me) to have a perfect balance of fat content - giving you just enough grease to leave utterly satisfied, but not crossing the line. And if you like bacon on your burger, you simply cannot afford to pass on a burger with the Pork Belly Preserves. The name may sound unappealing, but it's the most delicious smoky, porky, bacon-y condiment you'll ever try. If you're afraid of the whole food truck experience, don't be. The folks that work inside are always super-friendly and willing to help you understand the menu. Want to make a change or a substitution (I recommend, "add Pork Belly Preserves")? No problem, they will oblige with a smile. I really hope these folks thrive, because it's one of the true culinary gems of Baton Rouge.
<review# 347,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/23/2013,10/25/2013,7,85,,1,1>Come here for lsu and saints stuff, I've looked all over BR and never impressed with anyone's selection but this place has anything you want or need if it has to do with Saints or Lsu I promise.
<review# 348,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/19/2013,10/23/2013,38,71,,5,3>Bistro Byronz is one of my favorite BR restaurants. It's got a Parisian cafe atrmosphere and a menu teeming with Creole flair. The prices are stellar as well (with an entree running you about $14). My personal favorites are the Talapia Almondine or the Turkey Burger au Gruyere.
<review# 349,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,10/14/2013,10/17/2013,14,26,4,10,2>Moving here from Los Angeles this place is a hidden treasure in a non-descript building along the roadside. It looks like a dive restaurant but it's a very clean, well stocked and well priced selection of what the sign says. I found everything from Zergut products, every kind of milled flour you can think of, spices, fresh olives, Arabic and Indian foods, massive tea selection (an entire aisle full), they had Yerba Mate from Argentina and a unique soda collection including Ginger Beer from Jamaica, Cola from Turkey, artesian water from Georgia (not  the state) and Palm Soda from Nigeria. If you're a vegetarian or a curious foodie like me this place is a nice deviation from the norm that won't break your pocket book and there's plenty of sweets for the kids. Drop the crawfish po boy for a minute and go here to enliven your senses and your palate.
<review# 350,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/19/2013,10/16/2013,75,181,5,7,6>Wow!Thanks for the suggestion on this place, Yelp, because I don't know if I would have tried it otherwise. I was impressed with everything from the time I walked in until the time I walked out. The staff doesn't speak much English, but the service was still solid. A guy that has been there more than once noticed that I was a bit lost and was able to help me navigate the menu and suggested that I try the horchata. The staff was nice enough to give me a little taste in one of the salsa cups, and it was delicious...although, I hear there is a variation with rum that I have a feeling I may like MUCH better :)As for the food, the free chips and salsa are dynamite, super fresh and just the right amount of spice. I went with the popular vote and tried a pork tamale next and it was great! I really liked that it was actually recognizable meat and not mush in the center. Next I went with the tongue taco and the skirt steak taco - with a squirt of the tomatillo sauce, it was blissful. The tongue was tender and juicy while the skirt steak was just the right texture without being dry. I will note that a highlight for me was the salsa roja that is brought out with the tacos. Oh. My. Damn. Its sweet, its spicy, its tangy - its a fiesta in your mouth that I am not ashamed to say, I continued eating on my chips long after I got my fill of tacos.I'm ready to go back and try something else at this place ASAP, my only regret is that they don't serve Rumchata or any other adult beverages. Ah well, that's what to-go is for...
<review# 351,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/13/2013,10/14/2013,46,53,,2,3>They learned how to do it right at coffee call. After going to CdM in New Orelans many times, I have tasted their equivalent. Their fingers are soo good. They also seem a lot more humble and less attitude than their New Orleans competitor. I can't speak on the coffee much because I'm not an avid drinker but I did like it. I really like dthe atmosphere and it was cool that they have a lot of people here at odd hours.
<review# 352,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/2/2013,10/13/2013,37,137,,1,1>I went here for brunch this weekend. It's just your typical Southern restaurant with booth type seating. I got the crab cakes with arugula salad, and it was good. Neither too flaky, nor too overcooked. I liked that I could taste the crab meat and that it wasn't mixed with too much stuffing. My husband got crab cake eggs benedict with a side of potatoes. Judging from the fact that he wouldn't let me take a bite from his plate, and that his plate was polished clean by the time we were done eating, I'm guessing his order was excellent. My friend ordered a veggie omlette with a side of potatoes and she said it was great. We also ordered bottomless mimosas. But I thought they were rather weak. The service was good and attentive, though the waiter stopped within 5 mins of us having started eating, to ask if he could bring the check! For two people, our bill came to $43 before tipping. All in all, a good place for a lazy brunch.
<review# 353,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/17/2013,10/12/2013,1,26,2,3,4>Hands down the best coffee in Baton Rouge. They roast their own beans in house to give it a unique flavor. I have tried coffee shops all over America and can't find one better than this one in Baton Rouge. A little out of the way if your not in the LSU area, but worth the drive.
<review# 354,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/27/2013,10/11/2013,4,12,,9,2>I went to Frankie Marcello's with my mom for lunch based on the sole fact that it's my uncle's name as well! (But not his restaurant haha). We got the spicy crawfish and artichoke dip with the fried ravioli to dip it in and it was delicious! And the perfect amount of ravioli to dip. We didn't have leftover of either. For the main stuff I had the veal marsala and she got the lasagna based on the waiter's recommendation and they were both great!The best part was when the hostess seated us she asked where we preferred to sit based on the air conditioning and TV's which was great as my mom and I are both freeze babies! I also left my leftovers at the table and when I ran in to get them the hostess was already on her way to me as she saw I left them. GREAT service and food!
<review# 355,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/16/2013,10/10/2013,51,62,3,7,4>My husband and I are basically giant nerdy kids, so when we found LToBR, we geeked out pretty hard. Walking in, it doesn't look like much. There are a couple of tables to sit and eat pizza, some arcade games, and the front desk. Up the stairs is a large banquet room full of tables and chairs with private party rooms available. From there, we went through the door to view the current laser tag game in play... I almost peed myself I was so giddy. We immediately hustled down to the desk and signed up for the next couple of games. The laser tag arena is big and well built. This is no cheesy black-lit room with random partitions sprayed with tacky grungy neon paint.  The arena is two stories tall, with ramps instead of stairs for players to get between the two levels. There are full walls with windows (open, not glassed) and bases and nests. The arena is lit enough to see in front of you, but dark enough that you have to rely on the enemy's blinking lights to notice them. The music keeps you pumped and you get a little voice in your vest letting you know when you get a power up. There are even separate nests up on the second floor for people to gun down players without needing to maneuver around the arena. Of course you want to go on busy night, and if you're a novice avoid member nights or you'll get schooled. Games hold up to 44 players at a time and last 7 minutes. Public games start every 20 mins. There are also age/height requirements, so if you have little ones, you might wanna check that out so no one gets set up for disappointment. They are pretty strict when enforcing the "no running" policy and will boot you out if you're busted more than once, but that's for everyone's safety. With so many corners and hiding places, it's easy to plow into someone and take them out... which is no fun for anyone.Prices are somewhat reasonable, although it's always a good idea to browse the web for deals before you go.
<review# 356,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2013,10/9/2013,1,9,,1,1>The wife and I have been craving a Chicken Shawarma plate for weeks and finally had an evening to try Serops Cafe on Corporate Blvd in Baton Rouge. We had our plates prepared as take out and brought them home. The restaurant appeared clean and service seemed adequate, though there were only two other single patrons there. The food was very good and hit the spot. Neither of us could finish the plate. My only complaint is that the pita seemed to have been removed from a bag, lightly warmed and packaged to go. We were here on August 5, 2013.
<review# 357,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/14/2013,10/4/2013,0,9,1,1,1>Best chips and salsa I've had anywhere.  The hostess saw me eating the crumbs out of the bowl and had a refill on the table immediately.  I was full before the food came.  We got the Trio Fajita platter and the 6 Duck Empenadas.  The duck was a little gamey, but the platter was pretty good.  Skirt steak on the platter was very good for a tough cut of meat.  The refried beans were different than I've had before, they had a distinct coffee taste to them.  Not sure I liked that, but they mated well with a last piece of tortilla dipped in them.
<review# 358,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/30/2013,10/2/2013,50,194,4,3,3>Serrano's is a great place to sit outside and people watch.  The best table in the house is right by the sidewalk, outside.  The problem with this table is that it's the farthest away from everything so if your server is a loozer (they have a lot of them here), you'll be waiting.  My last trip was good.  Andre took care of us and was as attentive as we wanted him to be.  It rained...hard, but we stayed dry on the patio and laughed at everyone running by to get to the Chimes.  I have to mention, I don't always chose Serrano's first, but I hate waits, so we usually end up here b/c the Chimes is packed.  The chimichanga is awesome.  Top shelf margs seem strong, but I think they're a little pricey.  On that note, everything is pricey, but not as bad as Superior.  I had the burger for the first time and it was spot on.  Beef mixed with chorizo on ciabata with grilled onions.  DEEElish.  And quite spicy.  I'm likely to get it again next time.  Tailgate fans: They parTAY over here on game day.  Outside bars aplenty and live music.  I usually stop in for a large froze marg and hit the tailgate circuit.  This keeps me from having to haul a cooler everywhere, and by the time its empty I have enough liquid courage to bum beers off randos.
<review# 359,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/18/2013,10/1/2013,12,33,,5,1>Dined here last night for their Restaurant Week menu, and I must say.. I was impressed.I went in with low expectations because I have yet to hear a single rave review since the place opened. I hadn't necessarily heard horrible reviews either, but for the price, you want to go to places people are raving about. Restaurant Week was the perfect opportunity for me to try the new Galatoire's out.The building is so pretty from the outside, and I liked the atmosphere on the inside as well. It's very loud, which I had heard already. I felt the egg shells under my table, but I think it's so loud because everything is hard. Hard floors, nothing soft as far as decor goes, no separate rooms/walls.. it's just one large loud room. Which is fine with me. The original Galatoire's in New Orleans is loud too. That's part of the allure. You drink a lot, eat a lot, and get a little too loud. Baton Rouge doesn't handle the concept as well, but I digress.The fixed menu was surprisingly impressive. Many of BR's best restaurants dumbed down their menus for restaurant week, but Galatoire's had good options. My date and I opted to get all different stuff and share. I also ordered a French 75.First Course: Shrimp and GritsCrawfish Maison (Louisiana crawfish tails tossed in a cream salad with capers, green onions, lemon, and creole mustard)Second Course:Roasted Duck with Sweet Potato HashRibeye in what seemed like a wine sauce with mushrooms and garlic spaetzle.Broccoli with a hollandaise sauce.Fried PotatoesDessert:We both got chocolate pecan pie. They were individual pies, and I enjoyed mine, but my date felt that it was mostly pie crust. I'm the wrong person to ask as I don't order desserts. Everything tasted very good. The steak was cooked perfectly, the sweet potato hash was to die for, just good all around. I wasn't asked how I wanted my duck prepared, and it was a little tough, but the flavor was good enough to not worry too much about it. Was it the best meal I've ever had in my life? No. I didn't expect it to be. Still very good though. But the biggest thumbs up was MASSIVE portions. I've noticed other places making smaller portions for their Restaurant Week menu, but Galatoire's did no such thing. Even if this wasn't a $35 menu deal, the portions were huge for the type of restaurant it is. My duck was basically half of an entire duck.. a huge helping of sweet potato hash.. and then they let you choose a side on top of that. I've written a ton, so to sum it up: Much better than expected. Definitely a deal to be had with the fixed menu. I'd certainly return and pay their full prices because you WILL get full and be satisfied.
<review# 360,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/12/2013,9/30/2013,2,14,,1,1>Best pho I've had in BR! They put twice the amount of meat and twice the amount of side dressings! The atmosphere is upbeat and after you finish your pho, you can make your own frozen yogurt dish!  There are about 4-5 Tv's in there also, which you don't see much in many Japanese/Vietnamese restaurants
<review# 361,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/31/2013,9/29/2013,2,11,,1,1>The Rural Life Museum conveniently located near the center of the Baton Rouge, just off I10 and Essen Lane. It's easy to find, inexpensive to visit.You can learn so much of the life of the Acadian settlers, how they constructed their buildings.  Simple cabins, farm equipments, even an outhouse!__ show their rather primitive way of life.  There are 30+ antique buildings, a post office, a jail, a blacksmith shop and more.  If you visit this place during a festival, volunteers dressed in 18th & 19th Century outfit will greet you with a BIG smile and fill you in about the Louisiana culture as it was the past couple of hundred years.  They are not hesitant to point out the slaves cabins, how poor and often mistreated they were.  They had to put in long hours, hard labor.  Not just the slaves, but every able man and woman had to take their fair share of the rural life's demands.The Civil War reenactment is great!  Try to visit during that time.  Rural Life Museum_ as indicated in its name_ was constructed to show the peasants' life more than anything else with the collection of artifacts, farm equipments.  History seems to come alive as you are viewing the many primitive tools, and volunteers feel you in what dangers, what kind of obstacles those first settlers in this area had to face.I liked to roam on the ground, around the pond, marveled about the carriage, the Spanish Moss hanging down the trees.  They appeared being placed on those trees on purpose.  When you visit, make sure you get the story behind the Spanish Moss!  If you visit with children, they can have so much fun learning a craft, how to weave baskets, how to make candles, or soaps, how to braid hair, and many more hands-on experiments available.  Some simple, old toys the children can play with, not too long though, soon they'll ask for their own phone or electronic gadgets, for these "plain things" are not that much fun for them.BEWARE NORTHERN & WESTERN VISITORS:  SUMMER MONTHS ARE VERY HOT AND HUMID around here!  If possible, make your visit in the spring or late fall.Carry water bottles with you.  There's a gift shop on the premises, but so much you'll walk in that heat from cabin to cabin, so be prepared and have fun!
<review# 362,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/17/2013,9/28/2013,30,23,2,2,2>Good sushi, reasonable prices, good service, and good presentation.Though a little more expensive than some of the other buffet places around town, this one is positively a cut above the rest. I first walked into this place before they "re-opened". Originally it was another copy-cat serve yourself buffet place, but that didn't last long, and I'm glad the owners decided to change it up. After my first visit since the change, I've been hooked, and I have probably been to this place at least 20 times now. I love bringing new people here for a bit of food adventure. Now I wouldn't say that I am a sushi expert, but it is one of my favorite foods and this place really fills my cravings.There are two ways you can tackle the menu: either all you can eat or pay as you go. For me, it's a no brain-er to go with the AYCE. Also, keep in mind that even though it is lunch time you are not barred from getting the dinner menu for AYCE. The benefit here is a few of their premium items (sashimi including yellowtail or hamachi and a few specialty items like mango salmon and tuna tar-tar) and instead of the included soft drink you can get an alcoholic beverage. I have noticed that they go easy on the alcohol in mixed drinks, so I usually go with the sake instead.If you are at Sushi Masa, chances are you are coming for the sushi. In my opinion, best quality sushi fish in Baton Rouge even better than the non-buffet types (tried Tsunami, Nagoya, Tokyo Cafe, Ichiban, etc.). I have noticed that since I first started coming, the fish pieces for AYCE have gotten much smaller, but that doesn't really matter when it's AYCE (at one point before reducing the once ample sizes they tried a 10 piece sashimi / nigiri limit). Their rolls are pretty tasty too and they have plenty of other options (e.g. unlimited beef teriyaki, edamame, tempura, fried rice or noodles, gyoza, etc.).In terms of a buffet, this place is made to order. So really if you order off their AYCE or (ab)-normal menu, it's all the same stuff. Be sure to preempt your next serving by placing an order before you are done eating to make the experience more "too many plates on the table-Viking-like" (they do have a disclaimer that you are supposed to pay for uneaten food, but I have yet to experience this). Presentation is pretty surprising sometimes too (how about sashimi served in a martini glass with LED light effects?!?).If you go with a group, one of your AYCE receipts will have what everyone in the party (or most of it) ordered, which can bring a laugh or two.The atmosphere is nice too. Since it is not a standard buffet, they can afford to decorate a little better and turn down the lights for a little better atmosphere. The whole restaurant is really clean including the restrooms.You will be surprised how much your $24 (used to be $22.95) will buy you. Sushi Masa is highly recommended, and in all the times I have been there, they have never failed to keep me satisfied.
<review# 363,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/26/2013,9/27/2013,175,75,3,6,5>THIS.PLACE.IS.SICK.If you never been you gotta go and if you are a fan then get over there ASAP.  Randy and the krewe just completed the remodel and it is beautiful!  Besides it's chic Japanese atmosphere the sushi is the freshest and tastiest in town (and other towns too ;).)  I order the Ichiban Roll every time.  And when I am with a group I wish I would have ordered two of them.  It is filled with fresh maguro and topped with crab and eel sauce and crunchy.  So yummy.  There is quiet a variety of rolls- raw and cooked and of various price points to choose from.  The newly added Fireball and Jager dispensers are frozed and pour a chilled shot right out.  I am looking forward to the evening when my friend and I can go and get crunk at the bar!Also if you never had the yellowfin collar  here you must try it. It is grill and full of flaky white meat and not fishy at all!
<review# 364,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/5/2013,9/26/2013,10,4,,2,1>The Bungalow always has fun stuff to look through, and it's hard to leave without buying something funky and unique--like a vintage ashtray from a doctor's office. Their prices are pretty reasonable, and they have a ton of unique little treasures, art and great furniture that sells quickly. The workers are always friendly and helpful. From March-October, the store teams up with Project Purr to help rescued kittens find new homes--if you want, you can carry around a kitten with you while you shop. (They do this to socialize the rescued kittens with humans). Their Facebook is great to check in with--they post a ton of pictures of their inventory, and will even put something on hold for you until you can make it to the shop to purchase it.
<review# 365,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,1/12/2013,9/25/2013,30,5,2,2,2>I love Thai food so I'm a pretty tough critic. Thai kitchen did not disappoint! A coworker and I stopped by for the lunch buffet Friday. Great spring rolls, soup and popular  dishes like Pad thai, glass noodles, curry , fried rice etc are included. With tax it came up to $9. The price is worth it because there's such a large selection and unlimited trips . The staff is friendly enough, however since we were only getting the buffet I can't give a fair assessment of the service just yet. Im definitely coming back for dinner sometime to see what the regular menu is like.We saw some advertisement for the karaoke on Friday night so I'll probably try it then .. stay tuned for an update!
<review# 366,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2013,9/23/2013,0,6,,2,1>I just love this place!  My aunt and I usually come here after church, and on the weekends. I always get the same thing every time, the steak roll ups with a side of rice pilaf. Delicious and perfect every time. And the staff is always super friendly. Even when you get there 30 minutes before they close. I highly recommend this place to everyone.
<review# 367,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/18/2013,9/22/2013,9,1,2,3,2>This is my favorite restaurant in Baton Rouge. The most amazing Italian food. Ask Clint (the bar guy) to recommend a wine. I recommend the pizza for its homemade crispy crust and pepperoni on top of the cheese or the sirloin tips which are delectable with their perfect seasoning and grilled veggies over orzo for lunch. Everything is amazing. It is low key and casual but absolutely fantastic!!! Perfect date night.
<review# 368,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/20/2013,9/20/2013,418,77,6,5,5>I got off work late and was starving. I didn't feel like cooking and had no desire to supersize anything. I pulled out my trusty yelp app and discovered this little nugget of of joy. Instead of ordering delivery, I opted to drive in since I was unaware of the concept. The place looked like it had just gotten rocked by a solid group of drunken teenagers. I felt pretty badly for the staff. They were very friendly and helpful despite the hurricane that had just passed through the restaurant. I ordered the Dagwood (turkey, ham and prime rib) and put hummos, corn, black beans, romaine, spinach and tatziki sauce on it! Woohoo!  Man I am in hog heaven! The ingredients were fresh and delicious. Next time my fat ass is getting double meat. Mmmmm meat, but double! Thank you pita pit for giving me another option to think outside the bun.
<review# 369,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/6/2013,9/14/2013,95,166,,1,1>I love this place. It's a little cafe tucked inside a store where you can find just about anything. You don't have waitresses. You order up front. There's indoor and outdoor seating. If you sit indoors, there's a guy in there who will play the fiddle etx while you munch. They have a limited wine and beer selection. The food is great. My favorite is the chicken caprese sandwich. It's amazing. The tomato bisque is great as well. I had the Greek salad today and it was yummy. It comes with a white balsamic dressing instead of a mint vinaigrette. They get cakes from Bonano's and Nanette Mayhall which are to die for. I've raved about the red velvet from Digulios...same lady. I tried the lemon berry mascarpone today and it was great too!  I think I might be developing a sweet tooth!  The prices are reasonable too. The only thing negative I have to say is that I wish they would wipe the windowsills in the booths. They look like they've been collecting dust for centuries!!  Other than that, check it out. It's in a cool spot with lots of other stores. It'll be worth your while.
<review# 370,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/3/2013,9/8/2013,107,31,2,4,4>I told my girlfriend I was craving a grilled cheese one day, and then I ended up in cheesy heaven the next day. I have never had such an amazing grilled cheese sandwich. The cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was toasted to perfection. I am drooling about it by just writing about it. The place is a little bit divey but I like the atmosphere and all of the servers seem to know what they are doing. I will definitely be back there soon, hopefully to catch a live band!!
<review# 371,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,9/2/2013,9/5/2013,111,62,,3,2>The short drive from Baton Rouge was certainly worth it!  The pecan shrimp that we ordered as an appetizer were sheer perfection. Firecracker shrimp were also good but paled when paired with those divine pecan shrimp!  I ordered Crab-cakes as an entree and was very pleased with them. Another member of our group got the filet which was excellent. The fish special was a drum with choice of sauce. Our waitress suggested just a light lemon butter which we ordered. This was the special dish of the night. Perfect. If you have room, order the bread pudding. We will be back
<review# 372,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/18/2013,9/4/2013,105,85,,7,5>Mmm, Oscar's! I found out about this place on Yelp, and I'm so glad I did. We came for happy hour which is every weekday from 3-6pm. During this time, Oscar's has half-off drafts, 50 cent wings, and $5 pizzas. The day we dined there, arancini had just been added to the appetizer menu and we were the first to try it! For those who don't know, arancini is risotto which has been scooped into a ball, breaded, and fried. It is divine! Oscar's did it right with basil and sun-dried tomato arancini served with whipped goat cheese. Drafts were great too and we had Lazy Magnolia's Southern Pecan (only $2!) and Fat Tire ($2.50). Too full from our appetizer to eat pizza, but not wanting to miss out, we took our pizzas to go. I ordered the fig & prosciutto minus the prosciutto and loved every bite-- fresh fig jam as a base topped with mozzarella. The crust was on point too, and rivals Mellow Mushroom's which I also love.  Our server, Margot, was super sweet and made our experience even better. Looking forward to heading back to Oscar's for some more delicious food and drinks.
<review# 373,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/1/2013,9/2/2013,22,81,,2,1>It was my birthday, so decided to go to Kaminari's for my birthday dinner.  We had the Chicken spring rolls and those were extremely fresh, crispy, and well seasoned, certainly worth a repeat.  The Miso soup and Wonton soups were extremely flavorful and this is what I want on those sick days!I had the Amazing Chicken, which is fried chicken with a burnt orange sauce....a bit of sweet, sour, & spicy.  It was good, but not as spicy and seasoned as some of the other dishes I have tried.  My wife had the chicken hibachi entree and she found it to be lacking seasoning too, so maybe they were just having an off night in the kitchen.  It was good, just not exceptional like previous visits.  When I am craving Asian food, I want those balanced flavors to really hit my palate....sweet, sour, spicy, umami....
<review# 374,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/8/2013,9/1/2013,33,21,,1,3>Zippy's is my go-to cheap and dirty (actually pretty clean) Mexican spot. It's always busy unless you go right before closing, but I'm sure that has to do with the delicious daiquiris and margaritas they serve. I could live off of the chips and queso, always good in my opinion! I've also had the tacos, flautas, and quesadillas...all good choices. Overall it's a fun atmosphere for gamedays with all the tv screens everywhere and the patio is nice when it's not too hot out. Fast service, cheap and yummy food, always a win in my book.
<review# 375,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/21/2013,8/31/2013,100,239,,4,6>So I came here for the Yelp event on June 20th to meet our new community manager in Baton Rouge, Jonathon. It was a great time and though it is irrelevant to the review, Baton Rouge is lucky to have a guy like him as our community manager.Olive or Twist is craft cocktail bar and you can tell the moment you walk in. The design of the bar is excellent. It definitely doesn't feel like any other bar in Baton Rouge. There's no way around it, this place screams trendy.Since it's a cocktail bar, I should probably mention the drinks. I ordered a Sazerac because I didn't feel like being adventurous. That being said it was a pretty solid Sazerac and it had a decent price of $5 during happy hour. They also have a pretty respectable beer list, though it is a bit light on pale ales/IPA's. The staff was accommodating and friendly. They clearly knew their menu and were more than wiling to help you decide what to drink. One bartender even made an excellent caramel apple shot. Overall Olive or Twist is an excellent place. It seems like this would be a great place to bring someone on a date if you want to grab a drink or two.
<review# 376,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/5/2013,8/29/2013,60,159,,4,2>Rama is my favorite Thai place in BR. The panang anything is great, and I love the lemon grass soup! The only thing I don't like is how slow the service is, even for take out. Just plan to wait to be seated or for your take out, and if you eat in, plan to be there a while.
<review# 377,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/24/2013,8/28/2013,74,83,,5,3>I love this open air produce market on Perkins. I can get a big bag of fruit and veggies for $15, significantly cheaper than at the grocery store. The cashiers are super quick, and it's an easy stop for most of your essentials -- they have fresh bread from local bakeries as well as their produce, snack mixes, salsas and canned goods, etc. The only reason they're not getting five stars from me is that last time I bought grapes there, I discovered a few moldy ones. Luckily they allowed me to return them (I believe they have a two day return policy), but I was not super thrilled I had to make an extra trip (it was like $6 worth of grapes or I wouldn't have bothered).
<review# 378,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/16/2013,8/27/2013,39,13,2,2,3>I have only dined during lunch hours. I prefer the weekend lunch buffet selections to the weekday selections. I love their mango ice cream. The addictive mango ice cream is the main reason I dine here every other week. Service isn't too friendly but they are always efficient. I'm not an Indian food expert but everything is pretty tasty. The restaurant is always full of Indian people so that's a good indication that the food is authentic. I actually prefer India's restaurant to Bay Leaf, however, the new Indian restaurant, Curry N Kabob, has an edge over both and will give them a run for their money.
<review# 379,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/25/2013,8/25/2013,19,43,,1,2>I can't say enough good things about Superior Grill. Portions are gigantic, the salsa is fantastic, and the service is snappy. It would be great if they offered smaller, cheaper portions, but leftovers from Superior Grill never go uneaten in my house. I haven't had a margarita from Superior yet, but I plan to as soon as possible! If they are anything like the rest of the menu, they will not disappoint.
<review# 380,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/25/2013,8/24/2013,48,279,4,4,4>Love this place. They do alot of posting on Facebook so you can see new arrivals and if your in the mood you can just buy it then. I like to go in and try things on though. The girls inside are very helpful. My fav thing about this place is the dresses. They are very fun! My whole honeymoon I was in a different dress each day. The only time I wore anything else was when i was swimming.
<review# 381,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/3/2013,8/23/2013,44,69,2,4,3>The owner/waitress/cook/cashier (YES - she multitasks!) is a regular customer of mine.  I love her to death... so nice.  I finally decided to try out her restaurant a month or so ago.  Glad I did.  I have to admit; I was a little skeptical.  But she didn't let me down, and I will continue to return.  The food was delicious!  All home cookin' type of grub.  I wanted to try everything on the menu, but in the end I went with one of the lunch specials.  I ate the ENTIRE thing... I mean ALL of it.  Plus the fried mushroom appetizer!  Geez I'm a hog.  But seriously... patron the place.  It's good food.  And who knows?  You might see my smiling face in there.
<review# 382,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/14/2013,8/22/2013,8,13,,3,2>A true gem! Harrington's is a special restaurant you can find in downtown Baton Rouge.  Upon my first visit to Louisiana, my new co-workers treated me to this restaurant and I never looked back. For Cajun style favorites around lunchtime....you won't find better! In fact I eat here so often that my co-workers like to tease me about it.I recommend any of the main lunch dishes such as the Melancon (grilled catfish topped with crawfish etoufee). I have most of these dishes, and all are excellent. Another plus is that the side items are superb...the green beans, mashed potatoes and fried okra are all delicious choices. All of this goodness comes for quite a bargain as most meals are under $10.  For the price...you will not find better.The owner is a very kind man from the Lafayette area who will readily check up on you when he is there. The friendly staff and pleasant atmosphere only add to the excellent meal.  Do NOT miss out on trying this restaurant if your in the area. You won't regret it!
<review# 383,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/23/2013,8/21/2013,38,71,,3,2>I've been seeing Dr. Russo-Mounger and her staff for about 4 years now. I've always had a pleasant experience. I've never had to wait in the waiting room more than 3-5 minutes, my dental hygienist has always been pleasant, professional and knowledgeable, and I really enjoy the subtle spa amenities (aromatherapy wrap, a hand massage once, headphones and personal TV, an assortment of fruit juices upon departure, and a take-away baggie filled with a toothbrush, floss and a travel-size toothpaste). Dr. Russo-Mounger herself is always cheerful, helpful and knowledgeable- taking the time to explain things clearly and simply.

Probably the biggest section of apparel and geegaws I've ever seen outside a dedicated LSU/Saints store...Everything from clocks to vehicle magnets to vehicle stickers and flags to home banners to outdoor lighting to coolers to swimwear to glasses to t's...In the market for some LSU/Saints gear stop in and give this place a look...FYI prolly first time I ever stepped in a hardware store where I didn't wander around looking at tools...
<review# 385,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/4/2013,8/18/2013,3,3,,5,1>Ok. Yesterday was our 5th year anniversary. It was also the first time that four NBA teams could be eliminated on the same day out of the playoffs. I'm a Celtics fan by the way.  I was going to order out for our anniversary since we were going on a trip next weekend. My husband and I had been wanting pasta all week.  We had also been debating back and fourth throughout the day where we were going to eat.  This place was so off our radar. I pass it all the time and never go in.  This place is a hidden gem. We were discussing going to all of these Italian places in Baton Rouge but because I wanted to see these games and stay close to the house I remembered this place.  The food is excellent.  We ordered the fried green tomato appetizer that comes with cream sauce and shrimp.  Our main courses were mama's lasagna and the chicken parmesan and they also came with salads. You get complimentary bread also. This food was so good. The waiter that we had recommended those main courses. Also we told the waiter that it was our anniversary and he brought us some complimentary champagne with a dessert.  He even turned the NBA game on for us. Our waiter was Great!  I had a wonderful pink drink that I can't think of the name. There was also live music there last night and the house music was good too. This is a casual Italian restaurant that gives you the best of both worlds. The ambiance was nice and the food was reasonably priced. Our total might've been $50.  This was our first time going there and it will not be our last.
<review# 386,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/7/2013,8/17/2013,8,8,,2,1>I've gotta say, I was surprised to see the negative reviews of Taco Boudreaux's food!  I've been twice now, and both times everybody at the table tried a little bit of everything.  So far, everything I've sampled has been delicious!!  The cochon de lait quesadilla and the bayou burger were particularly awesome.  The first time I went, it was just me and my husband...the second time, it was a large group of us.  Everybody was thrilled with the food!Now, I will agree that they're a little bit over-priced for both proportion and ambience (it still basically feels like a Pizza Hut inside).  But I found nothing at all to complain about when it comes to the food!As far as service:  The first time I went, we were pretty unhappy with the service.  Everything came out timely, but our waitress seemed like she was stoned or something.  She was super out of it.  The second time we went, the service was AMAZING!  The owner even came out and chatted with us, and gave us desserts on the house.
<review# 387,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/19/2012,8/16/2013,2,12,,3,1>The restaurant looks more like an extension of the hotel lobby than an entity in and of itself, and the only way to get to it is by parking in the back and walking through the lobby. So, while the location makes this restaurant seem like a shinier version of the standard bar in a Marriot Courtyard it most certainly is not. The food is great. I had not eaten all day when I went, so I figured I would start with two small plates then adda soup if I was still hungry. I wasn't. Two small plates, the artisan salad and the vanilla bean braised short ribs, had enough substance and more than enough flavor to satisfy me. The salad was fresh, well composed, and delicious. The ribs and grits were a nice play on sweet and savory. There are two reasons this restaurant does not get five stars instead of four. First, there is the forgivable error of the grits cooling and congealing on the ribs before I could finish my salad. A little better timing, plating, and maybe some milk could have helped this. Second, I went to dinner early before the regular bartender was on, so a waitress behind the bar served me. She was great. Unfortunately, when the bartender came, he was rather aloof, I presume because he was not getting the tip (of course, I usually tip both servers when I have two, but not this time). The waitress continued to check on me, though less often because I should have been helped by the bartender at that point. Perhaps this was just a one-time deal, though, or a misunderstanding. The service was still, on average, good enough, and the food was absolutely worth it. I just wish it had a separate entrance...
<review# 388,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/18/2012,8/15/2013,46,9,,2,1>Best beer selection in Baton Rouge.  The burgers and salads are better than most restaurants in Baton Rouge.  There is plenty of seating both inside and outside on the patio, but it can  get crowded (especially on Wednesday nights.)I almost forgot to mention, they donate to animal charities on a regular basis!Amazing beer selection, killer food, and they love animals--what more could you ask for?
<review# 389,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,8/7/2013,8/14/2013,75,181,,2,2>GREAT Happy Hour right near LSU. 2 for 1 house wine, domestic beer, and sake along with half off several of their appetizers - my favorites of which are the fried mushrooms and the sushi egg roll. The sushi is always fresh and they usually have unique rolls for their monthly specials - check Facebook or the chalkboard outside before you walk in. My new favorite item is actually not a roll but the Wasabi Salad - a mixture of seaweed salad and squid salad in a wasabi dressing. DYNAMITE. Nothing fancy, but a great place for a quick lunch or an early dinner. Nice staff and sweet set-up with inside and outside seating.
<review# 390,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,8/6/2013,8/10/2013,14,26,,8,4>I wanted something different for lunch, being on a diet is tough in this town. I went to check out the grocery store next door, and the noodle place is great. Walked into the Smoothie shop and while there wasn't a line out the door, I was greeted by a nice man who is the owner. Someone complained about paying $10 for two drinks? Try doing that at the other smoothie place that litters the town. His smoothies are half the price of those other guys. He made me a fruit bowl that wasn't on the menu which was great as it had fresh coconut in it which I wasn't expecting. Turns out he grew up in northern California, and was working in Silicon Valley when his family asked for his help here. He opened the shop in 2003 and met his wife here and now has a family. There's always something about a small shop that adds to the reason why you go there and not just for the food. You go for the people too. And for that I'll keep coming back here. He's got a nice little cafe with couches and tables to chill out and surf on your phone or laptop and enjoy your frozen treat. It looks like he also has ice cream and he's got more than 3 dozen teas on this board. For me the best thing is that he'll make his smoothies with no sugar added. Which if you're on a diet is a huge deal. And like others said, this is probably the only place in the city you can get bubble tea fresh made. You can get it in the can if you go to the Vietnamese Grocery store either next to his shop or further down Florida about a 1/2 mile. There's a nice Pho place next door. Go there for lunch or dinner and go here for desert. It's a nice combination.
<review# 391,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/30/2013,8/9/2013,9,15,,4,2>Read about this place in Country Roads on the way to Baton Rouge and decided to stop there for dinner.  What a find!  It's billed as a market, and it is, but it resides in a cozy little house with the market/kitchen in back and the sit down casual restaurant in the front room.  Location is a little unlikely and  out of the way, but well worth it.Bruschetta was amazing with flavorful fresh tomatoes on homemade ciabatta.  The caprese salad had the same fresh tomatoes--husband said you can taste the sunshine in them--and fresh mozzarella slices on fresh Spring salad mix-oh so good!  Their pasta is also homemade and the red sauce is light and fresh.  I had the daily special, spaghetti with meatballs, for $6.99!  (The special rotates each day between 3 different pasta dishes.) The two huge meatballs were made of finely minced meat, spices and perhaps also cheese.  My husband chose the three cheese ravioli.  You may choose the red sauce with or without meat for the ravioli. They also make other types, as well, one with Italian ham and cheese and another with spinach and meat, I believe.  Our entrees were deeply satisfying.  I should also mention that the staff was very friendly and helpful with making selections.  The deli had a selection of meat, cheeses, and prepared pasta dishes to take home.  There was pizza on the menu that I really want to try and there is a number of sandwiches, including a muffaletta.We only wish this restaurant/market was closer to our home.
<review# 392,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,4/26/2012,8/8/2013,229,99,,10,4>I've eaten here a few times & all occasions were fabulous ! Their pricing is ridiculously high, but honestly, you can't expect to pay any less for the grade of sushi they serve. One roll will fill you up which is great for the pricing. If you're a variety type of person, my suggestion is to go with a group & split the rolls !Oh, when you sit down your server should greet you with a side of cucumber salad! It's just your typical cucumber, crab meat, sesame seed, & vinegar type of salad. Delicious & even better, on the house! Moving on to menu items I've had:Korean Spicy Tuna - I loved this! It's a plate of spicy tuna (which is SUPER spicy) served with sliced cucumbers, garlic, & jalapenos and seaweed paper. You basically build your own hand roll! It was delicious, but as I've mentioned before, it was overwhelmingly spicy! I eat a ton of spices too and I can handle a good bit, but this was a little to spicy for me. I wish it was toned down a bit so that I could enjoy more of the flavors. I didn't find this menu on the item and asked my server about it. She said is started off at 20$ but if you wanted to add more (I'm guessing spicy tuna?) the price would gradually increase. Fair pricing, definitely would have filled me up if I didn't share it.Edamame - basic edamame, was a little to mushy for my taste, but doesn't matter still good. I think it was 3.50$Beef Miso - 14$ for a bowl of udon noodles with soup, 3 skewers of beef, & some vegetable tempura (1 of each: onion, broccoli, carrot, sweet potato). I thought it came with a soup & salad but the server brought neither out. We didn't ask for it since we were full and would waste it. But be mindful of the description if this interest you! The soup broth was flavorful & tasted very clean (if you know what I mean). The beef skewers were tasteful and tender. We didn't care for the fried veggies because it was fried.Pink Lady Roll (13$) - snow crab, crunchy, avocado, spicy salmon, & crab stick soy wrapped! I can't even remember if this roll had any rice to it, which I love. I don't like too much rice because it's filling. If I can skip out on the rice altogether, that's a plus. The chefs cut this roll into 10 huge pieces. Doesn't come  with a sauce, doesn't need one, but if you're a sauce person, I'd recommend spicy mayo.Atlantic Salmon - I love this but the portion size is small. I can't justify spending 15$ on an appetizer that is this puny. I mean, unless I'm really treating myself to something nice. It's fresh salmon topped with mandarin oranges, I think some type of nut, & drenched (in a good way) in ponzu sauce. It is really really YUMMY but really really expensive! Every element of this appetizer works well together. Order it if you're treating yourself out. Skip it if you're low on cash.V-Roll - I forgot all the things that make up this roll. But it's huge & it'll feed you twice. There's a great variety of fish and flavors in this, so if you're eating alone, just order this roll for 17-18$. One of the best, if not the best, sushi joints in Baton Rouge. If you're coming to order crunchy rolls or something similar/simple, just head on over to Waka House or Albertsons for a cheaper version. If you know your sushi & want it as fresh as it comes, go to Sushi Yama and enjoy what they have to offer.PS: Another plus, they send you off (dessert) with sliced pineapples ON THE HOUSE ! =D
<review# 393,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/8/2013,8/7/2013,0,1,,2,1>I order breakfast here once a week. It's cooked fresh and its real good. The eggs are a tad on the greasy side but not bad.  Really like the omlets. They don't over season if they season at all, which I like, they let u season it. Haven't had lunch there but if its like there break feast I'm sure it's good.
<review# 394,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,4/1/2013,8/3/2013,51,62,2,2,1>I have only been here once, but I liked it enough to go ahead and star it. My first crawfish experience was in California and it was terrible. The texture and flavor of those little suckers turned me off hard, so you can imagine how mortified I was when I found out that my Chef Hubby's career was moving us to Louisiana... awesome. :/I have yet to make any friends whose mamas can whip up the baddest crawfish around, so I'm taking the shotgun approach and trying different restaurants. So far, Sammy's is the only place that makes crawfish not only edible, but delectable. I went here with my friend who was visiting from CA for her first crawfish experience. We went on a Friday night so it was pretty busy and our wait was about 45 minutes, which built anticipation and expectations as a wait in BR is rare. The atmosphere was buzzing and fun. The service was satisfactory, above the BR average. Not wanting to scare my friend with my distaste for crawfish, I ordered the catfish plate, which was mediocre. I chose the stuffed potato side which tasted like it had been held for a while. I did, however, sample her crawfish and I was delighted. It was sweet and spicy and firm and delish (which is a big deal considering until that moment I HATED crawfish). Here's my star distribution tactic: my meal would not have been worth the wait and maybe get 2 stars (3, without the wait). The crawfish bumped it up to a 4. I am reserved in giving it a 5 because my bar was set very low, I'm not sure if all crawfish before this experience has been exceptionally bad, or if this crawfish is exceptionally good.

Yum! The staff is friendly enough and the prices are right.  This could be my favorite place because it is close to home but give a try and see for yourself.  Happy Eating!!!
<review# 396,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,5/2/2013,8/1/2013,1,18,,9,1>Extremely pleased with Frankie Marcello's! Our server, Charles, was great. We arrived only 40 minutes before closing and never felt rushed, which is rare in many restaurants. He was helpful and friendly. He recommended our appetizer, the fried green tomatoes, and it was awesome! Very tasty. We actually split our entree, the catfish creole, and found the portions to be more than enough for both of us. They were very accommodating and even split our entree on two plates. I also got the John Paul martini and the Frankie-tini, both of which were very good. We will definitely be back.
<review# 397,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/27/2013,7/31/2013,1,4,,4,2>I was incredibly excited to try Leroy's after reading an article in the Business Report. The menu items sounded like food one could only dream of (pizza queso and beer shakes). My brother and I decided to go for dinner with two of our friends. It definitely lived up to my expectations! The service was great, and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. We had the pizza queso, cheese sticks, beer shakes, shrimp & grits, chicken & sausage pot pie, poutine with shaked chicken, and the chicken strips (which were not overly spicy as was written in another review). I am eager to go back and try some of the breakfast items and dessert!

Wow.  Chargrilled oysters! Amazing.  Add 2-1 drinks.  What else do you need.
<review# 400,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/5/2012,7/28/2013,18,12,,3,2>Brittany and I have been looking for a fajita place to compete with what we're used to in Texas. After a year and a half we decided to drive the half hour to try Papi's. So glad we did.The fajitas here are very good. They have the chips we like, the salsa we like, and TWO cheese dips we like! We drive here once a weekend now. Sounds crazy, but not having a Mexican joint we can frequent makes living in a town SUCK.Update: Now we've moved closer to the place and that's EVEN BETTER.
<review# 401,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/4/2013,7/27/2013,4,2,,5,2>I've only been on Saturdays. First time was for lunch. My burger was GREAT! You can tell the patties are made right there by hand. Mom had a Philly cheese steak, which was far from traditional, but still very good. I'm not much of a sweets person, but mom and daughter had cupcakes and went on and on about them. Went today for brunch. The shrimp n grits were delicious and the portion size was more than I could eat (and I'm 6'4", 275lbs). I'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu. My only regret is that I can't make it there for the daily lunch specials during the week. I've been told its the best lunch around for both GOOD food, and the amount you get for relatively cheap.
<review# 402,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/17/2012,7/26/2013,124,131,,2,1>Pretty good little spot--not amazing, but not too bad, either. I guess I would really give it more like 3.5 stars. The boiled shrimp are awesome, and the comfortable atmosphere is nice--very family-friendly. The salad dressing was watered-down and the sides weren't great, but the fried fish and fresh seafood were tasty.*update: bumping it up a star due to really tasty fried seafood to-go last time. Awesome hush-puppies and onion rings, as well! We'll be back soon!
<review# 403,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/6/2013,7/25/2013,11,5,,5,1>"The tandoori chicken and malai kofta here is probably the best that I've had.If you like Indian food or have never tried it, this would be a good place to try. The buffet is around $8 - $10 but I tend to get my money's worth !!!"

<review# 405,isUSA=TRUE,3.0,7/16/2013,7/23/2013,175,75,1,1,4>Over 1,000 scents hits you as you enter this store and I wanted to take home that smell!  Unfortunately each of these products are exorbitantly expensive.  I wandered through the store as a very helpful sales associate informed me of the great powers these organic products can do for your skin and hair.  I was given two samples of face moisturizers Enzymion and Gorgeous which she said will last me up to two weeks.  I purchased a lip scrub called Mint Julips -- "sugary Lip scrubs to make them smooth and tempting" and a shower gel called Happy Hippy - "revitalizing grapefruit wash for gloomy mornings". This is a great place to pick up a friend's birthday gift.  Grab a shower scrub, bubble bomb, and a Gorilla Perfume throw it in a bag and voila!  A tantalizing present!!
<review# 406,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/19/2013,7/21/2013,47,3,,3,2>I've eaten there twice now, and the food has been amazing!  Most recently for Restaurant Week, I had the Duck and Andouille Eggrolls, Cochon de Lait Platter, and Beignets and Ice Cream, and I cannot say a single negative thing about all three courses.  They successfully take Southern food and bring it to the next level.  Huge fan!
<review# 407,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/17/2013,7/20/2013,12,33,,3,1>This place is the best!Everything on the menu is absurdly cheap, and it's delicious. It's a small place run by a family who often have mom, dad, and the kids in the building. But they are a sweet as they come, and the food is outstanding.My first few visits, I had the Honduran tacos, which are great. But my most recent visit was my favorite. I had one order of papusas and I had the puerco guisado --- SO good. Rich and flavorful.. delicious.My SO loves the sopa de res, which is their beef soup. I've never been disappointed with anything I order at this place. It's worth the drive, considering I live across BR.
<review# 408,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2013,7/19/2013,42,61,3,,>I wouldn't describe it as "the best soul food in Louisiana" however, they can compete.  The place is very small.  You walk through the entrance and right into the dining area.  Since there wasn't a hostess or anyone to greet me I proceeded to walk into the kitchen unknowingly, there a man greeted me and sat my daughter and I.  There wasn't much to choose from the menu as in meat selection, there was fried chicken, fried catfish or smothered turkey wings.  The meal came with your choice of two sides.  I then experienced my first mac and cheese made from spaghetti pasta which I'm starting to learn that in Southern LA macaroni pasta isn't used for mac and cheese (confused look).  The food is good and the service may have been better if the man from the kitchen wasn't at the table next to me asking me a billion questions...guess he was being friendly?
<review# 409,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/14/2013,7/18/2013,6,29,,1,1>The bartenders are pretty friendly and the daquiris are really good.  They have the best Egg Nog daiquiri in Baton Rouge when it is Christmas time.  The karaoke nights are pretty funny and entertaining, the one complaint is the songs they have for karaoke are pretty old and lame.  In addition, they could use a little more seating.  Other than that it's a pretty chill place to go hang out after work.
<review# 410,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,12/28/2012,7/17/2013,134,34,,7,5>I was so pleased by the variety of gelato flavors at Latte e Miele. I didnt end up trying the gelato (they change their flavors everyday), because I was in the mood for something warmer, so I opted for the broccoli and gruyere croissant and a plain cappuccino. I also ordered a tiramisu truffle, which was so rich and decadent. I used to work in a coffee shop, so I know a good quality expresso. The decor was so cute and rustic modern, and there's even an outdoor patio. I saw dog treats for sale and asked if the place was dog friendy, and they said they were, so next time I will bring my mini Schnauzer while I unwind with a delicious coffee and a snack. The customer service was great, and they helped me to narrow down my list of what I wanted to order, and didnt push me to try anything just to upsell the ticket. This is the cutest, cleanest, friendliest cafe I have been to, and will definitely be back on a weekly basis to treat myself.
<review# 411,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/4/2013,7/16/2013,1,7,,1,1>The Varsity's location is ideal.  It's situated just outside the gates of LSU, next door to The Chimes, and just up the road from Louie's.  I've only been a time or two without the sole purpose being to see a concert.  As many posters have mentioned before, the concerts would benefit greatly if the upstairs seating was opened more frequently.  I did manage to grab a table there for The Veronicas, which made it far more comfortable and gave us a good view.  I can't say that I've ever been disappointed in my experience.  I haven't dealt with terribly late starting concerts (i.e.- Snoop Dogg), and the seating is really only a mild issue for me, personally.  Overall, I find The Varsity to be a cool venue with a good deal to offer.
<review# 412,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/11/2012,7/15/2013,41,13,,5,1>I'm surprised to see there isn't a review of this place yet. It's a hit with the downtown crowd during lunch. But my boyfriend and I went one evening after work to check it out. It's inside of City Plaza II so if you are unfamiliar with the area you might have difficulty finding it. But that shouldn't deter you!I truly enjoyed the food here and was pleasantly surprised. We tried various tapas, Tuna Tartare, Abita Shrimp, Salmon Basilica and the Warm Truffled Crimini Crostini, to name a few. They were all delicious. My boyfriend normally doesn't like raw sashimi but he loved this tapa. It was fresh and packed with flavor. The texture and consistency was just right. I really loved the Abita Shrimp served over a chive grit cake. I like to call it the "Cajun Tapa". It's really delicious and something different to try. I also enjoyed the Salmon with the tomato caper relish. It was cooked just right. And the Roasted Garlic and Goat Cheese on the mushroom crostini really complemented it well. The flavors were just right. If you haven't gone yet, then please go. I can't wait to go back and try more of their delicious tapas and antipasto boards.
<review# 413,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,10/3/2012,7/14/2013,8,10,,2,1>The is a lovely restaurant in downtown Baton Rouge serving Italian cuisine.  The recipes are supposedly from The Village Restaurant which was on Airline Highway near Florida Blvd. as I was growing up, and, one of my favorite restaurants.Three of us dined here on a Monday night which didn't slow the crowd down any.  The restaurant was quite full.  We made reservations online which was a good idea.We were served the bread appetizer which was beautiful and delicious.  It just so happend that it was complimentary on this night.  My Eggplant Parmesan was just delicious.  Their sauce is one of the best I have ever had.  This serving is huge; it would have been enough for all three of us, so there was plenty to take home.  A delicious Caesar Salad was served prior to the meal.One of my guest ordered the Ahi Grade Sliced Tuna with key lime ginger vinaigrette and wasabi and soy glaze.  The presentation was beautiful and the dish delicious. My other guest ordered the Large Traditional Salad with Grilled Gulf Shrimp.  I personally didn't taste it but she said it was outstanding.I highly recommend The Little Village's downtown location for the atmosphere and culinary experience.

We got a rush order done here ( canvas framing a photograph in 36X24 size) and were very satisfied with the results. The job was done in a few hours at a reasonable cost. The owner was also very patient in answering our stream of questions. Highly recommended!
<review# 415,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/8/2013,7/12/2013,95,166,,1,1>Everyone that works there is incredibly friendly. I don't shop for all my groceries there, as they don't always have everything I need and it's a little more expensive than other places. They have a great selection of wine and beer these days. They had a great sale on sodas not too long ago. 3 12 packs for 8.88!  That was a steal. Do that again please!!  I hope that Trader Joes doesn't hurt their business too badly. Ill always support the locals.
<review# 416,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,7/7/2013,7/11/2013,6,42,,3,1>Everything I've had here is just so good! I even brought my grandfather in for lunch one day, and he is quite skeptical of anything that isn't traditional American food. naturally he got the hamburger when we came to Albashas, and he was thrilled with it. Now he isn't so afraid when I try to introduce him to worldly cuisine.  I've had the Tabbouleh, chicken schwarma salad and falafel. All were delicious. Never go wrong here.
<review# 417,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/16/2012,7/10/2013,13,26,,2,1>The last four times I've eaten there, we sat at the bar, ordered the grilled oysters, and got great bar service.  Oysters are wonderful, fresh, and all the other dishes we ordered, mainly for splitting while we visited and enjoyed cocktails, were tasty. I consider it a reliable, good place to eat seafood in Gonzales, particularly if I want chargrilled oysters because not every local seafood restaurant offers it.. As for dress: Often see both dressed up and casually dressed diners.  A mix of travelers, locals stopping by, and those celebrating a special evening.
<review# 418,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/3/2013,7/9/2013,67,27,2,3,2>The closest I've been to experiencing love at first sight. The name (or my name rather) and good ratings drew me in during my day trip to Baton Rouge. Only open for lunch...til 2:30pm I believe. Located in Circa 1857 antique and art market, Yvette Marie's is a little gem located in the midst of unique and cool stores. Really loved the atmosphere. I ate outside by the fountain, facing piles of old furniture, cool paintings and other goods.  It's also connected to an antique store inside for customers to explore afterwards.I ordered the half sandwich, half salad combo with the Sensation Salad and Chicken Caprese. Both amazing! Salad had a special dressing that was so good with bleu cheese and candied walnuts. Sandwich was also very tasty...GREAT bread = GR-EAD! And it's mozzarella cheese would make other cheeses jealous.
<review# 419,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/10/2011,7/8/2013,2,39,,2,1>Add me to the fan list of this spot. These are the type of spots I crave. This is actually a market with a small kitchen and a few tables. The pasta is as authentic as you could ask for. The Po Boys and Muffalatta's are as good as any I have ever had ANYWHERE. There is always a line when I am there of folks picking up pans of their pasta. I am one that loves to hear Mr. Pocarello's stories as well. He will definitely let you know what his opinion is. He is a very proud man of Italian heritage and his place shows it in quality and decor. I think my father in law and him grew up together. They could pass for brothers in terms of personality! Oh yeah, cash only but there is an ATM machine in the store if you don't have cash on you. Dunno what the service fee for the machine is but at least it is there if you just have to have a po boy and forgot the cash
<review# 420,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,7/3/2013,7/7/2013,107,31,,2,2>I have been to the chimes two times now since moving to BR, and it has not disappointed me at all. You cannot go wrong with any of their dishes it seems.  This past visit I ordered the spinach and artichoke dip and the Cajun grilled catfish with a stuffed potato. Both items were delicious.  Pros: Large menu and beer selection, ample amount of TVs in the bar area for sporting events, friendly staff. PEPPER JELLY VINAIGRETTE!!!!!!!! Cons: The beer list is not updated with current prices and beers that they have.
<review# 421,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2013,7/6/2013,6,53,,2,1>I have been to latin american restaurants all over the country, from Los Angeles to Miami to Boston, and this hole in the wall restaurant had unbelievably amazing food. They've been at this location for a while---a secret kept for Gonzales, LA, alone. The service was excellent except for a little hesitation at first---"I wasn't sure if you spoke english!" This is as authentic and delicious as it gets.I ordered my food to-go. I was told it's normal just to walk up to the counter if that's what you want to do (you can also call ahead with your order). Otherwise, just walk in and take a seat. Service was quick, and they do accept debit cards if you're paying more than ten dollars.I ordered a chorizo torta, which came out on soft, fresh made bread (see the amazing homemade pastries in their store, next door), and which was both generous and portable. The blend of spices mixed with the meat was fantastic, and the avocado-based sauce I was given on the side was habanero-hot and muy sabroso. I also ordered three tacos---tripe, carnitas, and barbacoa. Holy. Cow. ¡Claro que sí---fantástico! The salsa verde I was given on the side was rich and savory, and also tasted homemade. The tripe was the best I've had.I will definitely be back.
<review# 422,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,3/7/2013,7/5/2013,66,126,1,2,2>The location may not be the best in town, but the food here more than makes up for it.  I've been here more times than I can remember and will keep coming back.  There are items that I crave on some days...the turtle soup, the crab cake, the rabbit loin and those delicious drop biscuits.  I hate that some people have had bad meals here...I think it has a lot to do with expectations and knowing what to order.  The chicken and waffles are not my favorite thing here but then again they're not something I would order a lot anyway.  I've had steaks here that were just as good as Ruth's.  I hope if you're reading this, that you'll give them a chance....it's definitely worth it if you're more interested in delicious food than perfect location and people watching.
<review# 423,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/30/2013,7/4/2013,48,6,,4,2>I'm consistently surprised by the wide a selection of groceries available right here in mid city. Not just the huge wine & beer selection, but a great deli line up, produce and everything else I can think of. I had initially expected to see just a small bit of this or that, but Calandro's really does have everything.
<review# 424,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/27/2013,7/3/2013,105,85,,6,2>Yum! I've gotten cupcakes here twice (cookies and cream and a double chocolate one) and they were both delicious! The store is small but doesn't need anything more than it has. I was a little annoyed that both times I came (visits were about a week apart), the store was out of cupcake holders so I didn't get a sealed container for my cupcake. I also don't understand the points system where the computer "remembers" me so I can get a free cupcake after a certain number of visits. I didn't give any personal information besides my card so how would the computer know me unless I used the same debit card each time? What if I pay with cash the next time I come? That was a little weird, especially when the person working couldn't explain it to me.

Most markets you have issues with certain undesirable foods that sit but that is not the case at Tony's. Last time I had the Gumbo, mac n' cheese, and mashed taters and gravy. It was as good as any other authentic louisiana cuisine. We order at least 50 balls everytime we go

The Ratatouille is pretty darn good too. And I cannot say enough about the Chicken Noodle soup - absolutely amaaaazinggg!!Love coming here for lunch.. the lines get long, so I usually try to get here after 12:30 pm.

<review# 428,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/25/2013,6/29/2013,6,6,2,2,1>This is the best restaurant in Baton Rouge, hands down. Their menu isn't all that long, but every option on it that my friends and I have tried has been fantastic. Some of the highlights include, the grilled cheese and tomato soup; the shrimp, Parmesan and calamari po boy with marinara sauce; the rib-eye -- all amazing. The service is very pleasant and speedy, and there beer selection is prime  as well. They truly can adapt to any party size with their giant dining room, as well.The outdoor areas (both front and back) are pleasant as well. Such a dependably delicious option for Baton Rouge!
<review# 429,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,5/1/2013,6/28/2013,22,81,,3,2>Visited Bistro Byronz tonight with family for dinner.  As usual, we were very pleased with our experience.  The staff is very friendly and the food is what you would expect in a Bistro but usually with a twist from the norm.For appetizer we had the three cheese chips.  The chips are homemade...potatoes sliced thin and fried then covered with a cheese sauce and green onion.  This is our "go-to" appetizer at Bistro Byronz and it is always a winner.  Tonight the chips were SLIGHTLY heavy handed on the salt but later discovered it was the cheese sauce that was over salted.  But even that did not ruin just how good they are!For entrees', I ordered the Back-of-the-stove chicken with succotash.  It is served on rice and a brown gravy.  I have had this several times here and always has extremely good flavor, almost like a good gumbo would have.  Tonight, tomatoes were added into the succotash and really enjoyed that addition.  If I had to improve on tonight's dish, it would be that I would have let the chicken cook longer so that it was truly falling apart into pieces rather than holding together.  Still, I did not have to break out the table knife at all.....just the trusty fork so the chicken was still tender and juicy, just not the normal pieces that have been cooked to death with deliciousness.  If that had happened, perhaps my 4 stars would be 5 stars on tonight's visit.My wife ordered the debris sandwich and she had the Au Gratin potatoes.  The sandwich was very flavorful...how can debris not be?......and moist.  This is one of her favorites from Bistro and one of the only times she will eat pot roast.  The Au Gratin potatoes are probably her favorite way potatoes are prepared and Bistro usually has one of the best in Baton Rouge.  But tonight, even though they were good, this is where we discovered the source of our slightly oversalted three cheese chips....the cheese sauce.  Again, nothing to send back to the kitchen....just over salted a touch enough that you noticed it.My mother-in-law had the steak frite...medium.  And I must say I have never tried the steak from Bistro, but the chef has always been dead on with cooking temperatures of the steaks as this is the only thing she orders here.  She has never had a medium rare or medium well steak served to her....it has always been dead on medium which takes skill if you have ever tried to repeat it over and over.  At some point, something is always bound to be off and you miss your mark on the temperature, but we haven't experienced that here the many times we have visited.  The steak is served with a side of grilled vegetables...a mix of squash and peppers usually....and usually frites but she substituted the Au Gratin potatoes which again confirmed the slightly elevated salt level in the cheese sauce.Overall, a great meal and a great experience.  If you have not had the opportunity to visit Bistro Byronz, you should do so.  They are all the way down on Government Street in an old converted house.  At first we were apprehensive about going because from the outside and things I had heard about it, they seemed pretentious and way too fancy.  But we decided to stop by one day for lunch and did not find that at all about them...and we have been returning ever since.  I truly recommend Bistro Byronz for a French/Louisiana Bistro experience.  I hear they have great Sunday Brunch as well.....just never been yet!
<review# 430,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,1/17/2013,6/27/2013,33,21,,2,4>My new favorite wine spot! Blend, previously The Wine Loft, is a very chic space in the downtown area. The new owners have taken the wine bar and bumped it up a notch. Let me just start by saying the staff is very attentive and knowledgeable about their selections and are delighted to help you decide the best wine for your tastes. I mentioned the reds I usually like and they recommended the perfect blend. My friends also sampled the mixed drink menu, which were quite tasty, as well. They also helped us pick out a few bites to snack on and I have to say I wish I could have bottled up the homemade strawberry jam and honey mustard they served on the fromage and charcuterie plate, yum! This was the perfect little spot for our girls night out, and also has a romantic vibe for couples. All around a great place to bring friends, family, or dates for a relaxing night out.
<review# 431,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,6/18/2013,6/26/2013,100,239,,1,1>I remember eating at Zorba's when I was a kid when it was at its original location of what is now Louisiana Lagniappe. Apparently the family moved back to Greece for about ten to fifteen years, but they decided to return to Baton Rouge and grace us with their Greek food presence.I came here right around the lunch rush and found they were definitely inadequately prepared for the amount of people that were here. This place is small and it seems they have already outgrown their location. I guess people remembered how good they used to be so they didn't have to do much to generate business.Once we were seated, we were treated to nice and friendly albeit extremely slow service. I ordered an order of Meat Dolmades(meat grape leaves) which were excellent and a gyro sandwich. I also had a chance to try the chicken souvlaki. After my experience I would have to rank Zorba's right below Albasha's. It's definitely the second best Greek in BR. That being said there are some things they win on, such as their pita bread, it's delicious. With the level of business they are seeing, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw them in a new location soon. I hope so, because as good as the food is, it's a bit too packed and it causes the service to suffer.
<review# 432,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/17/2013,6/25/2013,60,159,1,4,2>SERIOUSLY. AMAZING. DRUNK. FOOD. But, also, really good any time food.I'm a huge Louie's fan and have been ever since the first time I stumbled in at 2:30am after a night of dancing and drinking. Some of my favorite dishes are the country fried steak and the chocolate chip pancakes, but I can't remember trying anything here that wasn't good. This place gets SUPER busy, especially on Sunday mornings and when the bars start to close, so I recommend trying to come at an off-peak time or just being prepared to wait quite a while. (Although, once you order, the food comes pretty quickly considering how slammed they usually are.)I know this is a place I will visit again and again! See you there![Word to the wise: Just park in the pay lot at the end of the block (and be sure you pay!). They tow like crazy around this area.]
<review# 433,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,1/5/2013,6/24/2013,74,83,,6,5>I ADORE this place. Literally this is my favorite place in Baton Rouge. So what's so great about Magpie? Let's see..-- Fresh and locally-sourced ingredients - they get their produce and meat from the farmer's market-- Delicious, home-baked pastries - I especially love the pumpkin chocolate chip muffin-- Interesting sandwich combinations - bacon, apple, and havarti? Yes, please. -- Fantastic atmosphere - local artists' work grace the wall, reclaimed wooden accent wall, lots of nice, creative types coming in and working on their laptops, etc.-- Free wifi, lots of outlets - I've camped out here to work on my thesis many a time (too many, actually.. womp womp)-- Great iced mocha, yumThe only downsides are their food is pretty pricey (it kind of has to be, but it does mean this is more of a treat than a go-to lunch spot for this poor grad student), and they close pretty early (so not so good for after work or class study sessions).
<review# 434,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,2/16/2013,6/23/2013,39,13,,2,3>I love the cupcakes! My favorite flavors are wedding cake and banana foster. I absolutely love the frosting. It's light, fluffy and not too sweet. The employees are always sweet and helpful. I always buy a dozen at a time and they never rush me and always offer suggestions when I can't make up my mind on what flavors to get. The only negative thing is finding parking because of the mall traffic.
<review# 435,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/20/2012,6/22/2013,13,28,,6,2>So charming I can barely stand it. Such a tiny but welcoming and reasonably affordable place. I've been frequenting Oriental Market for years. For a while it was the only even vaguely close store to me that sold a variety of hi-chews (I spotted them at target recently) and ginger chews. I think the store does a good job of balancing item types to best use their small size. You can find some frozen food items, cookware, drinks (calpico yes god!), candy, tea, prepackaged meals, and condiments. The workers are very sweet. I'm literally the only white person I've ever seen there but they couldn't be more helpful whenever I needed something so please don't be intimidated by specialty grocers if they are new to you. You're missing out if you don't visit. Single item recommendation- honey ginger tea that's actually strong. Finally ginger tea with a real bite that I don't have to buy online. Korean packaging but it's got a picture of ginger root and a honeycomb on it so figure it out.
<review# 436,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,12/13/2012,6/21/2013,48,279,,2,1>I see why they call it Fat Cow...portions are HUGE!Awesome Gruyère chesse burger with apple and bacon slices (I think it was called the westwood burger- something close to that with a W). The cheese chunks were huge! Cooked to perfection. My husband had the 102 burger and it was good as well. We had an order of the duck fat and parmesean fries. These were good but I kept thinking of clogged arteries. Again a huge portion of fries...we didn't put a dent in them between the two of us. We snacked on them later on that night and still couldn't finish them. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the service. The food deserves a 5 but the service gets  3&1/2.
<review# 437,isUSA=TRUE,5.0,6/12/2013,6/20/2013,19,43,1,5,5>The value from Highland Coffees is so much higher than that of Starbucks in the bookstore, and wayyy higher than any CC's on campus. If you need a real pick-me-up, Highland Coffees is the play. Starbucks tries to give you as little as possible for your money, my cup from Highland Coffees was (almost :p) too full! Also, my bagel was fantastic.
<review# 438,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,11/6/2012,6/19/2013,44,69,,2,1>I've been to Germany before, and wanted to go somewhere that might could pass off a decent schnitzel. This place was beyond my expectations. The food was good, not fantastic. But I had the best time in here, and will go back. The food is European themed, but the atmosphere is pretty spot-on for European village.
<review# 439,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,9/10/2012,6/18/2013,38,71,,1,1>Really great lunch spot. Fast and VERY friendly service. Prices are great too- $5 for a healthy, quick and fresh plate. The falafel is a little dry but I'd still order it again. Haven't tried any of their baked good (baklava and what not) but it looks tasty in the display case. Definitely a place to try for lunch or during game days.
<review# 440,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,2/28/2013,6/17/2013,8,13,,2,1>4.5!Parrain's Seafood is the place to go! This restaurant is a perfect blend of high quality Cajun food, appealing atmosphere, and friendly wait-staff.  Suffice to say, I was very impressed with the restaurant when I came here last.I brought three out of town friends (from the North East) who had never really experienced Cajun cuisine before.  I was a little worried but everyone ended up LOVING their meal.  My friends were gushing about the terrific food and I got to look like I really knew where to eat in the city of Baton Rouge!We tried many dishes including the turtle soup, blackened alligator, chargrilled oysters, etoufee, and gumbo.  It was all terrific but everyone agreed that the oysters and the alligator were something truly special.  One of my friends who absolutely abhors seafood, ordered a grilled chicken dish (his favorite thing to order everywhere) and said it was literally the best he had ever had.  So you can bring non seafood lovers here as well!If your ever in Baton Rouge and on the prowl for some fresh cajun-style seafood, do not forget to look up Parrain's.  I would be shocked if you left hungry or disappointed!
<review# 441,isUSA=TRUE,4.0,3/22/2013,6/16/2013,122,389,1,7,4>First stop 3/22/13...Damn it was good!! I went with the Smith Burger topped with a tasty fried egg, pickles, cheddar cheese and lettuce along with Smith sauce and that was one juicy, greasy, delicious burger with that yummy egg yolk running all over everything!!My niece and her boyfriend both got the Filet Burger and I was jealous cause that thing has a whopping size patty.No matter what burger you order you can specialize it how you want from 5 different kinda cheeses,  tons of add ons from fried egg to bacon to Tabasco peppers to grilled onions to the usual condiments of pickles, lettuce, raw onion etc...The speciality fries are awesome...the Smith fries have a spicy kick and the Garlic Butter fries are deliciously rich...You can hurt yourself eating them...Upwards of 10 beers on tap plus a bottled beer selection...all local/LA brewed beers! Thumbs up for that....Gotta put it a notch above 5 Guys and if I'm around College or Acadian and feeling a burger this is a definite stop for yours truly!!
